40|$|Firefighting is an {{inherently}} dangerous occupation involving numerous risk sources, unique contexts, multiple personnel and rapidly changing environments. Firefighting operations are dynamic in nature yet require calculated risk taking and structured command {{to prevent the}} realisation of potentially catastrophic outcomes to both casualties and rescuers. The notion of “dynamic risk management” is a term that has gained popularity throughout fire services worldwide, yet the process of dynamic risk management is typically poorly articulated. This study demonstrates ‘dynamic risk management’ is a misnomer, with risk management being a defined process applied {{within the context of}} dynamic emergency response. Failure to recognise this and respond accordingly may leave fire services exposed to adverse findings should adverse consequences be realised. Further, this study tested the perceptions of risk held by <b>incident</b> <b>controllers</b> in the Department of Fire and Emergency Services in Western Australia against AS 31000, through a combination of qualitative surveys and subsequent Bayesian analysis of reported adverse outcomes resulting from all hazards emergency response. This study found significant variance in risk tolerance between <b>incident</b> <b>controllers</b> and to a lesser degree, variance in the understanding of risk as defined by AS 31000. Bayesian statistical analysis identified reportable adverse outcomes were almost certain to occur across the majority of firefighting activities, whilst potential worst case outcomes were rarely historically realised.

Firefighters managed to save the general store, town hall and school at Haven, though flames came within metres of those buildings. Winds of up to [...] changed direction three times throughout the day, producing conditions described by the local CFA <b>incident</b> <b>controller</b> as the worst he had ever seen.

40|$|Abstract. Most grassfires {{that occur}} in {{southern}} Australia are contained to small areas by local suppression resources. Those that are not require extra resources from neighbouring districts. Identifying these fires {{at the start of}} initial attack can prompt early resource requests so that resources arrive earlier when they canmore effectively assist with containment. This study uses operational data collected from Australian grassfires that used ground tankers and aircraft for suppression. Variables were limited to those available when the first situation report is provided to <b>incident</b> <b>controllers</b> and included weather parameters, resource response times, slope, curing state, pasture condition and estimated fire area at initial attack. Logistic regression and classification trees were used to identify grassfires likely to escape initial attack by (a) becoming large (final area$ 100 ha), (b) beingof longduration (containment time$ 4 h) or (c) either or both of these. These fireswould benefit from havingmore resources deployed to them than are normally available. The best models used initial fire area and Grassland Fire Danger Index as predictor variables. Preliminary operational decision guides developed from classification trees could be used by fire managers to make quick assessments of the need for extra resources at early stages of a fire...|$|R

40|$|This {{report will}} help the Tasmanian {{community}} be better prepared for, respond to and recover from natural disasters through an updated understanding and awareness of the natural hazards that have the most potential to impact the State. The information contained in this report, including the risk register and risk treatment options together with the accompanying all hazard summary report, {{can be used by}} stakeholders and practitioners throughout the emergency management sector to inform emergency management planning. This report assesses the State level risks posed by Bushfire, Flood, Severe Storm, Landslide, Tsunami, Earthquake, Heatwave, Coastal Inundation and Pandemic Influenza. Bushfire remains the greatest aggregated risk to Tasmania. It is a &# 039;High&# 039; or &# 039;Extreme&# 039; risk across all sectors of society, often with catastrophic consequences expected every 30 years (i. e. &# 039;Unlikely&# 039; likelihood). This likelihood is expected to become more frequent with climate change. Land-use planning and building systems are strong and effective controls for each of the hazards apart from Pandemic Influenza. Limiting future development and vulnerability in known &# 039;at risk&# 039; areas is considered to be the most effectve way of protecting life and property while limiting future government liability. A &# 039;multi-hazards&# 039; approach to exercises and business continuity planning within government was agreed to be an important treatment option, with hazard-specific training recommended for key incident management personnel (e. g. <b>incident</b> <b>controllers)</b> as well as formalising the arrangements to guide decision-makers in times of crisis to ensure rapid decision...|$|R

50|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} can negatively impact {{performance in}} professional fields as well, potentially jeopardizing lives. Due {{largely to the}} February 2009 crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, which killed 50 people and was partially attributed to pilot fatigue, the FAA reviewed its procedures to ensure that pilots are sufficiently rested. Air traffic controllers were under scrutiny when in 2010 there were 10 <b>incidents</b> of <b>controllers</b> falling asleep while on shift. The common practice of turn-around shifts caused sleep deprivation and was a contributing factor to all air traffic control incidents. The FAA reviewed its practices of shift changes and the findings saw that controllers were not well rested.

50|$|To ensure all {{incident}} {{personnel are}} working towards {{one set of}} objectives, the <b>Incident</b> <b>Controller,</b> {{in consultation with the}} Incident Management Team, determines the desired outcomes of the incident.

40|$|This report assesses {{whether the}} the Country Fire Authority and Victoria State Emergency Service {{effectively}} and efficiently manage emergency services volunteers. Introduction: Volunteering {{is critical to the}} delivery of community services throughout Victoria. When volunteers provide their time and resources, not only do they help to deliver services and contribute to the community, they enable these services to be delivered more cost effectively than if delivered by a paid workforce. The most recent Victorian Government estimate of the value of volunteering in Victoria was made in 2006 and placed the value at around $ 16. 4 billion per year. Volunteers give their time for different reasons, such as a sense of duty to their community, or a desire to help others, to learn and to develop themselves. Volunteerism also provides volunteers with an opportunity to connect with their community, creating a sense of belonging. Within rural communities, it is common for generations of families to volunteer with an organisation, with some volunteering for multiple agencies. Victoria has a range of emergency services organisations. These include Victoria Police, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade and Ambulance Victoria, which largely rely on a paid workforce. In contrast, the Country Fire Authority (CFA) and the Victoria State Emergency Service (SES), both of which provide emergency response services for natural disasters, rely significantly on volunteers. CFA’s volunteers number around 57 500, which includes 38 000 operational and 19 500 non-operational volunteers. Operational volunteers include firefighters, communications and emergency response officers and <b>incident</b> <b>controllers.</b> Non-operational volunteers perform a range of activities including community education, fundraising, management, recruitment and catering. SES reports that around 5 000 volunteers perform a range of its operational and non-operational roles. Operational roles include general rescues and road crash rescues, search and rescue functions and even managing and directing traffic during emergencies. Non-operational roles include management and administration, media and public relations, fundraising and community education. The audit objective was to assess whether CFA and SES {{effectively and efficiently}} manage emergency services volunteers. It examined whether the strategic and operational planning within these agencies was adequate to identify and address volunteer workforce capacity and requirements, including recruitment, retention and support...|$|R

40|$|Adverse weather {{conditions}} can put considerable {{strain on the}} National Airspace System. Even small decreases in visibility on the airport surface can create delays, hinder safe movement and lead to errors. Studies of Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) surface movement incidents support the need for technologies and procedures to improve ground operations in low-visibility conditions. This study examined 139 ASRS reports of low-visibility surface movement incidents at 10 major U. S. airports. Errors were characterized in terms of incident type, contributing factors and consequences. The incidents in the present sample were comprised of runway transgressions, taxiway excursions and ground conflicts. The primary contributing factors were Airport Layout and Markings, Communication and Distraction. In half the <b>incidents</b> the <b>controller</b> issued a new clearance or the flight crew took an evasive action and in the remaining half, no recovery attempt was made because the error was detected after the fact. By gaining a better understanding the factors that affect crew navigation in low visibility {{and the types of}} errors that are likely to occur, {{it will be possible to}} develop more robust technologies to aid pilots in the ground taxi task. Implications for crew training and procedure development for low-visibility ground taxi are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Using {{registration}} plate analysis, this paper investigates 1) {{the proportions of}} ‘unique’ vehicles, 2) the proportions of vehicles re-appearing from day-to-day and their individual arrival variances and 3) the numbers of locally registered vehicles among those seen during the morning commute period on three roads in Southampton. During <b>incidents,</b> a traffic <b>controller</b> would hope to divert the more familiar drivers onto less congested parts of the network using VMS and other media. Knowing the proportions of regular and unique drivers which make up the peak commuting periods would help in the timely dissemination of this traffic information. The proportions of unique vehicles varied significantly with road and time. Vehicles appearing {{on more than one}} day formed 80 % of the traffic before 08 : 15 but only 60 % between the 08 : 45 and 09 : 00 peak period during the 1996 Bassett Avenue survey (F(4, 20) = 60. 1, p< 0. 001, Mse = 6. 2). Although the proportions of vehicles re-appearing from day to day varied significantly with road, (? 2 (3) = 1501, P< 0. 001), their arrival variances were found to be very similar. On average, 65 % of the returning vehicles re-appeared within +/- 5 minutes of their previous day’s time implying that this frequency of arrival could be part of an habitual behaviour pattern. The results suggest that for occasions where congestion can be anticipated in advance, such as prior to emergency roadworks or special events, warning messages would be most effective before 08 : 30 a. m. when the largest proportion of regular vehicles would be using the roads. If regular users are more familiar with the local road network than one-off ‘unique’ vehicles, and {{would be more likely to}} divert on receiving incident information relevant to their route, then later in the morning, the proportion of knowledgeable local drivers falls substantially...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about control of marine propellers. All ships and {{underwater}} vehicles, {{as well as}} an increasing number of offshore exploration and exploitation vessels, are controlled by proper action of their propulsion systems. For safe and cost effective operations, high performance vessel control systems are needed. To achieve this, all parts of the vessel control system, including both plant level and low-level control, must be addressed. However, limited attention has earlier been given to the effects of the propulsion system dynamics. The possible consequences of improper thruster control are: • Decreased closed-loop vessel performance due to inaccurate thrust production • Increased vessel down-time and maintenance cost due to unnecessary mechanical wear and tear. • Increased fuel consumption and risk of blackouts due to unpredictable power consumption. By focusing explicitly on the propeller operating conditions and the available options for low-level thruster control, this thesis presents several results to remedy these problems. Two operational regimes are defined: normal, and extreme conditions. In normal operating conditions, the dynamic loading of the propellers is considered to be moderate, and primarily caused by oscillations in the inflow. In extreme conditions, the additional dynamic loads due to ventilation and in-and-out-ofwater effects can be severe. In order to improve the understanding of these loads and develop a simulation model suitable for control system design and testing, systematic model tests with a ventilating propeller in a cavitation tunnel and a towing tank have been undertaken. In conventional propulsion systems with fixed-pitch propellers, the low level thruster controllers are usually aimed at controlling the shaft speed. Other control options are torque control and power control, as well as combinations of the three. The main scientific contributions of this thesis are: • A combined torque/power controller and a combined speed/torque/power controller are designed. When compared to conventional shaft speed control, the proposed controllers give improved thrust production, decreased wear and tear, and reduced power oscillations. • A propeller load torque observer and a torque loss estimation scheme is developed, enabling on-line monitoring of the propeller performance. • An anti-spin thruster controller that enables use of torque and power control also in extreme operating conditions is motivated and designed. By applying the load torque observer to detect ventilation <b>incidents,</b> the antispin <b>controller</b> takes control of the shaft speed and lowers it until the ventilation incident is terminated. • A propeller performance measure {{that can be used to}} improve thrust allocation in extreme operating conditions is introduced. The proposed controllers and estimation schemes are validated through theoretical analyses, numerical simulations, and experiments on a model-scale propeller. </p...|$|R
