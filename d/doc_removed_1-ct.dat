40|$|We {{studied the}} changes in major {{elements}} and organic carbon concentrations during the initial stage of the mixing of the black (Rio Negro) and the White (Rio Solimoes) waters in the Amazon River basin to understand the geochemical processes that could control the redistribution between particulate and dissolved fractions. Water samples were collected at six stations including the Rio Negro and the Rio Solimoes and four stations downstream from the confluence. The relative contributions of the two tributaries were determined using a triple tracer approach (delta(18) O, deltaD, Cl-). Particulate (> 0. 2 mum) and dissolved (< 0. 2 mum) concentrations of major elements (Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Si) and organic carbon (POC and DOC) were measured. Major elements in the particulate fraction {{were found to have}} a nonconservative behaviour in the initial stage of the mixing due to mineral removal. In the dissolved fraction, only the DOC, Fe, and Mn behaved nonconservatively. The Fe losses could be due to preferential removal of Fe bound to N-rich organic matter (OM) and/or to preferential removal of Fe oxyhydroxides. The increasing dissolved manganese content in the dissolved phase is explained by a reductive dissolution of manganese oxides due to massive inputs of phenolic-rich OM from the Rio Negro.

40|$|A {{national}} conference held {{in association with}} the International Humic Substances Society and the Natural Organic Matter Interest Group. The impacts of gypsum application to pasture on the concentration and character of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and on the inorganic profile of surface and subsurface water were investigated in the Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia. Two adjacent sub-catchments of the Mount Bold reservoir were selected for study, where gypsum was applied at a rate of 15, 000 kg ha− 1 to one and the other left untreated, as a control. Gypsum amendment led to reductions in DOC concentrations in surface and subsurface flows of about 50 %, significant increases in aqueous Ca, Mg, Mn and Na and lower concentrations of other metals (Al, Fe) due to Ca 2 + exchange. Natural organic matter (NOM) in water from the gypsum-treated site was found to have a lower relative aromaticity compared with the control. Alum treatment of control and gypsum-treated waters by a jar test procedure led to 73 % and 48 % removal of DOC, respectively, resulting in similar residual concentrations. This indicates that <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> by traditional alum treatment of drinking water supplies is also susceptible to in situ gypsum treatment, probably via a similar metal-catalysed aggregation mechanism. We conclude that gypsum application to soils of medium to heavy texture has potential to enhance their capacity to bind NOM, thereby lowering DOC concentrations in surface and subsurface flows.

40|$|Background and Aim: Nowadays, {{regarding}} the increased human and geological activities, concentrations of toxic and carcinogenic disinfectant by-products– like Trihalomethanes -which have an organic base, {{in drinking water}} sources, has worryingly increased. Thus, the present study aimed at surveying the amount of dissolved organic carbon (<b>doc)</b> <b>removed</b> from aqueous solution by Fenton process. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, the outcome of removing dissolved organic carbon derived from natural water with initial concentrations 2, 4, and 8 mg/l using one-liter water containers by means of Fenton Process at PHs 2, 3, 4, and 5 due to adding 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/l of H 2 O 2 and Ferrous ions with 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/l concentrations at oxidation time 5, 10, 20, and 40 minutes was calculated. Finally, the outcome of carbon removal was assessed by means of TOC analyzer. Results: It {{was found that the}} most outcome of dissolved organic carbon removal (about 97 %) belonged to 10 / 1 H 2 O 2 and Ferrous ion, while dissolved organic carbon PH was 3 and its initial concentration was 2 mg/l and oxidation time was 40 minutes. Conclusion: Generally speaking, it was confirmed that the improved Fenton Oxidation Process can efficiently be used to refine water containing dissolved organic carbon. The method was found to be highly and relatively fast compared to conventional existing techniques and also, it can be concluded that the Fenton process {{has the potential to be}} utilized for the cost-effective removal of DOC from water and wastewater...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatability}} of NOM {{present in}} runoff and subsurface waters from discrete zero-order catchments (ZOCs) with three land management practices (Australian native vegetation, pine plantation, grasslands) on varying soil textures of a closed drinking water reservoir-catchment was investigated. Subsurface water {{samples were collected}} by lysimeters and shallow piezometers and surface waters by installation of barriers that diverted waters to collection devices. For small sample volumes collected, a 'micro' jar testing procedure was developed to assess the treatability of organics by enhanced coagulation using alum, under standardised conditions. DOM present in water samples was quantified by measurement of DOC and UV absorbance (at 254 nm) and characterized using these and F-EEM. The mean alum dose rate (mg alum per mg <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> or Al/DOC) {{was found to be}} lower for DOM from sandy soil ZOCs (21. 1 +/- 11. 0 Al/DOC) than from clayey soil ZOCs (38. 6 +/- 27. 7 Al/DOC). ZOCs with Pinus radiata had prominent litter layers (6. 3 +/- 2. 6 cm), and despite differences in soil textures showed similarity in DOM character in subsurface waters, and in alum dose rates (22. 2 +/- 5. 5 Al/DOC). For sandy soil ZOCs, the lowest alum dose rates (16. 5 +/- 10. 6 Al/DOC) were for waters from native vegetation catchment while, for clayey soil ZOCs, waters from pine vegetation had the lowest alum dose rates (23. 0 +/- 5. 0 Al/DOC). Where ZOCs have a prominent O horizon, soil minerals had no apparent influence on the treatability of DOM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

They have two major benefits: first, they drastically improve the living standards and even health outcomes for patients. In addition, they allow significant cost savings for adult care by reducing the needs for medical staff. A common drawback of current Mobile Care Systems is that they are rather stationary in most cases and firmly installed in patients’ houses or flats, which makes them stay very near to or even in their homes. There is also an upcoming second category of Mobile Care Systems which are portable without restricting the moving space of the patients, but with the major drawback that they have either very limited computational abilities and only a rather low classification quality or, which is most frequently, they only have a very short runtime on battery and therefore indirectly restrict the freedom of moving of the patients once again. These drawbacks are inherently caused by the restricted computational resources and mainly the limitations of battery based power supply of mobile computer systems. This research investigates the application of novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to improve the operation of 2 Mobile Care Systems. As a result, based on the Evolving Connectionist Systems (ECoS) paradigm, an innovative approach for a highly efficient and self-optimising distributed online machine learning algorithm called MECoS - Moving ECoS - is presented. It balances the conflicting needs of providing a highly responsive complex and distributed online learning classification algorithm by requiring only limited resources in the form of computational power and energy. This approach overcomes the drawbacks of current mobile systems and combines them with the advantages of powerful stationary approaches. The research concludes that the practical application of the presented MECoS algorithm offers substantial improvements to the problems as highlighted within this thesis...|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} set of {{measurements were}} performed to investigate the effect of different engine conditions (i. e. load, speed, temperature, "driving scenarios") and emission control devices (with/without diesel oxidative catalyst, DOC) on the composition and abundance of unregulated exhaust gas emissions from a light-duty diesel engine. Exhaust emissions were introduced into an atmospheric chamber and measured using thermal desorption comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionisation detector (TD-GC×GC-FID). In total, 16 individual and 8 groups of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured in the exhaust gas, ranging from volatile to intermediate volatility. The total speciated VOC (∑SpVOC) emission rates varied significantly with different engine conditions, ranging from 70 to 9268 milligrams of VOC mass per kilogram of fuel burnt (mg kg - 1). ∑SpVOC emission rates generally decreased with increasing engine load and temperature, {{and to a lesser}} degree, engine speed. The exhaust gas composition changed as a result of two main influencing factors, the DOC hydrocarbon (HC) removal efficiency and engine combustion efficiency. Increased DOC HC removal efficiency and engine combustion efficiency resulted in a greater percentage contribution of the C 7 to C 12 branched aliphatics and C 7 to C 12 n -alkanes, respectively, to the ∑SpVOC emission rate. The investigated <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> 46  ±  10  % of the ∑SpVOC emissions, with removal efficiencies of 83  ±  3  % for the single-ring aromatics and 39  ±  12  % for the aliphatics (branched and straight-chain). The DOC aliphatic removal efficiency generally decreased with increasing carbon chain length. The emission factors of n -nonane to n -tridecane were compared with on-road diesel emissions from a highway tunnel in Oakland California. Comparable emission factors were from experiments with relatively high engine loads and speeds, engine conditions which are consistent with the driving conditions of the on-road diesel vehicles. Emission factors from low engine loads and speeds (e. g. cold-start) showed no agreement with the on-road diesel emissions as expected, with the emission factors observed to be 2 to 8 times greater. To our knowledge, this is the first study which has explicitly discussed the effect of the DOC HC removal efficiency and combustion efficiency on the exhaust gas composition. With further work, compositional differences in exhaust gas emissions as a function of engine temperature, could be implemented into air-quality models, resulting in improved refinement and better understanding of diesel exhaust emissions on local air quality...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{adsorption}} and microwave assisted-oxidation of Cationic Blue (X-GRL) on hydrous manganese oxides (delta MnO(2)) and commercial MnO(2) (beta MnO(2)). The effects of X-GRL adsorption and Mn(IV) reductive dissolution are investigated. delta MnO(2) exhibits higher adsorbing potential for X-GRL than beta MnO(2) does, with dissolved organic carbon (<b>DOC)</b> removal potential (<b>removed</b> <b>DOC</b> at per gram MnO 2) of 4. 92 and 0. 31 mg/g, respectively. The ratio of absorption at different wavelength (A(202) (nm) /A(300) (nm) /A(610) (nm)) and ratio of DOC to A(610) (nm) (R(DOC) /A(610) (nm)) varies after adsorption. This implies the electron transfer between manganese oxides surfaces and X-GRL, which is confirmed by dissolved Mn(II) concentration increase. delta MnO(2) exhibits more remarkable oxidizing effect than beta MnO(2) does. X-GRL adsorption onto delta MnO(2) involves in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, which is inhibited by Ca(2 +) presence and favored at higher pH. Manganese species (delta MnO(2), beta MnO(2) and Mn(2 +)) facilitates X-GRL degradation and DOC removal in O(2) /MWL systems, and more significant effects are observed for delta MnO(2) due to its combined effects of adsorption and catalysis. The k(app) (apparent reaction constant) in the initial 10 min with delta MnO(2) presence is about 2. 5 and 4. 2 times higher than that with beta MnO(2) and Mn(2 +) presence, respectively. However, with reactions continuing, DOC mineralization is inhibited in heterogeneous systems due to the adverse effect of high dissolved Mn(2 +) concentration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In Boreal regions the raw waters contain high {{concentrations}} of natural organic matter (NOM), thus their removal in biofilters is not always effective due to the slow degradation rate of biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC). The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the BDOC degradation rate after ozonation of humic rich dissolved organic carbon (DOC= 4 - 8 mg/L) drinking water. To measure BDOC removal kinetics a simple method was developed for this study. The organic carbon in synthetic water solution in which the only organic substance was acetate was completely removed during the first 120 minutes. During the same period only 9 % of the <b>DOC</b> was <b>removed</b> from ozonated drinking water sample (O 3 mgL- 1 /DOC mgL- 1 = 1 - 1. 5). In the following 105 minutes another 7 % of DOC was degraded by the columns. After that no changes of DOC occurred. These results allow concluding that even at high ozone doses the BDOC produced from humic-rich water is slowly biodegradable and therefore is not effectively removed by biofiltration applying the contact time (20 - 30 min) currently used by ozonation-biofiltration plants...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the utilization of}} dissolved organic matter and oxygen for sewage purification and to evaluate the feasibility of {{the application of the}} sewer as a pretreatment system for municipal sewage. The experiment was carried out in a 1. 5 -km section of a sanitary gravity sewer in a slope of 0. 0075. This sewer is a cement pipe with an inner diameter of 450 mm. Continuous monitoring of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), suspended solids (SS), flow rate, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were conducted along the sewer. It was found that 16 % of the <b>DOC</b> was <b>removed</b> in the section with an estimated 18 -minute retention time. Throughout the entire sewer section, a slow flow rate favors a higher DOC removal efficiency because it offers a longer retention time, which implies that oxygen would not be a limiting factor. The DO decreased progressively along the sewer line and the mean concentration difference between the influent and effluent was found almost constant at 3. 1 mg/L throughout the entire sewer section. Batch tests using both sewage and sediment were carried out to determine their specific DOC removal rates and the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), and the mean values were found to be 1. 3 mg DOC/mg SS/day (0. 054 mg DOC/mg SS/day) for DOC removal and 17. 7 mg O 2 /g SS/hr for oxygen uptake in the sewage phase and 2. 6 mg DOC/mg SS/day (0. 108 mg DOC/mg SS/day) for DOC removal and 32 mg O 2 /g SS/hr for oxygen uptake in the sediment phase, respectiveIy. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content analysis of the SS and sediment samples also confirmed that both the SS and the sediments contained substantial amount of active biomass. The oxygen budget analysis of this sewer found that the oxygen demand for the sediment and the sewage is 22. 8 kg O 2 /day and 4. 3 kg O 2 /day, respectively. If this entire 1. 5 -km sewer system is taken as a tubular bioreactor, it can be estimated that 39. 13 Kg of DOC can be stabilized per day, to which the sewage phase contributes 40 % while the sediment phase contributes 60 %.

40|$|Ion {{exchange}} resins {{have found}} an increasing application in {{the drinking water}} treatment sector {{over the last few}} decades. The ion exchange resins have a positive ability to remove the charged natural organic matter (NOM). To apply this process in full-scale treatment, the most suitable resin has to be selected and the hydraulic behaviour of the treatment process must be known. This study has the purpose to study the NOM fractions removal with different resins and select the most suitable resin for NOM removal of the Weesperkarspel water. Another purpose is to study the hydraulic behaviours of fluidized ion exchange and testing of the fluidization models of Ergun and Richardson-Zaki. The thesis study is characterizing NOM into the specific fraction and later observing the removal of each fraction with the different ion exchange resins. The kinetic and the equilibrium of NOM removal of each resin are also studied. Four ion exchange resins are tested (Lewatit VP OC 1071, Purolite Macronet 200, Duolite A 7 and MIEX DOC). The ultraviolet absorbance method (UV), dissolved organic carbon detection method (DOC), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), fluorescence excitation emission matrix (fluorescence EEM) and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detector method (LC-OCD) were applied. Weesperkarspel water contains a high degree of aromatic NOM fractions, mostly in the form of humic substances. The Lewatit VP OC 1071 is the most suitable resin for removal of NOM in general view, especially aromatic NOM and humic substances fractions. It appears to be removed as high as 65 % and 94 % respectively. The MIEX <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> 57 % aromatic NOM fraction and 70 % of humic substances. The pH was found as the dominant parameter for the NOM removal by the weak base Duolite A 7. In normal raw water (pH = 7. 8), this resin is almost ineffective while it can remove the aromatic NOM up to 35 % and humic substances fraction of 45 % in raw water pH adjusted to 5. The sorbent Purolite Macronet 200 can remove only biopolymers and neutral NOM fractions. Adsorption is an important mechanism for the removal process of high molecular weight NOM fractions and the neutrals fractions. By using the linear driving force model (LDF) to describe the ion exchange rate of the resin, it was found that MIEX <b>DOC</b> resin can <b>remove</b> NOM faster than other resins. The LDF- k constant of MIEX DOC is also higher than other resins. MIEX DOC has the smallest resin bead size. This can be the reason for the fast removal of NOM. The resin exchange capacity is related with the Freundlich constant K and n. Increase of K and n values lead to increase of exchange capacity. The Lewatit VP OC 1071 has the highest K and n values and thus the highest exchange capacity. The exchange rate and exchange capacity is a specific property of each resin. With help from the LDF model and Freundlich isotherm the breakthrough curve can be determined. The Lewatit VP OC 1071 has longest running time compared with the MIEX DOC and Duolite A 7 due to the highest exchange capacity. The hydraulics behaviour of fluidized bed ion exchange has been investigated with the strong base gel resin Lewatit VP OC 1071. The temperature and the feed velocity influence the expanded behaviour. The wet density and wet porosity are important parameters for the model prediction. Combination of mathematical modelling of ion exchange and the treatment conditions of Weesperkarspel drinking water treatment plant, the fluidized ion exchange process can be designed. For Weesperkarspel drinking water treatment plant, the aim is to decrease the DOC concentration of 7. 2 mg C/l to 3. 0 mg C/l with the fluidized ion exchange process. The 20 fluidized ion exchange reactors with a height of 9 m, 10 m 2 of resin bed surface area, a bed height of 2 m and a feed velocity of 20 m/h are designed. The reactors consist of 4 groups, each group is started with delays of 15 days. With this operational step, the running time of each reactor is 60 days.

The CSBR was more effective and stable for eutrophic water treatment than OSBR, in terms of extracellular microcystin-LR, chlorophyll-a, DOC, and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) removal. Removal efficiencies of extracellular microcystin-LR and chlorophyll-a were 75. 8 % and 59. 7 % in CSBR and 60. 5 % and 53. 0 % after 2 [*]h in OSBR. CSBR had much higher removal efficiency (34. 3 %) than OSBR (22. 7 %) for DOC, and CSBR could remove 67 % BDOC, accounting for 34 % of total DOC in source water. 11. 5 % of <b>DOC</b> was <b>removed</b> through means other than biological degradation, such as biofilm adsorption and bioflocculation.

40|$|Background Evidence {{increasingly}} {{shows that}} stream ecosystems greatly contribute to global carbon fluxes. This involves a tight coupling between biofilms, the dominant form of microbial life in streams, and {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC), a very significant pool of organic carbon on Earth. Yet, the interactions between microbial biodiversity and the molecular diversity of resource use are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Using six 40 -m-long streamside flumes, we created a gradient of streambed landscapes with increasing spatial flow heterogeneity to assess how physical heterogeneity, inherent to streams, affects biofilm diversity and DOC use. We determined bacterial biodiversity in all six landscapes using 16 S-rRNA fingerprinting and measured carbon uptake from glucose and DOC experimentally injected to all six flumes. The diversity of <b>DOC</b> molecules <b>removed</b> from the water was determined from ultrahigh-resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Bacterial beta diversity, glucose and DOC uptake, and the molecular diversity of DOC use all increased with increasing flow heterogeneity. Causal modeling and path analyses of the experimental data revealed that the uptake of glucose was largely driven by physical processes related to flow heterogeneity, whereas biodiversity effects, such as complementarity, most likely contributed to the enhanced uptake of putatively recalcitrant DOC compounds in the streambeds with higher flow heterogeneity. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest biophysical mechanisms, including hydrodynamics and microbial complementarity effects, through which physical heterogeneity induces changes of resource use and carbon fluxes in streams. These findings highlight the importance of fine-scale streambed heterogeneity for microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in streams, where homogenization and loss of habitats increasingly reduce biodiversity...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain insight into the mechanisms that are operative in pre-ozonized coagulation. Effects of pre-ozonation on organic matter removal during coagulation with IPF-PACl were investigated by using PDA (photometric disperse analysis), apparent molecular weight distribution and chemical fractionation. The dynamic formation of floes during coagulation process was detected. Changes of aquatic organic matter (AOM) structure resulted from the influence of pre-ozonation were evaluated. Results show that dosage of O- 3 and characteristics of AOM are two of the major factors influencing the performance of O- 3 on coagulation. No significant coagulation-aid effect of O- 3 was observed for all experiments using either AlCl 3 or PACl On the contrary, with the application of pre-ozonation, the coagulation efficiency of AlCl 3 was significantly deteriorated, reflected by the retardation of floe formation, and the removal decreases of turbidity, DOC, and UV 254. However, if PACl was used instead of AlCl 3, the adverse effects of pre-ozonation were mitigated obviously, particularly when the O- 3 dosage was less than 0. 69 (mg O- 3 /mg TOC). The difference between removals of UV 254 and DOC indicated that pre-ozonation greatly changed the molecular structure of AOM, but its capability of mineralization was not remarkable. Only 5 % or so <b>DOC</b> was <b>removed</b> by pre-ozonation at 0. 6 - 0. 8 mg/L alone. Fractionation results showed that the organic products of pre-ozonation exhibited lower molecular weight and more hydrophilicity, which impaired the removal of DOC in the following coagulation process...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{oxidation}} (EO) processes {{have been}} gaining a growing popularity in wastewater treatment. Their engineered applications inspire {{the search for}} conductive, stable, inexpensive, and sustainable electrode materials. Magnéli-phase titanium oxides have unique crystal and electron structure, which result in good electrical conductivity approaching that of metal and excellent corrosion resistance close to that of ceramics. We fabricated a monolithic porous Magnéli-phase Ti 4 O 7 electrode for EO of refractory industrial dyeing and finishing wastewater (DFWW). The results demonstrated that the electrochemically active area of porous Ti 4 O 7 electrode was 2 – 3 orders of magnitude higher than the apparent surface area of bulk electrode. The Ti 4 O 7 electrode achieved efficient and stable abatement of recalcitrant organic pollutants on site without any extra addition of chemicals. The soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved organic carbon (<b>DOC)</b> were <b>removed</b> by 66. 5 % and 46. 7 %, respectively, at current density of 8 mA cm− 2 after 2 h reaction. The bioavailability of treated wastewater was improved substantially, indicated by one order of magnitude increase in BOD 5 /COD. The Ti 4 O 7 electrode had good long-term stability, with its maximum COD removal declined only slightly (< 8 %) at current density of 20 mA cm− 2 during a 50 -cycle operation. The organic pollutants appear {{most likely to be}} oxidized by electrochemically generated active species like physisorbed OH radical and aqueous ClO− species under mass transfer control condition. The current study provides important insights for achieving efficient and sustainable electrochemical wastewater treatment using the novel porous Ti 4 O 7 electrode material...|$|R

Fischer), who harasses him in the showers and later attacks him in the prison yard with a knife; both men spend time in the hole. When the warden discovers that Doc has painted an ungainly {{caricature}} of him, {{as well as other}} policemen on the island itself, he permanently <b>removes</b> <b>Doc's</b> painting privileges; in response, a depressed Doc hacks off his own fingers with a hatchet from the prison workshop and is led away. Later, Morris encounters bank robber brothers John and Clarence Anglin (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau), who are his old friends from another prison sentence, and he makes the acquaintance of prisoner Charley Butts (Larry Hankin). Later, during mealtime, Morris places one of Doc's chrysanthemums at the table in honor of Doc, but the warden stops by and crushes it. Litmus is enraged, but as he reaches out to grab the warden, he suffers a fatal heart attack.

40|$|Adsorption on {{granular}} {{activated carbon}} (GAC) and fractionation of marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was investigated {{with the objective of}} mitigating RO membrane biofouling {{in the context of a}} reverse osmosis process for seawater pretreated by ultrafiltration. The behaviours of six commercial GAC compounds were compared. Batch kinetics experiments showed that 80 % of DOC in seawater was adsorbed within four hours. Adsorption kinetics fitted the Ho and McKay model well, and isotherms followed the Freundlich model. GAC A and GAC F had the best adsorption capacities. For GAC A, the adsorption mechanism was mainly related to high occupation of the porous volume, whereas for GAC F, the adsorption was mainly related to electrostatic interactions. GAC A was selected for a fixed bed column experiment continuously fed with seawater as GAC F released acidic groups into the feed water. This filtration set-up enabled more than 70 % of <b>DOC</b> to be <b>removed</b> from seawater. Moreover, LC-OCD analysis showed that GAC A filtration drastically reduced DOC fractions, including colloidal transparent exopolymer particles (cTEP) by 92 % and neutral low molecular weight molecules by 80 %, thus reducing the potential for biofouling of the RO membranes...|$|R
40|$|Sequential ozone and UV-based {{processes}} (VUV irradiation and UV/H 2 O 2) for {{the treatment}} of secondary effluent were investigated. The effectiveness of these sequential treatments was compared with the individual treatments in terms of reduction in DOC, COD, UV 254 and colour and impact on BDOC. The greatest decrease in DOC, COD and UV 254 was achieved for samples treated with ozone before UV/H 2 O 2 (UVH), where a synergistic benefit was observed. By monitoring the formation of hydroxyl radicals (HO) during UVH and ozonation it was demonstrated that UVH treatments generated more hydroxyl radicals than ozonation, which explained the greater extent of mineralisation attained during UVH treatment. Sequential O 3 -UVH treatment (for 5 and 10 min, respectively) enhanced the formation of biodegradable compounds such that when followed by biological treatment up to 73 % of the <b>DOC</b> could be <b>removed</b> from the secondary effluent. Furthermore, application of the O 3 -UVH treatment achieved 2. 5 times greater mineralisation than ozone alone. This improvement, however, required 4. 5 times greater electrical energy input (EEI) for the same treatment time of 15 min...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to have a strong effect on the Eastern Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) region, which includes 40 % of the Arctic shelves and comprises the Laptev and East Siberian seas. The largest organic carbon pool, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), may change significantly due to changes in both riverine inputs and transformation rates; however, the present DOC inventories and transformation patterns are poorly understood. Using samples from the International Siberian Shelf Study 2008, this study examines for the first time DOC removal in Arctic shelf waters with residence times that range from months to years. Removals of up to 10 %- 20 % were found in the Lena River estuary, consistent with earlier studies in this area, where surface waters were shown to have a residence time of approximately 2 months. In contrast, the DOC concentrations showed a strong nonconservative pattern in areas with freshwater residence times of several years. The average losses of DOC were estimated to be 30 %- 50 % during mixing along the shelf, corresponding to a first-order removal rate constant of 0. 3 yr- 1. These data provide the first observational evidence for losses of DOC in the Arctic shelf seas, and the calculated DOC deficit reflects DOC losses that are higher than recent model estimates for the region. Overall, a large proportion of riverine <b>DOC</b> is <b>removed</b> from the surface waters across the Arctic shelves. Such significant losses must be included in models of the carbon cycle for the Arctic Ocean, especially since the breakdown of terrestrial DOC to CO 2 in Arctic shelf seas may constitute a positive feedback mechanism for Arctic climate warming. These data also provide a baseline for considering the effects of future changes in carbon fluxes, as the vast northern carbon-rich permafrost areas draining into the Arctic are affected by global warming.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the changes in}} dissolved major and trace element concentrations along the Orinoco River, including the mixing zone between the Orinoco and Apure Rivers. Water samples from the Apure and Orinoco Rivers were collected monthly in four sectors {{over a period of}} 15 months. Auxiliary parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature), total suspended sediments, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and major (Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Si) and trace (Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Cr) element concentrations were measured in all sectors. The relative contribution of both rivers after the Apure-Orinoco confluence was determined using Ca as a tracer. Moreover, a mixing model was developed to determine whether dissolved species exhibit a conservative behavior during mixing. The results indicate that <b>DOC</b> is <b>removed</b> from waters during the Apure-Orinoco mixing, probably due to absorption of DOC on mineral phases supplied by the Apure River. Dissolved Na, Ca, and Mg behave conservatively during the mixing processes, and their concentrations are controlled by a dilution process. The anomaly in the temporal pattern of K in the Orinoco is caused by the input of biogenic K originating from the Apure River during the high-water stage. The loss of dissolved Si during the low-water stage {{can be explained by the}} uptake of Si by diatoms. Dissolved Mn, Zn, Al, and Fe showed a non-conservative behavior during the Apure-Orinoco mixing. The removal of Mn and Zn from the dissolved phase can be explained by the formation of Mn-oxyhydroxides and the scavenging of Zn onto Mn oxides. Dissolved Fe is controlled by redox processes, although the removals of Fe and Al due to the preferential adsorption of large organometallic complexes by mineral surfaces after the Apure-Orinoco confluence can affect the mobility of both elements during transport. The conservative behavior shown by Cu and Cr can be related to the tendency of both elements to be complexed with small organic colloids, which are not preferentially adsorbed by clays...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{problem for}} the {{application}} of microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membrane technology is membrane fouling. Such is the case that understanding membrane fouling {{has become one of the}} major factors driving MF and UF membrane technology for- ward. Nevertheless, identifying the constituents that most contribute to membrane fouling 20 and quantifying how they are detached when backwashing (BW) and cleaning-in-place (CIP) are applied still remains a challenging task. The aim of the present study was to quan- tify membrane fouling development during filtration and membrane fouling detachment during BW and CIP in terms of membrane permeability changes and masses of inorganic and organic constituents accumulated on the membrane. The study was conducted using 25 bench-scale MF and UF modules fed with coagulated and settled water coming from a drinking water treatment plant and operated under dead-end and cross-flow operation modes. The experiments consisted inconsecutive permeation (20 min) alternated with BW with permeate water (1. 0 min) (periodically chemically assisted with NaClO and NaOH) and followed by a two-stage CIP consisting first in an oxidising and basic step (NaClO and 30 NaOH) and second in an acidic step (citric acid). Feed, permeate, retentate (when present) and cleaning discharge streams were monitored for turbidity, total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC, respectively), UV 254 and inorganic ions (Al, Fe, P). DOC was frac- tionated by high-performance size exclusion chromatography to gain insight into the beha- viour of the different organic fractions. Results showed that both MF and UF membranes 35 successfully removed turbidity, Al and Fe, whereas UV 254 was moderately removed and TOC and <b>DOC</b> poorly <b>removed,</b> with removal percentages higher for UF than for MF. With regard to the organic fractions, the largest molecular weight compounds were moderately removed while the smallest organic fractions seemed to totally permeate through both membranes. The results also showed that foulants were poorly washed out from thePeer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
25|$|Campbell Island is a sub Antarctic island 700km {{south of}} New Zealand that became infested with rats in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, {{including}} the Campbell teal and Campbell snipe, only survived on small rocky islets {{just off the}} island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for ex-situ conservation, but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The <b>DOC's</b> plan to <b>remove</b> rats from the island {{was one of the}} most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113km2, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of bird strike for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. Snipe have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.|$|R
40|$|This study uses a 10 -year {{record of}} precipitation, soil, and stream {{concentration}} of nutrient and carbon species from an upland peat catchment {{to examine whether}} or not changes in nutrient inputs can explain long-term increases in DOC flux from peat. The study uses time series analysis and particularly the derivation of impulse response functions to provide an alternative approach to environmental manipulations and experimental additions of nitrogen. The study shows that (1) the catchment has a fixed capacity for nitrogen uptake and as such nitrogen flux from the catchment is controlled by precipitation inputs; (2) the DOC flux from the catchment shows no relationship with precipitation inputs and flux from the peat itself continues to increase over the period; (3) impulse response functions suggest that high DOC concentrations suppress nutrient flux from the catchment {{and not the other}} way around; and (4) no significant correlation could be found between nutrient time series and the residual of the <b>DOC</b> concentrations after <b>removing</b> the effects of both temperature and changes in water table. The study can find no evidence of a link between nutrient inputs and the release of DOC from the peat profile. The DOC flux corrected for rainfall inputs and the residual time series of regression all show sharp step changes in the DOC release after severe drought...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{quantified}} {{the role of}} in-stream processes on net dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively) export from peatland catchments, and those that have offer conflicting evidence. In this study, we evaluated evidence for active organic matter processing under field conditions, via a coordinated campaign across four UK catchments with peatland headwaters, targeted on potential ‘hotspots’ and ‘hot moments’ of physico-chemical carbon cycling. We hypothesised that specific hotspots and hot moments would occur where waters enriched with DOC and POC sourced from headwaters are exposed to: (1) mixing with freshwaters of different pH, conductivity and metal concentrations; and (2) mixing with seawater during autumn when DOC concentrations were at their highest. We observed instances of POC removal in headwaters, and potential for rapid conversion between dissolved and particulate carbon forms and for net removal of peat-derived carbon at confluences further downstream (where observed, {{on the order of}} 52 – 75 % for POC, and 5 – 44 % for DOC). Estuary transect surveys indicated that up to 30 % of fluvial <b>DOC</b> can be <b>removed</b> under high flow conditions. However, in the majority of cases concentrations remained within the range that would be expected based on conservative transport. These findings indicate that rapid (e. g. solubility-related) processes within the river system may be important but sporadic, thus are unlikely to provide major removal pathways for peat-derived organic carbon...|$|R
40|$|Peatlands {{are serving}} {{as one of}} the most {{important}} terrestrial carbon stores in the United Kingdom and globally. In the UK, the current trend of peatlands turning from carbon sinks to carbon sources is widely observed and reported. As numerous factors may affect the carbon cycle of peatlands, including climate, land management, hydrology and vegetation, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was commonly used as an indicator of peatland carbon changes. Besides the function as an indicator of carbon turnover in peatland, increasing DOC in the stream water also raises concern in water companies as the removal of DOC from water represents a major cost of water treatment. This thesis investigates the impacts of land management such as drain blocking and revegetation on stream DOC changes. By building a pilot column study, this thesis also assessed the potential of bank filtration serving as DOC treatment in UK. Results of drain blocking shows the management was a significant impact on the DOC changes. However, later investigation of peak flow events indicates such positive impacts from drain blocking were minor in terms of high peak flow events. Since the majority of DOC export occurred during such peak flow events, drain blocking were found not as an efficient management of DOC changes. The field study of revegetation observed minor effects of revegetation on stream DOC. The results of column bank filtration indicate low DOC removal rate under the current stream DOC level in UK. The bank filtration may efficient <b>remove</b> <b>DOC</b> when higher DOC input applied. However, it is not suitable for UK peatland under current DOC export. ...|$|R
