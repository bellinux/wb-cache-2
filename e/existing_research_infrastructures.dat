From the research publishing perspective, {{the aim is}} to pursue an holistic approach where publishing includes any product (e. g. articles, data sets, experiments, notebooks, websites) resulting from a research activity and relevant to the interpretation, evaluation, and reuse of the activity or part of it. In this paper, we present the foundational concepts and relationships characterising SciRepo, i. e. an innovative class of scientific repositories that (a) promotes a publishing mechanism blurring the distinction between research life cycle and its scholarly communication; (b) simplifies the "publishing" of an entire research activity allowing to seamlessly exploit and reuse every research product; and (c) is conceived to be nicely integrated on top of <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of Horizon 2020, the European Commission approved the ASTERICS initiative (ASTronomy ESFRI and Research Infrastructure CluSter) to collect knowledge and experiences from astronomy, astrophysics and particle physics and foster synergies among <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and scientific communities, hence {{paving the way for}} future ones. ASTERICS aims at producing a common set of tools and strategies to be applied in Astronomy ESFRI facilities. In particular, it will target the so-called multi-messenger approach to combine information from optical and radio telescopes, photon counters and neutrino telescopes. pLISA is a software tool under development in ASTERICS to help and promote machine learning as a unified approach to multivariate analysis of astrophysical data and signals. The library will offer a collection of classification parameters, estimators, classes and methods to be linked and used in reconstruction programs (and possibly also extended), to characterize events in terms of particle identification and energy. The pLISA library aims at offering the software infras tructure for applications developed inside different experiments and has been designed with an effort to extrapolate general, physics-related estimators from the specific features of the data model related to each particular experiment. pLISA is oriented towards parallel computing architectures, with awareness of the opportunity of using GPUs as accelerators demanding specifically optimized algorithms and to reduce the costs of pro cessing hardware requested for the reconstruction tasks. Indeed, a fast (ideally, real-time) reconstruction can open the way for the development or improvement of alert systems, typically required by multi-messenger search programmes among the different experi mental facilities involved in ASTERICS...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The European Plate Observing System (EPOS) aims to {{integrate}} existing infrastructures in the solid earth sciences {{into a single}} infrastructure, enabling earth scientists across Europe to combine, model, and interpret multidisciplinary datasets at different time and length scales. In particular, a primary objective is {{to integrate}} <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> within the fields of seismology, geodesy, geophysics, geology, rock physics, and volcanology at a pan-European level. The added value of such integration is not visible through individual analyses of data from each research infrastructure; {{it needs to be}} understood in a long-term perspective that includes the time when changes implied by current scientific research results are fully realized and their societal impacts have become clear. EPOS is now entering its implementation phase following a four-year preparatory phase during which 18 member countries in Europe contributed more than 250 research infrastructures to the building of this pan-European vision. The Arctic covers {{a significant portion of the}} European Plate and therefore plays an important part in research on the solid earth in Europe. However, the work environment in the Arctic is challenging. First, most of the European Plate boundary in the Arctic is offshore, and hence, sub-sea networks must be built for solid earth observation. Second, ice covers the Arctic Ocean where the European Plate boundary crosses through the Gakkel Ridge, so innovative technologies are needed to monitor solid earth deformation. Therefore, research collaboration with other disciplines such as physical oceanography, marine acoustics, and geo-biology is necessary. The establishment of efficient research infrastructures suitable for these challenging conditions is essential both to reduce costs and to stimulate multidisciplinary research...|$|E

40|$|The {{presentation}} briefly {{discusses the}} general challenges (with focus on technical point of views) in unlocking alternative resources of lower grade and above ground (urban) metal ores for resource efficiency. The low {{concentration of the}} targeted metals and more complex composition of these alternative sources provide challenges in processing and recovering all the valuable metals. There is limited thermodynamic information {{and the lack of}} understanding of the behavior of the elements during processing. A comprehensive approach addressing both the technical and non-technical barriers needs to be applied for maximising resource efficiency and wealth generation. In this presentation, a number of activities in Australia including researches within the Wealth from Waste Cluster and Swinburne University of Technology will be also briefly discussed. Wealth from Waste Cluster is a multi-disciplinary international research cluster between CSIRO, University Technology Sydney, Swinburne University of Technology, University of Queensland, Monash University and Yale University. The researches within the Cluster aim to explore ways to harness value from above ground stocks of metals with a focus on industrial ecology and circular economy, considering the size and value of the available resources, the socio-technical systems needed to overcome barriers and to develop new business models which would facilitate the harnessing of wealth from waste. In Swinburne University of Technology a Research Group with theme focusing on the Resource Efficiency is being developed. This multidisciplinary research area within Swinburne is supported by the <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and laboratories, as well as the new Design for Resource Efficiency Studio within the Factory of the Future to be opened in mid 2015. Researches within Swinburne, associated with the theme are also discussed in the presentation, which include electrically enhanced boron impurities removal from metallurgical grade silicon, selective sulfidation for removal of impurities in weathered ilmenite (FeTiO 3), and studies on thermodynamic behavior of valuable metals...|$|E
40|$|BalticGrid – a {{step towards}} EGI Olgerts Belmanis, Ilmars Slaidins Riga Technical University Abstract After joining EU in 2004 process of {{integration}} of the Baltic States in European infrastructures and communities gained strength. One of urgent tasks was an integration of well developed computing and communication infrastructure of the Baltic States into the emerging grid computing based European e-Infrastructure. Aim {{of this paper is}} to present challenges and achievements of the Baltic Grid Project as a case study on development of grid computing and integration of <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and communities into common European Research Area. BalticGrid project first phase started in November 1, 2005 with 10 leading institutions in 6 countries. Baltic States joined the consortium with little experience in grid but in short time gained necessary expertise and created grid computing infrastructure. After the project first phase there were 17 operational grid computing clusters, 8 of them certified as production sites in EGEE. All necessary central services were deployed and at least doubled. The Baltic Grid Second Phase (BalticGrid-II) project started in May 1, 2008 and was designed to increase the impact of services and improve support of users of the recently created e-Infrastructure in the Baltic States and extend the BalticGrid infrastructure to Belarus. The consortium was composed of 13 leading institutions in seven countries, with 7 institutions in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, 2 in Belarus, 2 in Poland, and one each in Sweden and Switzerland. BalticGrid project was successfully completed in April 30, 2010. Aims and objectives of the Baltic Grid projects will be presented in the paper, as well as detailed analysis of achieved results in establishing sustainable e-Infrastructure in the Baltic States. Development of e-Infrastructure in the Baltic States was coordinated with the EU policy guidelines and based on best practice case analysis elsewhere in Europe and worldwide. Baltic States have computing infrastructure and well trained staff to interoperate at European level. The challenge for all Baltic States after the end of BG-II, EGEE and other collaborating project is to maintain sustainable grid infrastructure in European Research Area (ERA). The way of future Grid infrastructure and services sustainability was developed by the European Grid Initiative (EGI) Design Study project. Baltic Grid project partners also learned EGI DS goals as well as best practice from other grid projects. EGI will provide way to establish collaboration between number of computing infrastructure projects to meet needs and requirements of ERA. BG-II project established good contacts with industry. BalticGrid development policy defines the need for long-term sustainable collaboration to develop and maintain a core infrastructure that includes permanent services that are suitable for researchers from a variety of disciplines. To meet these objectives each country have established NGI based on NREN and joined EGI. EGI is the way towards a sustainable production grid infrastructure for Europe. Results obtained in the Baltic Grid project confirm readiness of partner institutions to collaborate within EGI and ERA to maintain sustainability...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{combination}} of economic challenges and uncertain policy conditions in the United States, European Union, and elsewhere, the development of advanced biorefineries has progressed slower than anticipated. This has delayed {{the transition to a}} more sustainable and less carbon-intensive economy. In this article, we adopt the technological innovation system (TIS) approach to analyze advanced biorefinery development in Sweden, a front-runner country in current development. The analysis highlights a number of system strengths (e. g., long-term research funding; significant research infrastructure; strong actor networks) that have contributed to developing the Swedish TIS, but also important system weaknesses (e. g., weak coordination among ministries; lack of industrial absorptive capacity; unclear roles) inhibiting it. The article highlights a combination of four policy measures that build on the system strengths to address the system weaknesses: (a) the implementation of a deployment policy for creating domestic niche markets; (b) improved policy timing and more structured coordination among different governmental agencies; (c) the provision of stronger incentives for mature industries to invest in R&D and improve their absorptive capacity; and (d) improved organization and financing of <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> In addition to the empirical contribution, the article contributes with novel insights into the TIS framework by highlighting the dynamics between system strengths and weaknesses, and suggests that system strengths should be better emphasized in future TIS studies...|$|R

However, knowledge about patterns in microbial aerobiology is still relatively scarce, and this can be attributed, in part, {{to a lack of}} consensus on appropriate sampling and analytical methodology. In this study, three different methods were used to investigate aerial biodiversity over Svalbard: impaction, membrane filtration and drop plates. Sites around Svalbard were selected due to their relatively remote location, low human population, geographical location with respect to air movement and the tradition and history of scientific investigation on the archipelago, ensuring the presence of <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The aerial bacterial biodiversity found was similar to that described in other aerobiological studies from both polar and non-polar environments, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes being the predominant groups. Twelve different phyla were detected in the air collected above Svalbard, although the diversity was considerably lower than in urban environments elsewhere. However, only 58 of 196 bacterial genera detected were consistently present, suggesting potentially higher levels of heterogeneity. Viable bacteria were present at all sampling locations, showing that living bacteria are ubiquitous in the air around Svalbard. Sampling location influenced the results obtained, as did sampling method.

40|$|This report {{assesses the}} {{literature}} on the inter-relations between the economy and security with particular focus on terrorism and the "human drivers of insecurity" to identify both available knowledge and crucial research gaps. In addition, the report surveys the European research capacity in the field of security economics. The study is based on a thorough literature survey of the newly emerging field of security economics, using a variety of electronic catalogues and search engines as sources. The study reveals that it is not just terror attacks but also security measures of private and public agents responding to the threat of terrorism that incur significant repercussions for the economy, often with trans-national consequences. Impacts vary with the maturity of an economy; appropriate ex ante and ex post policies are critical to contain the damage of terrorism. Given the dynamic nature of human-induced insecurity, policies should place emphasis on "systemic resilience". Gaps in the economic security literature include insufficient knowledge of the behaviour of terrorists and their targets. Furthermore, the global impacts of terror attacks and especially of security measures require more analysis. Future research requires a more rigorous conceptual framework, methodological improvements and, above all, better data. In comparison to the United States, the current research capacity in security economics in Europe is weak. On the one hand, there is significant research potential in the field of security economics within the European Union in the shape of several high quality researchers. On the other hand, the <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and institutional barriers both inhibit this potential from being developed academically and for policy advice. Establishing a European network of security economists and funding a European centre for security economics could contribute to remedy this situation. ...|$|R

Despite the initial conceptualisation, however, the practical implementation of EBVs remains challenging. There is much discussion about the concept and implementation of EBVs: which variables are meaningful; which data are needed and available; at which spatial, temporal and topical scales can EBVs be calculated; and how sensitive are EBVs to variations in underlying data? To advance scientific progress in implementing EBVs we propose that both scientists and <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> operators need to cooperate globally to serve and process the essential large datasets for calculating EBVs. We introduce GLOBIS-B (GLOBal Infrastructures for Supporting Biodiversity research), a global cooperation funded by the Horizon 2020 research and innovation framework programme of the European Commission. The main aim of GLOBIS-B is to bring together biodiversity scientists, global <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> operators and legal interoperability experts to identify the <b>research</b> needs and <b>infrastructure</b> services underpinning the concept of EBVs.

40|$|Background: In high-resource settings, obstetric {{ultrasound}} is {{a standard}} component of prenatal care used to identify pregnancy complications and to establish an accurate gestational age {{in order to improve}} obstetric care. Whether or not ultrasound use will improve care and ultimately pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings is unknown. Methods/Design: This multi-country cluster randomized trial will assess the impact of antenatal ultrasound screening performed by health care staff on a composite outcome consisting of maternal mortality and maternal near-miss, stillbirth and neonatal mortality in low-resource community settings. The trial will utilize an <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> the Global Network for Women’s and Children’s Health Research with sites in Pakistan, Kenya, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Guatemala. A maternal and newborn health registry in defined geographic areas which documents all pregnancies and their outcomes to 6 weeks post-delivery will provide population-based rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, stillbirth, neonatal mortality and morbidity, and health care utilization for study clusters. A total of 58 study clusters each with a health center and about 500 births per year will be randomized (29 intervention and 29 control). The intervention includes training of health workers (e. g., nurses, midwives, clinical officers) to perform ultrasound examinations during antenatal care, generally at 18 – 22 and at 32 – 36 weeks for each subject. Women who are identified as having a complication of pregnancy will be referred to a hospital for appropriate care. Finally, the intervention includes community sensitization activities to inform women and their families of the availability of ultrasound at the antenatal care clinic and training in emergency obstetric and neonatal care at referral facilities. Discussion: In summary, our trial will evaluate whether introduction of ultrasound during antenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes in rural, low-resource settings. The intervention includes training for ultrasound-naïve providers in basic obstetric ultrasonography and then enabling these trainees to use ultrasound to screen for pregnancy complications in primary antenatal care clinics and to refer appropriately.

The thesis discusses the data retrieval and transfer mechanisms in challenging networks {{such as the}} Grid and the delay-tolerant networking (DTN). The Grid concept has gained adaptation {{as a solution to}} high-performance computing challenges that are faced in international research collaborations. Challenging networking is a novel research area in communications. The first part of the thesis introduces the challenges of data availability in environment where resources are scarce. The focus is especially on the challenges faced in the Grid and in the challenging networking scenarios. A literature overview is given to explain the most important research findings and the state of the standardization work in the field. The experimental part of the thesis consists of eight scientific publications and explains how they contribute to research in the field. Focus in on explaining how data transfer mechanisms have been improved from the application and networking layer points of views. Experimental methods for the Grid scenarios comprise of running a newly developed storage application on the <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> A network simulator is extended for the experimentation with challenging networking mechanisms in a network formed by mobile users. The simulator enables to investigate network behavior with a large number of nodes, and with conditions that are difficult to re-instantiate. As a result, recommendations are given for data retrieval and transfer design for the Grid and mobile networks. These recommendations can guide both system architects and application developers in their work. In the case of the Grid research, the results give first indications on the applicability of the erasure correcting codes for data storage and retrieval with the existing Grid data storage tools. In the case of the challenging networks, the results show how an application-aware communication approach can be used to improve data retrieval and communications.

40|$|In this paper, we ask {{why so much}} {{ecological}} {{scientific research}} {{does not have a}} greater policy impact in the UK. We argue that there are two potentially important and related reasons for this failing. First, much current ecological science is not being conducted at a scale that is readily meaningful to policy-makers. Second, to make much of this research policy-relevant requires collaborative interdisciplinary research between ecologists and social scientists. However, the challenge of undertaking useful interdisciplinary research only re-emphasises the problems of scale: ecologists and social scientists traditionally frame their research questions at different scales and consider different facets of natural resource management, setting different objectives and using different language. We argue that if applied ecological research is to have greater impact in informing environmental policy, much greater attention needs to be given to the scale of the research efforts {{as well as to the}} interaction with social scientists.

This paper describes a new research initiative funded by the Australian Research Council that will see the development of an SDI to support urban analytics and urban research capabilities focused on Australian cities. This is a timely development for Australia, which is not only one of the most urbanised countries in the world, but is also witnessing high levels of growth rates in its urban areas uncommon in western developed countries.

40|$|The task {{of working}} group 4 {{was to examine}} the {{relationship}} between ecosystem functioning and biodiversity in marine systems. The definition of biodiversity used by the working group is the biological variability in ecosystems as the genetic, species and habitat level. The inventory of marine life is much closer to completion in Europe than in many other areas but some geographic areas, such as the Mediterranean Sea, and specific taxa, mostly in the small size range (viruses, bacteria and protists), require more exploration. Also required is a European synthesis, including studies of both horizontal and vertical gradients of biodiversity, as well as the relationship between diversity and environmental data. The most efficient manner to investigate how species impact ecosystem functioning is to understand the role of the relatively few key organisms. These species should be identified and preferentially attract the attention of ecologists and biological oceanographers. Their study would provide a functional understanding that could be used to model and predict the response of marine ecosystems to global environmental change. In addition to global issues, working group 4 also examined a large range of regional and local issues that also require attention because it is at these scales that most burning societal questions occur.

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the trends in peer-reviewed longitudinal panel studies under scientific direction. Household panel studies have succeeded in broadening their disciplinary scope. Numerous innovations such as questions dealing with psychological concepts, and age-specific topical modules, physical health measures, measures of cognitive capabilities, behavioral experiments have been incorporated into various panel studies or are soon to be introduced. In the UK, the household panel study Understanding Society comprising 40, 000 households was launched in 2009 and recently added an “innovation sample”; in the Netherlands, the new LISS household panel study launched in 2006 with over 5, 000 households {{will be used for}} the testing of innovative measurement methods. The microdata from household panel studies like PSID (US Household Panel Study), BHPS (the predecessor of UK HLS), HILDA (Australian Panel Study), and SOEP (German Socio-Economic Panel) are in continuously high demand by the research and policy advisory community. More important than "discovering" entirely new survey areas is "tailoring" the details of existing survey content to new, more specific (theoretical) questions, and thus maintaining proven and widely used elements of survey content. In the years to come, "tailoring" survey content will be the real challenge facing surveys that are integrated into the <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> like HILDA, LISS, PSID, SHP (Swiss Panel), SOEP, and Understanding Society. We argue that, in the future, household panel studies should be designed to take the "margins" of the life course more fully into account. Indeed, household surveys are ideally suited to gather comprehensive data on these life phases. They can be improved, on the one hand, by including specific topics about the fetal phase of life and early childhood of children born into the panel, and on the other hand, by including better information about late life and death. In the middle of the life course, improved questions on income, savings, consumption, and wealth, as well as psychological constructs will play a central role, as will specific "event-triggered" questionnaires on central life occurrences such as marriage, divorce, and entry into and exit from unemployment. In order to substantially improve the statistical power of long-term longitudinal data, we propose an absolute minimum number of observations of about 500 persons per birth and age cohort. As of now, only the British Understanding Society will meet this target. A positive side-effect of such an enlargement is a significantly improved potential for analyses of relatively small groups within the population: for example, lone parents or specific immigrant groups. Another positive side-effect would be an improved potential for regional analyses. For example, in Germany, a cohort size of about 500 persons implies a survey sample size of about 20, 000 households, which is large enough for analyses in the majority of federal states. Multidisciplinary panel studies will become even more important if they are accepted as reference datasets for specialized surveys that are independent of the original panel study (e. g., observational studies such as twin studies and laboratory or intervention studies). To enhance this important function, new types of service are needed, including advice on special surveys and possibly also data preparation for special surveys. " (author's abstract...|$|R
