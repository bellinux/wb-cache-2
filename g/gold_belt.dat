The costume consists of long sleeves, new shoes, full-length top concealing her midriff, high neckline, and a modified hairstyle while retaining the original turqoise-green color from the films. Her pants have been replaced with a floor-length dress. A <b>gold</b> <b>belt</b> featuring an embroidered design of Raja's face has also {{been added to the}} costume. Jasmine introduced her new outfit to guests with a public appearance at the first Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party. Although similar modifications were made to Pocahontas and Mulan's costumes, Jasmine's redesign has inspired the most controversial response from the public. When questioned, park attendants and cast members explain that the redesigns were made to be more accurate to the cultures from which the characters hail, although Jasmine is from a fictional kingdom, Agrabah. Rachel Paige of Hello Giggles identified the main reason for the dramatic modifications is because several park guests were complaining about the character's exposed midriff and its effects on young girls; Paige defended that the outfit is in accordance to the location and time period in which the film is set. The redesign is expected to gradually begin to appear at other Disney theme parks around the world as well.|$|E
