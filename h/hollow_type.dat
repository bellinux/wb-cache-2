40|$|Abstract: Automotive chassis is a {{skeletal}} {{frame on}} which various mechanical parts like engine, tires, axle assemblies, brakes, steering etc. are bolted. It {{is the most}} crucial element that gives strength and stability to the vehicle under different conditions. Automobile frames provide strength and flexibility to the automobile. The backbone of any automobile, it is the supporting frame to which the body of an engine, axle assemblies are affixed. Role of the chassis {{is to provide a}} structural platform that can connect the front and rear suspension without excessive deflection Moreover; it should be rigid enough to withstand the shock, twist, vibration and other stresses.

The {{mechanism of}} oxidation is studied by analysing their compositional and morphological evolution {{over a long}} span of time (three years) due to exposure to ambient atmosphere.

In the first step, the shell of ZnO forms over Zn NCs rapidly up to certain limiting thickness: with in few days [...] depending upon the size [...] Zn NCs are converted to Zn-ZnO (core-shell), Zn-void-ZnO, or <b>hollow</b> ZnO <b>type</b> NCs.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) containing both intrinsic and extrinsically introduced defects {{has been investigated}} through the study of bamboo and hollow multi-walled CNT morphologies. The controlled addition of argon, hydrogen, and chlorine ions in addition to atomic hydrogen and magnesium vapor was used for varying the charge and type of extrinsic defects. To quantify changes in the CNTs upon treatment, Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques were employed. It was indicated from Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and chronopotentiometric experiments that the electrochemical response of <b>hollow</b> <b>type</b> CNTs could be tailored more significantly compared to bamboo type CNTs, which have innately high reactive site densities and are less amenable to modification. Total defect density and edge- plane-like defect concentrations monitored through Raman spectroscopy were used to correlate changes in the electrochemical response of the CNT electrodes {{as a function of}} treatment. The implementation of CNT electrodes in a prototypical electrolytic capacitor device was then explored and characterized. Dependencies on source current and redox couple concentration were evaluated, as well as changes in the total capacitance as a function of treatment. Cyclability studies were also performed as a function of source current magnitude to evaluate the longevity of the faradaic currents which typically decrease over time in other similar capacitors.

Here we present results using the viral protein, E 2, from bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). BVDV infection occurs in the target species of cattle and sheep herds worldwide and is therefore of economic importance. E 2 is a major immunogenic determinant of BVDV and is an ideal candidate {{for the development of}} a subunit based nanovaccine using mesoporous silica nanoparticles. <b>Hollow</b> <b>type</b> mesoporous silica nanoparticles with surface amino functionalisation (termed HMSA) were characterised and assessed for adsorption and desorption of E 2. A codon-optimised version of the E 2 protein (termed Opti-E 2) was produced in Escherichia coli. HMSA (120 nm) had an adsorption capacity of 80 [small mu]g Opti-E 2 per mg HMSA and once bound E 2 did not dissociate from the HMSA. Immunisation studies in mice with a 20 [small mu]g dose of E 2 adsorbed to 250 [small mu]g HMSA was compared to immunisation with Opti-E 2 (50 [small mu]g) together with the traditional adjuvant Quillaja saponaria Molina tree saponins (QuilA, 10 [small mu]g). The humoral responses with the Opti-E 2 /HMSA nanovaccine although slightly lower than those obtained for the Opti-E 2 + QuilA group demonstrated that HMSA particles are an effective adjuvant that stimulated E 2 -specific antibody responses. Importantly the cell-mediated immune responses were consistently high in all mice immunised with Opti-E 2 /HMSA nanovaccine formulation. Therefore we have shown the Opti-E 2 /HMSA nanoformulation acts as an excellent adjuvant that gives both T-helper 1 and T-helper 2 mediated responses in a small animal model.

In this study we have investigated the capacity of the major immunological determinant of BVDV- 1, the E 2 protein combined with <b>hollow</b> <b>type</b> mesoporous silica nanoparticles with surface amino functionalisation (HMSA), to stimulate immune responses in sheep. The current work also investigated the immunogenicity of the E 2 nanoformulation before and after freeze-drying processes. The optimal excipient formulation for freeze-drying of the E 2 nanoformulation was determined to be 5 % trehalose and 1 % glycine. This excipient formulation preserved both the E 2 protein integrity and HMSA particle structure. Sheep were immunised three times at three week intervals by subcutaneous injection with 500 mu g E 2 adsorbed to 6. 2 mg HMSA as either a non-freeze-dried or freeze-dried nanoformulation. The capacity of both nanovaccine formulations to generate humoral (antibody) and cell-mediated responses in sheep were compared to the responses in sheep immunisation with Opti-E 2 (500 mu g) together with the conventional adjuvant Quil-A (1 mg), a saponin from the Molina tree (Quillaja saponira). The level of the antibody responses detected to both the non-freeze-dried and freeze-dried Opti-E 2 /HMSA nanoformulations were similar to those obtained for Opti-E 2 plus Quil-A, demonstrating the E 2 nanoformulations were immunogenic in a large animal, and freeze-drying did not affect the immunogenicity of the E 2 antigen. Importantly, it was demonstrated that the long term cell-mediated immune responses were detectable up to four months after immunisation. The cell-mediated immune responses were consistently high in all sheep immunised with the freeze-dried Opti-E 2 /HMSA nanovaccine formulation (> 2, 290 SFU/million cells) compared to the non-freeze-dried nanovaccine formulation (213 - 500 SFU/million cells).

40|$|Recently, D'Odorico and Fagherazzi (2003) {{proposed}} "A {{probabilistic model}} of rainfall-triggered shallow landslides in hollows" (Water Resour. Res., 39, 2003). Their model describes the long-term evolution of colluvial deposits through a probabilistic soil mass balance at a point. Further {{building blocks of}} the model are: an infinite-slope stability analysis; a steady-state kinematic wave model (KW) of hollow groundwater hydrology; and a statistical model relating intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme precipitation. Here we extend the work of D'Odorico and Fagherazzi (2003) by incorporating a more realistic description of hollow hydrology (hillslope storage Boussinesq model, HSB) such that this model can also be applied to more gentle slopes and hollows with different plan shapes. We show that results obtained using the KW and HSB models are significantly different as in the KW model the diffusion term is ignored. We generalize our results by examining the stability of several hollow types with different plan shapes (different convergence degree). For each <b>hollow</b> <b>type,</b> the minimum value of the landslide-triggering saturated depth corresponding to the triggering precipitation (critical recharge rate) is computed for steep and gentle hollows. Long term analysis of shallow landslides by the presented model illustrates that all hollows show a quite different behavior from the stability view point. In hollows with more convergence, landslide occurrence {{is limited by the}} supply of deposits (supply limited regime) or rainfall events (event limited regime) while hollows with low convergence degree are unconditionally stable regardless of the soil thickness or rainfall intensity. Overall, our results show that in addition to the effect of slope angle, plan shape (convergence degree) also controls the subsurface flow and this process affects the probability distribution of landslide occurrence in different hollows. Finally, we conclude that incorporating a more realistic description of hollow hydrology (instead of the KW model) in landslide probability models is necessary, especially for hollows with high convergence degree which are more susceptible to landsliding...|$|E
40|$|At {{the rear}} of the vehicle an end {{acoustic}} silencer is attached to the exhaust system. This is primarily to reduce noise emissions for the benefit of passengers and bystanders. Due to the location of the end acoustic silencer conventional thermal protection methods (heat shields) through experimental means can not only be difficult to incorporate but also can be an inefficient and costly experience. Hence simulation methods may improve the development process by introducing methods of optimization in early phase vehicle design. A previous publication (Part 1) described a methodology of improving the surface temperatures prediction of general exhaust configurations. It was found in this initial study that simulation results for silencer configurations exhibited significant discrepancies in comparison to experimental data. This was mainly due to the inability to represent complex fluid flows through the components of the silencer, which was greatly simplified in the simulation models and software utilised. The following investigation addresses the errors noted in the previous publication and considers a further improvement to the end acoustic silencer models. The investigation covers the combination of alternative heat transfer models and sophisticated geometrical modeling. It was found that pipe friction must be considered to calculate the pressure losses within the silencer systems. The bending influence on internal flow conditions and resulting heat transfer effects were considered through the utilization of convective augmentation factors. The perforation through the internal pipe walls were taken into account by increasing the frictional factors within the Nusselt number models. Finally the absorption material within the chambers of the silencer system was modeled utilizing a multi-layer arrangement within the simulation software. Two vehicle models were considered, the first being a 4 cylinder engine and the second a 6 cylinder engine. Both models simulated two operating points, 35 km/h hill climb and 250 km/h. The simulation was then validated through experimental climatic wind tunnel tests, where temperature probes were attached to highly thermal sensitive regions. Utilizing the proposed methodology, the simulation yielded results that featured strong correlations to experimental data. Within the majority of probed locations a temperature difference of less than 50 K was achieved. Future work consists of improving the areas of discrepancy, particularly surrounding chambers of a <b>hollow</b> <b>type...</b>|$|E
