5|$|Biographies {{published}} {{after his}} death were typically heavy on eulogy. Theodore Martin's five-volume magnum opus was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> and exhaustive account. Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-twentieth-century biographers such as Hector Bolitho and Roger Fulford, who (unlike Strachey) had access to Victoria's journal and letters. Popular myths about Prince Albert—such as the claim that he introduced Christmas trees to Britain—are dismissed by scholars. Recent biographers, such as Stanley Weintraub, portray Albert as a figure in a tragic romance, who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for a lifetime. In the 2009 movie The Young Victoria, Albert, played by Rupert Friend, is made into a heroic character; in the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet—something {{that did not happen}} in real life.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} anthological {{record of}} Namdev's works {{occurs in the}} Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh scriptures compiled in 1604, although Novetzke notes that while the manuscript records of Namdev mostly date from the 17th and 18th centuries, there exists a manuscript from 1581 that presents a rarely recounted variant version of Namdev's Tirthavli, a Marathi-language autobiographical piece. It is evident that the Guru Granth record <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> rendition of what Namdev wrote: the oral tradition probably accounts significantly for the changes and additions that {{appear to have been}} made by that time. The numerous subsequently produced manuscripts also show variant texts and additions that are attributed to him. Of around 2500 abhangs that were credited to him and written in the Marathi language, perhaps only 600 - 700 are authentic. The surviving manuscripts are geographically dispersed and of uncertain provenance.|$|E

500|$|Smederevo Fortress {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the most striking and monumental pieces of architecture surviving from medieval Serbia", and [...] "the witness of Serbian creative force."

The fortress and surrounding area have accumulated evidence of the civilizations that developed throughout history, mainly between the 15th and 20thcenturies, providing a direct testimony for the progress of the medieval Serbian state and corresponding Orthodox Church.|$|E

[...] In naming Schulz to his All-America team, Walter Camp said: [...] "He is well over six feet in height, yet a fast, powerful man who gets well over the field and makes more tackles in a game than any other man on his team. [...] In addition he <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> passer and feeds the ball well to his backs either for kicks or runs".|$|E

[...] The song has been notated in 4/4 time with one bar in 2/4 at a slow rock (70–72 beats per minute) tempo and is built on a chord progression without a bridge section: ...|$|E

500|$|Joseph Dalton Hooker {{described}} Nepenthes rajah in 1859, naming it {{in honour of}} Sir James Brooke, {{the first}} White Rajah of Sarawak. [...] In the past, the Latin name was written as Nepenthes Rajah, since it derives from a proper noun. However, this capitalisation is considered incorrect today. 'Rajah Brooke's Pitcher Plant' <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate,</b> but seldom-used common name. N. rajah is also sometimes called the 'Giant Malaysian Pitcher Plant' or simply 'Giant Pitcher Plant', although the binomial name remains {{by far the most}} popular way of referring to this species. The specific epithet rajah means [...] "King" [...] in Malay and this, coupled with the impressive size of its pitchers, has meant that N. rajah {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "King of Nepenthes".|$|E
500|$|Of Sicily's own form of Baroque, post 1693, it {{has been}} said, [...] "The {{buildings}} conceived {{in the wake of}} this disaster expressed a light-hearted freedom of decoration whose incongruous gaiety was intended, perhaps, to assuage the horror". While this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> description of a style which is almost a celebration of joie de vivre in stone, it is unlikely to be the reason for the choice. As with all architectural styles, the selection of style would have directly linked to current fashion. Versailles had been completed in 1688 in a far sterner Baroque style; Louis XIV's new palace was immediately emulated across Europe by any aristocrat or sovereign in Europe aspiring to wealth, taste, or power. Thus it was the obvious choice for the [...] "homeless rich" [...] of Sicily, of whom there were hundreds. The excesses of the Baroque-style palazzi and country villas to be constructed in Sicily, however, were soon to make Versailles seem a model of restraint.|$|E
500|$|Whether or {{not such}} {{language}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> {{reflection of the}} vernacular of blacks in Mississippi at the time, the effect of its usage has offended some critics, who see it as perpetuating racial stereotypes. The character Queenie (who sings the above verses) in the original production was played not by an African American but by the Italian-American actress Tess Gardella in blackface (Gardella was {{perhaps best known for}} portraying Aunt Jemima in blackface). Attempts by non-black writers to imitate black language stereotypically in songs like [...] "Ol' Man River" [...] was alleged to be offensive, a claim that was repeated eight years later by critics of Porgy and Bess. But such critics sometimes acknowledged that Hammerstein's intentions were noble, since [...] "Ol' Man River"' was the song in which he first found his lyrical voice, compressing the suffering, resignation, and anger of an entire race into 24 taut lines and doing it so naturally that it's no wonder folks assume the song's a Negro spiritual." ...|$|E
