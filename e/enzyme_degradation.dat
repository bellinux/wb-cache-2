This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions.

50|$|This is {{the process}} of disguising {{medically}} active molecules with lipophilic molecules that allow it to better sneak through the blood-brain barrier. Drugs can be disguised using more lipophillic elements or structures. This form of the drug will be inactive because of the lipophilic molecules but then would be activated, by either <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> or some other mechanism for removal of the lipophilic disguise to release the drug into its active form. There are still some major drawbacks to these pro-drugs. The first of which is that the pro-drug may be able to pass through the barrier and then also re-pass through the barrier without ever releasing the drug in its active form. The second is the sheer size of these types of molecules makes it still difficult to pass through the blood-brain barrier.|$|E
5000|$|Initial rate experiments. When {{an enzyme}} {{is mixed with}} a large excess of the substrate, the enzyme-substrate {{intermediate}} builds up in a fast initial transient. Then the reaction achieves a steady-state kinetics in which enzyme substrate intermediates remains approximately constant over time and the reaction rate changes relatively slowly. Rates are measured {{for a short period}} after the attainment of the quasi-steady state, typically by monitoring the accumulation of product with time. Because the measurements are carried out for a very short period and because of the large excess of substrate, the approximation that the amount of free substrate is approximately equal to the amount of the initial substrate can be made. The initial rate experiment is the simplest to perform and analyze, being relatively free from complications such as back-reaction and <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation.</b> It is therefore by far the most commonly used type of experiment in enzyme kinetics.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the protection of NPs from the degradation of shRNA, DNase I protection test and serum protection test were performed in vitro. The results showed that after the naked shRNA was digested by DNaseI for 1  h or incubated with fetal bovine serum for 8  h, the band disappeared suggesting that the naked shRNA was degraded thoroughly. In contrast, after digestion, the band of shRNA loaded in NPs still remained, implying that nucleic acid in NPs was not degraded and retained the integrate structure. It suggested that shRNA was efficiently protected from the <b>enzyme’s</b> <b>degradation</b> by encapsulation in NPs.|$|R

50|$|His {{finding of}} greatly {{different}} levels of catalase activity in certain substrains of mice, which were under genetic control, provided an excellent model for pursuing fundamental research in biochemical genetics in the mammalian system. The analyses of the first, the second the backcross generations between high-enzyme and low-enzyme mouse substrains showed that the difference was due to a single autosomal gene pair with low dominant to high. Using specific metabolic inhibitors, it was subsequently found that the genetic {{difference between the two}} substrains lies primarily in the markedly increased rate of the enzyme destruction in the liver of one of the substrains. This was a unique finding since in all normal rats and mice studied previously the rates of enzyme destruction seemed to be almost constant. Although transient alteration in the rate of <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> has been observed under certain physiological conditions with other enzyme systems, the observation on catalase iwas {{believed to be the first}} demonstration of such regulatory mechanism under genetic control.|$|E
50|$|Copper {{nanoparticles}} {{with great}} catalytic {{activities can be}} applied to biosensors and electrochemical sensors. Redox reactions utilized in those sensors are generally irreversible and also require high overpotentials (more energy) to run. In fact, the nanoparticles have the ability to make the redox reactions reversible and to lower the overpotentials when applied to the sensors. One of the examples is a glucose sensor. With the use of copper nanoparticles, the sensor does not require any enzyme and therefore has no need to deal with <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> and denaturation. As described in Figure 3, depending on the level of glucose, the nanoparticles in the sensor diffract the incident light at a different angle. Consequently, the resulting diffracted light gives a different color based on the level of glucose. In fact, the nanoparticles enable the sensor to be more stable at high temperatures and varying pH, and more resistant to toxic chemicals. Moreover, using nanoparticles, native amino acids can be detected. A copper nanoparticle-plated screen-printed carbon electrode functions as a stable and effective sensing system for all 20 amino acid detection.|$|E
40|$|Mouse {{resident}} peritoneal macrophages display sufficient 5 '- nucleotidase {{activity to}} hydrolyze 58 nm AMP/min per cell protein. This activity increases approximately 163 nm AMP/min per mg after 72 h in culture. The enzyme is renewed in unstimulated cells with a half-time of 13. 9 h. The activity is not reduced by treatment of intact cells {{with a variety}} of proteolytic enzymes, including trypsin, pronase, urokinase, and plasmin. Cells obtained from an inflammatory exudate have diminished or absent levels of enzyme activity. Endotoxin-elicited cells display enzyme activitiy of 20. 9 nm AMP/min per mg, while thioglycollate-stimulated macrophages have no detectable activity. The reduced level of activity in endotoxin-stimulated cells is due to their elevated rate of <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation,</b> with a half-time of 6. 9 h. Their rate of enzyme synthesis is essentially normal. No evidence for latent enzyme activity could be obtained in thioglycollate-stimulated cells, nor do these cells produce any inhibition of normal cell enzyme activity. Serum deprivation reduces the enzyme activity of resident cells to about 45 % of control activity. These conditions do not significantly affect the rate of enzyme synthesis, but again are explainable by an increase in the rate of <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation.</b> Pinocytic rate is elevated in endotoxin-stimulated cells which show a more rapid rate of <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> than unstimulated cells do. However, in serum-free conditions, the rate of <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> is doubled with no change in the pinocytic rate of the cells...|$|E

Fractionation of cell-free extracts, by high-speed zonal centrifugation, of methanol-grown C. boidinii showed non-sedimentable and sedimentable proteolytic activities. Naturally occurring inhibitors of vacuolar proteinases were non-sedimentable. Fractionation of extracts prepared from methanol-grown cells which had been adapted to ethanol utilization for 5 h revealed significant changes in the sedimentability and distribution of proteolytic and acid phosphatase activities. These results suggest the possible involvement of a vacuolar process during alcohol oxidase degradation...|$|R

A model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) to describe the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide by linking the ifosfamide plasma concentrations to the extent of the autoinduction. The proposed model revealed the effect of autoinduction on the disposition of ifosfamide. The initial clearance, volume of distribution, rate constant for <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation,</b> induction half-life of the enzyme and the ifosfamide concentration at 50 % of the maximum inhibition of <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> were estimated at 2. 94 +/- 0. 27 l h- 1, 43. 5 +/- 2. 9 l, 0. 0546 +/- 0. 0078 h- 1, 12. 7 h and 30. 7 +/- 4. 8 microM, respectively. Interindividual variabilities of initial clearance, volume of distribution, rate constant for <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> were 24. 5, 23. 4 and 22. 7 %, respectively. Proportional and additive variability not explained by the model were 13. 6 % and 0. 0763 microM, respectively. The absence of a lag time for the autoinduction of ifosfamide metabolism could be the result of an immediate inhibition of the enzymatic degradation of CYP 3 A 4 by ifosfamide. By application of the autoinduction model individual pharmacokinetic profiles of patients were described with adequate precision.

40|$|Cellulose acetate was {{characterized}} by using enzyme in both digestion and chemical derivation and acetolysis. The fragments were normalised and compared on an anhydroglucose scale, using mass spectrometry to identify the different sized fragments.

The macroscopic effect of this variation in the degree of acetylation will be a modification of the structural properties of the polymer chains. It was found that through comparison with enzyme-based degradation, an estimation of the acetylation topography of the cellulose acetate fraction could be made. <b>Enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> produced a number of oligosaccharides of more than 10 glucose units, presumably resistant to <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> because they contained acetate groups. Chemical hydrolysis gave a random ladder of short sequences of mainly 3 - 4 glucose units some of which had a high methyl ether content, that were analysed by mass and converted to an anhydroglucose mass scale.

40|$|Two almost-identical {{strains of}} Eubacterium aerofaciens {{isolated}} from the normal human gut flora were used. The cell wall (CW) of one strain with a peptidoglycan (PG) type A 4 α induces chronic arthritis in the rat after a single intraperitoneal injection, whereas CW of the other with PG type A 4 β induces only a transient acute arthritis. The CW of the arthritogenic E. aerofaciens was a twofold-more-potent stimulator of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) than the nonarthritogenic CW. After degradation with mutanolysin, {{the capacity of the}} arthritogenic PG to stimulate production of TNF-α and MCP- 1 was significantly increased, whereas that of the nonarthritogenic PG was significantly decreased. In other words, after <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> the arthritogenic PG had a four- to fivefold-stronger stimulatory capacity than that of the enzyme-treated nonarthritogenic PG. These findings indicate that the arthritogenicity of CW or a PG is not dependent on the enzyme resistance alone but also on how the PG fragments released by <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{degradation}} of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBP carboxylase; E C 4. 1. 1. 39). Its turnover seems to be related with the leaf ontogeny. Thus, synthesis is most prominent early in leaf development and a rapid degradation ensues during senescence. Between the initial and final stages of leaf development, RuBP carboxylase shows a high stability, being considered by some authors, as a leaf storage protein. However, these patterns of turnover were not observed in maize, a C_ 4 plant, when a more accurate method for the determination of the rates of <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> was used. On the other hand, experiments recently performed, with Lemna minor, a C_ 3 plant, grown under nitrogen starvation conditions, showed that the enzyme was not preferentially degraded. This observation suggested that the concept of storage protein may not be applicable to Lemna RuBP carboxylase. One purpose of the present work was to clarify the discrepancies observed in the reported patterns of in vivo RuBP carboxylase degradation in C_ 3 (wheat) and C_ 4 (maize and sorghum) plants. The rates of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> were compared with those obtained for glycolate oxidase. Furthermore, our aim was also to investigate if RuBP carboxylase functions as a leaf storage protein. For this purpose, the rates of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>degradation</b> were studied in plants grown under stress conditions induced by nitrogen or sulfur starvation. For acquiring further information about that function of the RuBP carboxylase, we have studied the mobilization of sulfur in leaves and the concentration of the enzyme in plants grown under an excess of nitrogen or sulfur.
