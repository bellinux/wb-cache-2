5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs and a powerful build. Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more terrestrial of the two, since Archaeolemur may <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> more time foraging and sleeping in the trees. Both genera also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for walking on the ground.|$|E
5|$|During the season, the Rangers were {{interested}} in acquiring Vancouver Canucks forward Pavel Bure. It was reported that Canucks general manager Brian Burke had requested Malhotra {{to be involved in}} a trade that would <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> him along with Niklas Sundstrom, Dan Cloutier and the Rangers' first-round pick in the 1999 draft in exchange for Bure. However, Rangers general manager Neil Smith refused to include Malhotra and the deal never materialized.|$|E

5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In Gonzales, Martin {{turned the}} letter over to Launcelot Smithers. When the Mexican army arrived in Béxar, Smithers had {{immediately}} {{set out for}} Gonzales.

Smithers added his own message under Martin's, encouraging men to gather in Gonzales {{to go to the}} relief of the Texians at the Alamo.|$|E

5|$|The 6th century {{marked the}} rebirth of Roman naval power. In 508, as {{antagonism}} with the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Theodoric flared up, the Emperor Anastasius I (491–518) is reported to <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> a fleet of 100 warships to raid the coasts of Italy. In 513, the general Vitalian revolted against Anastasius. The rebels assembled a fleet of 200 ships which, despite some initial successes, were destroyed by admiral Marinus, who employed a sulphur-based incendiary substance to defeat them.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Line was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route. The plan would <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> Blue Line trains to Huntington, with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the Blue Line operated to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro's special Independence Day service pattern.|$|E
5|$|After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan {{fell to the}} Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hernán Cortés {{to declare}} their {{allegiance}} to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K'iche' Maya of Q'umarkaj may also <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> a delegation. In 1522 Cortés sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new delegations from Iximche and Q'umarkaj at Tuxpán; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the King of Spain. But Cortés' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were harassing Spain's allies in the region. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.|$|E

5|$|Between its {{beginning}} and the Beijing Olympics, the United States Virgin Islands have participated in fifteen Olympics games, including five Winter Olympics. Of the ten Summer Olympic games, the Virgin Islands <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> a delegation for every game since the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The first women in the team participated at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, and the delegation has included women ever since, peaking at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The size of its summer Olympic team was largest between 1972 (16 athletes) and 1992 (25 athletes), and was at its all-time largest in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles when 29 athletes competed for the country. After 1996, the team carried 15 athletes or less.|$|E
5|$|Cuba was {{of special}} {{importance}} to Southern Democrats, who believed their {{economic and political}} interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union. The existence of slavery in Cuba, the island's plantation economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders, whose way of life was under fire from Northern abolitionists. Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the population-based House of Representatives, Southern politicians sought to maintain the fragile {{balance of power in}} the Senate, where each state received equal representation. As slavery-free Western states were admitted, Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state. If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state, the island would <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> two senators and up to nine representatives to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord were {{paired with}} fellow Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in the quarter–finals, and the tie {{came down to}} a penalty shootout, which Feyenoord won 5–4. The first leg was drawn 1–1 with Feyenoord taking the lead in first half injury time through Pierre van Hooijdonk. PSV {{equalised}} two minutes after the restart when Mateja Kežman scored on 47 minutes. The second leg was again drawn 1–1, with PSV taking the lead on 75 minutes, when Mark van Bommel scored from outside the penalty area. That looked to <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> PSV into the semi-finals, but with seconds remaining, Van Hooijdonk scored from Johan Elmander's cross to send the tie into extra-time. PSV were reduced to ten men in extra time when Van Bommel was sent off for a second bookable offence but they still managed to hold out for the extra 30 minutes to force a penalty shootout. All penalties were converted until Giorgi Gakhokidze stepped up, and saw his penalty saved. Feyenoord converted their subsequent penalties, with Van Hooijdonk putting away the vital fifth penalty.|$|E

5|$|From 14 December 1942 to 28 January 1943, Devers went on an {{inspection}} {{tour of the}} battlefields in North Africa, taking with him Brigadier Generals Edward H. Brooks and Williston B. Palmer from the Armored Force, and Gladeon M. Barnes from the Ordnance Department. He spoke with key British generals including Harold Alexander, Bernard Montgomery and Richard McCreery, and American commanders including Eisenhower, Patton, Thomas B. Larkin and Orlando Ward. Eisenhower was defensive, suspicious that Marshall may <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> Devers to replace him, and nervous when Devers had critical comments about {{the handling of the}} 1st Armored Division. Devers and his party received a great deal of feedback, both positive and negative about American equipment. Devers noted that the M4 Sherman was superior to the M3 Lee that the 1st Armored Division was equipped with, but urged the development of the more powerful 76mm gun.|$|E
5|$|Nauru {{earned a}} {{qualification}} place in weightlifting in the International Weightlifting Federation's continental Olympic qualification event—Oceania and South Pacific Olympic Weightlifting Championships—held in Auckland, New Zealand from March 27 to 30, 2008. At the event only those National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of Oceania {{which had not}} gained berths for 2008 Olympics in the 2006 and 2007 World Weightlifting Championships got chance to win qualification places. Itte Detenamo was selected over Yukio Peter to fill the earned quota. Nauru could <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> participants in swimming and athletics also, but chose not to as there was no national governing body of swimming and the nation lacked basic infrastructure and competitive athletes in order to complete in athletics.|$|E
5|$|Peter Emmerson, a {{historian}} and {{supporter of the}} desertion theory, asks why Wilson would <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> three of his men away at such a precarious moment. JP Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises {{that it would not}} be out of the ordinary for the major to do so again. In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him. The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to go too. Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding.|$|E
