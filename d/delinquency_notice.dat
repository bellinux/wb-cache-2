However, these corrections do not get carried back to the computer files. Therefore, the SOI Division has had to devise its own correction strategies. We feel that, over the past several years, SOIâ€™s IRP-cleaning process has improved significantly. As a result, we are more comfortable with publishing data from these documents.
