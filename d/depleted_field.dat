500|$|The Giro {{began in}} Amsterdam with an {{individual}} time trial. Favorites for the stage included two British riders, [...] captain Bradley Wiggins and ' David Millar. Several riders in the Giro peloton considered Wiggins the prohibitive favorite. Wiggins won the stage, securing the first pink jersey. A major surprise on the stage was Grand Tour rookie Brent Bookwalter from [...] coming in second, just 2 seconds off Wiggins' winning time. Millar was seventh, 6 seconds back. This {{set the stage for}} a turbulent opening to the Giro, as both of the road race stages in the Netherlands featured several crashes. The courses for the road stages in the Netherlands were noted to have a lot of street furniture on them, which combined with the riders' nerves on the first day of a three-week Grand Tour as well as crosswinds from the North Sea to make the first mass-start stages very perilous. Tyler Farrar, Carlos Sastre, Christian Vande Velde, Greg Henderson, Wiggins, Alessandro Petacchi, Domenico Pozzovivo, Marzio Bruseghin, Filippo Pozzato, and Gilberto Simoni all fell from their bikes at some point while the Giro was in the Netherlands. There were also many other crashes that took down so many riders it was difficult to keep track of exactly who was effected. Crashing and, consequently, falling away from the leading group on the road, meant different things for different riders. For sprinters like Farrar and Petacchi, crashing meant they were unlikely to be able to contest the finishes for stage wins, while overall contenders like Wiggins and Sastre lost time in the general classification. For the second year in a row, Vandevelde suffered a broken collarbone as a result of his crash, consequently abandoning the race. Despite crashing during stage 2, Farrar got up and was able to win the stage from a <b>depleted</b> <b>field</b> sprint. The state of the roads in the Netherlands and the sheer quantity of crashes that took place there incurred much criticism and questions over whether they should be included in a Grand Tour. Cadel Evans and Alexander Vinokourov both took the pink jersey while the Giro was in the Netherlands. Vinokourov held it prior to the transfer to Italy, with six riders from three teams within 10 seconds of him, meaning the pink jersey still remained very much in flux.|$|E

40|$|Drilling into mature, <b>depleted</b> <b>fields</b> {{is often}} {{difficult}} because of tight pressure margins. Increasing the pressure control will enable wells that previously were considered undrillable, to be drilled. Enabling drilling and increased oil recovery from <b>depleted</b> <b>fields</b> would most likely lead to {{a substantial increase in}} profit margains. A better pressure control will also increase the safety of the drilling crew, because the risk of unwanted situations such as a kick or a blow-out is decreased, also reducing the risk of unwanted environmental influence, e. g. oil spill. To compensate for the lack of a continuous measurement of the bottomhole pressure during drilling operations, an adpative observer of the bottomhole pressure is implemented. The observer implemented is tested, and shows promising results in estimating both the bottomhole pressure and the friction coefficient in the well during a pipe connection procedure. To control the pressure in the well, a low-order nonlinear model predicitve controller is developed, and it has been tested to perform well during the pipe connection procedure, where it maintains the pressure within the predefined boundaries. In this thesis both the obsever and the controller will be tested against an artificial well; simulated by a commercial software. </p...|$|R
40|$|In China, {{south of}} the Yangtze River, there are {{a large number of}} carbon sources, while the Sichuan Basin is the largest {{sedimentary}} basin; it makes sense to select the targets for CO 2 geological storage (CGUS) early demonstration. For CO 2 enhanced oil and gas, coal bed methane recovery (CO 2 -EOR, EGR, and ECBM), or storage in these <b>depleted</b> <b>fields,</b> the existing oil, gas fields, or coal seams could be the target areas in the mesoscale. This paper proposed a methodology of GIS superimposed multisource information assessment of geological suitability for CO 2 enhanced water recovery (CO 2 -EWR) or only storage in deep saline aquifers. The potential per unit area of deep saline aquifers CO 2 storage in Central Sichuan is generally greater than 50 × 104 [*]t/km 2 at P 50 probability level, with Xujiahe group being the main reservoir.

40|$|AbstractThe {{first stage}} of the CO 2 CRC Otway Project, located in {{south-eastern}} Australia, has stored 65, 445 tonnes of CO 2 -rich gas in the <b>depleted</b> Naylor Gas <b>Field.</b> Comparisons have been made between simulations using the non-isothermal multi-phase flow simulator TOUGH 2 /EOS 7 C and the accumulated field data up to and beyond the end of injection.

When fitting to the downhole pressure only, the observed arrival time was in the range of uncertainty of the model predictions. The use of multiple geostatistical realisations of heterogeneity demonstrates the importance of capturing the range of uncertainty in the geology and the consequent scatter in forward predictions.

40|$|The {{geological}} {{storage of}} carbon dioxide is a promising method to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and to meet demanding climate targets. It is also a key enabler for the upstream industry when large amounts of CO 2 are produced in hydrocarbon production operations and a disposal concept is required. The most promising geological reservoirs for CO 2 storage are <b>depleted</b> hydrocarbon <b>fields</b> and deep saline aquifers. While <b>depleted</b> <b>fields</b> are usually well characterized and have proven seals, saline aquifers are generally more abundant, with a higher total storage capacity. The present habilitation treatise addresses key aspects of CO 2 injection and plume migration in saline aquifers, with the presented results being partly applicable to storage in <b>depleted</b> hydrocarbon <b>fields.</b> CO 2 storage research is focused on storage capacity and storage safety. Several threats have been identified concerning the injection process, e. g. firstly, the migration of the CO 2 plume potentially leaving the characterized zone of the reservoir to a potential leakage zone and, secondly, the long-term fate of the CO 2 in the reservoir – how safe is CO 2 storage? The involved time scales range from immediately after injection up to several decades for the primary plume migration. The ultimate trapping processes might take place over centuries and even millennia. This document presents results of experimental research and numerical modeling addressing the early phase of geological storage, i. e., aspects of injectivity, plume migration and early trapping. The document is meant to provide guidance for further experimental investigations, including data interpretation by numerical modeling. We further aim to identify displacement mechanisms and their effects on plume migration, and to provide simple rules for an upfront investigation {{on the basis of}} a limited set of data and before extensive reservoir modeling is performed...|$|R

Overall, we found that the ratings of CCS were neutral on average. However, if the CO 2 is produced by a biomass power plant or industry, CCS is rated more positively than in a scenario with a coal-fired power plant. The specifications of transport and storage interacted with each other such that scenarios including EGR or a <b>depleted</b> gas <b>field</b> without mentioning a pipeline were evaluated better than storing it in a saline aquifer or a <b>depleted</b> gas <b>field</b> and mentioning a pipeline as means of transport.
