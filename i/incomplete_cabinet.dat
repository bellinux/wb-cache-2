5000|$|Certain news organizations, such as Politico and Newsweek, called Trump's <b>incomplete</b> <b>cabinet</b> a [...] "{{conservative}} dream team" [...] or [...] "the {{most conservative}} cabinet United States history." [...] On the other hand, The Wall Street Journal stated that [...] "it's {{nearly impossible to}} identify a clear ideological bent in the incoming president's" [...] cabinet nominations.
