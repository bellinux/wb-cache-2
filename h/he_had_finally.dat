5|$|Cobain and Novoselic {{met while}} {{attending}} Aberdeen High, although they never connected, according to Cobain. The pair eventually became friends while frequenting the practice {{space of the}} Melvins. Cobain wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond {{for a long period}} of time. In persuading Novoselic to form a band, Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project Fecal Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. The pair recruited Bob McFadden on drums, but after a month the project fell apart. In early 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard. The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape but started writing new material soon after forming.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E

Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.|$|E

He carried on until he reached 144, before holing out to Gillespie off MacGill. Then the score read: 329/6. Patel and Agarkar carried on until no more play was possible due to bad light.|$|E
25|$|It was in 1852 that Wagner {{finally settled}} upon the name Der Ring des Nibelungen for the {{complete}} cycle. Other titles that were considered and rejected included: Das Gold des Nibelungen (The Gold of the Nibelung), which appeared on the title page of the verse draft of Die Walküre; and Der Reif des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung), which was mentioned {{in a letter to}} August Röckel, dated 12 September 1852. On 14 October 1852, however, Wagner informed Theodor Uhlig that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> decided that the title of the entire cycle would be Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung, or The Nibelung's Ring).|$|E
25|$|Fergus guides Marot to {{the most}} {{promising}} fossil-bearing site, {{near the town of}} Kubyab {{on the banks of the}} upper Zora River in the Dashtate of Chilihagh. There they find a rival, Marot’s competitor Warren Foltz, who is fanatically attached to a rival theory and is not averse to destroying contrary evidence. Moreover, Foltz is being assisted by xenologist Alicia Dyckman, to whom Fergus had formerly been wed in a stormy marriage culminating in divorce. The cause was Alicia’s contentious and overbearing personality; convinced she always knew best, she had interfered with Fergus’s tours to the point that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> barred her from participating.|$|E

25|$|This bough {{forms an}} {{important}} plot {{detail of the}} story Aldarion and Erendis. According to the narrative, King Tar-Meneldur at one point refused to bless his son Aldarion's sailing to Middle-earth and forbade his kin to set oiolairë upon the ship; and Erendis won Aldarion's love by doing this instead. She set it several times later, though her love for Aldarion gradually lessened; but after a bough became frozen during one journey, Erendis disapproved completely of Aldarion's journeys. Another woman used to bless his ships for some time, until Aldarion forsook the tradition and instead placed upon the prow an image of an eagle presented to him by Círdan; by that time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> breached with Erendis.|$|E
25|$|Kaykhusraw II (1237–1246) {{began his}} reign by {{capturing}} the region around Diyarbakır, but in 1239 {{he had to}} face an uprising led by a popular preacher named Baba Ishak. After three years, when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> quelled the revolt, the Crimean foothold was lost and {{the state and the}} sultanate's army had weakened. It is in these conditions that he had to face a far more dangerous threat, that of the expanding Mongols. The forces of the Mongol Empire took Erzurum in 1242 and in 1243, the sultan was crushed by Baiju in the Battle of Köse Dağ (a mountain between the cities of Sivas and Erzincan), and the Seljuq Turks were forced to swear allegiance to the Mongols and became their vassals. The sultan himself had fled to Antalya after the 1243 battle, where he died in 1246, his death starting a period of tripartite, and then dual, rule that lasted until 1260.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> conquered Siam, {{he still}} needed {{to deal with the}} middle Tai country. King Mekuti of Lan Na had allied himself with his old rival Setthathirath of Lan Xang. On 23 October 1564, Bayinnaung himself led five massive armies (64,000 men, 3600 horses, 330 elephants) and began a two-pronged {{invasion}} of Lan Na. The levies hailed from all over the empire, including Siam whose troops were led by Ramesuan, the former crown prince of Siam. The massive show of force worked. When four southern armies showed up at Lamphun, 20km south of Chiang Mai, on 25 November 1564, the commanders leading Chiang Mai's defenses simply fled the city. Mekuti now submitted, asking for forgiveness. Bayinnaung spared the broken king's life, and sent him to Pegu. The Burmese king then stayed in Lan Na for the next four months, administering the country. He appointed Queen Visuddhadevi, as the vassal ruler of Lan Na before leaving Chiang Mai on 10 April 1565 to deal with a serious rebellion in Pegu.|$|E

25|$|Takahashi {{created the}} {{majority}} of the main scenario himself. Takahashi worked on the script alongside Yuichiro Takeda, a writer who had previously worked on Xenoblade Chronicles; and Kazuho Hyodo, who had written episodes for multiple Gundam series. The story of Xenoblade Chronicle X was substantially larger than Xenoblade Chronicles, with Takahashi and Takeda feeling that they could not handle the entire scenario themselves. On advice from Takeda, he brought in Hyodo. Due to Hyodo's extensive involvement in science fiction stories, Takahashi felt confident leaving much of the work to him. The choice of a science fiction setting was influenced by Takahashi's wish to do something different from the fantasy setting of Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenoblade Chronicles X was the first time Hyodo had worked on a video game. One of the main goals for Takahashi was having humans and the robot Skells coexisting and functioning in the world. Due to the scale and experimental nature of the game, the Monolith Soft team made an effort {{to move away from the}} philosophical storylines their company had become known for with previous titles. Speaking about his goals for the game, Takahashi felt that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> created what he had wanted to since first founding Monolith Soft in 1999.|$|E

[...] Bertin's final pose reverses the usual {{relationship between the two}} men. The artist becomes the cool, detached observer; Bertin, usually calm and reasoned, is now restless and impatient, mirroring Ingres' irritation at spending time on portraiture.|$|E
500|$|The Canucks spent a {{full year}} {{attempting}} to trade Luongo and his contract before conceding that no team was willing to meet their demands. [...] Instead they agreed to trade Schneider to the New Jersey Devils. [...] The deal, completed on June 30 at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, saw the ninth overall selection (Bo Horvat) sent to Vancouver. Schneider described the trade as [...] "shocking", adding that after several seasons of expecting to be traded, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finally</b> begun to believe he would stay in Vancouver. He played his first game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, a 3-0 loss.|$|E

50|$|In the 1951 film, {{instead of}} singing it to Kim {{just before he}} leaves, Ravenal sings it to her when he meets {{her for the first}} time after being away for several years - the exact reverse of the {{situation}} in the original show and the 1936 film version. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>finally</b> returned and now asks her to pretend that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> never been away.|$|R
