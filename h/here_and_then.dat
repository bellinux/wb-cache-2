5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E
5|$|Some teleosts are migratory; certain {{freshwater}} species move within river {{systems on}} an annual basis; other species are anadromous, spending their lives at sea and moving inland to spawn, salmon and striped bass being examples. Others, exemplified by the eel, are catadromous, doing the reverse. The fresh water European eel migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. The adults spawn <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> die, but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe. By the time they arrive, they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers, overcoming obstacles in their path to reach the streams and ponds where they spend their adult lives.|$|E
2500|$|Lowe {{was widely}} admired by his peers for excelling {{in every aspect}} of mountaineering, from rock- and ice-climbing to ski descents. Dave Hahn once remarked, [...] "There's Alex Lowe up <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> there's the rest of us down here. The guy's just really that much better than {{everybody}} else." [...] and Conrad Anker said, [...] "We're all at this one level, and then there's Alex." [...] Lowe himself said [...] "The best climber in the world is the one having the most fun!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{he is in}} {{a better}} place," [...] {{continued}} Hannah: [...] "we shouldn't wish him <b>here</b> again. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had." ...|$|R
5000|$|Judd's {{success in}} The Day the Earth Caught Fire saw Columbia Pictures sign {{him to a}} long term contract. According to Val Guest though [...] "he was such {{a pain in the}} ass to everybody. He had an {{enormous}} opinion of himself and he was his own worst enemy. Columbia just loaned him out <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there <b>and</b> <b>then</b> let him go." ...|$|R
2500|$|... (A {{few weeks}} before his death, after having made Toscanini listen to the opera, Puccini exclaimed: [...] "If I don't succeed in {{finishing}} it, at this point someone {{will come to the}} footlights and will say: 'The author composed until <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he died.'" [...] Arturo Toscanini related Puccini's words with great emotion, and, with the swift agreement of Puccini's family and the publishers, decided that the evening of the first performance, the opera would appear as the author left it, with the anguish of being unable to finish).|$|E
2500|$|Platforms 3, 3A and 6 {{are used}} by the London Underground Central line, which rise from their tunnels onto the overground <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{immediately}} descend back underground upon departure from Stratford. Platforms 3 and 6 are island platforms providing cross-platform interchange with the TfL Rail [...] "Shenfield Metro" [...] and weekend c2c services operating from platforms 5 and 8 respectively, while platform 3A has a direct step-free connection at mezzanine level, facilitating easier interchange with Jubilee line trains on platforms 13 to 15 and DLR trains on platforms 4A and 4B. Westbound Central line trains travelling towards central London open doors on both sides so that passengers can alight and board trains from either side, reducing dwell times and peak-hour congestion in the passageways.|$|E
2500|$|The {{establishment}} of the Zocalo as the main market square meant that commercial development in Mexico would begin <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> spread outward {{to the rest of}} the territory. This also meant that the square would be a crowded, chaotic mass of stalls, with various attempts to clear it over the colonial period, with little long term success. This is because despite all the attempts by civil and religious authorities to control the markets, the indigenous market never disappeared. By the end of the 16th century, a number of indigenous markets were permitted to set up, so that these people could sell their own products, especially in areas then far outside Mexico City such as Tacubaya. [...] Eventually, they began to sell in the main plaza in Mexico City, weekly at first, then daily.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{therefore}} it wouldn't {{do for you}} to live here; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> papa is living <b>here</b> himself. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> the permission never has been given. I suppose Frank did not go there at first without the Duke knowing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, dear, it {{is still}} dark. Sleep again for a while, and I will sleep too. I think Grace will be <b>here</b> to-night, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{there will be no}} room for me here." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{closed the}} prosecutor's case; and there {{followed}} a pause, {{during which the}} Bench consulted together, and the rector eyed the congregation, nodding to one <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there. <b>Then</b> the Chairman, turning to him, said: ...|$|R
2500|$|Polypropylene {{is liable}} to chain {{degradation}} from exposure to heat and UV radiation such as that present in sunlight. Oxidation usually occurs at the tertiary carbon atom present in every repeat unit. A free radical is formed <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> reacts further with oxygen, followed by chain scission to yield aldehydes and carboxylic acids. In external applications, it shows up as a network of fine cracks and crazes that become deeper and more severe with time of exposure. For external applications, UV-absorbing additives must be used. Carbon black also provides some protection from UV attack. The polymer can also be oxidized at high temperatures, a common problem during molding operations. Anti-oxidants are normally added to prevent polymer degradation. [...] Microbial communities isolated from soil samples mixed with starch {{have been shown to}} be capable of degrading polypropylene.|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly; I have another." [...] Standing {{near him}} she read to herself a passage <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there; <b>then,</b> in her sweet voice, she {{read some of}} them out. [...] "Oh, if YOU were only an actress!" [...] the young man exclaimed.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "I desire neither rest nor refreshment. All I require is, that you conduct {{me to the}} Princess, if you have her <b>here</b> confined, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> that you deliver her up to me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{will bring}} father back," [...] said Christie; [...] "he won't leave us <b>here</b> alone; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{together}} we {{must come to}} some understanding with him--with THEM--for somehow I feel as if this house belonged to us no longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{does it all}} amount to? It is like a {{fight between}} navvies in a tunnel to settle the {{position}} of the Pole star. It doesn't concern us.... Oh! it doesn't indeed concern us. It's a scuffle in the darkness, and our business, the business of all brains, the only permanent good work is to light up the world.... There will be mischief <b>and</b> hatred <b>here</b> <b>and</b> suppression <b>and</b> <b>then</b> forgetfulness, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> things will go on again, a little better or a little worse...." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'This is {{the sacred}} stone of Scone {{upon which the}} kings of Scotland have been crowned from time immemorial.
