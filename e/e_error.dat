Until now, this procedure has been primarily solved by using a 3 x 3 matrix obtained via a least-squares optimization. In this paper, we propose to use the spherical sampling method, recently published by Finlayson et al. to perform a perceptual color characterization. In particular, we search for the 3 x 3 matrix that minimizes three different perceptual errors, one pixel-based, and two spatial-based. For the pixel-based case, we minimize the CIE Delta <b>E</b> <b>error,</b> while for the spatial-based case we minimize both the SCIELAB error, and the CID error measure. Our results demonstrate an improvement of approximately 3 % for the Delta <b>E</b> <b>error</b> and 15 % for the two other error measures...|$|E
40|$|The orange wheat blossom midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) pest {{that can}} cause {{significant}} yield losses. Several hymenopterous parasitoids are known to attack S. mosellana. For the effective biological control of this pest by its parasitoids, the hostparasitoid synchrony is particularly important. The synchronization between the emergence of S. mosellana and its parasitoids was studied under controlled conditions with soils sampled from two locations. For both sites, three parasitoid species were identified: Macroglenes penetrans (Kirby) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), Euxestonotus error (Fitch) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) and Platygaster tuberosula (Kieffer) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae). The hypothesis that parasitoid emergence is triggered by the same rainfall that induces host emergence was tested by simulating three rainfall events, a week apart. The parasitoid M. penetrans emerged later than S. mosellana {{with a mean of}} 57 ± 7 DD (degree-days above 7 °C) for insects collected from Juprelle and 68 ± 10 DD for those from Veurne (i. e., 4 - 5 days after its host). M. penetrans was therefore closely synchronized with its host through the same inductive rainfall, but {{this was not the case}} for <b>E.</b> <b>error</b> or P. tuberosula. Depending on when the rainfall that triggered the emergence of S. mosellana occurred, <b>E.</b> <b>error</b> and P. tuberosula emerged either before or after their host.

40|$|Abstract — Space, cost, and signal {{processing}} constraints, among others, often preclude {{the use of}} multiple antennas at wireless terminals. This paper investigates distributed decodeand-forward fixed relays (infrastructure-based relaying) which are engaged in cooperation in a two-hop wireless network as a means of removing the burden of multiple antennas on wireless terminals. In contrast to mobile terminals, the deployment of a small number of antennas on infrastructure-based fixed relays is feasible, thus, the paper examines the impact of multiple antennas on the performance of the distributed cooperative fixed relays. Threshold-based maximal ratio combining (MRC) and thresholdbased selection combining (SC) of these multiple antenna signals are studied and analyzed. It is found that the end-to-end (E 2 <b>E)</b> <b>error</b> performance of a network which has few relays with many antennas is not significantly worse than that which has many relays each with a fewer antennas. Obviously, the former network has a tremendous deployment cost advantage over the latter. It is also observed that the E 2 <b>E</b> <b>error</b> performance of a network in which the multiple antennas at relays are configured in SC fashion is not significantly worse than that in which MRC is used. For implementation, SC presents a significantly lower complexity and cost than a full-blown MRC.

In particular, noncontextual letter substitution <b>errors</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>errors</b> in which the erroneous letter that replaces the target letter does not occur elsewhere within the word) were virtually absent in oral spelling and typing and mainly found in written spelling.
