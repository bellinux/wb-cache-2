60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{dismissed}} him. After a {{very brief}} toilet I hastened downstairs.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{felt myself}} {{swelling}} with the inarticulate hate that possessed me.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> for {{the life}} of me I could say nothing.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> whereat {{he looked}} more {{disappointed}} than before.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> feebly, for <b>I</b> was {{longing to}} accept his offer.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> though <b>I</b> guessed {{well enough}} what night he meant.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him. His head had dropped {{down on his}} chest again.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> I smiled {{down upon}} her {{a smile that}} was very full of confidence.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{paused in}} the act of dislodging the {{shavings}} which had drifted down my neck.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, for <b>I</b> {{had never}} heard {{anything}} of the sort.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in sorrow, a {{thrust of}} jealousy cutting me the while.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> {{with all}} <b>my</b> flush of joy changed to foolish resentment.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{said that}} I could not, and next moment was sorry, for she {{proceeded}} to explain.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{answered}} her vaguely. She sent {{a boy with}} a message, and brought me out a chair, dusting it carefully with her apron.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{replied that}} I had been idling {{long enough and}} must try to make some money, news at which he seemed very disappointed.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} its great black hole yawned close, but <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, whereat they murmured {{together}} and made {{as though they}} would go.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> held up my rifle. [...] "You'll {{have to go}} aloft to do it, and {{the first}} man that gets into the shrouds will get this." ...|$|E
60|$|The carrier {{looked at}} me, {{as if to}} inquire if she were coming back. <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> said I thought not. 'Then come up,' said the carrier to the lazy horse; who came up accordingly.|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{looked at}} the scented noble who turned pale beneath his paint. Then I {{looked at the}} fat eunuch, Houman, who opened his mouth and gasped like a fish, and when I had looked, <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> said as though to myself, ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> emphatically, {{guessing}} that I {{was to be}} seat {{on another}} proud mission.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Some {{instinct}} told me {{that they}} were professors. But I didn't say so.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at me as though asking for {{confirmation}} of her views. <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{tried to}} think the thing out while all the time those {{wonderful}} eyes of hers seemed to draw the soul from me. It {{seemed to me that}} she bent forward and held up her face to me. Then I lost my reason and also bent forward. Yes, she made me mad, and, save her, I forgot all.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{said that}} at present I feared {{it would not be}} possible, but that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out, then I shall know more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marion {{can tell}} you," [...] he said. He motioned towards the coffee-pot and asked, [...] "More?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> he said, [...] "Come out {{and let us}} see what the {{maritime}} interests have been doing for us. Pipe or cigar?" [...] I chose cigarettes, and he brought the box off the table, stopping {{on his way to}} the veranda, and taking his pipe and tobacco-pouch from the hall mantel.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Mr. Dick <b>shook</b> his, and sighed. 'Tell {{him about}} the Memorial,' said Mr. Dick.|$|R
60|$|I {{had heard}} {{something}} of Moissan, but I knew his artificial diamonds were very small. <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> silently, but {{pressed her}} hand, which, while she went on, still {{remained}} resting in mine.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> answered, 'I don't know. There {{are so many}} queer things {{hidden away}} {{in the heart of}} this great {{continent}} that I should be sorry to assert that there was no truth in it. Anyhow, we mean to try and find out. We intend to journey to Lekakisera, and thence, if we live to get so far, to this Lake Laga; and, if there are any white people beyond, we will do our best to find them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Crowded Owl {{looked at}} me, but <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "No, no, no!" [...] Then he drew {{himself up and}} just stood there. He seemed struck dumb; but that didn't matter, as he couldn't talk to us, anyway. But he didn't go away. When we walked farther up the wharf, he {{followed}} us, and again offered us some beans. I began to get angry, and said [...] "No!" [...] pretty violently. At this, he left us, but as we turned {{at the end of}} the wharf, we saw him near the club-house, standing and talking with Maiden's Heart.|$|E
6000|$|He listened, but I do {{not know}} whether he heard much of my clack, and I got very tired of it myself at last. When I had {{finished}} my blackberries, he asked mechanically, in an echo of my former visit, with a repetition of his gesture towards the coffee-pot, [...] "More?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> then he led the way out to the veranda, stopping to get his pipe and tobacco from the mantel on the way. But when we sat down in the early falling September twilight outside, he did not light his pipe, letting me smoke my cigarette alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in {{token of}} my ignorance, and Ebbits looked {{compassion}} at me, while Zilla snorted her customary contempt.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> slowly. <b>I</b> {{was sorry}} to {{disappoint}} him; but it was necessary before all things {{to get at the}} bare truth.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Every {{symptom of}} fatal relapse. I {{could not imagine}} what card Hilda held in reserve. But I stood there, waiting.|$|R
