Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Wu was {{contacted}} by the Manhattan District Engineer, Colonel Kenneth Nichols. The newly commissioned B Reactor at the Hanford Site had run into an unexpected problem, starting up and shutting down at regular intervals. John Archibald Wheeler suspected that a fission product, xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.4 hours, was the culprit, and might be a neutron poison. Segrè then remembered the work that Wu had done at Berkeley on the radioactive isotopes of xenon. The paper on the subject was still unpublished, but Wu and Nichols went to her <b>dorm</b> <b>room,</b> and collected the typewritten draft prepared for the Physical Review. Xenon-135 was indeed the culprit; {{it turned out to}} have an unexpectedly large neutron absorption cross-section.|$|E

5|$|Kaja Bordevich Ballo (1988– March 28, 2008) was a {{university}} {{student in the}} French town of Nice; her father was Olav Gunnar Ballo, {{a member of the}} Norwegian Parliament. On March 28, 2008 Kaja Ballo took the personality test run by the Church of Scientology, and committed suicide later the same day. Family and friends stated that Ballo was happy prior to taking the test, and that her mood dramatically shifted after receiving the results. She committed suicide hours after getting the results of the test back; Ballo jumped from the fourth floor of her <b>dorm</b> <b>room.</b> In addition to a note, her family found the Scientology personality test among her belongings. French police investigated connections between Scientology and Ballo's death, and interviewed two leaders of the organization in France. Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they were unable to establish a causative link between the Scientology test and Ballo's death.|$|E
5|$|Clannad story {{revolves}} around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year {{high school student}} who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his <b>dorm</b> <b>room</b> with Tomoya doing nothing much.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{is home to}} two {{pioneers in}} {{undergraduate}} campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, {{claims to be the}} oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a <b>dorm</b> <b>room.</b> The station has its studios {{on the second floor of}} Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest Student television station and home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.|$|E

5|$|To {{convert the}} {{backlink}} data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into {{a measure of}} importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized {{that it could be}} used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's <b>dorm</b> <b>room</b> into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) have a minor {{fight over}} Keith’s {{relationship}} with Harmony.

In criminology class, Mr. Landry (Patrick Fabian) tells Veronica that he’s applied her for an internship at the FBI. Veronica talks to Logan (Jason Dohring) about Mercer, but he still refuses to give her an alibi. Veronica and the girlfriend, Meryl, find that Sully has contacted another girl, Scarlett, but Scarlett knows that Sully has a girlfriend. Veronica visits Mercer in prison, and he tells her {{that there are many}} people who would want to frame him. Sully’s roommate comes back to their room, and Veronica uncovers that Meryl and Sully had a fight the previous weekend.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} dream sequence, Buffy is woken by Anya in her <b>dorm</b> <b>room.</b> She then finds {{herself in her}} room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, Buffy talks to her mother, {{who lives in the}} walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been {{promoted}} to Surgeon General and is drawing up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam start to make a pillow fort. When Buffy finds her weapons bag, the only thing in it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells Buffy that she cannot have friends and must work alone, which Buffy rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy's living room next to her dying friends until Buffy realizes that she can stop the fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{test whether}} the {{incidence}} of common colds among college students in China is associated with ventilation rates and crowdedness in dormitories. Methods: In Phase I of the study, a cross-sectional study, 3712 students living in 1569 <b>dorm</b> <b>rooms</b> in 13 buildings responded to a questionnaire about incidence and duration of common colds in the previous 12 months. In Phase II, air temperature, relative humidity and CO 2 concentration were measured for 24 hours in 238 <b>dorm</b> <b>rooms</b> in 13 buildings, during both summer and winter. Out-to indoor air flow rates at night were calculated based on measured CO 2 concentrations. Results: In Phase I, 10 % of college students reported an incidence of more than 6 common colds in the previous 12 months, and 15 % reported that each infection usually lasted for more than 2 weeks. Students in 6 -person <b>dorm</b> <b>rooms</b> were about 2 {{times as likely to}} have an incidence of common colds $ 6 times per year and a duration $ 2 weeks, compared to students in 3 -person rooms. In Phase II, 90 % of the measured <b>dorm</b> <b>rooms</b> had an out-to indoor air flow rate less than the Chinese standard of 8. 3 L/s per person during the heating season. There was a dose-response relationship between out-to indoor air flow rate per person in <b>dorm</b> <b>rooms</b> and the proportion of occupants with annual common cold infections $ 6 times. A mean ventilation rate of 5 L/(sNperson) in dorm buildings was associated with 5 % of self reported common cold $ 6 times, compared to 35 % at 1 L/(sNperson) ...|$|R
