The ASPBM described biomass and substrate oscillations in aerobic continuous cultures as experimentally observed.

In this article, we present hospital utilization data from British Columbia over the period 1969 - 1985, which reinforce our earlier (Barer, Evans, Hertzman, et al. 1987) conclusion: it is not aging per se that poses the threat; rather, it {{is what we are}} choosing (through our health care system) to do to and with our elderly. In 1969, British Columbia hospital patients over 65 years of age and staying longer than 60 days accounted for 12. 5 percent of all days; by 1985 / 86, they were accounting for 39 percent. Furthermore, in 1985 / 86, 1 patient in 200 was using one-quarter of all patient days and dying {{at the end of the}} process, and 2 patients in 100 (who stayed over 60 days whether discharged alive or <b>dead)</b> were <b>accounting</b> for almost one-half of all days...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Perennial {{ryegrass}} (Lolium perenne) - {{white clover}} (Trifolium repens) hill-land pastures were grazed {{at different times}} in the winter to study the effect of time of winter grazing on plant response and forage production. The same pastures were grazed by sheep once in early December, January, February, March, or April and compared to an ungrazed control in each of three forage years (December 1983 to July 1986). Winter stock grazing densities {{were based on a}} three day grazing period and a 400 kg ha⁻¹ dry matter residual. Grazing in the winter reduced herbage mass but had relatively little effect on subsequent forage production. This is consistent with the poor conditions for growth (relatively cold and low light levels) during the winter.
