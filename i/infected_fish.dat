25|$|The {{bacterium}} Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, {{which probably}} comes from eating <b>infected</b> <b>fish,</b> {{poses a threat}} to belugas kept in captivity, causing anorexia and dermal plaques and lesions that can lead to septicemia. This condition can cause death if it is not diagnosed and treated in time with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{that become}} {{infected}} experience hemorrhaging of their internal organs, skin, and muscle. Some fish show no external symptoms, but others {{show signs of}} infection that include bulging eyes, bloated abdomens, bruised-looking reddish tints to the eyes, skin, gills and fins. Some <b>infected</b> <b>fish</b> have open sores that may look like the lesions from other diseases or from lamprey attacks.|$|E

25|$|Henneguya {{and other}} parasites in the myxosporean group have complex life cycles, where the salmon {{is one of}} two hosts. The fish {{releases}} the spores after spawning. In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream. When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon. The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle. The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout has a similar life cycle. However, as opposed to whirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon— even heavily <b>infected</b> <b>fish</b> tend to return to spawn successfully.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{infectious}} salmon anemia (ISAv) {{was discovered}} in Norway in an Atlantic salmon hatchery. Eighty percent of {{the fish in the}} outbreak died. ISAv, a viral disease, is now a major threat to the viability of Atlantic salmon farming. It is now the first of the diseases classified on List One of the European Commission’s fish health regime. Amongst other measures, this requires the total eradication of the entire fish stock should an outbreak of the disease be confirmed on any farm. ISAv seriously affects salmon farms in Chile, Norway, Scotland and Canada, causing major economic losses to infected farms. As the name implies, it causes severe anemia of <b>infected</b> <b>fish.</b> Unlike mammals, the red blood cells of fish have DNA, and can become infected with viruses. The fish develop pale gills, and may swim close to the water surface, gulping for air. However, the disease can also develop without the fish showing any external signs of illness, the fish maintain a normal appetite, and then they suddenly die. The disease can progress slowly throughout an infected farm and, in the worst cases, death rates may approach 100 percent. It is also a threat to the dwindling stocks of wild salmon. Management strategies include developing a vaccine and improving genetic resistance to the disease.|$|E
500|$|Lastly, some drugs, such as furazolidone, furoxone, benomyl, fumagillin, {{proguanil}} and clamoxyquine, {{have been}} shown to impede spore development, which reduces infection rates. [...] For example, one study showed that feeding fumagillin to O. mykiss reduced the number of <b>infected</b> <b>fish</b> from between 73% and 100% to between 10% and 20%. [...] Unfortunately, this treatment is considered unsuitable for wild trout populations, and no drug treatment has ever been shown to be effective in the studies required for United States Food and Drug Administration approval.|$|E

500|$|M. cerebralis {{was first}} {{recorded}} in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania, having been introduced via infected trout imported from Europe, and has spread steadily south and westwards. Until the 1990s, whirling disease {{was considered a}} manageable problem affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. However, it has recently become established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico), where it is causing heavy mortalities in several sportfishing rivers. Some streams in the western United States have lost 90% of their trout. In addition, whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which {{is important for the}} tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, [...] "the Montana Whirling Disease Task Force estimated trout fishing generated US $300,000,000 in recreational expenditures in Montana alone". Making matters worse, some of the fish species that M. cerebralis infects (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) are already threatened or endangered, and the parasite could worsen their already precarious situations. [...] For reasons that are poorly understood, but probably have to do with environmental conditions, the impact on <b>infected</b> <b>fish</b> has been greatest in Colorado and Montana, and least in California, Michigan, and New York.|$|E
50|$|Reported {{symptoms}} of <b>infected</b> <b>fish</b> include reddened skin, inflammation of organs including {{the eyes and}} brain, liver damage, and eventual organ failure and death. The mortality rate is about 80-100% of <b>infected</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the Immunostimulant potential of Turmeric and Ginger in <b>fish</b> Cirrhinus mrigala <b>infected</b> with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fishes were divided into three groups, one received control diet, another received turmeric incorporated diet [T diet] and the third group received Ginger incorporated diet [G diet] for 40 days. The hematological parameters were analyzed and compared between uninfected and infected. A decrease in Total Erythrocyte Count[47 %], Haemoglobin [22 %] and Packed Cell Volume [16 %] was observed in <b>infected</b> <b>fishes</b> fed with control diet, but in T diet the decrease was marginal [TEC 14 %, Hb 22 % & PCV 9 %] and in G diet the decrease was minimal [TEC 12 %, Hb 19 % & PCV 7 %].

40|$|Populations of generalist species often {{comprise}} of smaller sub-sets of relatively specialised individuals whose niches comprise small sub-sets {{of the overall}} population niche. Here, the role of parasite infections in trophic niche specialisation was tested using five wild <b>fish</b> populations <b>infected</b> with the non-native parasite Ergasilus briani, a copepod parasite with a direct lifecycle that infects the gill tissues of <b>fish</b> hosts. <b>Infected</b> and uninfected <b>fishes</b> were sampled from the same habitats during sampling events. Prevalence in the host populations ranged between 16 and 67 %, with parasite abundances of up to 66 parasites per fish. Although pathological impacts included hyperplasia and localised haemorrhaging of gill tissues, {{there were no significant}} differences in the length, weight and condition of <b>infected</b> and uninfected <b>fishes.</b> Stable isotope analyses (δ 13 C, δ 15 N) revealed that the trophic niche of <b>infected</b> <b>fishes,</b> measured as standard ellipse area (i. e. the isotopic niche), was consistently and significantly smaller compared to uninfected conspecifics.
