40|$|Managing newly {{received}} cattle presents {{challenges from}} both a nutritional and health standpoint; however, information about pre-arrival management of <b>incoming</b> <b>feeder</b> cattle {{has become increasingly}} available and can be utilized to refine arrival processing protocols. Previous management, nutrition and vaccination history impacts newly arrived cattle’s capabilities of coping with the stress associated with feedlot entry. Utilizing the available information to more precisely identify the diseaserisk of incoming groups of cattle will assist in determining expected investments in disease prevention and intervention {{as well as the}} associated labor involved...|$|E
40|$|The thesis titled Individual {{stand-by}} of <b>incoming</b> <b>feeder</b> of Energetika Třinec 6 kV substantion is theoreticaly {{and practically}} concived work that offers comprehensive information on automatic standby {{focused on the}} selected operation of Energetika Třinec. At present, the standby is in authention mode and thesis solves shutdown of transformer T 5. The extract of automatic device indicates trouble-free operation and thesis focus on the power take-off for transformer T 5. The theoretical part provides information about problems of own comsumption of power plants, automatic device of standby and protection of electrical equipment. Thesis also sloves the protection settings, which is supported by calculations of short-circuit currents. The practical part is formed from the suggestion of solution in accordance to current criteria and the evaluation of possible settings of protective automatic devices together with an assessment of implementation option of standby. The aim of the thesis is to perform analysis of standby and evaluate effects which causes shutdown of own comsumption part. The final part assesses current settings of protection based on calculated values. Existing protections are unsuitable and it is recomennded to deploy digital multi-stage protections {{as a replacement for}} present relay protections...|$|E

Substation consists of 2 <b>incoming</b> <b>feeders,</b> 2 outgoing feeders for motors, 2 outgoing feeders for power transformers, measuring, bus coupler and bus riser <b>feeder.</b> <b>Incoming</b> <b>feeders</b> are connected to distribution system E. ON by cable lines which were proposed. Protected machines (power transformers and motors with rated power) are connected to switchgear panels of UniGear ZS 1 type by cable lines too. Proposed protection system {{is based on the}} short-circuit conditions, standard CSN 33 3051 recommendations as well as theoretical backgrounds acquired from technical papers and other publicated literature according to the bibliography. For selected protection functions are defined their parameters. Control, monitoring and protection functions provides REF 542 plus relay. Consequently, secondary tests which are part of the commissioning, are given in the practical part of thesis. Secondary tests were performed by relay test system FREJA 300 by Megger. Results of tests are displayed in tripping characteristics...|$|R
40|$|A supply {{restoration}} approach {{which uses}} load profiles constructed from the measurements obtained from domestic smart meters is discussed. The smart meter measurements were aggregated {{to construct the}} load profiles of the loads connected to an 11 kV transformer. These load profiles were used to decide the period during which an agent reconfigures the network to minimise outage times. The proposed approach was exemplified using a 11 kV network having two <b>incoming</b> <b>feeders</b> and a backup generator...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{protection}} concept for medium voltage substation. The first theoretical part of thesis describes given medium voltage substation. Substation consists of two <b>incoming</b> <b>feeders</b> and six outgoing feeders. Due {{to the size of the}} substation was selected one outgoing feeder which is the subject of description and protection concept. Next part of the thesis is a description of the protective functions used to protect the elements in the selected feeder. This part contains a detailed description of the function and setting options for protection. The main part of the thesis describes calculation of specific protection functions and consequently with secondary testing of protective functions. Tests were performed on protective functions in the digital protections REF 615 and REM 620. The final part of the thesis deals with the evaluation of the secondary test results and verification saturation of the specified current transformers...|$|R
40|$|Performance and carcass {{data from}} 624 steers in three {{experiments}} {{were used to}} evaluate potential strategies that might be used with <b>incoming</b> <b>feeders</b> to remove animals that produce low value carcasses when cattle are sold in a valuebased grid. Removing 10 % of the carcasses with the lowest net value from each group increased the overall average net value of the remaining carcasses $ 17. 50 to $ 21. 09. Carcass weight {{was found to be}} the most significant factor determining net value of the carcass. Gain of the steers during the first 3 to 5 weeks of the feeding period was significantly related to average final gain and carcass value, but accounted for {{a small portion of the}} overall variation in gain or carcass value. Use of initial gain was successful in identifying ten of the sixty-four carcasses with least net value in a value-based grid. Adding frame score and measurement of initial thickness of backfat along with initial gain did not significantly improve identification of the low-value carcasses. Sorting the steers as feeders based on frame score and initial thickness of backfat resulted in differences in performance and carcass measurements. The low-value carcasses tended to be concentrated in the smaller-framed steers...|$|R
