5|$|In the 1810s and 1820s, greater <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the {{accuracy}} of long-range gunfire, and less on {{the weight of a}} broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy in the 1850s after the development of wrought-iron-jacketed steel cannon by William Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Phase III: At {{the height}} of the Roman Empire's power, forces were tasked with manning and {{securing}} the borders of the vast provinces which had been brought under Roman control. Serious strategic threats were less common in this period and <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> preserving gained territory. The army underwent changes in response to these new needs and became more dependent on fixed garrisons than on march-camps and continuous field operations.|$|E
5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the larger}} Church of the Brethren, {{significant}} <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> social issues. In the Brethren (Ashland) and Grace Brethren groups, significant <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> exegesis of the Bible. Several {{of the groups}} maintain a larger [...] "Doctrinal Statement" [...] or treatise, but only {{for the purpose of}} clarifying their Biblical position.|$|R
5|$|In 1975, {{the mall}} {{underwent}} some cosmetic renovation and was renamed from simply The Mall to University Mall, probably to diversify {{it from the}} new McCain Mall Simon was planning for North Little Rock. The mall's reopening was held in March of that year. News accounts say that special <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> a security program. University Mall drew thousands of shoppers yearly and was known for its holiday displays and programs. It also became a favorite place for many walkers, including retirees and heart patients from St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center, located just across University Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Singapore went through some post-independence crises, {{including}} the SARS outbreak in 2003 {{and the threat}} of terrorism. In December 2001, a plot to bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered and as many as 36 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were arrested under the Internal Security Act. Major counter-terrorism measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur. More <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> promoting social integration and trust between the different communities.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E

5|$|Courtly {{love was}} the eroticisation of love between the nobility. <b>Emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric {{events such as}} tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, {{it could also be}} private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{previous}} film's financial success, Boogeyman 2 was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer. Casting began in December {{of the same year}} with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the former hospital, Linda Vista Community Hospital, over a four-month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural entity, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E

5|$|On taking office, Reagan {{was faced}} with the same {{decision}} as Carter before: whether {{to continue with the}} B-1 for the short term, or to wait {{for the development of the}} ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985. It was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets. After this, the introduction of the SA-10 missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first Soviet Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable. During 1981, funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time-frame which led to developing the Long-Range Combat Aircraft (LRCA) project. The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111, and ATB as possible solutions; an <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> multi-role capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations.|$|E
5|$|Thief was {{developed}} with the Dark Engine, a proprietary game engine. It was written during the game's development, {{rather than as}} a separately budgeted project, which led to time constraint issues. An <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> simulating real life physics; arrows would arc through the air rather than fly straight. The engine features alpha blending, texture filtering and lighting techniques. Motion capture technology was integrated to allow for realistic character animation. The engine's renderer—which draws the graphics—was largely written by Looking Glass Studios programmer Sean Barrett in fall 1995. While the renderer was expected to be finished before the game's release date, Barrett left the company in 1996. He later performed contract work for the company, and assisted in writing features like hardware support. However, the renderer was never fully addressed, and was less advanced than others of the time.|$|E
5|$|For much of Chinese history, the {{position}} of Emperor was determined by primogeniture; {{the position}} would pass from father to first-born son upon the father's death. While Khitan succession was also kept within families, an <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> selecting the most capable option, with all of a leader's brothers, nephews, and sons considered valid choices for succession. Khitan rulers were expected to hand over power to a paternal relative after serving a single three-year term. Abaoji signaled his desire to become a permanent ruler at his accession in 907, securing his position by killing {{most of the other}} Khitan chieftains. Between 907 and 910 Abaoji's rule went unchallenged. It was only after 910, when Abaoji disregarded the Khitan tradition that another member of the family assume {{the position of}} Great Khan, that his rule came under direct challenge. In both 912 and 913 members of Abaoji's family, including most of his brothers, attempted armed insurrections. After the first insurrection was discovered and defeated, Abaoji pardoned the conspirators. After the second, only his brothers were pardoned, with the other conspirators suffering violent deaths. The brothers plotted additional rebellions in 917 and 918, both of which were easily crushed.|$|E

5000|$|In Orthodox Judaism, Cheder is a {{term used}} to mean a private primary day school where the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> {{religious}} study and a secondary <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> secular knowledge which is also taught. These are increasingly popular within haredi communities in Europe and America where a core curriculum is obligatory, so even haredi (ultra-Orthodox) schools tend to offer a fairly broad if superficial secular education.|$|R

5|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} summer camp at Fort Clinton, MacArthur had the cadets trained to use modern weapons by regular army sergeants at Fort Dix; they then marched back to West Point with full packs. He attempted to modernize the curriculum by adding liberal arts, government and economics courses, but encountered strong resistance from the Academic Board. In Military Art classes, {{the study of the}} campaigns of the American Civil War was replaced with the study of those of World War I. In History class, more <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the Far East. MacArthur expanded the sports program, increasing the number of intramural sports and requiring all cadets to participate. He allowed upper class cadets to leave the reservation, and sanctioned a cadet newspaper, The Brag, forerunner of today's West Pointer. He also permitted cadets to travel to watch their football team play, and gave them an allowance of $5 ($ in modern dollars) a month. Professors and alumni alike protested these radical moves. Most of MacArthur's West Point reforms were soon discarded but, in the ensuing years, his ideas became accepted and his innovations were gradually restored.|$|E
5|$|Music {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} musical production in Scotland between the early sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century. In this period the court followed the European trend for instrumental accompaniment and playing. Scottish monarchs {{of the sixteenth century}} were patrons of religious and secular music, and some were accomplished musicians. In the sixteenth century the playing of a musical instrument and singing became an expected accomplishment of noble men and women. The departure of James VI to rule in London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, meant that the Chapel Royal, Stirling Castle largely fell into disrepair and the major source of patronage was removed from the country. Important composers of the early sixteenth century included Robert Carver and David Peebles. The Lutheranism of the early Reformation was sympathetic to the incorporation of Catholic musical traditions and vernacular songs into worship, exemplified by The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567). However, the Calvinism that came to dominate Scottish Protestantism led to the closure of song schools, disbanding of choirs, removal of organs and the destruction of music books and manuscripts. An <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the Psalms, resulting in the production of a series of Psalters {{and the creation of a}} tradition of unaccompanied singing.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, as copper {{became more}} readily available, {{advances}} in ceramic technology levelled off as more <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> developing metallurgical techniques.|$|E
