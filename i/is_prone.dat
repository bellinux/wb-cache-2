5|$|Lawton {{is located}} {{squarely}} in the area known as Tornado Alley and <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to severe weather from late April through early June. Most notably, an F4 tornado in 1957, and an F3 tornado in 1979 struck the southern region of the city.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Election Commission would {{review the}} postal voting system where EC {{chairman}} Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof {{said they would}} study the proposal to call for an early voting session for army personnel, policemen and EC staff instead of posting votes. Nevertheless, the Youth wing of PAS have demanded for the postal votes to be abolished altogether as it claims that the postal votes are no longer relevant and <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to abuse and exploitation {{by the government to}} their benefit.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, it <b>was</b> <b>prone</b> to mold, while Crljenak <b>was</b> <b>prone</b> to <b>be</b> overly heat sensitive, {{thus the}} cross of Plavac Mali {{resulted}} in a grape that had neither of these negative attributes and was perfect for the region.|$|R

5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is {{absorbed by the}} dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{was most}} likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, {{although}} savoys were not developed until the 16th century. By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine. Cabbage heads are generally picked {{during the first year}} of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year, and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> {{to genetic}} {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if {{the animal is}} exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Curium-244 decays into 240Pu by {{emission}} of alpha particle, {{but it also}} absorbs neutrons resulting in {{a small amount of}} heavier curium isotopes. Among those, 247Cm and 248Cm are popular in scientific research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of 247Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons. Synthesis of 250Cm via neutron absorption is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the intermediate product 249Cm (64 min), which converts by β− decay to the berkelium isotope 249Bk.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E
5|$|Historically the breeds {{that were}} merged into the King Charles Spaniel {{were used for}} hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs. The modern breed <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to several health problems, {{including}} cardiac conditions {{and a range of}} eye issues.|$|E

5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of the myths {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.|$|E
5|$|Since Manila <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to earthquakes, the Spanish colonial architects {{invented the}} style called Earthquake Baroque which the churches and {{government}} buildings during the Spanish colonial period adopted. As a result, succeeding earthquakes of the 18th and 19th centuries barely affected Manila, {{although it did}} periodically level the surrounding area. Modern buildings in and around Manila are designed or have been retrofitted to withstand an 8.2 magnitude quake in accordance to the country's building code.|$|E

5|$|The bay {{serves as}} a nursery for shrimp and as an {{ecosystem}} for diverse species of birds and fish. Shrimp farms have been established inland to circumvent restrictions on the bay. The area close to shore <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to flooding, and can sometimes accumulate large populations of mosquitos. As a consequence, no major settlements have been founded on the bay. However, the small communities of Port Alto and Carancahua have been established on the western and eastern shores, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The breed <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to skin disorders. About {{a quarter}} of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans to}} {{undertake}} a major restoration of Mdina's walls were made in 2006, {{as part of a}} project that also included restoration of the fortifications of Valletta, Birgu and the Cittadella. In the case of Mdina, the main focus was to consolidate the terrain, since the city is built on a blue clay plateau which <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to subsidence. The multimillion-euro restoration was partially financed by the European Regional Development Fund. Works began in early 2008 by the Restoration Unit. The process of restoration was documented by Dr. Spiteri.|$|E

5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|Today, Fort Ricasoli {{remains largely}} intact, {{although}} {{it is in a}} dilapidated state. The headland that it is built upon <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to coastal erosion, and some of the walls between No. 3 and No. 4 bastions have already collapsed into the sea. In 2004, the Restoration Unit of the Ministry of Resources and Infrastructure removed, restored and re-attached part of the fort's walls, but nothing has been done to restore the entire fort.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and <b>is</b> <b>prone</b> to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
