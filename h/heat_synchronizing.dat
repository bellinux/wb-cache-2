40|$|Graduation date: 1974 During {{karyokinesis}} in the ciliate, Tetrahymena pyriformis, strain GL-I, an extranuclear chromatin body (ECB) {{is frequently}} formed as an excluded mass {{between the two}} dividing daughter macronuclei. The formation and fate of ECB's were followed by means of Feu lgen, toluidine blue 0, and euchrysine staining and autoradiography (³H-thymidine). The following results were obtained: 1) Fifty-one percent of the dividing cells in a log growth phase culture produce one (43 %) or more (8 %) ECB's. 2) Newly formed ECB's respond to stains and extractions as do macronuclei. 3) Single ECB's assort randomly into either daughter cell. 4) By the completion of cytokinesis, most newly formed ECB's have undergone changes in morphology and stainability. 5) The ECB's gradually disappear during the cell cycle: the percentage of daughter cells with recently formed ECB's remains relatively constant at 30 % for the first 35 minutes and then decreases gradually to about 10 % just before division 2 (at 205 minutes). 6) The remaining ECB's are carried through division 2, and are found in 5 % of the subsequent G₁ cells. 7) Most of these ECB's disappear during the next cell cycle, although some are carried into division 3. 8) ECB's once formed do not incorporate labeled thymidine {{at any time in}} the cell cycle. ECB's in log growth phase G₁ cells placed into starvation medium (inorganic salts) disappear rapidly and almost completely (from 30 % at division to 1 % by 90 minutes as compared to 30 % to 15 % in cells maintained in nutrient medium). Almost all (88 %) <b>heat</b> <b>synchronized</b> cells form at least one ECB at the first synchronized division (21 % form two), resulting in 48 % of the daughter cells with an ECB. This value drops rapidly to 8 % within 80 minutes and to 5 % just prior to the second synchronized division (at 105 minutes) and then rises to 55 % following this division. The extra percent of ECB's is due to the small carryover from the first division. The loss of ECB's probably results from intracellular digestion with subsequent reincorporation or elimination of the breakdown products. These and other data suggest that ECB formation is a factor in the maintenance of some optimum nucleo-cytoplasmic mass ratio which may be involved in the control of the cell cycle...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Cell {{division}} in a <b>heat</b> <b>synchronized</b> Tetrahymena pyriformis (GL-I) cell can be delayed if the cell {{is exposed to}} X-irradiation (300 kVp, 20 mA, HVL = 0. 9 mm Cu, 25 R/ sec) prior to a critical time {{after the end of}} the synchronizing treatment (EST). At the critical time, the cells undergo a rapid transition from a state of being sensitive to being delayed to one of relative insensitivity. After this time, the coming division is delayed little if at all; that is, there is an "all or none" transition to insensitivity to division delay. However, the second division is delayed, indicating that damage has occurred. The transition point (median critical time) is determined by interpolating the time after EST at which a given radiation exposure splits a population of cells into 50 percent delayed and 50 percent not delayed. The transition point is dose dependent in that the larger the exposure, the later the transition point (31 minutes after EST for 3 kR increasing gradually to 51 minutes after EST for 18. 5 kR). The division delay response is correlated with a resorption of the developing new mouth as determined from silver stained cells fixed every ten minutes after EST. The length of time for the oral primordium to be resorbed increases as the dose increases and varies with the time of irradiation relative to the transition point. The all or none" nature of the division delay response and the fact that cells irradiated after the transition point seemingly "ignore" the radiation damage until the second generation, together suggest that the damage produced by the irradiation may or may. not trigger a cellular response that results in cell division delay and oral primordium resorption. These responses might suggest that preformed enzymes, possibly from lysosomes, could be involved. Therefore, cells were treated with a known lysosomal stabilizer (hydrocortisone) and a labilizer (vitamin A) continuously before, during, and after exposure to 7. 5 kR of X-rays. Cells treated with hydrocortisone- 21 - phosphate (5. 0 mM) showed an earlier transition point (36. 5 minutes after EST) whereas cells treated with vitamin A-acetate (0. 2 mM) showed a later transition point (50. 5 minutes after EST) relative to the transition point for untreated, irradiated cells (43 minutes after EST). The time of the transition for cells treated with a lysosomal stabilizer (depresses enzyme release) and 7. 5 kR corresponds to the transition point for untreated cells irradiated with only 5. 0 kR,suggesting less sensitivity. Conversely, the transition point for cells treated with a lysosomal labilizer (enhances enzyme release) and 7. 5 kR corresponds to the time of transition for untreated cells exposed to 18. 5 kR, suggesting greater sensitivity. However, in all cases, 7. 5 kR delayed the divisions about the same amount, whether the agents were present or not, indicating that the agents do not act in a simple dose - modifying manner. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that irradiation produces damage that may or may. not trigger off a cellular response that leads to delay of division. The sensitivity of the cell to being triggered to delay division may involve lysosomes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is to describe the use of artificial insemination (AI) in sheep and discuss the possibilities for AI in Sweden. Male and female fertility, heat detection, semen handling and insemination techniques in sheep are described. Advantages and disadvantages of AI are discussed. In order to achieve genetic progress it is important with well planned and implemented breeding programs. The Swedish Sheep Recording Scheme and computer software from Elitlamm are the basis for sheep breeding in Sweden. Natural mating of ewes are most common {{and the use of}} AI is limited. However, there is an increasing interest for use of AI for importation of genetic material and for storage of semen from endangered breeds. In Norway the use of AI has increased in recent years. Two different methods, cervical and vaginal insemination, are used. When using AI it is advantageous if all ewes in the herd are in heat at the same time. Oestrus synchronization can be implemented by means of synthetic hormones or with use of so-called teaser rams. The technique that works best and is recommended in Norway is vaginal insemination. This technique, together with ram <b>synchronized</b> <b>heat</b> is good practice also in Swedish sheep breeding...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWorldwide, having as aim {{the more}} and more cost {{effective}} animal rearing, specialized breeds are used by practising and experimenting modern methods of animal breeding and reproduction. Planning the adequate reproduction activity to each farm purpose in view leads to some high technological indices. The aim of the present paper is the one of assessing the best methods of reproduction planning activity in a beef herd. There were analyzed the reproduction indices in a Charolais livestock, allotted to three categories of females: primiparous 36 females, 29 secundiparous females and 15 multiparous, a total of eighty-two reproduction stock. The study was conducted during three years and the reproduction indices were the following: length of pregnancy, service-period, calving interval, fertility rate, and sex ratio of the offspring. The animals come from import, from a total livestock nucleus of 21 heifers and a bull, the farm livestock increasing gradually to 96 heads. The females were used maximum five calving, and then culled. The age of females’ introduction to reproduction is 22 - 24 months, the first calving being achieved at 2, 5 years, maximum 3 years. There were used the grouped calving system and individual calving system along the year. Following the three years study, even the reproduction indices did not differ significantly, by the grouped calving system obtained in early spring {{with the aid of}} <b>synchronized</b> <b>heats,</b> the early calves used better the grazing season offering increasing amounts of meat with less costs...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{of fully}} dense {{refractory}} thin films {{by means of}} physical vapor deposition (PVD) requires elevated temperatures T-s to ensure sufficient adatom mobilities. Films grown with no external heating are underdense, {{as demonstrated by the}} open voids visible in cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy images and by x-ray reflectivity results; thus, the layers exhibit low nanoindentation hardness and elastic modulus values. Ion bombardment of the growing film surface is often used to enhance densification; however, the required ion energies typically extract a steep price in the form of residual rare-gas-ion-induced compressive stress. Here, the authors propose a PVD strategy for the growth of dense, hard, and stress-free refractory thin films at low temperatures; that is, with no external heating. The authors use TiN as a model ceramic materials system and employ hybrid high-power pulsed and dc magnetron co-sputtering (HIPIMS and DCMS) in Ar/N- 2 mixtures to grow dilute Ti 1 -xTaxN alloys on Si(001) substrates. The Ta target driven by HIPIMS serves as a pulsed source of energetic Ta+/Ta 2 + metal-ions, characterized by in-situ mass and energy spectroscopy, while the Ti target operates in DCMS mode (Ta-HIPIMS/Ti-DCMS) providing a continuous flux of metal atoms to sustain a high deposition rate. Substrate bias V-s is applied in synchronous with the Ta-ion portion of each HIPIMS pulse in order to provide film densification by heavy-ion irradiation (m(Ta) = 180. 95 amu versus m(Ti) = 47. 88 amu) while minimizing Ar+ bombardment and subsequent trapping in interstitial sites. Since Ta is a film constituent, primarily residing on cation sublattice sites, film stress remains low. Dense Ti 0. 92 Ta 0. 08 N alloy films, 1. 8 mu m thick, grown with T-s less than= 120 degrees C (due to plasma <b>heating)</b> and <b>synchronized</b> bias, V-s = 160 V, exhibit nanoindentation hardness H = 25. 9 GPa and elastic modulus E = 497 GPa compared to 13. 8 and 318 GPa for underdense Ti-HIPIMS/Ti-DCMS TiN reference layers (T-s less than 120 degrees C) grown with the same V-s, and 7. 8 and 248 GPa for DCMS TiN films grown with no applied bias (T-s less than 120 degrees C). Ti 0. 92 Ta 0. 08 N residual stress is low, sigma = - 0. 7 GPa, and essentially equal to that of Ti-HIPIMS/Ti-DCMS TiN films grown with the same substrate bias...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhen {{coupled to}} acoustics, {{unsteady}} heat release oscillations may cause recurrent problems in many combustion chambers, potentially leading to dramatic damages to the structure. Accumulation of acoustic energy around the eigenmodes of the combustor {{results from the}} resonant coupling between pressure disturbances in the flame region with <b>synchronized</b> <b>heat</b> release rate perturbations. Predicting these frequencies and the corresponding sound pressure field is a key issue to design passive or active control systems to prevent the growth of these instabilities. In this study, an acoustically controlled combustion test bench CESAM is used to stabilize a partially premixed swirling propane-air flame. In the premixing tube, reactants are injected tangentially to generate the swirling flow, the flame being stabilized in the combustion chamber by a sudden expansion of the cross section. The premixer backplane is equipped with an Impedance Control System (ICS) allowing to adjust the acoustic reflection coefficient at this location. Acoustics of the coupled-cavitiy system formed by the premixer and the combustion chamber is investigated analytically by {{taking into account the}} measured acoustic impedances at the premixer backplane and in the feeding lines. The chamber length is also modified to examine effects of the geometry on these predictions. It is shown that the premixer and combustion chamber can be considered as acoustically decoupled for small values of the acoustic coupling index, defined in the article, offering flexible solutions to control the pressure distribution within the combustor, except when these frequencies match. When the frequencies are close to each others, only the analysis of the damping of the different cavities enables to indicate wether the system is coupled or not. Modifying either the acoustic coupling index or the damping values featuring the same frequency appears then as alternative solutions to decouple cavities...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} long {{recognized}} that the environment has {{an important role to}} play in the regulation of the mammalian reproductive function. Environmental cues, such as changing day-light or increase temperature, are know to trigger off growth or regression of the reproductive organs in a whole variety of species and nutrition and stress can influence the onset of breeding and affect the fertility. Although the domestic buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) has been since long time considered as a short-day-breeder polyestral seasonal animal, indeed in the tropical areas near of equator line they are polyestral continuous. It would seem that photoperiod has a marked influence in buffalo reproduction in determinate areas of the world, however in some tropical areas like in Brazil, mainly in the Amazon valley and areas nearest of the equator the light seems to have a minimal effect or no effect on the reproductive cues however the nutrition and heat stress measured throughout temperature/ humidity indexes (THI) {{play an important role in}} the reproductive functions of buffaloes and it is suggested that THI > 75 has a negative effect on reproductive performances of buffaloes. The calving season is regulated by the availability of native pasture in the floodplain or in areas of artificial pasture On the other hand when buffaloes are raised in the southwest and southern regions (parallels 14 to 33 South) they show a typical seasonal pattern when the calving season are concentrated between de February to July. The body condition score (BCS) seems to affect directly the fertility of female buffaloes since females that calve with a BCS < 2. 5 show delayed postpartum ovulation, weak estrus symptoms and more service per conception rate. Seasonal anestrus is a normal phenomenon in the out breeding season that occur in areas near, upon or down of the Cancer and Capricorn lines, respectively, however the anoestrus can be overcame by the use of hormone to <b>synchronize</b> <b>heat</b> and ovulation. Buffaloes are quite resistant to the cold weather but protection must also be provided as well as in the tropical areas where shade, water access and good management increase the fertility rates...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} induced radiation resistance. Experiments were designed to identify the nature of lesions that induce this mechanism and the cellular components which regulated its expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. DNA recombinational repair capacity induced by DNA damage {{was believed to be}} the system that conferred resistance to killing by radiation in yeast. The nature of the radiation generated DNA lesions that induce this mechanism have been examined using the two different endpoints of resistance to cell killing and suppression chemical mutation. In yeast, DNA lesions produced by low-LET (Linear Energy Transfer) γ-rays were more efficient at inducing radioresistance and mutation suppression than lesions produced by high-LET neutrons. It was inferred that DNA single strand breaks were important inducing lesions. Oxygen modifiable lesions and hydroxyl radicals (OH·) were particularly efficient inducers of this repair mechanism. Radiation induction of DNA repair depends not only on a variable induction response to different DNA lesions, but also on the availability of the induced repair system to deal with subsequent damage. Yeast mutants deficient in topoisomerase I, in topoisomerase II, or in DNA polymerase I were used to further investigate the involvement of these enzymes in the mechanism of induced thermal tolerance or radiation resistance. The systems that confer increased resistance to heat or radiation were independent of either topoisomerase activity or DNA polymerase function but topoisomerases may have a regulatory role during the signalling of these mechanisms. Maintenance of correct DNA topology may prevent induction of the heat shock response, and heat shock induction of a component of the full radiation resistance in yeast may be the consequence of topoisomerase I inactivation. DNA polymerase I did not seem to have a role in the thermal tolerance or radioresistance mechanism in yeast. Synchronized G 1 or G 2 C. reinhardtii cells were neither radiosensitized nor did they become radioresistant in response to <b>heat</b> shock. However, <b>synchronized</b> G 1 or G 2 algal cells had a normal heat-induced thermotolerance response. Neither radiation, heat shock, nor cycloheximide suppressed chemical mutations in algae. The DNA repair capacity of C. reinhardtii was not altered by heat shock and in this organism chemical mutations were not a consequence of an induced error-prone repair system. Heat shock was capable of inducing only partial radioresistance in wild type yeast cells while radiation induced full radioresistance. Dot blot analysis of the RAD 52 epistasis group revealed that heat shock increased expression of only RAD 52 transcripts whereas radiation increased expression of RAD 52, 54, and 57 therefore demonstrating differential induction of repair genes by heat shock or radiation. Yeast mutants deficient in recombinational repair (rad 52) were radiosensitive and neither heat shock nor radiation exposure could induce radioresistance. Nonetheless these mutants exhibited enhanced expression of RAD 51, rad 52, RAD 54, 55, and 57 transcripts after either heat shock or radiation exposure. It was inferred that the inducible, non-functional rad 52 gene product was incapable of conferring radioresistance (repairing DNA damage) and, as a consequence, additional repair genes may have subsequently been induced in an unsuccessful attempt to repair the residual damage.
