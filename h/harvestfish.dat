5000|$|<b>Harvestfish</b> (American <b>harvestfish)</b> Peprilus paru (Linnaeus, 1758).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Harvestfish</b> is deep-bodied, round, and {{strongly}} compressed laterally with a forked caudal fin. It has long, curved, sickle-shaped dorsal and anal fins, lacks pelvic fins, a blunt snout, a small mouth, weak teeth, and lack a longitudinal [...] <b>Harvestfish</b> are usually silvery and , sometimes {{with a green}} tint on its dorsal half, with tinged yellow fins. They usually grow to about 18 to 30 cm in length. <b>Harvestfish</b> have 2-5 total dorsal spines, 38-47 total soft dorsal rays, 2-3 anal spines, and 35-45 soft anal rays. The <b>Harvestfish</b> also lacks the mucous pores situated below the anterior half of the dorsal fin that are conspicuous in the butterfish.|$|E
5000|$|Peprilus medius (W. K. H. Peters, 1869) (Pacific <b>harvestfish)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|These fish grow {{usually to}} about 20 cm in length, and are deep-bodied and circular-shaped, with curved fins, rounded nose and small mouth. <b>Harvestfish</b> are greenish silvery above, silvery {{sometimes}} tinged with yellow on its sides and belly and the fins of some individuals are slightly dusky or yellowish. Their habitat is the subtropical {{waters of the}} Western Atlantic: Chesapeake Bay and northern Gulf of Mexico in United States to Argentina. <b>Harvestfish</b> are sometimes caught commercially as a food fish.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Distribution== The <b>Harvestfish</b> {{distribution}} is Western Atlantic, {{as well as}} the Northern Gulf of Mexico to Argentina. They can range from Florida to Venezuela, Trinidad, and Antilles. They have been found in the western Caribbean.|$|E
50|$|Peprilus paru, (<b>harvestfish</b> or American harvestfish; syn. Peprilus alepidotus), also {{occasionally}} {{known by}} a few local names as star butter fish or sometimes even simply as butterfish, is a marine, benthopelagic, circular-shaped and deep-bodied fish classified in the family Stromateidae of butterfishes.|$|E
5000|$|As coldwater species, this {{jellyfish}} cannot {{cope with}} warmer waters. The jellyfish are pelagic {{for most of}} their lives but tend to settle in shallow, sheltered bays towards the end of their one-year lifespan. In the open ocean, lion's mane jellyfish act as floating oases for certain species, such as shrimp, medusafish, butterfish, <b>harvestfish,</b> and juvenile prowfish, providing both a reliable source of food and protection from predators [...]|$|E
5000|$|... ==Habitat== The <b>Harvestfish</b> is a pelagic {{schooling}} fish {{found in}} subtropical waters in coastal bays and inshore waters over the continental shelf at moderate depths. Juveniles {{can be found}} in shallow coastal waters or near coastal estuaries. They are known for their habit of swimming under certain species of jellyfishes, where they find shelter and perhaps a food supply of small invertebrates that have become entangled in the tentacles, but they are also subject to fatal stings inflicted by these tentacles.|$|E
50|$|Fish of {{this species}} are usually deep-bodied, {{flattened}} sideways, and somewhat circular or rounded, with blunt noses and small mouths with weak teeth. Some other characteristics of this fish are the absence of ventral fins, one long, continuous dorsal fin, long pectoral fins, and tiny, cycloid scales. The tail fin is nearly {{as long as the}} dorsal fin and deeply forked. The American butterfish is similar in appearance to its close relative, the <b>harvestfish</b> (Peprilus alepidotus), but can be distinguished by its much lower dorsal and tail fin.|$|E
