30|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether hysteroscopic metroplasty for septate uterus represents a risk factor of adverse outcome in pregnancy, during labor, and after delivery.

No difference in obstetric outcome (preterm labor, hemorrhage before and after <b>delivery,</b> <b>mean</b> weeks of gestation at <b>delivery,</b> <b>mean</b> birth weight, breech presentation, and cesarean section rate) between the two groups has been found. The results of this study suggest that patients who underwent hysteroscopic metroplasty for septate uterus are at no higher risk of adverse obstetric outcome at term and during labor, comparing to the general population. Though vaginal delivery seems to be safe, rare but serious complication, reported by several studies, like uterine rupture during pregnancy or labor, should always be taken into consideration.|$|R

5000|$|For {{the general}} scholar, the term <b>delivery</b> <b>means</b> {{the way in}} which a form of {{information}} is conveyed to a particular audience or group of people. These ideas of delivery could mean hearing information spoken at a conference or reading the newspaper. The forms can range from podcasts to videos, pictures to text, or even songs and newspapers. Delivery is the modem in which information is given in order for the topic to be best understood and related to. The term [...] "delivery" [...] is often aligned with the term [...] "performance". The Forest of Rhetoric states that delivery is not only the fifth canon of rhetoric, {{but it is also a}} translation of the word [...] "hypokrisis", or [...] "acting". This Greek word was translated into delivery in the standpoint of spoken or recited information rather than newspapers or essays. Performance of plays, speeches, skits, etc. turns into the delivery of information in the piece being performed or spoken. This is the same as a piece of literature or rhetoric delivering its information through word choice, layout, and structure.|$|E
5000|$|A Connectionless packet {{delivery}} (or packet-switched) system (or service) {{is offered}} by the Internet, because it adapts well to different hardware, including best-effort delivery mechanisms like the ethernet. Connectionless <b>delivery</b> <b>means</b> that the messages or streams are divided into pieces that are multiplexed separately on the high speed intermachine connections allowing the connections to be used concurrently. Each piece carries information identifying the destination. The delivery of packets {{is said to be}} unreliable, because packets may be lost, duplicated, delayed or delivered out of order without notice to the sender or receiver. Unreliability arises only when resources are exhausted or underlying networks fail. The unreliable connectionless delivery system is defined by the Internet Protocol (IP). The protocol also specifies the routing function, which chooses a path over which data will be sent. It is also possible to use TCP/IP protocols on connection oriented systems. Connection oriented systems build up virtual circuits (paths for exclusive use) between senders and receivers. Once built up the IP datagrams are sent as if they were data through the virtual circuits and forwarded (as data) to the IP protocol modules. This technique, called tunneling, can be used on X.25 networks and ATM networks.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently {{interest}} in idiopathic (neurogenic) faecal incontinence has swung from denervation {{of the external}} anal sphincter to the internal sphincter. AIMS: To evaluate the effects of vaginal delivery on the internal sphincter. SUBJECTS: 1372 mothers were studied antenatally and 1202 were accepted into the study. METHODS: Sphincter pressures were measured antenatally, in the early postnatal period, and six to 10 weeks later in selected patients. RESULTS: 755 of 1202 subjects assessed antenatally were primiparous women and 447 multiparous women. Some 320 previous spontaneous vaginal <b>deliveries</b> (SVD) (<b>mean</b> 59 mm Hg) and 67 previous forceps <b>deliveries</b> (<b>mean</b> 58 mm Hg) had lower resting pressures than 755 primiparous women (mean 66 mm Hg) (p < 0. 01). A total of 493 subjects were reassessed postnatally. There were 372 SVDs, 47 vacuum extractions, 20 forceps, and 54 caesarean deliveries. All vaginal deliveries but not caesarean sections dropped their resting anal pressures from antenatal values (p < 0. 001). Some 227 first SVDs had a much greater fall than 145 subsequent SVDs. In 162 subjects who had undergone their first vaginal delivery and who were followed up there was some recovery but the resting pressures were still lowered at six to 10 weeks post partum.

Exposure to traumatic life events such as child abuse, neglect and domestic violence is a driver of service need.
