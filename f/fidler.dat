5|$|The Doug Anthony All Stars (or Doug Anthony Allstars, DAAS, D.A.A.S. or stylised as D⋆A†A☭S) are an Australian musical comedy, {{alternative}} {{rock and}} vocal group who initially performed together between 1984 and 1994. The band is an acoustic trio, originally comprising Paul McDermott and Tim Ferguson on main vocals and Richard <b>Fidler</b> on guitar and backing vocals. The group reformed in 2014, with Paul Livingston (aka Flacco) replacing <b>Fidler</b> on guitar.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Fidler</b> {{had been}} advocating {{for the group}} to reform for years, his work {{commitments}} with ABC Radio prevented him from participating and Livingston again filled his place as the group's guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{proposals}} for {{completion of the}} tunnel have come from New York City Councilman Lewis <b>Fidler,</b> who has proposed 0.33% tax for the tri-state region {{to pay for the}} construction. The tunnel was listed as one of many projects that could receive federal funds that were to have been allocated to the Access to the Region's Core tunnel, which was canceled in October 2010. State Senator Diane Savino was among the supporters of the tunnel; Savino stated that if built, the tunnel would cost $3 billion and would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment.|$|E

5|$|The Army assumed {{responsibility}} for the Manhattan Project on 17 September 1942, with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., as director, although the Army did not formally take over the contracts with the University of California from the OSRD until 1 May 1943. Major Thomas T. Crenshaw, Jr., became California Area Engineer in August 1942, with Captain Harold A. <b>Fidler,</b> who soon replaced him, as his assistant. Crenshaw established {{his office in the}} Donner Laboratory at the University of California. In September 1942, the S-1 Executive Committee recommended that a five-tank pilot plant be built along with a 200-tank section of a production plant.|$|E
5|$|Indictment against Blythe {{was brought}} by State Attorney Vladimír Mužík. Mužík had tried {{a number of}} murderers, such as Luboš Mika (life in prison), Roman <b>Fidler</b> (life {{imprisonment}} at 1st instance, 25 years on appeal), Maria Zolotukinová (13 years imprisonment) and Petr Procházka (11 years imprisonment). He also tried a case against Andranik Soghojan, an alleged head of Russian mafia, requesting 25 {{years in prison for}} ordering a murder. The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted Soghojan due to lack of evidence; however, the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court, and the case will be heard again by a different tribunal of the Municipal Court. Another of Mužík's murder cases which ended in acquittal due to insufficient evidence is that of Miroslav Rus, who was indicted in connection with disappearance of Miroslav Kříž, a vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association.|$|E
5|$|With Piper's departure, Paul McDermott, who {{performed}} {{at one of}} DAAS's regular clubs, was invited to join. He accepted, {{although he did not}} like their material, which he considered too sweet. <b>Fidler</b> says McDermott changed the group's dynamic; he wrote the majority of their songs and prompted a darker tone. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, where they based themselves with a regular gig at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, in an effort to save enough money to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe. Initially DAAS found that Melbourne audiences did not respond to their act and to provoke a reaction they became more aggressive, with McDermott and Ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often picking on Fidler's naturally happy but stupid character. They made their first overseas performance at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1987, to sold out crowds.|$|E

25|$|<b>Fidler</b> also {{submitted}} regular {{reports on}} {{the activity of the}} Radiation Laboratory to the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., and briefed him, on his visits to Berkeley, which were made about once a month between October 1942 and November 1943. As part of his role in coordinating the electromagnetic process, <b>Fidler</b> occasionally visited Chicago, which was more convenient for contractors like Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis Chalmers; Boston, where the offices of Stone & Webster, the main engineering contractor were located; and the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He attained the rank of major. After World War II ended in August 1945, <b>Fidler</b> was transferred to Tennessee, where he worked on the declassification of Manhattan Project documents. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work on the Manhattan Project, which was presented by Groves at a ceremony at Lawrence's home on October 21, 1945.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, {{one third}} of housing within Birmingham was {{declared}} unfit for habitation and a major construction programme was needed to deal with problem. By 1950, Birmingham City Council had been constructing municipal housing to accommodate the rising population of Birmingham and to accommodate those who had been displaced by the slum clearances in the inner-city areas of the city, similar to the process which had started some 30 years earlier when the first council houses were built. Municipal house construction developed into high-rise construction in the mid-1950s with the guidance of Alwyn Sheppard <b>Fidler,</b> the City Architect of Birmingham. By 1962, however, the city council was demolishing more houses than it was constructing and <b>Fidler</b> urged the council to adopt the French Camus system which consisted of housing at a density of approximately 50 houses per hectare and 80 people per acre. The council refused this and demanded 48 homes per hectare with 75 people per acre. In a final attempt to convince the council, he proposed a 'garden city' layout for the Castle Bromwich Airfield site in 1963. This too was rejected and, as a result, <b>Fidler</b> resigned from his position. He was quickly succeeded by J. R. Sheridan-Shedden, the deputy City Architect who held the position temporarily. Upon taking the position, he designed a revised masterplan for the Castle Bromwich Airfield estate. The new masterplan used the Radburn Layout which consisted of super-blocks of housing, schools, retail and offices around a communal open space, a concept which was created by Clarence Stein in Radburn, New Jersey in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Harold Alvin <b>Fidler</b> (August 02, 1910 – April 2, 2004) was the Associate Director of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory from 1958 to 1974.

Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, which was {{developing}} calutrons for electromagnetic isotope separation. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the administration of contracts between the Army and the University of California.|$|E

25|$|<b>Fidler</b> {{left the}} Army, but {{continued}} to work on declassification in Washington, D.C., for the Atomic Energy Commission, which replaced the Manhattan Project on January 1, 1947. In 1949, he returned to Berkeley as the Atomic Energy Commission's Area Manager on the West Coast. In this capacity {{he was responsible for}} research activities on the West Coast, and was involved in the selection of the site for the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, the Atomic Energy Commission's second weapons laboratory.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 1958, at {{the request}} of Ernest Lawrence, <b>Fidler</b> joined the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory as Associate Director. He {{remained}} in the role until 1974, when he and the director, Edwin McMillan, both retired. He also served on the Atomic Energy Commission's Management Advisory Committee from 1962 to 1972. He died at his Piedmont Gardens Retirement Community home in Oakland, California, on April 2, 2004. He was survived by his three children, his wife having predeceased him in 1991.|$|E
25|$|The council {{attempted}} {{to limit the}} damage caused to their reputation {{as a result of}} the scandal surrounding the resignation of <b>Fidler</b> by agreeing to embark on the major building project at Castle Bromwich with five new goals. These were increasing housing output at the estate by a further 4,000 homes, which was aimed to reduce the cost of dwellings, introducing industrialised forms of construction to save labour, attracting new national contractors to work in Birmingham, and increase capacity by providing continuous work for contractors.|$|E

25|$|The first written {{account of}} present-day Alberta {{comes to us}} from the fur trader Anthony Henday, who {{explored}} the vicinity of present-day Red Deer and Edmonton in 1754–55. He spent the winter with a group of Blackfoot, with whom he traded and went buffalo hunting. Other important early explorers of Alberta include Peter <b>Fidler,</b> David Thompson, Peter Pond, Alexander MacKenzie, and George Simpson. The first European settlement was founded at Fort Chipewyan by MacKenzie in 1788, although Fort Vermilion disputes this claim, having also been founded in 1788.|$|E
25|$|Back at the Red River District, HBC trader Peter <b>Fidler</b> {{arrived at}} Lake Manitoba with a cargo of trade goods on September 4. NWC clerk Seraphim Lamarre {{gathered}} a small force of Métis to assault <b>Fidler,</b> but finding that Fidler’s party was too large {{and under the}} protection of local Indians, Lamarre retreated to Fort Douglas. Alexander Macdonell reinforced Lamarre with 12 or 15 more Métis and Lamarre successfully plundered Fidler’s goods in late September. On September 5, the Nor’Westers at Red River learned of Selkirk’s capture of Fort William, Alexander Macdonell, Archibald Mclellan and Cuthbert Grant met at Bas de la Rivière and proposed to raise a force to retake it, but the Métis refused on account of Selkirk being accompanied by government soldiers, instead the Métis decided to stay and defend the Red River colony. Mclellan then departed for Fort William with a small force of voyageurs and two Métis who agreed to go as far as Lac la Pluie. With Lac la Pluie in his control, Captain D’Orsonnes and a party of 28 Du Meuron soldiers with two cannons went out on snow shoes and sledges to recapture the Red River Colony. In 40 days they reached Pembina and seized it. Hearing rumours that Fort Douglas was only held by a handful of men, D’Orsonnes moved to retake it. He encamped 10 miles south of Fort Douglas in a dense wood and built scaling ladders for a night attack.|$|E
