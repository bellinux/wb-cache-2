Terri Dowty, one of the report's authors, replied, 'it's an appalling aspersion to throw {{at some of the}} leading academics in this field. I'm astonished they are challenging the evidence we used since much of the evidence in the report is from the Government itself.' Action on Rights for Children said that the proposals invaded a child's right to privacy given by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while the Joint Committee on Human Rights said that the 'serious interference' with the rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to respect for private life – seemed to be 'difficult to justify'.

2500|$|However, this {{indirect}} penetration in {{the aftermath}} of the Yen Bai mutiny seems to have been the evolution of a process that had begun at least six months earlier. Several sources indicate that this was triggered by the French crackdown on the VNQDD and other revolutionary independence organisations in early 1929. The crackdown had uncovered the extent of the VNQDD's systematic infiltration of the army, and had prompted a military crackdown on troops with connections to such organisations. By October 1929, after heavy civilian criticism of the military's <b>information</b> <b>policy</b> in July, army authorities had realised the need to systematically gather intelligence to deal with the threat from new forms of anti-colonial organisation. As such information could be collected only by the Sûreté, the implication was that the military had to work more closely with the colonial political police. Three weeks before Yen Bai, Governor General Pasquier had congratulated General Commandant Superior Aubert on the [...] "most favourable results" [...] of [...] "close [...] collaboration".|$|E

Zorthian possessed both experience with the media {{and a great deal of}} patience and tact while maintaining reasonably good relations with the press corps. Media correspondents were invited to attend nightly MACV briefings covering the day's events that became known as the Five O'Clock Follies, most correspondents considering these briefings to be a waste of time. The Saigon bureau chiefs were also often invited to closed sessions at which presentations would be made by a briefing officer, the CIA station chief, or an official from the embassy who would present background or off-the-record information on upcoming military operations or Vietnamese political events.|$|E

Deputy Interior Minister Shota Khizanishvili also affirmed that the militants' bodies will be buried in accordance with their faith. On September 3–4, three of the killed militants (Baghakashvili, Kavtarashvili and Margoshvili) were buried by residents of Duisi in the Pankisi Gorge. On September 3, the Georgian Dream opposition issued a statement condemning [...] "the criminally irresponsible <b>information</b> <b>policy</b> of the authorities" [...] and said that [...] "horrifying details are being reported about moral pressure exerted on relatives" [...] of the killed gunmen by the government officials allegedly trying to hide the fact there were Georgian citizens among the members of the armed group. Allegedly, government officials conducted at least one burial at night and family members were forbidden to gather people for a funeral or even to see the body. The killed Chechens were buried also in Duisi village cemetery at night of October 30. Reportedly, family members of one of the killed Chechens arrived in Georgia in September but the government refused to hand over the body to them. In May 2013, the authorities re-examined corpses of Baghakashvili, Margoshvili and Zaurbekov; family members said they agreed for exhumations to be conducted despite Islam forbidding removing the dead from their graves, because they too want to find the truth. The bodies were exhumed in order to determine precisely how they died, as the results of the original postmortems have disappeared.|$|E

40|$|Researchers and {{information}} security professionals share {{an understanding of}} information securitypolicies {{as the foundation of}} organizational information security. A major concern for informationsecurity professionals is that only seldom do these policies bring about the expected outcomes. Inefforts to understand this problem, researchers have concentrated on different approaches formotivating end-users to comply with the <b>information</b> security <b>policies</b> but left the differences inorganizational groups and their expectations of these policies for little attention. This thesisanalyzes the impact of key organizational groups' perceptions of <b>information</b> security <b>policies</b> to theimplementation and use of these policies in the light of a theoretical framework that draws on theliterature on frames of reference and on <b>information</b> security <b>policies.</b> We propose a concept ofInformation Security Policy Frames of Reference (ISPFOR) as a means for understanding theseperceptions and their consequences. Our empirical findings from an interpretive case studyhighlight that organizational groups' perceptions of <b>information</b> security <b>policies</b> deserve attentionin regard to formulating and implementing <b>information</b> security <b>policies</b> in organizations. The thesisconcludes by arguing that frames of reference perspective, a perspective prominent in informationsystems research but not yet applied in the context of <b>information</b> security <b>policies,</b> offers acompelling explanation for problems around <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> implementation and use inorganizations and provides new insight into employees' perceptions of <b>information</b> security <b>policies.</b> Validerat; 20110607 (anonymous...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of a European public sphere is a very topical issue at the current stage of development of the European Union. It has gained a particular momentum since {{the rejection of the}} Constitutional Treaty in the public referenda held in France and the Netherlands in 2005, but the emerging gap between the European institutions and the citizens of Europe had been recognized already in the early 1990 s {{at the time of the}} Maastricht Treaty, and has been well documented since by successive polls of public opinion organized by the Commission through its Eurobarometer surveys.

40|$|This study {{originated}} from the realisation {{that the information}} security industry has identified the <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> {{as one of the}} most important information security management controls. Within the industry there are, however, differing views as to what constitutes an <b>information</b> security <b>policy,</b> what it should contain, how it should be developed and how it should best be disseminated and managed. Numerous organisations claim to have an <b>information</b> security <b>policy,</b> but admit that it is not an effective control. The principal aim of this study is to make a contribution to the information security discipline by defining what an <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> is, where it fits into the broader information security management framework, what elements an effective policy should contain, how it should be disseminated and how the document is best kept relevant, practical, up-to-date and efficient. The study develops and documents various processes and methodologies needed to ensure the effectiveness of the <b>information</b> security <b>policy,</b> such as the dissemination process and the <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> management lifecycle. The study consists of five parts, of which Part I serves as introduction to the research topic. It provides background information to the topic and lays the foundation for the rest of the dissertation. Chapter 1 specifically deals with the research topic, the motivation for it and the issues addressed by the dissertation. Chapter 2 looks at the concept of information security management and what it consists of, highlighting the role an <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> has to play in the discipline. Chapter 3 introduces the various international information security standards and codes of practice that are referred to, examined and analysed in the dissertation. This chapter specifically highlights how and to what extent each of these address the topic of the <b>information</b> security <b>policy.</b> Part II introduces the concept of the <b>information</b> security <b>policy.</b> Chapter 4 provides the background to what an <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> is and where it fits into the broader structure of an organisation’s governance framework. Chapter 5 specifies what an effective <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> is and what components are needed to ensure its success as an information security control. Part III expands the components of an effective <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> as introduced in Chapter 5. This part consists of Chapters 6 to 8, with each of these addressing a single component. Chapter 6 further investigated the development of the <b>information</b> security <b>policy.</b> The dissemination of the document is discussed in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 expands the concept of the <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> management lifecycle. Part IV consists of Chapter 9, which deals with a case study applying the various processes and methodologies defined in the previous part. The case study deals with a fictitious organisation and provides detailed background information to indicate how the organisation should approach the development and dissemination of the <b>information</b> security <b>policy.</b> Some of the examples constructed from the case study include a sample <b>information</b> security <b>policy</b> and a presentation to be used as introduction to the <b>information</b> security <b>policy.</b> The dissertation is concluded in Chapter 10. This chapter provides a summarised overview of the research and the issues addressed in it. Prof. J. H. P. Ehler...|$|R
