25|$|Raiden {{returns in}} the {{crossover}} fighting game Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. He plays {{a significant role}} in the story mode for the game, being in part responsible for creating Dark Kahn (alongside his DC counterpart Superman), which in turn causes the Mortal Kombat and DC Universes to merge. He also comes into contact with Batman when he rescues Liu Kang from him after Batman detains him for questioning regarding the merging of the worlds. Raiden attempts to electrocute Batman but finds it has no effect due to his <b>insulated</b> <b>body</b> armor. After a brief skirmish, Raiden is able to teleport himself away from the UN Orbital Space Station with Kang in tow. He later challenges Sub-Zero into a fight and later the enraged Captain Marvel, who tells him to leave. After the large battle between the Mortal Kombat warriors and the DC heroes and villains, he defeats Shang Tsung and Kang. Realizing his mistake, he teams up with Superman to defeat Dark Kahn, and later imprisons Darkseid in the Netherrealm. In his endings, Raiden returns to his realm to find that exposure to his world's sun has weakened him greatly. The sorcerer Quan Chi offers him a large jade amulet with unknown origins that would restore his powers. Raiden is given a choice between a life of servitude to the sorcerer, or mortality.|$|E

Even this pause may have been enough to cause convulsions of the earth above; indeed, I gathered from Marama and other Orofenans that such convulsions had occurred on and around the island at what must have corresponded with that moment of the loosing of the force.|$|E

It had a restyled front entry centre exit body to 40 ft by 8 ft 6in dimensions with a long (22 ft) wheelbase and was the only rear-engined Olympic, having a vertical Leyland O.680 transversely mounted under the rear bench seat. Transmission was by a 90° gear train into a Spicer 'Torquematic' torque converter then into a modified Worldmaster style rear axle. It had a very comprehensive heating and ventilation system and an <b>insulated</b> <b>body.</b> Unlike other Olympics it had all-round air suspension.

In the episode [...] "Interactions", Maxwell Dillon is {{electrocuted}} {{in a freak accident}} after his power drill falls onto a damaged computer console: {{when he tries}} to pick it up, the resulting electrical shock sends him flying against a specialized tank holding genetically altered electric eels, becoming exposed to the substance inside. Although Max survived, his body became an unstable living electrical capacitate. He is then forced to wear an <b>insulated</b> <b>body</b> suit to contain the bio-electricity being produced in order to protect others around him, especially his face which had transformed into an electrical field. After an encounter with Spider-Man, Max goes berserk and takes up the name 'Electro' [...] Electro then rushes out to Doctor Connors's lab, demanding that Connors cure him. He is interrupted by Spider-Man again and the two battle. Spider-Man defeats Electro by tossing him into a swimming pool which short-circuits him, knocking him unconscious.

40|$|In {{scenarios}} {{of a future}} energy provision, liquid hydrogen has, as an environmentally benign energy carrier, advantages compared to other alternatives (for instance the pollution-free oxidation to water). However, in consideration of hazards associated with hydrogen when mixed with air, the assessment of conceivable risks and its jeopardizing potential after an inadvertant release has to be performed. The tools for such a risk analysis are calculation models to simulate conceivable accidents {{with the release of}} cryogenic liquids as realistic as possible. The spreading and vaporization of cryogenic liquids, as a part of it, has been investigated in this work. Experiments have been conducted to study the vaporization of liquid nitrogen (LN_ 2) over <b>insulated</b> <b>bodies</b> of macadam and concrete (dry/moist). For moist concrete, the time until a complete vaporization of the LN_ 2 is significantly smaller than for dry concrete. Also, the radial pool spreading and vaporization of liquid nitrogen over water and of liquid hydrogen over water and aluminium has been experimentally examined. After spreading of the cryogenic liquid over a water surface, ice formation has been observed. To simulate vaporization over <b>insulated</b> <b>bodies</b> as well as pool spreading over water and solid grounds, the computer model LAuV (LachenAusbreitung und Verdampfung) has been developed. The results of postcalculations are in good agreement with the measurement data of the above mentioned own experiments as well as of literature data. Postcalculations have been made for liquid natural gas, liquid nitrogen, and liquid hydrogen.

50|$|Fats {{are also}} sources of {{essential}} fatty acids, an important dietary requirement. They provide energy as noted above. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble, meaning {{they can only}} be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats. Fats {{play a vital role}} in maintaining healthy skin and hair, <b>insulating</b> <b>body</b> organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function. Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases. When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute—or at least maintain equilibrium of—the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue. This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as excretion, urination, accidental or intentional bloodletting, sebum excretion, and hair growth.|$|R
50|$|While {{hibernation}} {{has long}} been studied in rodents, namely ground squirrels, no primate or tropical mammal was known to hibernate prior to the discovery that the fat-tailed dwarf lemur of Madagascar hibernates in tree holes for seven months of the year. Malagasy winter temperatures sometimes rise to over 30 C, so hibernation is not exclusively an adaptation to low ambient temperatures. The hibernation of this lemur {{is strongly dependent on}} the thermal behaviour of its tree hole: if the hole is poorly <b>insulated,</b> the lemur's <b>body</b> temperature fluctuates widely, passively following the ambient temperature; if well <b>insulated,</b> the <b>body</b> temperature stays fairly constant and the animal undergoes regular spells of arousal.
