2500|$|The GDP of the Philippines rose {{during the}} martial law, rising from P55 million to P193 million in about 8 years. This growth was spurred by massive lending from {{commercial}} banks, accounting for about 62% percent of external debt. As a developing country, the Philippines during the martial law {{was one of}} the heaviest borrowers. These aggressive moves were seen by critics as a means of legitimizing martial law by purportedly enhancing the chances of the country in the global market. Much of the money was spent on pump-priming to improve infrastructure and promote tourism. However, despite the aggressive borrowing and spending policies, the Philippines lagged behind its Southeast Asia counterparts in GDP growth rate per capita. The country, in 1970–1980, only registered an average 3.4 percent growth, while its counterparts like Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia garnered a mean growth of 5.4 percent.
