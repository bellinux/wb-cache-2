40|$|Faced with {{a future}} of rising energy costs {{there is a need}} for {{industry}} to manage energy more carefully in order to meet its economic objectives. A problem besetting the growth of energy conservation in the UK is that a large proportion of energy consumption is used in a low intensive manner in organisations where they would be responsibility for energy efficiency is spread over a large number of personnel who each see only small energy costs. In relation to this problem in the non-energy intensive industrial sector, an application of an energy management technique known as monitoring and targeting (M & T) has been installed at the Whetstone site of the General Electric Company Limited in an attempt to prove it as a means for motivating line management and personnel to save energy. The objective energy saving for which the M & T was devised is very specific. During early energy conservation work at the site there had been a change from continuous to intermittent heating but the maintenance of the strategy was receiving a poor level of commitment from line management and performance was some 5 % - 10 % less than expected. The M & T is concerned therefore with heat for space heating for which a heat metering system was required. Metering of the site <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> system posed technical difficulties and expenditure was also limited. This led to a ‘tin-house' design being installed for a price less than the commercial equivalent. The timespan of work to achieve an operational heat metering system was 3 years which meant that energy saving results from the scheme were not observed during the study. If successful the replication potential is the larger non energy intensive sites from which some 30 PT savings could be expected in the UK...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the analysis of industrial energy use for the purposes of reducing that use to a minimum within the constraints imposed by the existing plant. The work is divided into two parts. Firstly, a general analysis of the energy used in an industrial plant is made for the year 1986. Based on monthly records of energy consumption and environmental parameters, it is primarily intended to heighten management awareness of energy flows and the relative contributions from each energy type towards the total annual consumption and cost. It is performed using a suite of interactive linked computer programs and the data is reduced to a graphical form for presentation in a report. The analysis is a first approximation, assuming steady state conditions with many parameters time and space averaged, but is justified by the findings that monetary savings approaching 5 % of the annual energy bill could be made with changes to operational procedures alone. As a result of this work, it was revealed that the boiler-house supplying the majority of the plant with <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> for process and space heating requirements used {{more than half of the}} total annual energy requirements and that potential energy savings were likely. Secondly, a detailed analysis of the energy used by the boiler-house is- carried out. A real time monitoring and targeting system which records and displays boiler, environmental and plant parameters is developed and installed. Data gathered over a period of six months enables (i) specific cases of energy wastage resulting from operational procedures to be identified and (ii) trends of performance indicating poor energy efficiency to be traced. The system developed may be used to provide the information necessary to enable improved control. A general result which may be inferred from this work would be that the combined approaches of a topdown general analysis and a bottom-up detailed analysis of energy use can provide significant opportunities for energy conservation resulting solely from the improved operation of large energy consuming plant. The work was performed at a major manufacturing plant in the U. K. with an annual energy consumption of the order of 600 gigawatt-hours and an annual energy bill of the order of E 10 million...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{is to improve the}} control and provide a more cost-efficient operation in the direct heating of stored domestic or industrial fluid mediums; such to be achieved by means of an intelligent automated energy management system. For the residential customer this system concept applies to the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply as stored in the familiar <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> cylinder; for the industrial or commercial customer the scope is considerably greater with larger quantities and varieties of fluid mediums. Both areas can obtain significant financial savings with improved energy management. Both consumers and power supply and distribution companies will benefit with increased utilisation of cheaper 'off-peak' electricity; reducing costs and spreading the system load demand. The project has focussed on domestic energy management with a definite view to the wider field of industrial applications. Domestic energy control methodology and equipment has not significantly altered for decades. However, computer hardware and software has since then flourished to an unprecedented proportion and has become relatively cheap and versatile; these factors pave the way for the application of computer technology in this area of great potential. The technology allows the implementation of a 'hot water energy management system', which makes a forecast of the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> demand for the next 24 hours and proceeds to provide this demand in the most efficient manner possible. In the (near) future, the system, known as FEMS for Fluid Energy Management System, is able to take advantage and in fact will promote the use of a retail 'dynamic spot price tariff’. FEMS is a combination of hardware and software developed to replace the existing cylinder thermostat, take care of the necessary data-acquisition and control the cylinder's total energy instead of it's (single point) temperature. This provides, besides heating cost reduction, a greater accuracy, a degree of flexibility, improved feedback, legionella inhibition, and a diagnostic capability. To the domestic consumer the latter three items are of greatest relevance. The crux of the system lies in its predictive ability. Having explored the more conventional alternatives, a suitable solution was found in the utilisation of the Elman recurrent neural networks, which focus on the temporal characteristics of the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> demand time series and are able to adapt to changing environments, coping with the presence of any non-linearity and noise in the data. Prior to developing FEMS a study was made of the basic fluid behaviour in medium and <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> domestic <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> cylinders, an area not well-covered to date and of interest to engineers and manufacturers alike. For this step data acquisition equipment and software was purposely created. The control software plus equipment were combined into a fully automated test system with minimal operator input, allowing a large amount of data to be gathered over a period measured in months. A similar system was subsequently used to collect actual <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> demand data from a residential family, and in fact forms the basis for FEMS. Finally an enhanced version of FEMS is discussed and it is shown how the system is able to output multiple prediction and utilise varying tariff rates...|$|R

Adhesion to thermoplastic olefin (TPO) substrates, like blends of polypropylene (PP), is often difficult to attain due to the low surface energy and the nonpolar nature of the surface. One always specifies, therefore, that the surface of the substrate must be pretreated. Pretreatment methods can vary, from oxidation of the surface, e. g., plasma or flame, to diffusion and mechanical interlocking of an applied polymer to the surface. Mechanical interlocking to the nonpolar TPO surface can be achieved through the use of an adhesion promoter, namely a chlorinated polyolefin (CPO). The type of CPO used, in addition to the types of solvents and flame treatments used, can substantially influence the degree of adhesion/cohesion obtained within the CPO/TPO system. PP is a TPO that is used in automobile construction. In this report it is described a set of experiments that provide quantitative information about how CPOs optimize the adhesion of a commercial primer coating to PP. The study was performed according to eight CPOs and two different ways of flame treatment. The CPOs were prepared by mixing them with a standard primer in order to investigate what type of CPO optimized better the adhesion of the primer to a PP substrate. On the other hand, the experiments were started with non ideal parameters for the flame treatment and were changed for the final experiment to work at its best. To study the paint adhesion a steam jet test was used. This consists of an assay based in <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> cleaners.

Measurements {{were carried out}} with a cylindrical test module containing a single hollow fibre membrane in the centre and a well-defined air gap situated around the fibre. The experimental {{results show that the}} previous developed predictive model, with membrane parameters determined from gas permeation experiments, describes correctly the dependence of water vapour flux on temperature level, temperature difference, air gap total <b>pressure,</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> flow and membrane type. At atmospheric air gap pressure, the measured fluxes per saturated water vapour pressure difference between the bulk flows (0. 08 – 0. 10 kg/m 2 h mbar) are comparable with those presented in literature. A reduction of the total air gap pressure to the saturated water vapour <b>pressure</b> of the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> feed flow temperature of 65 °C, raises the flux by a factor of three. Next to the water vapour flux, the energy efficiency of the process is very important. The measured energy efficiencies (typically 85 – 90 % for a 3 mm air gap and a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> feed temperature of 65 °C) are slightly below the theoretical values (95 – 98 %), which could be explained by a small heat loss to the surroundings. For air gaps of 1. 5 mm or smaller, the energy efficiency is reduced to less than 70 %, due to thermal conduction across product water bridges between the membrane fibre and the condenser surface.
