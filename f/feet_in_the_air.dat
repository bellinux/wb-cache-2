5|$|In Washington, D.C., {{sustained}} winds remained below {{tropical storm}} force, though gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) as {{recorded by the}} National Academy of Science. Hurricane-force winds existed several hundred <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> with wind sensors {{on the top of}} tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85mph (115 to 135km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. A gauge on Wisconsin Avenue recorded a storm surge of 11.3feet (3.4m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25feet (3.1m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane.|$|E

25|$|Walking {{differs from}} a running gait {{in a number}} of ways. The most obvious is that during walking one leg always stays on the ground while the other is swinging.

25|$|The fast-paced {{construction}} schedule led to contractors {{to use a}} self-climbing form system to build the towers. The formwork, supplied by PERI, provided a solution to meet the tight construction tolerances and provide safe access for workers laboring hundreds of <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The self-climbing system meant that the tower cranes {{did not have to}} spend time raising the forms after each segment of concrete hardened, and instead could be better used to haul material from barges below.|$|E

Bossy was also noted for his clean play, never resorting to fighting (and being one of the first players to speak out against violence on the ice), and winning the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play three times: 1983, 1984, and 1986.|$|E
25|$|In , a {{different}} {{version of the}} Batmobile retains its classic-shape and designs; but is heavily influenced by The Dark Knight Trilogy Tumbler. The car is heavier than a tank, its ability to absorb impact makes it nearly indestructible, and affected anything it collided with in similar fashion. It can be called to Batman instantly with the press of a button and can eject Batman hundreds of <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> to instantly begin gliding. Batman can also control the Batmobile remotely using his Batmobile Remote gadget and it can even support Batman while he is fighting free flow combat via a Batmobile assisted Special Takedown. Like the Batsuit and gadgets, the Batmobile can be upgraded and even has its own alternate skins (such as one based on the Batmobile from 1960 TV series). The game also features Batmobiles from the 1960 TV Series and the films appear as DLC and are used in special Racing AR Challenges.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} wave of raids across Northern Ireland, 342 people were arrested. Many of those arrested {{reported}} that they and their families were assaulted, verbally abused and threatened by the soldiers. There were claims of soldiers smashing their way into houses without warning and firing baton rounds through doors and windows. Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having the barrel of a gun pressed against their heads, being dragged by the hair, being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a human shield. Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter.

According to DWP founder Danny Whetstone, using Barco helped with seamless projection and brightness adjustment: [...] "It was essential that we hang the projectors straight down, 151 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> lens to field, in order to fill the enormous visual area with the converged image".

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Lafayette High School in 1977, Taylor {{attended}} the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill {{where he was}} a team captain, and wore No. 98. Originally recruited as a defensive lineman, Taylor switched to linebacker before the 1979 season. He had 16 sacks in his final year there (1980), and set numerous defensive records. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in 1980. While there the coaching staff marveled at his intense, reckless style of play. [...] "As a freshman playing on special teams, he'd jump a good six or seven <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> to block a punt, then land {{on the back of his}} neck", said North Carolina assistant coach Bobby Cale.

500|$|A {{miniature}} {{model of}} the Boeing 747 airplane was created for the explosion scene. [...] The model, {{one of the most}} detailed miniature scenes in the film, was about 10 feet long and 7 feet wide, and the landing gear was made from all machined metals. According to visual effects supervisor Ariel Velasco Shaw, the miniature had to be launched about 40 feet up into the air {{to make it look like}} a real Boeing 747 exploded into a fireball. [...] If blowing up a four-foot plane, the explosion must be a minimum of eight <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> [...] To film the explosion in detail, the crew used three cameras running 120 frames per second and one camera running 300 frames per second (if they had filmed using a real-time camera, the succession of the explosion would not be filmed in a particular order).|$|E
50|$|The Reverse Layup is {{the most}} stylish and {{effective}} method of making the ball from close. Generally you fake the defender into defending a regular layup on the near side and then jump {{to the far side}} of the basket before shooting. For this move to work, one must dribble to the basket, and taking note of the opponents already there. Make a fake right (left) hand layup while cutting under the basket and opponents. Take two steps, and jump off <b>the</b> right (left) <b>foot.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> make a sweeping hook shot with the left (right) hand.

They stripped him naked, smashed his kneecaps with a bat, one of them shot him with a gun, broke his ribs, stuck him with sharp objects, used a cattle prod on his penis and anus making him lose his bowels, burned parts of his body with a blow torch, and told him how they were going to kill his wife and children if he did not confess.
