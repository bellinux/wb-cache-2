5|$|The Academy of St Olave's, {{a chamber}} {{orchestra}} which gives concerts in St Olave's Church, Marygate, {{is one of}} the music groups that perform regularly in York. A former church, St Margaret's, Walmgate, is the National Centre for <b>Early</b> <b>Music,</b> which hosts concerts, broadcasts, competitions and events including the York <b>Early</b> <b>Music</b> Festival. Students, staff and visiting artists of York St John University music department regularly perform lunchtime concerts in the University chapel. The staff and students of the University of York also perform in the city.|$|E
5|$|Kraków {{is home to}} {{two major}} Polish festivals of <b>early</b> <b>music</b> {{presenting}} forgotten Baroque oratorios and operas: Opera Rara, and Misteria Paschalia. Meanwhile, Capella Cracoviensis runs the Music in Old Cracow International Festival.|$|E
5|$|Rose, Morris & Co {{have been}} {{established}} in Denmark Street since 1919. Originally based at No. 11, they now occupy No. 10 in the former offices of Southern Music Publishing. The company became the first British distributor of Rickenbacker guitars in 1962, which had a surge in popularity after musicians noticed the Beatles' John Lennon playing one. Rose Morris purchased instruments directly from Rickenbacker's factory instead of their sales office, {{in order to keep}} up with demand. The British models carry unique serial numbers such as the 325, the Rose Morris 1996. The <b>Early</b> <b>Music</b> Shop's London branch is based {{on the first floor of}} number 11, above Rose Morris. The shop contains <b>early</b> <b>music</b> instruments including recorders and sheet music.|$|E

5|$|Through his {{critical}} writings, published {{under his}} own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of <b>early</b> <b>music.</b> In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards {{the end of his}} life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} in English {{cities in the}} Middle Ages, Canterbury {{employed}} a town band known as the Waits. There are records of payments to the Waits starting from 1402, though they probably existed earlier than this. The Waits were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for 'misdemeanors' but were reinstated in 1660 when they played for the visit of King Charles II on his return from exile. Waits were eventually abolished nationally by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835. A modern <b>early</b> <b>music</b> group called The Canterbury Waits has revived the name.|$|E
5|$|Film scores, {{although}} they are secondary to the film, are often critically acclaimed and very popular in their own right. Among <b>early</b> <b>music</b> for Italian films from the 1930s {{was the work of}} Riccardo Zandonai with scores for the films La Principessa Tarakanova (1937) and Caravaggio (1941). Post-war examples include Goffredo Petrassi with Non c'e pace tra gli ulivi (1950) and Roman Vlad with Giulietta e Romeo (1954). Another well-known film composer was Nino Rota whose post-war career included the scores for films by Federico Fellini and, later, The Godfather series. Other prominent film score composers include Ennio Morricone, Riz Ortolani and Piero Umiliani.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} major annual events, such as First Night which occurs on New Year's Eve, the Boston <b>Early</b> <b>Music</b> Festival, the annual Boston Arts Festival at Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park, the annual Boston gay pride parade and festival held in June, and Italian summer feasts in the North End honoring Catholic saints. The city {{is the site}} of several events during the Fourth of July period. They include the week-long Harborfest festivities and a Boston Pops concert {{accompanied}} by fireworks {{on the banks of the}} Charles River.|$|E
5|$|Dylan {{introduced}} a literary element to rock through {{his fascination with}} the Surrealists and the French Symbolists, and his immersion in the New York City art scene of the early 1960s. The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as the Doors, Steppenwolf and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture. Dylan also {{led the way in}} blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of Yes, and British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and <b>early</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of her arrival in Aldeburgh Imogen gave {{considerable}} support and assistance to the Aldeburgh Festival, as a conductor and, from 1953, increasingly as a planner and organiser. In 1956 her position was formalised, and she joined Britten and Pears as one of the festival's artistic directors, taking responsibility for programmes and performers. At the 1956 festival she fulfilled a long-held ambition by arranging a performance of Gustav Holst's opera Savitri, the first of several Holst works that she introduced to the festival. Savitri was offered as part of a double bill that included Imogen's arrangement of John Blow's 17th century opera Venus and Adonis. In 1957 she instituted late-night concerts devoted to <b>early</b> <b>music,</b> and in 1962 she organised a series of evening concerts of Flemish music, in which she had more recently become interested. She also devised frequent programmes devoted to church music, for performance at Aldeburgh parish church. Since moving to Aldeburgh in 1952, Imogen had lived in a series of lodgings and rented flats. In 1962 she moved to a small contemporary bungalow built for her in Church Walk, where she lived {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

5|$|The School of Music {{presents}} an annual series of concerts that showcase talent {{in a variety}} of genres. School of Music at FIU offers a dynamic learning environment for informed, creative musicians. Students are fully involved in their chosen fields, where they can recognize clearly what they need to learn in order to become contributors to those fields. FIU's School of Music embraces an evolving world for its possibilities and the new opportunities and challenges that it affords, while providing the tools necessary to empower young musicians in their quest to carve out careers. FIU School of Music's concert season incorporates music of all styles including jazz, <b>early</b> <b>music,</b> chamber music, choral/vocal, contemporary music, wind, and opera theater performed by world class musicians and ensembles. Many masterclasses and lectures are also open to the public and offered at no charge. The season runs from August through April each year.|$|E
25|$|Also {{part of the}} {{progressive}} folk movement was guitarist John Renbourn, whose 1968 album Sir John Alot of Merry Englandes Musyk Thynge and ye Grene Knyghte began to display {{his interest in the}} medieval, containing a number of versions of <b>early</b> <b>music</b> songs, which would be dominant on The Lady and the Unicorn (1970). From 1967 Renbourn {{was a member of the}} folk group Pentangle, and he took his interest in <b>early</b> <b>music</b> into the mix of influences (including blues, jazz, bluegrass, world music and traditional folk song) in the band. Coming from the more traditional end of the folk spectrum were Shirley and Dolly Collins. They were the first artists to produce a complete album, Anthems in Eden (1969), that combined traditional folk songs with <b>early</b> <b>music</b> instruments, utilizing David Munrow’s <b>Early</b> <b>Music</b> Consort, and <b>early</b> <b>music</b> remained a major preoccupation of their careers. Also from 1969 Third Ear Band made use of medieval instruments alongside classical and eastern influences.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>early</b> <b>music</b> {{was only}} one of a range of {{influences}} on these bands, including classical, jazz and world music, from which progressive groups selected and adapted. As the popularity of progressive rock declined in the face of punk rock, new wave and electronic rock {{in the second half of}} the 1970s, <b>early</b> <b>music</b> tended to disappear as a major musical influence in rock, and while medieval and fantasy themes remained a feature of developing genre of heavy metal, there was little conscious attempt to replicate <b>early</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
