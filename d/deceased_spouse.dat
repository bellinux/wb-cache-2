25|$|An inheritance, {{but not a}} gift, {{taken by}} a parent {{from his or her}} child is treated as group A, where it is an {{immediate}} interest (but not a life interest) in property. In certain circumstances, the beneficiary may take the place of his/her <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse</b> for the purpose of determining the applicable group where that spouse died before the disponer and was a nearer relative to the disponer.|$|E
25|$|On November 9, 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union and the {{law firm}} Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison filed United States v. Windsor in New York {{on behalf of a}} {{surviving}} same-sex spouse whose inheritance from her <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse</b> had been subject to federal taxation as if they were unmarried. New York is part of the Second Circuit, where no precedent exists for the standard of review to be followed in sexual-orientation discrimination cases.|$|E
50|$|The {{deceased}} {{must have}} been domiciled in Scotland, but the right accrues from movable property, wherever situated. The surviving spouse's right vests by survivance, and is independent of the <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse's</b> testamentary provisions; it may however be renounced by contract, or be discharged by satisfaction. It is subject to alienation of the <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse's</b> movable estate during his lifetime or by its conversion into heritage.|$|R
50|$|The {{law does}} not permit the living spouse to receive any of the <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse’s</b> {{property}} or money. No matrimonial property is considered to have existed between the two living spouses.|$|R
50|$|The {{intestacy}} laws {{of certain}} American states, such as Arkansas, Delaware, and Rhode Island limit the surviving spouse's rights (inheritance) to the <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse's</b> real estate {{to a life}} estate. Louisiana applying an itemised (civil law) code has alike default provisions for succession, called usufruct.|$|R
2500|$|The {{experience}} of sensing {{the presence of}} a deceased loved one is a commonly reported phenomenon in bereavement. It can {{take the form of a}} clearly sensory impression or can involve a quasi-sensory 'feeling' of presence. Rees conducted a study of 293 widowed people living in a particular area of mid-Wales. [...] He found that 14% of those interviewed reported having had a visual hallucination of their <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse,</b> 13.3% an auditory one and 2.7% a tactile one. These categories overlapped to some extent as some people reported a hallucinatory experience in more than one modality. Of interest in light of the previous heading was the fact that 46.7% of the sample reported experiencing the presence of the <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse.</b> Other studies have similarly reported a frequency of approximately 50% in the bereaved population.|$|E
2500|$|When the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America {{was formed}} in 1788, it adopted the Westminster standards, as {{containing}} the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures. However, it revised chapters 20.4, 23.3, and 31.2 of the Confession, basically removing the civil magistrate (i.e., the state) from involvement in ecclesiastical matters. It also removed the phrase [...] "tolerating a false religion" [...] {{from the list of}} sins forbidden in Answer 109 of the Larger Catechism, and replaced [...] "depopulations" [...] in Answer 142 with [...] "depredation." [...] The Confession was amended again in 1887, when the final sentence of chapter 24.4, which forbade the marrying of the close kindred of one's <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse,</b> was removed.|$|E
2500|$|Donkey – Recently <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse</b> to Chris the Ninja Pirate who {{resembles a}} rocking horse. Was {{originally}} Weebl's girlfriend until Chris stole her {{from him in}} [...] "Wrong." [...] Her death was shown in the 100th episode after suffering from a serious accident {{as a result of}} both herself and Chris, in his words, [...] "doing position 97 near a porthole." [...] In the same episode, Donkey said her only word: [...] "minge" [...] (about which Weebl and Bob speculate on what she could have meant, à la Citizen Kane; however, Chris proves that she just [...] "likes to swear like a fishwife"). Her demise is more sombre than the comedic deaths of some of the other characters, [...] leading to a somewhat depressing funeral and, in [...] "Intervention", making Chris go insane with grief. Two days after episode 100 was released, Weebls-Stuff.com brought out a special T-shirt dedicated to Donkey reading [...] "Donkey 2002–2006. Rock in peace." [...] Donkey has since been listed as a cast member in the credits of [...] "Goo-lien", although she did not appear in the episode. She makes a return in Body, just her bottom part appears though, and Weebl's Mummy said that she chewed off Donkey's head to make room.|$|E

5000|$|When {{it became}} {{possible}} to solemnize eternal marriages with <b>deceased</b> <b>spouses</b> in the Nauvoo temple in 1845-1846, Martha {{chose to be}} eternally united or sealed to Joseph Smith rather than Vinson.

2500|$|In {{the series}} three (December 2014) opener, set on Valentine's Day the {{following}} year, Caroline proposes marriage to Kate, wishing {{to make their}} union official. She is faced with hostility both from Celia, who is prejudiced about Caroline's new family unit, and from bullies at her school who target Lawrence. [...] A depressed Celia uses the discovery of Alan's illegitimate son Gary (Rupert Graves) as an excuse not to attend the wedding. When Alan turns up at the wedding alone, Caroline lashes out at him, telling him that there is now no point him being there. In episode three (2015), Kate and Caroline exchange vows {{in the company of}} friends and colleagues. Caroline is devastated when Kate is fatally injured in a car-accident the next day. Alan and Celia arrive at the hospital to emotionally support Caroline; they learn that Kate's daughter has been delivered alive. Caroline struggles to manage her grief following Kate's funeral, and begins imagining conversations with her <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse.</b> Unwilling to give up her career to become a full-time single mother, she hires an ex-pupil Holly (Cara Theobold) to become baby Flora's nanny. In episode five Caroline is incredulous when, six weeks after Kate's death, John suggests they get back together. When Holly is revealed to be an alcoholic, Caroline turns to Flora's biological father to help out with childcare.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, all [...] "Asiatics" [...] {{who were}} British {{subjects}} became {{eligible for a}} pension, and in 1942, pension eligibility was extended to Pacific Islanders known as [...] "Kanakas", and from that July that year [...] "Aboriginal natives" [...] of Australia became eligible for pensions {{if they were not}} subject to a state law [...] "relating to the control of Aboriginal natives" [...] or if they lived in a state where they could not be exempt from such laws but were of eligible for pension on the grounds of [...] "character, standard of intelligence and development". That same year, pension became exempt from income tax. In 1943, funeral benefits were introduced, together with a Wife's Allowance for wives of incapacitated age pensioners [...] "where she lived with him, was his legal wife and did not receive a pension in her own right." [...] From June 1942, Widows' Pension Class B was paid to widows without dependent children who were aged 50 and over. The term [...] "widow" [...] included de facto widows who had lived with the <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse</b> {{for at least three years}} prior to his death and had been maintained by him. Eligibility was also extended to deserted de jure wives who had been deserted for at least six months, divorced women who had not remarried and women whose husbands were in hospitals for those considered to be insane.

Marrying one's godparent or <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse's</b> sibling is also prohibited, {{although}} marrying one's stepchild is not - e.g. Vyacheslav Ivanov exercised {{his right to}} marry his stepdaughter after her mother's (his first wife's) death.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to 1964 the {{surviving}} spouse {{also has a}} right of terce (not {{the same as the}} religious term terce) on the <b>deceased</b> <b>spouse's</b> lands. Thus, under Scots law, both movable and immovable property are subject to the rights of a surviving spouse and children. Section 10(1) of the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964 abolished the common law rights of 'terce' and 'courtesy'. Only jus relictae, jus relicti and legitim remain.|$|R

50|$|For example, if {{a person}} dies intestate, the laws of some jurisdictions require {{distribution}} of the estate to the <b>deceased's</b> <b>spouse</b> or children. However, if there are none of these, the estate can often be distributed to the next closest group of living relatives, whether they be parents, grandparents, first cousins, aunts and uncles, or second cousins in extreme cases. If a person dies intestate with no identifiable next of kin, the person's estate generally escheats (i.e., legally reverts) to the government.|$|R
