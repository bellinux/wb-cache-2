40|$|BACKGROUND: Functional {{weakness}} describes weakness {{which is}} inconsistent and incongruent with disease. It is {{also referred to}} as motor conversion disorder (DSM-IV), <b>dissociative</b> <b>motor</b> <b>disorder</b> (ICD- 10) and 'psychogenic' paralysis. Studies of aetiology have focused on risk factors such as childhood adversity and life events; information on the nature and circumstance of symptom onset may shed light on the mechanism of symptom formation. AIM: To describe the mode of onset, associated symptoms and circumstances at the onset of functional weakness. METHODS: Retrospective interviews administered to 107 adults with functional weakness of < 2 years' duration. RESULTS: The sample was 79 % female, mean age 39 years and median duration of weakness 9 months. Three distinct modes of onset were discerned. These were: sudden (n= 49, 46 %), present on waking (or from general anaesthesia) (n= 16, 13 %) or gradual (n= 42, 39 %). In 'sudden onset' cases, panic (n= 29, 59 %), dissociative symptoms (n= 19, 39 %) and injury to the relevant limb (n= 10, 20 %) were commonly associated with onset. Other associated symptoms were non-epileptic attacks, migraine, fatigue and sleep paralysis. In six patients the weakness was noticed first by a health professional. In 16 % of all patients, no potentially relevant factors could be discerned. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of functional weakness is commonly sudden. Examining symptoms and circumstances associated closely with the onset suggests hypotheses for the mechanism of onset of weakness in vulnerable individuals...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{weakness}} describes weakness {{which is}} both internally inconsistent and incongruent with any recognizable neuro-logical disease. It may be diagnosed {{as a manifestation of}} conversion disorder or <b>dissociative</b> <b>motor</b> <b>disorder.</b> Other names include psychogenic or ‘non-organic ’ paralysis. We aimed to describe the incidence, demographic and clinical characteristics of cases with functional weakness of less than 2 years duration, and to compare these with controls with weakness attributable to neurological disease. Both cases and controls were recruited from consultant neurologists in South East Scotland. Participating patients underwent detailed assessments which included: physical examination, structured psychiatric interview (Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), measures of symptoms, disability and distress [Short Form (36) Health Survey, Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale], and assessment of their illness beliefs using an augmented version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire. In total, 107 cases (79 % female, mean age 39 years, median duration of illness 9 months) were recruited. This number suggests a minimum annual incidence of 3. 9 / 100 000. Forty-six controls (83 % female, median age 39 years, duration 11 months) were also recruited. Compared to controls, cases had similar levels of disability but more physical symptoms, especially pain. They had a higher frequency of psychiatric disorders, especially current major depression (32 versus 7 %, P 50. 0001), generalized anxiety disorder (21 versus 2 %, P 50. 005), panic disorder (36 versus 13 %, P 50. 001) and somatization disorder (27 versus 0 %, P 50001). There was no difference in median self-rated anxiety and depression scores. Paradoxically, they were less likely than controls to agree that stress was a possible cause o...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{study the}} {{clinical}} and socio demographic profile {{of patients with}} dissociative disorder and their comorbid mental illness. Materials and methods Fifty-one patients of dissociative disorder presenting to emergency and outpatient department of Psychiatry at College of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital {{during the period from}} Jan to March 2012 were included. International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems tenth edition, diagnostic criteria for research (ICD- 10, DCR) was used. Results Out of 51 patients, the majority 24 (47. 1 %), were in the age group 15 - 29. However the age of presentation ranged from 9 - 45 years. The females were more, 44 (86. 3 %) as compared to males 7 (13. 7 %). The majority of patients had low level of education with none of the patients having education above intermediate level. The majority of patients, 27 (52. 9 %) belonged to lower middle class. 49 % of the patients presented with dissociative convulsions, 15. 7 % with <b>dissociative</b> <b>motor</b> <b>disorders,</b> 15. 7 % with dissociative stupor, 11. 8 % with dissociative anesthesia and sensory loss and 7. 8 % with trance and possession disorder. Depressive illness was found co-morbid with dissociative disorder in 33. 3 %, borderline personality disorder in 9. 8 % and histrionic personality disorder in 7. 8 %. There was history of immediate stressful events that supposedly precipitated the event in 76. 5 %. Conclusion Dissociative disorder mainly affects young female of lower socio-economic and educational status with history of immediate stressful life events precipitating the illness.

40|$|Introduction: Oral <b>motor</b> <b>disorders,</b> such as {{speech and}} {{swallowing}} disorders, often occur in children. Generally parents complain that children refuse to eat hard food, drooling excess, {{and unable to}} speak clearly. Oral motor disturbance can occur due to the unavailability of maturation of oral motor structure. This study was aimed to determine the description of oral motor disturbance in children aged 2 - 4 years in some Integrated Health Service (Posyandu) in Bandung. Methods: Descriptive research with cross sectional design. The study was conducted on 100 parents who came to six posyandu in Bandung by using questionnaires through guided interviews by researchers. Samples were taken using multistage random sampling technique. The results will be presented in tabular form and assessed using Arikunto standard criteria. Results: The results showed a low percentage in oral motor disturbances. Indicators of oral motor disturbance in children aged 2 - 4 years included in either category. As for children who have oral <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> exhibit various manifestations. Conclusion: The description of oral <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> in children aged 2 - 4 years in Posyandu in Bandung was shown by various manifestations.

40|$|Background: Studies in {{patients}} with chronic severe constipation, suggest {{the presence of a}} diffuse <b>motor</b> <b>disorder</b> of the gastrointestinal tract. Aim: To investigate small bowel motor activity in a group of patients with severe constipation. Material and Methods: Forty three patients (age range 13 to 70 years, 40 women) with severe constipation referred to our motility laboratory, where studied. Ten had a previous colectomy. Radiological examinations showed a megacolon in 30 and dilatation of small intestinal loops in nine; the remaining X rays studies were normal. Small intestinal motility was studied using perfused catheters and external transducers. Results: Ten patients had normal motor recordings. Eight patients showed a neuropathic disorder characterized by a continuous irregular pattern of contractions of normal amplitude, with absence of phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC). Sixteen presented a normal MMC associated to a decreased amplitude of contractions (Miopatic disorder). Nine showed both types of <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> (Mixed pattern). Normal radiological findings were more commonly associated to normal manometric recordings. By contrast, an altered motor activity, mainly of myopathic and mixed type <b>motor</b> <b>disorder,</b> was observed in all patients with dilated small intestinal and colonic loops. Conclusions: The presence of small intestinal <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> was a frequent finding in this selected group of patients with chronic constipatio...|$|R
40|$|Motor {{abnormalities}} of the oesophagus are characterised by a chronic impairment of the neuromuscular structures that co-ordinate oesophageal function. The best-defined entity is achalasia, which {{is discussed in}} a separate chapter. Other <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> with clinical relevance include diffuse oesophageal spasm, oesophageal dysmotility associated with scleroderma, and ineffective oesophageal motility. These non-achalasic <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> have variable prevalence but they could be associated with invalidating symptoms such as dysphagia, chest pain and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. New oesophageal diagnostic techniques, including high-resolution manometry, high-frequency intraluminal ultrasound and intraluminal impedance, allow (1) better definition of peristalsis and sphincter function, (2) assessment of changes in oesophageal wall thickness, and (3) evaluation of pressure gradients within the oesophagus and across the sphincters that can produce normal or abnormal patterns of bolus transport.

40|$|Esophageal {{manometry}} {{has long}} been the gold standard for assessment of esophageal motility. Recently, high-frequency intraluminal ultrasonography (HFIUS) has been introduced to measure esophageal contractility and the thickness of esophageal muscle. Greater esophageal muscle thickness has been reported in patients with achalasia, diffuse spasm, and hypertensive peristalsis. In this issue of the Journal, Mittal and colleagues report additional observations in patients with esophageal symptoms referred for esophageal manometry. Their findings confirm earlier observations in patients with spastic <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> and report new findings of greater muscle thickness in patients with nonspecific <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> as well as normal manometry. Greater muscle thickness was associated with a greater prevalence of dysphagia suggesting the possibility that symptoms may be related, at least in part, to alterations in the biomechanics of the esophagus. The place of HFIUS in the assessment of esophageal function remains to be determined, but it offers the possibility of greater insights into esophageal physiology as well as clinical esophageal <b>motor</b> <b>disorders.</b> Richard H Hollowa...|$|R

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Esophageal <b>motor</b> <b>disorders,</b> often leading to {{dysphagia}} and chest pain, continue to pose diagnostic and therapeutic problems. In the past 12 months important new information regarding esophageal <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> was published. This {{information will be}} reviewed in this paper. Recent findings A {{number of studies have}} addressed the issue of heterogeneity in achalasia, the best defined esophageal motility disorder. The spastic esophageal motility disorders nutcracker esophagus and diffuse esophageal spasm may coexist with gastroesophageal reflux disease, which has consequences for the management of patients with these disorders. The entity labelled ineffective esophageal motility is associated with reflux esophagitis, but also with morbid obesity. For the detection of disordered transit caused by ineffective esophageal motility, application of intraluminal impedance monitoring in conjunction with manometry leads to improved diagnosis. New data on the effect of Nissen fundoplication on esophageal motility were published during the last year. Summary Recent knowledge on the heterogeneity of achalasia and the association of spastic esophageal <b>motor</b> <b>disorders</b> and ineffective motility with reflux disease will help the clinician in the management of patients with these disorders...|$|R
