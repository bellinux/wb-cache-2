5|$|It {{may not be}} {{possible}} to observe every atom in the asymmetric unit. In many cases, disorder smears the <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> map. Weakly scattering atoms such as hydrogen are routinely invisible. It is also possible for a single atom to appear multiple times in an <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> map, e.g., if a protein sidechain has multiple (<4) allowed conformations. In still other cases, the crystallographer may detect that the covalent structure deduced for the molecule was incorrect, or changed. For example, proteins may be cleaved or undergo post-translational modifications that were not detected prior to the crystallization.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, {{the nature of the}} Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400–2,500cm−3. As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.|$|E
5|$|As {{an element}} with high <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> and atomic number, iodine absorbs X-rays weaker than 33.3keV {{due to the}} {{photoelectric}} effect of the innermost electrons.

40|$|SummaryRecurring {{groups of}} atoms in {{molecules}} {{are surrounded by}} specific canonical distributions of electrons. Deviations from these distributions reveal unrealistic molecular geometries. Here, we show how canonical <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> can be combined with classical <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> derived from X-ray diffraction experiments to drive the real space refinement of crystal structures. The refinement process generally yields superior molecular models with reduced excess <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> and improved stereochemistry without compromising the agreement between molecular models and experimental data...|$|R

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A model for tissue characterization in CT was used with a parameterization of linear attenuation coefficients. Sixteen chemical substances with effective atomic numbers between 5. 21 and 13. 08 and <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> between 2. 20 and 4. 12 x 10 (23) electrons/cm(3) were scanned at energies of 80 and 140 kV on a DSCT. From the reconstructed dual energy data sets, effective atomic numbers and <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> of the substances were calculated. RESULTS: Our presented model using DSCT approximated the effective atomic numbers and effective <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> of 16 substances very well. The measured effective atomic numbers deviated 3. 4 ± 6. 8 % (R(2) = 0. 994) from theoretical effective atomic numbers. In addition, measured effective <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> deviated - 0. 6 ± 2. 2 % (R(2) = 0. 999) from theoretical effective <b>electron</b> <b>densities.</b> CONCLUSION: Effective atomic numbers and effective <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> can be determined with a high accuracy with DSCT. Therefore the model can be of potential benefit for clinical applications of quantitative tissue characterization with DSCT...|$|R

5|$|On September 12, 2013, NASA officially {{confirmed}} that Voyager 1 {{had reached the}} interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed, with a generally accepted date of August 25, 2012, the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected. By this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause; {{a new model of}} the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found. A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in <b>electron</b> <b>density,</b> based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013, triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012 (<b>electron</b> <b>density</b> is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within). Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because Voyager 1s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980. In September 2013, NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves. The recordings represent the first sounds to be captured in interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|The intensities of the {{reflections}} observed in X-ray diffraction {{give us the}} magnitudes |F(q)| but not the phases φ(q). To obtain the phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as mercury. Combining the magnitudes and phases yields the full Fourier transform F(q), which may be inverted to obtain the <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> f(r).|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{calculate}} accurate <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> of full proteins or of selected sites in proteins {{is a prerequisite}} for a fully quantum-mechanical calculation of protein-protein and protein-ligand interaction energies. Quantum-chemical subsystem methods capable of treating proteins and other biomolecular systems provide a route to calculate the <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> of proteins efficiently and further make it possible to focus on specific parts. Here, we evaluate and extend the 3 -partition frozen-density embedding (3 -FDE) scheme [Jacob, C. R.; Visscher, L. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 155102] for this purpose. In particular, we have extended this scheme to allow for the treatment of disulfide bridges and charged amino acid residues and have introduced the possibility to employ more general partitioning schemes. These extensions are tested both for the prediction of full protein <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> and for focusing on the <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> of a selected protein site.

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{a technique}} used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this <b>electron</b> <b>density,</b> the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E
5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, {{and there may be}} disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E

40|$|Time-resolved imaging of {{chemically}} active valence <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> is a {{long sought}} goal, as these electrons dictate the course of chemical reactions.

5|$|Therefore, the {{autocorrelation}} function c(r) of the <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> (also {{known as the}} Patterson function) can be computed directly from the reflection intensities, without computing the phases. In principle, this {{could be used to}} determine the crystal structure directly; however, it is difficult to realize in practice. The {{autocorrelation function}} corresponds to the distribution of vectors between atoms in the crystal; thus, a crystal of N atoms in its unit cell may have N(N-1) peaks in its Patterson function. Given the inevitable errors in measuring the intensities, and the mathematical difficulties of reconstructing atomic positions from the interatomic vectors, this technique is rarely used to solve structures, except for the simplest crystals.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or <b>electron</b> <b>density)</b> towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} bond between atoms occurs {{as a result}} of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the <b>electron</b> <b>density.</b> For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E

This GAIM-derived TING model (G-TING) was then run for the period 1 – 4 April 2004. The TING model was also run as a stand-alone coupled model (S-TING), without using the GAIM <b>electron</b> <b>densities,</b> for the same period. The resulting thermospheric responses from the two simulations were compared at around the F region peak altitude. There was an extended quiet period during this interval followed by a moderate geomagnetic storm (Kp ~ 6. 0). The ingestion of the GAIM <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> had little effect on the neutral temperature and composition during the quiet period before the storm, but there were noticeable global effects on the neutral winds, mainly as a result of changes in the ion drag force. During disturbed periods, changed <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> produced much more significant effects on the global thermosphere. The increased auroral <b>electron</b> <b>densities</b> enhanced the Joule heating rate, in addition to the ion drag, which resulted in significant global changes not only in the neutral winds, but also in the neutral temperature and composition.
