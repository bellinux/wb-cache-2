5|$|The {{earliest}} known American lodges were in Pennsylvania. The Collector for {{the port}} of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, {{two years before the}} formation of the first <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> in London. The Premier <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania. Other lodges in the colony obtained authorisations from the later Antient <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of England, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Scotland, and the <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Ireland, which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the British Army. Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge,</b> applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival.|$|E
5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will {{have to choose between}} them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge.</b> Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E

2500|$|According to data {{compiled}} in 2011, 42 {{out of the}} 51 mainstream U.S. <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> recognize Prince Hall <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges.</b> [...] The mainstream state <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> that do {{not recognize}} Prince Hall <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> are located largely in southern states, an area with an estimated 50% of Prince Hall Freemasons: Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, South Carolina and West Virginia. While African-Americans can join any lodge in North America, Prince Hall Masonry remains {{a vital part of}} American tradition.|$|R
25|$|The Orange Order {{was brought}} {{to other parts of}} the English-speaking world by Ulster Protestant {{migrants}} and missionaries. <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> have been set up in Scotland, England, Wales, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and West Africa. However, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> of Ireland and Scotland have always been the largest by far. The Imperial Grand Orange Council is made up of representatives from all of these various <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges.</b> It has the power to arbitrate in disputes between <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges,</b> and in internal disputes when invited.|$|R
5|$|Freemasonry, as {{it exists}} in various forms all over the world, has a {{membership}} estimated by the United <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of England at around six million worldwide. The fraternity is administratively organised into independent Grand Lodges (or sometimes Grand Orients), each of which governs its own Masonic jurisdiction, which consists of subordinate (or constituent) Lodges. The largest single jurisdiction, in terms of membership, is the United <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of England (with a membership estimated at around a quarter million). The <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Scotland and <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Ireland (taken together) have approximately 150,000 members. In the United States, total membership is just under two million.|$|E
5|$|Not all French lodges {{agreed with}} the new wording. In 1894, lodges favouring the {{compulsory}} recognition of the Great Architect of the Universe formed the Grande Loge de France. In 1913, the United <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of England recognised a new <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Regular Freemasons, a <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> that follows a similar rite to Anglo-American Freemasonry with a mandatory belief in a deity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Ireland and the <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Scotland {{were formed}} in 1725 and 1736 respectively, {{although}} neither persuaded {{all of the}} existing lodges in their countries to join for many years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of Canadian <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> are in amity with UGLE. There {{is also a}} healthy presence of GOdF-affiliated <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> and Orients, particularly in the French-speaking province of Quebec ...|$|R
50|$|The VGLvD {{represents}} German Freemasonry {{to foreign}} institutions (the other <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges)</b> and the German public. The member <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> are autonomous in their internal affairs {{and in the}} manner of teaching.|$|R
5000|$|After the American Revolution and, again, {{after the}} {{incorporation}} of the Dominion of Canada, the various Provincial <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> in North America were closed, and the Lodges in each State or Province formed independent <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges.</b> These in turn, chartered lodges in the territories in the West and North. As each new State or Province came into being, the lodges that had been chartered within its borders gathered together and formed new <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges.</b>|$|R
5|$|The basic, local {{organisational}} unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge. The Lodges are usually supervised and governed {{at the regional}} level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> that supervises all of Freemasonry; each <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> is independent, {{and they do not}} necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.|$|E
5|$|Woodford {{used the}} Freemason in 1879 to oppose a move in <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> to enforce {{uniformity}} of ritual on its lodges. His own letter {{on the subject}} provoked much correspondence, convincing <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of the groundswell of resistance to such a move.|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> {{were formed}} by pre-existing [...] "Time Immemorial" [...] lodges (lodges that predated {{the concept of}} having <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> to supervise and coordinate the craft, and thus were retained as having existed from [...] "time immemorial").|$|R
50|$|The Knights and Ladies of Honor were {{organized}} on a three tier system with local Subordinate <b>Lodges,</b> state level <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> and {{governed by a}} national Supreme Lodge. There were 16 <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> in 1896. Its headquarters was in Indianapolis, Indiana.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the US {{there are}} also {{numerous}} bodies that claim to be Masonic <b>Lodges</b> and <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges,</b> but which are not recognized as such by UGLE, the mainstream <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges,</b> nor their Prince Hall counterparts. These are deemed to be irregular.|$|R
5|$|Jennings was twice-elected Grand Master of the Indiana <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Freemasons, {{serving in}} 1824 and 1825. He {{declined}} reelection in 1825.|$|E

5|$|Many rites {{accepting}} {{women have}} ritual of a Masonic style, are founded by Masons, but at best have an ambivalent reception amongst <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> masons. Nonetheless, they actively recruit new members from within regular masonry.|$|E
50|$|Other bodies {{predicate}} {{their assessment}} of regularity on the 8th decree of Anderson's Constitution; a Lodge is regular {{if it works}} in conformity {{to the rules of}} its granted constitutional patent. <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> certify regularity to their recognized Member <b>Lodges</b> and <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> with patents.|$|R

50|$|Unlike other <b>grand</b> <b>lodges</b> of the <b>Grand</b> Master of VGLvD acts {{only as a}} representative. The {{decision-making}} body is the Senate which consists of {{five members of the}} GL AFuAMvD, three members of the GLLFvD and one member of each of the other three <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges.</b>|$|R
5|$|Relations between Grand Lodges are {{determined}} by the concept of Recognition. Each <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognises. When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be , and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons why one <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity.|$|E
5|$|The ritual form {{on which}} the Grand Orient of France was based was {{abolished}} in England in the events leading {{to the formation of}} the United <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of England in 1813. However the two jurisdictions continued in amity (mutual recognition) until events of the 1860s and 1870s drove a seemingly permanent wedge between them. In 1868 the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the State of Louisiana appeared in the jurisdiction of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of Louisiana, recognised by the Grand Orient de France, but regarded by the older body as an invasion of their jurisdiction. The new Scottish rite body admitted blacks, and the resolution of the Grand Orient the following year that neither colour, race, nor religion could disqualify a man from Masonry prompted the <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> to withdraw recognition, and it persuaded other American Grand Lodges to do the same.|$|E
5|$|Blue Lodge Freemasonry offers {{only three}} {{traditional}} degrees, {{and in most}} jurisdictions, the rank of past or installed master. Master Masons are also able to extend their Masonic experience by taking further degrees, in appendant bodies approved by their own <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge.</b>|$|E

5|$|Freemasonry {{and women}} have a complex relationship, which can be readily divided into many phases with no {{demonstrable}} relationship to each other until the 20th century. A few women were involved in Freemasonry before the 18th century; however the first printed constitutions of the Premier <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge</b> of England appeared to bar them from the Craft forever.|$|E

5|$|Many {{countries}} {{with a majority}} Muslim population do not allow Masonic establishments within their borders. However, countries such as Turkey and Morocco have established Grand Lodges, while {{in countries such as}} Malaysia and Lebanon there are District Grand Lodges operating under a warrant from an established <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodge.</b>|$|E
50|$|With nothing {{driving the}} District GL to seek amity, {{for over three}} years this {{remained}} the status quo. Cyprus' letters requesting amity were politely declined as rumor spread about a territorial dispute. The District GL was the sole Cypriot masonic body recognized by England, and while a few European <b>grand</b> <b>lodges</b> moved to accept Cyprus, North American <b>grand</b> <b>lodges</b> especially were unwilling {{to act on the}} matter out of deference to UGLE. Only two US state jurisdictions had accepted Cyprus: Pennsylvania and Washington. No movement was forthcoming from the others, nor from the Commonwealth <b>grand</b> <b>lodges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Grand Orient de France (GOdF) was {{recognised}} by most <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> in {{the world}} {{until the middle of}} the 19th century, when the GOdF recognised an irregular and [...] "unrecognised" [...] Masonic organisation in Louisiana. [...] This caused several US <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> to withdraw recognition from the GOdF. The final breaking point, however, came about due to a decision by the GOdF in 1877 to remove the requirement for Masons to have a belief in a Supreme Being. UGLE and most other Anglo-Saxon <b>Grand</b> <b>Lodges</b> suspended all relations with, and recognition of, the Grand Orient de France as a result.|$|R
