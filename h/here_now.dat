5|$|Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> was {{released}} in the UK on 21 August 1997. The release date had been brought forward out of Ignition's fear that import copies of the album from the United States would arrive in Britain before that country's designated street date. Worrying that TV news cameras would interview queuing fans at a traditional midnight opening session, Ignition forced retailers to sign contracts pledging not to sell the record earlier than 8:00am. However, when the album did go on sale, the cameras showed up regardless, {{just in time to}} record the initially slow trade. It was not until lunch time that sales picked up. By {{the end of the first}} day of release, Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> sold over 424,000 units and by the end of business on Saturday of that week sales had reached 663,389, making it, at the time, the fastest-selling album in British history. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard charts in the United States kept off the #1 spot by Puff Daddy's No Way Out, but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> is {{the third}} studio album by English rock band Oasis, {{released}} on 21 August 1997 by Creation Records. Oasis had achieved worldwide success with their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe and 1995 follow up (What's the Story) Morning Glory? The third album was highly anticipated by both fans and music critics. Oasis' management company, Ignition, {{were aware of the}} dangers of overexposure, and before release sought to control the media's access to the album. The campaign included limiting pre-release radio airplay and forcing journalists to sign gag orders. The tactics resulted in the alienation of both the press and many industry personnel connected with the band, and fueled large-scale speculation and wide publicity within the British music scene.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{resurgence}} in popularity since {{the success of}} Don't Believe The Truth was highlighted in February 2008 when, in a poll to find the fifty greatest British albums of {{the last fifty years}} conducted by Q magazine and HMV, two Oasis albums were voted first and second (Definitely Maybe and (What's The Story) Morning Glory? respectively). Two other albums by the band appeared in the list – Don't Believe The Truth came in at number fourteen, and the album that has previously been heavily criticised by some of the media, Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now,</b> made the list at No.22.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} {{artist of the}} 1990s was British band Simply Red, who topped the UK Albums Chart for 19 weeks with four different albums. Stars, their fourth studio album, sold 3.29million copies in total, and was the biggest-selling album of both 1991 and 1992. Stars was the second biggest-selling album of the decade; it was outsold by Manchester band Oasis's second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, which spent 10 weeks at number one during 1995 and 1996, and sold 4.16million copies. It was the highest-certified album of the 1990s, achieving platinum certification 13 times. Following the album's success, Oasis's follow-up, Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now,</b> sold 663,000 copies {{in the first four}} days of its release, making it the fastest-selling album in UK chart history.|$|E
5|$|Oasis {{signed to}} {{independent}} record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). The following year the band recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with drummer Alan White, {{in the midst}} of a chart rivalry with Britpop peers Blur. Along with Suede, Pulp, Blur and others, Oasis came to be regarded as one of the major bands of the Britpop movement and the Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1997 Oasis released their third album, Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> (1997), and although it was the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, the album's popularity tapered off quickly, but not before selling 8 million copies. McGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band released Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000). After their departures, they were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist/frontman Gem Archer and former Ride guitarist/frontman Andy Bell. Their fifth studio album Heathen Chemistry was released in 2002. In 2004 drummer Alan White left the band leaving them as a four-piece with addition of the Who drummer Zak Starkey as recording and touring unofficial fifth member and found renewed success and popularity with Don't Believe the Truth (2005).|$|E
5|$|Oasis' debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994), {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the band's rise to fame as part of the Britpop movement. Oasis' second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries and their third studio album, Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Britpop eventually declined in popularity and Oasis' next two albums failed to revive it. However, the band's final two albums, Don't Believe the Truth (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul (2008), were hailed as its best efforts in over a decade and found renewed success. On 28 August 2009, following an altercation with Liam prior to a gig in Paris, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from Oasis and on 23 October 2009, he confirmed he would embark on a solo career. Gallagher would go on to form Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.|$|E

It was the fourth fastest selling album of all time, behind Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> (Oasis, 1997), X (Coldplay, 2005) and Life for Rent (Dido, 2003). The album {{remained}} at number one for seven weeks, and reached one million sales after 29 days, making it the fastest album to sell one million copies by a solo female in the UK. Spirit was the second biggest selling album of 2007 in the UK, behind Back to Black (Amy Winehouse, 2006). For {{each of the first}} seven weeks it sold over 100,000 copies, a record which was later equalled by JLS (JLS, 2009), and beaten by 21 (Adele, 2011), which sold over 100,000 copies for twelve weeks. On 23 November 2008, the album returned to number one for a week, following the release of the deluxe version of the album. In the UK Spirit was the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s, and is the twentieth best-selling album of all time. The album has been certified ten-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, with sales of 3.1 million by December 2014. It is the 4th best selling album of the millennium in the UK, and as of November 2015 has sold 3,132,668 copies in the UK.|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} the Britpop {{movement}} was in decline, and the band had failed to meet expectations with their third album. After {{the conclusion of the}} Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> Tour in early 1998, amidst much media criticism the group kept a low profile. Later in the year, Oasis released a compilation album of fourteen B-sides, entitled The Masterplan. [...] "The really interesting stuff from around that period is the B-sides. There's a lot more inspired music on the B-sides than there is on Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> itself, I think", related Noel in an interview in 2008.|$|E

500|$|On {{the first}} day of release, Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> sold over 424,000 copies, {{becoming}} the fastest-selling album in British chart history, while initial reviews were overwhelmingly positive. Retrospectively, however, the album is viewed by many music journalists and fans and by most members of the band as over-indulgent and bloated. Q magazine, which gave the album a five-star review on its release, admitted in 2007 that Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> is often thought of as [...] "a disastrous, overblown folly—the moment when Oasis, their judgement clouded by drugs and blanket adulation, ran aground on their own sky-high self-belief." [...] The album's producer Owen Morris said the recording sessions were marred by arguments and drug abuse, and that the band's only motivations were commercial. As of 2008, the album had sold eight million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1997, Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> {{had sold}} eight million units worldwide. However, the sales volume was largely gained {{in the first two}} weeks of release, and once the album was {{released}} to UK radio stations the turnover tapered off. Buyers realised that the album was not another (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, and by 1999, Melody Maker reported that it was the album most sold to second-hand record stores. In the 2003 John Dower-directed documentary , music critic Jon Savage pinpointed Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> as the moment where the Britpop movement ended. Savage said that while the album [...] "isn't the great disaster that everybody says", he noted that [...] "t was supposed to be the big, big triumphal record" [...] of the period. Q expressed similar sentiments, writing, [...] "So colossally did Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> fall short of expectations that it killed Britpop and ushered in an era of more ambitious, less overblown music". Irish Times journalist Brian Boyd wrote: [...] "Bloated and over-heated (much like the band themselves at the time), the album has all that dreadful braggadocio that is so characteristic of a cocaine user." [...] Reflecting in 2007, Garry Mulholland admitted, [...] "the fact that nothing could have lived up to the fevered expectations that surrounded its release doesn't change the facts. The third Oasis album is a loud, lumbering noise signifying nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Oasis {{spent the}} end of 1996 and {{the first quarter of}} 1997 at Abbey Road Studios in London and Ridge Farm Studios in Surrey {{recording}} their third album. Quarrels between the Gallagher brothers plagued the recording sessions. Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> was released in August 1997. Preceded by the UK numberone single [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?", the album was their most anticipated effort, and as such became the subject of considerable media attention. By {{the end of}} the first day of release, Be <b>Here</b> <b>Now</b> sold 424,000 units and by the end of business on Saturday of that week sales had reached 696,000, making it the fastest-selling album in British history. The album debuted at numbertwo on the Billboard 200 in the US, but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment. Although early media reviews were positive, once the hype had died down, the album was criticised for being bloated and derivative with most of the critics focused on the extensive length of several songs, the heavier sound, and overproduction.|$|E
