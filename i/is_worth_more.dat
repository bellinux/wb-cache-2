She reserves the school auditorium for cheer practice, so glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has to find the club a new rehearsal space. He visits a local roller rink where he finds former glee club member April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), who tells him that she is the mistress of the wealthy eighty-year-old tycoon who owns the rink. Upon learning that Will is looking to sublet his apartment, April invites herself to visit. After spending the night sharing a bed, Will forbids April from staying over again and tells her she <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than being a mistress. April says she will break up with her tycoon.|$|E

This will be the route to Xena's 64 I/O lines, which are dynamically configurable as input, output, or bidirectional. 'Xorro' will allow bridging Xena to external hardware for control purposes, to internal systems, or to other XCore processors. This last point <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> exploration; XCore is a parallel processing architecture; more XCores can be chained together if more computing power is required.. Reference boards have been made with up to 256 cores, offering a theoretical 102400 MIPS.|$|E

25|$|The climbers' {{jersey is}} {{worn by the}} rider who, {{at the start of}} each stage, has the largest amount of {{climbing}} points. If a rider leads two or more of the categories, the climbers' jersey is worn by the rider in second, or third, place in that contest. At the end of the Giro, the rider holding the most climbing points wins the classification. In fact, some riders, particularly those who are neither sprinters nor particularly good at time-trialing, may attempt only to win this particular competition within the race. The Giro has four categories of mountains. They range from category 4, the easiest, to category 1, the hardest. There is also the Cima Coppi, the highest point reached in a particular Giro, which <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> points than the race's other first-category climbs.

25|$|A {{team can}} acquire players through {{any of the}} three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing {{replacements}} for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contract. If the new contract <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows–two before the auction, and one after the auction but {{before the start of the}} tournament. Players can not be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.|$|E

500|$|The phrase [...] "30 {{pieces of}} silver" [...] is used more {{generally}} {{to describe a}} price at which people sell out. In Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, it is echoed in the 30 roubles which the character Sonia earns for selling herself. In the folk-song King John and the Bishop, the bishop's answer to the riddle of how much the king is worth is 29 pieces of silver, as no king <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than Jesus. In Shakespeare's play Henry IV, Part 2, the mistress of Falstaff asks [...] "and didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings?" [...] The story [...] "Treasure Trove" [...] by F. Tennyson Jesse relates the rediscovery in modern times of the thirty pieces of silver and how they drive men to kill.|$|E
500|$|In {{those cases}} {{they did not}} manage to conceal, however, the GDR's media was subject to {{stringent}} controls by the Stasi {{as well as the}} Socialist Unity Party of Germany, using Neues Deutschland, the GDR's second largest daily newspaper, as their zentralorgan. Through its own television station, the GDR government controlled the content shown in television broadcasting as well. The GDR border troops‘ actions were being portrayed as legitimate border defense and the people who were killed while trying to escape were defamed both in official statements as well as in reports of the state-controlled media. In 1962, East German journalist Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler commented on the death of Peter Fechter in the television program Der schwarze Kanal: [...] "The life of every single one of our brave boys in uniform <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than the life of a lawbreaker to us. Staying away from the border, you can save yourself blood, tears and screams." [...] SED newspaper Neues Deutschland claimed Fechter was driven into suicide by [...] "front city bandits" [...] as well as accusing him of being homosexual. [...] In similar fashion, Günter Litfin was falsely depicted as being a homosexual, a prostitute as well as a criminal. In 1966, the Berliner Zeitung depicted Eduard Wroblewski as antisocial and being wanted as a Foreign Legionnaire for serious crimes in the district of Halle. These cases were exemplary of representatives of the press constructing false allegations in order to defame killed escapees.|$|E
500|$|Kim {{is raised}} in a nuclear family. Unlike popular {{animated}} sitcoms such as The Simpsons and Family Guy, both of Kim's parents are intelligent, accomplished and attractive; Kim's own intelligence is often attributed {{to the fact that}} she is born to a rocket scientist father and neurosurgeon mother. Kim's inherent confidence is a Possible family trait; her father James, who views women as equals, proudly reiterates the phrase [...] "Nothing is impossible for a Possible" [...] on numerous occasions. In her younger years, Kim's grandmother [...] "Nana" [...] Possible fought crime much like Kim herself. Kim Possible approaches the subject of the friend zone via Kim and Ron's relationship, discussing male-female friendship in a manner reminiscent to that of the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally... (1989). According to Sarah Freymiller of Bustle, the protagonists friendship evokes that of Batman and the Joker, [...] "Kim holds the functional and social power, while Ron exerts more of a calming, occasionally slapstick influence on the show ... he is the intelligent, kind chaos in her highly-organized life." [...] Kim and Ron are solely platonic friends for the show's first three seasons and remain best friends even after they start dating in Season 4, defying the popular belief that [...] "being romantically involved <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than being in a friendship." [...] The series avoids the popular [...] "Will they or won’t they?" [...] trope often used in television shows, keeping them as a couple for the remainder of the series. Having grown up together and learned from each other's mistakes, Kim and Ron ultimately make up for each other's shortcomings. According to Feminist Fairytales, [...] "Ron has a very relaxed attitude towards life which often provides a balance to Kim's assertive nature and perfectionism, while Kim helps Ron become much more independent and self-reliant." [...] Freymiller also believes Ron might have been conceived because [...] "the creators sensed that television would only be able to accept a strong female character if she had a male counterpart," [...] eliminating fears Kim might be perceived as too bitchy, complementing her actions as opposed to dominating.|$|E
