500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Lucky Day" [...] was {{directed}} by Stephen Agnes; it was filmed in New York City, on the East Village.

In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one up {{the front of my}} dress, one up the back of my dress. I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an <b>ear</b> <b>piece</b> with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do!

2500|$|A {{new type}} of BTE aid called the mini BTE (or [...] "on-the-ear") aid. It also fits behind/on the ear, but is smaller. A very thin, almost {{invisible}} tube is used to connect the aid to the ear canal. Mini BTEs may have a comfortable <b>ear</b> <b>piece</b> for insertion ("open fit"), but may also use a traditional earmold. Mini BTEs allow not only reduced occlusion or [...] "plugged up" [...] sensations in the ear canal, but also increase comfort, reduce feedback and address cosmetic concerns for many users.|$|E
2500|$|Meucci {{emphasizes}} that the conductors [...] "for mouth and ears... must be metallic", but does not explain why this would be desirable. He mentions [...] "communication with the ground" [...] but does not suggest that a ground return must complete a circuit if only [...] "the wire" [...] (singular, not plural) is used between the sender's mouth piece and the receiver's <b>ear</b> <b>piece,</b> with {{one or the other}} person being electrically insulated from the ground by means of glass insulators ("...consists in isolating two persons... by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, {{at the foot of the}} chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire.").|$|E
2500|$|Its {{construction}} {{was that of}} a triple-sized modern telephone. The hollow <b>ear</b> <b>piece</b> was made in such a form to focus the sound waves direct to the operator's ear. A thin metal diaphragm was secured to the opposite end, a pair of magnets with a pivoted armature was secured to the frame of the armature, and connected with the diaphragm by means of a strut, thus keeping the armature from contracting poles of the magnets, which were energized by a battery current. When the current was closed, the armature held the diaphragm in magnetic suspension. The slightest change in the current manifested upon the diaphragm and upon all those on the same line. It was decided best to move everything in connection with developing and manufacturing this project to House's shop in Bridgeport, [...] also taking Royal House (who was then over 70 years old) and his wife with them.|$|E

50|$|The novelty wore off, {{and there}} wasn't {{significant}} {{interest in the}} technology until around forty years later when a Connecticut radio station began to broadcast binaural shows. Stereo radio {{had not yet been}} implemented, so the station actually broadcast the left channel on one frequency and the right channel on a second. Listeners would then have to own two radios, and plug the right and left <b>ear</b> <b>pieces</b> of their head sets into each radio. Naturally, the expense of owning two radios was, at the time, too much for a broad audience, and again binaural faded into obscurity.|$|R

50|$|Robert Weitbrecht {{created a}} {{workaround}} for the Bell restrictions in 1963.

His acoustic coupler is known as the Weitbrecht Modem.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of mokot worn by female royalty. The typical mokots that are worn are much {{similar to those of}} male royalty. Some crowns are just like tiaras where {{at the back of the}} mokot hair is let loose, cascading down the back. Other mokots have a few accessories such as <b>ear</b> <b>pieces</b> that would sit above the ear and help hold the mokot in place while a comb at the back is just an added accessory. Flowers are also worn on the mokot in the same style, but the hanging garlands of flowers are worn on the left and the bouquet is worn on the right. The best example of these royal clothes is illustrated by Khmer classical dance costumes, which are an adaptation of the beautiful royalty costume.|$|R
50|$|During his experimentation, Broadbent {{made use}} of the {{dichotic}} listening test. This task has been used extensively to test numerous psychological phenonomena such as response times of specific auditory information, as well as testing for attended and unattended information presented to a participant. It is widely used {{as it is a}} non-invasive method of testing cerebral dominance. In a typical dichotic listening paradigm, the participant is wearing a headphone, in which a different auditory stimuli are presented to each ear at the same time, and the participant's attention is divided. The participant is instructed to attend (attended channel) the information coming from one of the <b>ear</b> <b>pieces</b> and neglect (unattended channel) the information presented from the other. Following the listening period, the participants are tested on whether they recall any information presented in the unattended channel.|$|R

50|$|A Roman {{contract}} {{had to be}} oral. Since {{the contract}} was oral, {{it could not be}} made by the deaf or dumb without a slave to act as their mouth or <b>ear</b> <b>piece</b> and could not be made from afar. D.45.1.1.pr, which appears to have been compressed as the reasoning does not follow perfectly, says that there is only a stipulation when parties speak so the mute, deaf and dumb cannot stipulate, and someone who is not there cannot stipulate. However, a slave may stipulate for a deaf or dumb master.|$|E

By distinction, when listening to sound through headphones, the sound from the left earpiece is audible only to the left ear, and the sound from the right <b>ear</b> <b>piece</b> is audible only to the right ear. When producing binaural media, the sound source is recorded by two separate microphones, placed at a distance comparable to that between two ears, and they are not mixed, but remain separate on the final medium, whether video or audio.|$|E
