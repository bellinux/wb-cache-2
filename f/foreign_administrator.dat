Grew, Acting Secretary of State, came into my office after the Cabinet meeting on May 8 and said they had an important order in connection with Lend-Lease which President Roosevelt had approved but not signed. It was an order authorizing the FEA and the State Department to take joint action to cut back the volume of Lend-Lease supplies when Germany surrendered. What they told me made good sense to me; with Germany out of the war, Lend-Lease should be reduced. They asked me to sign it, I reached for my pen and, without reading the document, I signed it.|$|R

5000|$|By November 29, Pius XII {{reversed}} {{his stance}} against appointing foreigners to sees in occupied Poland. Orsenigo suggested to Pius XII {{it would be}} [...] "opportune to appoint" [...] Splett as apostolic administrator to Chełmno-Pelplin. Splett was bishop of then exempt Danzig diocese which belonged to the nunciature to Poland, {{and he was a}} Danziger so he was not German until the annexation of his home country only weeks before his appointment. So Pius XII agreed that Orsenigo designated Splett the apostolic administrator to Chełmno-Pelplin with effect of 5 December 1939. The government-in-exile, now in London, saw this as a betrayal of the 1925 concordat between the Holy See and Poland, which prohibited placing any Polish territory under the jurisdiction of a bishop outside Poland. It was very unusual that not the Consistorial Congregation or the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, respectively, in the papal name, but Orsenigo, using special papal plenipotentiary powers, appointed Splett, a peculiarity repeating with each appointment of <b>foreign</b> apostolic <b>administrators</b> in German annexed and occupied Poland.|$|R

50|$|This {{program was}} spearheaded by {{regional}} leaders like Zeng Guofan who, employing Yung Wing, established the Shanghai arsenal, Li Hongzhang {{who built the}} Nanjing and Tianjin Arsenals, Zuo Zongtang who constructed the Fuzhou Dockyard. The arsenals were established {{with the help of}} <b>foreign</b> advisors and <b>administrators,</b> such as Léonce Verny who helped build the Ningbo Arsenal in 1862-64, or the French officer Prosper Giquel who directed the construction of the Fuzhou Arsenal in 1867-74. Zeng and Li collaborated to construct the Jiangnan Arsenal. Schools for the study of mechanical skills and navigation under the direction of foreign advisers were established at these arsenals and dockyards. As these powerful regional strongmen were able to act independently of the central government, there was little coordination between the provinces and the government.|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{language}} (FL) {{programs in}} U. S. colleges {{are expected to}} meet educational and societal needs {{for the development of}} learners capable of using languages other than English for a range of professional, academic, cultural, humanistic, and other valued purposes. A key component in the effectiveness of any educational program is the inclusion of systematic evaluative processes, which enable educators to understand, improve, demonstrate, and ensure the quality of their services and their learners’ outcomes. However, FL programs may not be prepared to incorporate evaluation processes into their practices, despite increasing requirements to do so. Furthermore, available evaluation guidance, examples, tools, and strategies that are articulated to the actual needs of FL educators are scant. This NFLRC Summer Institute is designed to help college <b>foreign</b> language <b>administrators</b> and teachers engage in useful, practical, and effective program evaluations to meet a variety of purposes. As a starting point, it takes seriously the values, goals, and constraints that characterize college language programs. In light of these realities, it will provide language educators with a user-oriented approach to developing evaluations that maximize benefits for language learners and teachers, while minimizing potential negative consequences. It will also provide participants with tools and strategies for making program evaluation a systematic and consistently useful component of their FL departments. Practical topics will include: (1) learner needs analysis, (2) student learning outcomes assessment, (3) curriculum development and improvement, (4) program review, (5) personnel/teacher evaluation, (6) course evaluationstrategies for professional development in evaluatio...|$|R
40|$|The UN {{operation}} in Cambodia {{was a major}} venture provided with extensive resources and entrusted to implement a highly ambitious program contained in the Paris Accords signed on October 23, 1991. Today, official rhetoric speaks of a "model" when referring to what a more modest view would treat as an experience - one from which it is indispensable to draw all the lessons. The UN proved unable to carry out much of its mission. It jailed to disarm the rival troops. It jailed to neutralize the Communist party's omnipresent influence over existing administrative structures. It failed to repair or rebuild a minimum of infrastructure in such basic areas as health, education, and communications. It failed to reintegrate into society the 372, 000 refugees who had come back from camps in Thailand. It failed to preserve the country's unity and territorial integrity. Yet it did score some successes. It laid the ground work for a pluralistic society. It repatriated the refugees. It organized elections that were free and fair enough to allow new, thoroughly legitimate institutions to come into being. A cautious assessment of this operation leads to a reflection on the conditions for {{success or failure of}} such a venture. Lessons are to be learned from each step : starting from the diplomatic moves behind the decision to carry out the operation and the mandate defining its scope; and ending with the political, economic, and social repercussions due to thousands of soldiers and <b>foreign</b> civilian <b>administrators</b> passing through the country. Each phase of the flow of operations must also be questioned, from recruitment of personnel to assessment of the results obtained...|$|R
40|$|The European Union Insolvency Regulation (the EU Regulation) is a {{giant step}} forward in {{promoting}} international cooperation among EU countries for cross-border insolvency proceedings. It adopts a modified universalist solution to cross-border proceedings insofar as they are located within the EU. However, experience has shown that it needs improvement to work effectively. A venue battle now rages between courts of several European countries over which country 2 ̆ 7 s courts will administer particular cross-border proceedings and how the center of main interest is to be determined for this purpose. This Article begins with a detailed examination of the two principal cases where conflicts have arisen, Eurofood and Daisytek. Eurofood is a subsidiary of Parmalat, which has produced the largest invsolvency case in European history. The Irish and Italian courts have both opened main insolvency proceedings for the Eurofood subsidiary, and the controversy is now pending before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). For the Daisytek French subsidiary, both English and French courts have opened main insolvency cases, and an appeal is pending before the French Cour de Cassation, where the Ministry of Justice is expected to recommend submission to the ECJ. Two very important substantive modifications would vastly improve the EU Regulation. First. the EU Regulation needs {{to provide for the}} filing in the same country (thereby permitting the filing in the same court) of members of a corporate group that are economically integrated. It is very difficult (if at all possible) to recognize a corporate empire when its insolvency proceedings are distributed among a number of countries. Second, the EU Regulation needs to clarify the definition of 2 ̆ 2 center of main interest 2 ̆ 2 (CoMI) and to specify what a court should consider in making the CoMI decision. A court should weigh the following factors: (1) the location of operations and management decisions for the corporation; (2) the location of the 2 ̆ 2 nerve center 2 ̆ 2 or place of principal decision-making for the corporation; and (3) the expectations of creditors, such as suppliers and financiers, as to the CoMI decision in the event that the company foes into an insolvency proceeding. This Article also argues for three kinds of procedural improvements: (1) decoupling the decision on whether a proceeding is a main proceeding from the decision opening the proceeding itself, to give an opportunity to the parties in interest to be heard on the subject of whether a proceeding is a main proceeding; (2) defining what constitutes a 2 ̆ 2 judgment opening insolvency proceedings, 2 ̆ 2 to specify what steps qualify under this term in those countries where an opening order or judgment is not a typical part of the insolvency process; (3) adopting procedures to recognize the due process rights of <b>foreign</b> estate <b>administrators,</b> <b>foreign</b> creditors, and other parties in interest in a cross-border insolvency proceeding...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} the cross-cultural adjustment problems and the influencing factors of the adjustment for foreign students in Taiwan. The research methodologies used in this study include qualitative research approach, documentary analysis, participant observation and in-depth interview with a number of foreign students. The samples (7 foreign students and 2 individuals relating to the adjustments) were purposive sampling for the research purpose. The study discovered that foreign students' cultural adjustment is greatly affected by individual factors, group living and the organizational environment. 1. Individual factors: Issues such as the language ability, eating patterns, cultural intelligence, native culture, international exposure, personal attributes, duration of the stay in Taiwan, culture shock and reason for abroad study influence the adjustment process of a foreign student. 2. Group living: The adjustment progress is also impacted by international students' personal interaction with the local students, different treatments received and the stereotypes about their origin countries owned by the local students. 3. Organizational environment: Social support (teacher, scholarship, campus environment) provided by school, different treatments in school, living environment and other factors are affecting a foreign student's adaption to the new environment and culture. Hopefully the research findings and conclusions will provide some practical views and suggestions to the <b>foreign</b> students, school <b>administrators</b> as well as the practitioners. 本研究主要目的為瞭解外國學生在台灣求學期間，跨文化適應情形以及影響跨文化適應的最主要因素。根據研究的發現與結論，期以對外國學生、學校行政、實務界提出可行的具體建議。 本研究採用質性研究進行資料收集與資料分析。資料收集方面，本研究以立意抽樣選取中部某國立大學 7 位外國學生，以及 2 位與外國學生適應有相關之人員(包括：國際事務處的行政人員、負責接待外國學生的義工) 進行深度訪談。資料分析方面，本研究以口語資料分析法進行，在完成訪談逐字稿後，將內容進行初步的概念化定義，再將訪談內容歸納後，根據其所涵蓋的意義賦予一個適當的概念名稱（命題），最後歸納出結論。 本研究發現，外國學生會受個人、群體，及組織而影響其跨文化適應。(1) 個人：外國學生主要受到語言能力、飲食習慣、文化智商、國家文化、國際經驗、人格特質、在台時間、居住狀況、文化衝擊等因素的影響，而有不同的適應差異；(2) 群體：與台灣學生的人際互動、台灣學生對外國學生國家的刻板印象、以及對待東西方外國學生的差別待遇等，皆會使得外國學生有不同的適應差異；(3) 組織：學校所提供之社會支援（教師、獎學金、校園環境）、在學校差別待遇、居住環境等因素的影響，皆會使得外國學生有不同的適應差異。 本研究將根據各項研究結論，期望透過瞭解外國學生的適應性問題，供給外國學生、學校行政以及實務界當作參考依據，藉而提升跨文化適應能力，並有有效減少適應困擾的產生。中文摘要		i 英文摘要		ii 目次		iii 表目次		iv 圖目次		v 第一章	緒論	 6 第一節	研究動機與背景	 6 第二節	研究目的	 8 第三節	研究問題	 8 第四節	名詞釋意	 8 第五節	研究流程	 9 第二章	文獻探討	 11 第一節	跨文化適應	 11 第二節	文化衝擊	 26 第三節	外國學生介紹	 28 第三章	研究方法	 33 第一節	研究對象	 33 第二節	研究架構	 37 第三節	研究工具	 38 第四節	研究步驟	 43 第五節	資料分析與步驟	 46 第六節	研究嚴謹度	 47 第四章	研究結果	 50 第一節	組織環境	 50 第二節	群體生活	 59 第三節	個人因素	 66 第五章	結論	 92 第一節	研究結果	 92 第二節	研究貢獻與研究限制	 107 第三節	研究者自我省思	 108 參考文獻	 112 附錄	 122 表目錄 表 1 - 1 歷年外國學生來台人數	 7 表 2 - 1 Black (1988) U-curve 四階段適應過程	 13 表 2 - 2 國外學者跨文化適應之構面	 15 表 2 - 3 馬斯洛(Maslow) 層級需求理論	 21 表 2 - 4 歷年外國學生來台人數	 28 表 2 - 5 各校獲補助計畫之條件規定	 29 表 2 - 6 台灣獎學金類別	 29 表 2 - 7 國內外國學生研究整理	 32 表 3 - 1 受訪者列表	 34 表 3 - 2 質化研究與量化研究的差異比較	 39 表 3 - 3 訪談稿重新建構意義單元	 47 表 4 - 1 受訪者文化智商以及其適應情況	 78 表 4 - 2 受訪者國家文化的差距以及其適應情況	 82 表 4 - 3 受訪者在台時間表	 88 圖目錄 圖 1 - 1 研究流程	 10 圖 3 - 1 研究架構	 38 圖 3 - 2 訪談步驟	 45 圖 5 - 1 外國學生會受組織、群體，及個人而影響其跨文化適應 9...|$|R
