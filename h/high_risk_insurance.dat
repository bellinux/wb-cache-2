30|$|The problem {{arises when}} a {{relatively}} poor {{segment of the}} population inhabits high-exposure, high-risk areas of the coastal United States. Many low income people are unable to have their homes insured adequately (underinsured homes) or at all. Due to extremely <b>high</b> <b>risk,</b> <b>insurance</b> companies are likely to charge disproportionally high premiums in these areas. With every hurricane event, as our results confirm, there is a growing gap between wealthy and poor in these areas that further exacerbates the problem. Insurance companies can choose not to sell insurance to the relatively poor segment of population or can decide to charge very high premiums that cannot be afforded by the relatively poor portion of the population. But both strategies put government into peril since someone will, eventually, have to provide assistance to the victims of hurricane catastrophes.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis address how aggregate shocks affect insurance firms 2 ̆ 7 {{risk management}} and asset investment decisions {{as well as}} the impact of these decisions on insurance prices and regulation. The first chapter develops a signaling model to examine how insurance firms choose among retention, reinsurance and securitization especially for catastrophe risks. The second chapter examines the determination of insurance prices in an integrated equilibrium framework where insurers 2 ̆ 7 assets may be subject to both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. The third chapter presents an empirical analysis of the hypothesized impacts of internal capital and asset risk on insurance prices as predicted by the results of the second chapter. The last chapter investigates the optimal design of insurance regulation to achieve the Pareto optimal asset and liquidity management by insurers as well as risk sharing between insurers and insurees. Chapter 1 provides a novel explanation for the predominance of retention and reinsurance relative to securitization in catastrophe risk transfer using a signaling model. An insurer 2 ̆ 7 s risk transfer choice trades off the lower signaling costs of reinsurance against the additional costs of reinsurance stemming from sources such as their market power, higher cost of capital relative to capital markets, and compensation for their monitoring costs. In equilibrium, the lowest risk insurers choose reinsurance, while intermediate and <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> choose partial and full securitization, respectively. An increase in the loss size increases the average risk of insurers who choose securitization. Consequently, catastrophe risks, which are characterized by low frequency-high severity losses, are only securitized by very high risk insurers. Chapter 2 develops a unified equilibrium model of competitive insurance markets where insurers 2 ̆ 7 assets may be exposed to idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. We endogenize the relationship between insurance prices and insurers internal capital that potentially reconcile the conflicting predictions of previous theories that investigate the relation using partial equilibrium frameworks. Equilibrium effects lead to a non-monotonic U-shaped relation between insurance price and internal capital. Specifically, the equilibrium insurance price first decreases with a positive shock to the internal capital when it is below certain threshold level, and then increases with a positive shock the internal capital when it is above the threshold level. Further, we also derive another testable implication that an increase in the asset default risk increases the insurance price and decrease the insurance coverage. Chapter 3 studies the property and casualty insurance industry in periods from 1992 to 2012 based on the aggregate level of NAIC data. We show that the insurance price decreases with an increase in the surplus of insurance firms {{at the end of the}} previous year when the surplus is lower than 8. 5 billion, and then increase when the surplus is higher than 8. 5 billion. Our results provide support for the hypothesis of a U-shaped relationship between internal capital and insurance price. Our results also provide evidence for the positive relationship between asset portfolio risk and insurance price. Chapter 4 studies the effects of aggregate risk on the Pareto optimal asset and liquidity management by insurers as well as risk-sharing between insurers and insurers. When aggregate risk is low, both insurers and insurers hold no liquidity reserves, insurees are fully insured, and insurers bear all aggregate risk. When aggregate risk takes intermediate values, both insurees and insurers still hold no liquidity reserves, but insurers partially share aggregate risk with insurers. When aggregate risk is high, however, it is optimal to hold nonzero liquidity reserves, and insurees partially share aggregate risk with insurers. The efficient asset and liquidity management policies {{as well as the}} aggregate risk allocation can be implemented through a regulatory intervention policy that combines a minimum liquidity requirement when aggregate risk is high, 2 ̆ 2 ex post 2 ̆ 2 contingent on the aggregate state, comprehensive insurance policies, and reinsurance...|$|E

30|$|Because {{provision}} of insurance for standing timber is more costly {{than that for}} many other assets, an insurance company interested in entering this market will initially set high premiums, which attract very few landowners. A low volume of business means the insurer is unable to reduce premiums due to the <b>high</b> <b>risks</b> of <b>insurance.</b> The <b>risk</b> to the insurer may be reduced {{by an increase in}} the number of policy holders because the average difference in mean payout in case of damage will not rise as rapidly as the percentage increase in the total number of insured parties.

The ongoing discussions by the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are putting substantial efforts to promote climate change adaptation through international cooperation in the form of providing additional finances and technologies including proposals to promote a global or regional climate <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> facility. Case studies from within and outside the Asia-Pacific region provide valuable lessons which could be used for promoting <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> by the future climate regime (post-Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012).

40|$|Restrictions on <b>insurance</b> <b>risk</b> {{classification}} {{can lead}} to troublesome adverse selection. A simple version of the usual argument is as follows. If insurers cannot charge risk-differentiated premiums, more insurance is bought by <b>higher</b> <b>risks</b> and less <b>insurance</b> is bought by lower risks. This raises the equilibrium pooled price of insurance above a population-weighted average of true risk premiums. Also, since the number of <b>higher</b> <b>risks</b> is usually smaller {{than the number of}} lower risks, the total number of risks insured usually falls. This combination of a rise in price and fall in demand is usually portrayed as a bad outcome, both for insurers and for society. However, some restrictions on <b>insurance</b> <b>risk</b> classification are common in practice. For example, since 2012 insurers in the European Union has been barred from using gender in underwriting; and many countries have placed some limits on insurers' use of genetic test results. We can observe that policy-makers often appear to perceive some merit in such restrictions. This observation motivates a careful re-examination of the usual adverse selection argument. In this talk, we study the implications of insurers not being allowed to use risk-differentiated premiums. First, we provide a micro-foundation in variations across individuals' utility of wealth to obtain an aggregate insurance demand function. Then, within this framework, we formulate the concept of loss coverage, defined as expected losses compensated by insurance, as a metric for evaluating different <b>insurance</b> <b>risk</b> classification schemes. Finally, we reconcile loss coverage to a utilitarian concept of social welfare, defined as the sum of individuals' expected utilities over the entire population. Specifically, we show that if insurance premiums are small relative to wealth, maximising loss coverage maximises social welfare. From a policy perspective, this may be a useful result because maximising loss coverage does not require knowledge of individuals' (unobservable) utility functions; loss coverage is based solely on observable quantities...|$|R
