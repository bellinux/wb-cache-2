40|$|The Global Nuclear Vision Project is examining, using {{scenario}} building techniques, a {{range of}} long-term nuclear energy futures. The exploration and assessment of optimal nuclear fuel-cycle and material strategies is {{an essential element of}} the study. To this end, an established global E{sup 3 } (energy/economics/environmental) model has been adopted and modified with a simplified, but comprehensive and multi-regional, nuclear energy module. Consistent nuclear energy scenarios are constructed using this multi-regional E{sup 3 } model, wherein future demands for nuclear power are projected in price competition with other energy sources under a wide range of long-term demographic (population, workforce size and productivity), economic (price-, population-, and income-determined demand for energy services, price- and population-modified <b>GNP,</b> <b>resource</b> depletion, world-market fossil energy prices), policy (taxes, tariffs, sanctions), and top-level technological (energy intensity and end-use efficiency improvements) drivers. Using the framework provided by the global E{sup 3 } model, the impacts of both external and internal drivers are investigated. The ability to connect external and internal drivers through this modeling framework allows the study of impacts and tradeoffs between fossil- versus nuclear-fuel burning, that includes interactions between cost, environmental, proliferation, resource, and policy issues...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{forecasts}} of oil prices over the 1980 s {{that were made}} in 1980. It identifies the sources of errors due to such factors as exogenous <b>GNP</b> assumptions, <b>resource</b> supply conditions outside the cartel, and demand adjustments to price changes. Through 1986, the first two factors account {{for most of the}} difference between projected and actual prices. After 1986, misspecification of the demand adjustments becomes a particularly troublesome problem. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} growing closer due to {{communication}} facilities. But {{this is also}} having an adverse effect on social, economic growth of any developing country. If we observe safety risks like fire, crime and accidents, Accidents are having high probabilities along with moderate impact. so we come to know accidents must be pay high attention. (wrf: INDIA survey report 2012). It {{has been estimated that}} over millions of persons die and half to this number are injured every single year in road accidents throughout the world causing around 1 % of annual gross national product (<b>GNP)</b> <b>resources</b> of the developing countries. The main aim of transportation is handling the mobility with safety measures. Most of the time, due to lack of knowledge of place the injured person is unable to report the accident. Even if in many cases the persons are dying just because of lack of proper help. There are various technologies & researches which are focusing on the emergency services for providing help on accidental spots. GIS Web services are used to provide routing information to the healthcare facilities but this will not be working in the severe cases. In our approach we will create a SMS alert system for government authorities so they can come to know the accident has happened and reach on the spot for further investigation. This includes two emergency personals like police and healthcare facilities supporting mobile environment. This can be accessed on any GPRS enabled mobile device. The system can be useful for any common man for information of optimized routes to nearby healthcare facilities in a user friendly GUI from current location. This will also helpful for traffic officer for decision making &reporting of an accident. This data repository will help to the extraction of rules from pattern observed in accidents related to spatial characteristics with help of geo spatial data mining. This will be guidance to government authorities involved in road planning...|$|R
40|$|The neoclassical growth {{model is}} {{extended}} to include costly intermediated {{borrowing and lending}} between households. This is an important extension as substantial resources are used in intermediating {{the large amount of}} borrowing and lending between households. In 2007, in the United States, the amount intermediated was 1. 7 times <b>GNP,</b> and the <b>resources</b> used in this intermediation amounted to at least 3. 4 percent of GNP. The theory implies that financial intermediation services are an intermediate good and that the spread between borrowing and lending rates measures the efficiency of the financial sector. ...|$|R
40|$|The Report of the Commission on Social Welfare (CSW) {{together}} with the three Background Papers comprise the first ever comprehensive review of the entire Social Welfare System. Expenditure on Social Welfare is at a record high of over 14 per cent of <b>GNP,</b> absorbing more <b>resources</b> than is devoted by the State to agriculture, fisheries, forestry, industry, transport and communications combined. Throughout the recessionary fifties expenditure on social welfare never exceeded 6 per cent of GNP. Indeed back in the fifties the four areas of education, health, housing and social welfare combined absorbed around 15 per cent of GNP. An expanding population faces contracting opportunities. Unemployment and debt are at record levels. Substantial emigration has resumed. Output is flagging and, while inflation is well down, real interest rates have never been higher. The Report of the CSW culminates in its chapter on Costings and Priorities. I will limit my comments to some remarks regarding these two areas...|$|R
40|$|For a {{large sample}} of 61 {{developing}} countries, {{over the period}} 1980 - 95, we calculate {{a measure of the}} efficiency with which national political-economic systems convert a given volume of material <b>resources</b> (<b>GNP</b> per capita) into human development (longevity, education and literacy) for their citizens. This we label this RICE (relative income conversion efficiency). Four main variabls explain variations in RICE. The first, population density, that works largely in technical fashion. It is easier and cheaper to provide health and education services to densely-clustered populations. The second variable is geographical: all else being equal, location in West Africa lowers the rate at which material resources are converted into human development. This probably reflects West Africa's highly disease-prone natural environment. The third and fourth variables relate to governance. They however correlate with RICE in strikingly contrasting ways. A composite measure of the quality of government institutions, produced for international investors and leaders, turnns out to be significantly but negatively correlated with RICE. In other words, countries with governance institutions that are attractive to international investors tend to perform badly at converting material resources into human development. By contrast, a variable relating to state-society relations – the extent to which governing elites are financially independent on their own citizens – is significantly and negatively correlated with RICE. Governments that are dependent on their own citizens for critical resources appear neither to strengthen this particular accountability mechanism nor to play an independent rold in raising RICE scores: we could find no statistical connection between RICE and the degree of democracy. ...|$|R
