5|$|In April 1965, the United States Naval Research Laboratory group {{launched}} an Aerobee 150 rocket {{equipped with a}} pair of Geiger counters. This flight discovered seven candidate X-ray sources, including the first extragalactic X-ray source; Virgo X-1 was designated as the first X-ray source detected in Virgo.

5|$|Primatologist Carel P. van Schaik and {{biological}} anthropologist Cheryl D. Knott further investigated tool use in different wild orangutan populations. They compared geographic variations in tool use {{related to the}} processing of Neesia fruit. The orangutans of Suaq Balimbing (P. abelii) {{were found to be}} avid users of insect and seed-extraction tools when compared to other wild orangutans. The scientists suggested these differences are cultural. The orangutans at Suaq Balimbing live in dense groups and are socially tolerant; this creates good conditions for social transmission. <b>Further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> highly social orangutans are more likely to exhibit cultural behaviours came from a study of leaf-carrying behaviours of ex-captive orangutans that were being rehabilitated on the island of Kaja in Borneo.|$|E

In accordance with these instructions, the flying squadrons assigned to the three carriers undertook training exercises from their ships and shore bases from 4 July onwards. Intelligence gained from decrypting German radio messages during early July, and photos taken by a RAF aircraft on 12 July, provided <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the battleship was once again fully operational and possibly preparing to put to sea.

5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value {{that was more than}} a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
5|$|After 1066, William did {{not attempt}} to {{integrate}} his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as Duke. When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made– <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{specimens}} of Pinacosaurus {{of different ages}} found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness, while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative {{to the rest of}} the skeleton, <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical halfrings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim; gradually the ossification extended towards the middle regions. On the rest of the body, the ossification process progressed from the neck onwards in the direction of the tail. Young ankylosaurs are commonly found together but adults are found separate, suggesting they were solitary.|$|E
5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.|$|E
5|$|In their 1995 {{review of}} Malagasy bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues {{established}} Eptesicus somalicus malagasyensis, a new subspecies of Eptesicus somalicus (currently Neoromicia somalica). They {{had only a}} single specimen and noted that further material was needed to assess the new form's relationship with E.somalicus. Studies in 2001 and 2002 provided evidence that E.somalicus and related species are not closely related to Eptesicus (nor to Pipistrellus, where they have also been placed), so that these species were allocated to the separate genus Neoromicia. In 2004, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo reviewed the Malagasy subspecies after collecting two more specimens and concluded that it was distinct enough to be classified as a separate species, Neoromicia malagasyensis. Two years later, Paul Bates and colleagues reported on two more specimens and showed that the bacula (penis bones) of N.malagasyensis and N.somalica are different, providing <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they are distinct species. However, they recommended that further research assess the degree of difference between N.malagasyensis and N.matroka (formerly in Eptesicus, but placed in Neoromicia by Bates and colleagues), which occurs further east in Madagascar. The IUCN Red List currently again classifies the species in Eptesicus, as Eptesicus malagasyensis.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the three}} kings, Máel Coluim {{appears to have}} been the most powerful, and it is {{possible}} that Mac Bethad and Echmarcach were underkings or clientkings of his. Mac Bethad appears to have become Mormaer of Moray in 1032 after the slaying of his kinsman, Gilla Comgáin mac Máel Brigti, Mormaer of Moray (died 1032). Previous rulers of Moray are sometimes styled as kings by various Irish annals, a fact which may explain why Mac Bethad was called a king when he met Knútr. Although the apparent date of Mac Bethad's accession to the mormaership (1032) appears to contradict the date of the kings' meeting (1031), this discrepancy can be accounted for in two ways. One possibility is that Gilla Comgáin was actually slain in 1031 but only recorded in 1032. Another possibility is that Knútr merely returned from Rome in 1031, but actually met with the kings in 1032, after Gilla Comgáin's demise and Mac Bethad's accession. There is <b>further</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> could cast doubt on the date of the meeting. Although the aforesaid versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date Knútr's pilgrimage to 1031, he is otherwise known to have visited Rome in 1027. Whilst it is possible he undertook two pilgrimages during his career, {{it is more likely that}} the chronicle has misdated his journey. In fact, it possible that the chronicle failed to account for the time in which Knútr spent on the continent and Scandinavia after having visited Rome.|$|E
