30|$|Given the {{inability}} to explain the <b>decline</b> by shifts <b>in</b> the composition of individual and business characteristics, we explored a few additional methods of explaining the decline. The distribution of establishment-level employment change has been narrowing during the last 10 to 15 years, fully accounting for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> job creation and job destruction, yet this narrowing only explains {{about a third of}} the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> hires and separations. This tells us that the explanation for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> hires and separations will be different than the explanation for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> job creation and job destruction. We also find that the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> hires and separations is being driven by the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> job-to-job flows and the disappearance of short-duration jobs in the U.S. economy.|$|R
30|$|In section IV, we {{analyze the}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> gross worker flows (hires and separations), {{employing}} some helpful identities that relate gross worker flows to gross job flows (job creation and job destruction), {{as well as}} to job-to-job flows. We find that the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> gross job flows can be described as a narrowing of the distribution of employer growth rates, but this change in the distribution of gross job flows only explains {{about a third of the}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> gross worker flows. This implies that whatever economic forces are driving the <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> gross job flows, there are different forces that are driving the <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> gross worker flows. Analyzing the relationship between gross worker flows and job-to-job flows, we find that <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> both short-duration jobs and job-to-job flows are driving the <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> gross worker flows.|$|R

5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{has reduced}} dragonfly populations across the world, {{for example in}} Japan. Over 60% of Japan's wetlands {{were lost in the}} 20th century, so its dragonflies now depend largely on rice fields, ponds, and creeks.

40|$|The pace of {{business}} dynamism in the U. S. has declined over recent decades. The <b>decline</b> is evident <b>in</b> a pronounced <b>declining</b> trend <b>in</b> {{the pace of}} both gross job creation and gross job destruction and <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> trends <b>in</b> alternative measures of establishment and firm level volatility. An important component of these declining trends is a marked <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the firm startup rate. A recent finding in the literature is that the changing composition of U. S. businesses cannot account for the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> dynamism. This is partly because the changing industrial composition of the U. S. economy actually works in the opposite direction. The implication is {{that much of the}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> dynamism should be viewed as occurring within detailed industry, firm size and firm age categories. To explore the factors underlying this within-cell <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> dynamism, we address two sets of closely related questions in this paper: First, what types of startups have exhibited the largest decline and, relatedly, what types {{of business}}es have exhibited the largest <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> dynamism? Second, is the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> dynamism accounted for by a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the variance of idiosyncratic shocks impacting firms or by a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the responsiveness of firms to the shocks...|$|R

5|$|In Southern Europe, wolf {{extermination}} was not {{as complete}} as in Northern Europe, because of greater cultural tolerance of the species.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the hypothesis that recent <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> black marriage rates have been driven by a declining pool of high-earning, young black men.

30|$|The <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> hires and separations {{from all}} three data sources shows a “stair-step” pattern, with <b>declines</b> {{concentrated}} <b>in</b> or around recessions, from which the measures never fully recover during expansions. Using NBER recession dates, all of the 8.9 percentage point <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> LEHD hires (from 2001 :Q 1 – 2010 :Q 4) occurs during the 2001 and the 2007 – 2009 recessions, and 6.3 percentage points of the 8.1 percentage point <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> LEHD separations occurs during the recessionary quarters. Similarly, more {{than all of the}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> JOLTS hires occurs during recessions, and half of the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> JOLTS separations occurs during recessions. The CPS series is somewhat different: as seen in Figure  1, much of the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> CPS hires and separations occurs in 2002, immediately following the 2001 recession, and in 2007, immediately preceding the 2007 – 2009 recession.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{trends in}} social capital since 1952 and assess {{explanations for the}} observed declines.

Rising community heterogeneity (particularly income inequality) explains the fall in social capital produced outside the home whereas the rise in women's labor force participation rates explains the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> social capital produced within the home. ...|$|R
