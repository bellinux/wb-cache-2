The power of the Court to require that this be <b>done</b> <b>is</b> specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore.

5|$|It {{was moved}} to its current {{location}} on St George's Street {{at the edge of}} the village, although the date when this was <b>done</b> <b>is</b> unclear. The site where the cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have been on this occasion that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition is that it was moved in 1825, although a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes <b>done,</b> <b>is</b> not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E
5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was <b>done</b> <b>is</b> invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E

25|$|Erythromelalgia is a {{difficult}} condition to diagnose as there are no specific tests available. However, reduced capillary density has been observed microscopically during flaring; and reduced capillary perfusion is noted in the patient.

Tests done at universities include quantitative sensory nerve testing, laser evoked potentials, sweat testing and epidermal sensory nerve fiber density test (which is an objective test for small fiber sensory neuropathy).

25|$|Post-Irradiation Examination (PIE) is {{the study}} of used nuclear {{materials}} such as nuclear fuel. It has several purposes. It is known that by examination of used fuel that the failure modes which occur during normal use (and {{the manner in which the}} fuel will behave during an accident) can be studied. In addition information is gained which enables the users of fuel to assure themselves of its quality and it also assists in the development of new fuels. After major accidents the core (or what is left of it) is normally subject to PIE to find out what happened. One site where PIE is <b>done</b> <b>is</b> the ITU which is the EU centre for the study of highly radioactive materials.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, French-Swiss {{architect}} Le Corbusier designed several {{buildings in}} France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid {{is an example}} of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters (121 feet). France's largest financial district is La Defense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located. Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been <b>done</b> <b>is</b> the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc or Paul Andreu.|$|E
25|$|Professional diving {{operations}} are usually formally planned {{and the plan}} documented as a legal record that due diligence has been done for health and safety purposes. Recreational dive planning may be less formal, but for complex technical dives, can be as formal, detailed and extensive as most professional dive plans. A professional diving contractor will be constrained by the code of practice, standing orders or regulatory legislation covering a project or specific operations within a project, and is responsible for ensuring that {{the scope of work}} to be <b>done</b> <b>is</b> within the scope of the rules relevant to that work. A recreational (including technical) diver or dive group is generally less constrained, but nevertheless is almost always restricted by some legislation, and often also the rules of the organisations to which the divers are affiliated.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} remains meaningful {{even when}} the system is far away from equilibrium.

The set of microstates (with probability distribution) on which the sum is <b>done</b> <b>is</b> called a statistical ensemble. Each type of statistical ensemble (micro-canonical, canonical, grand-canonical, etc.) describes a different configuration of the system's exchanges with the outside, varying from a completely isolated system to a system that can exchange one or more quantities with a reservoir, like energy, volume or molecules. In every ensemble, the equilibrium configuration of the system is dictated by the maximization of the entropy of the union of the system and its reservoir, according to the second law of thermodynamics (see the statistical mechanics article).|$|E
