60|$|With this view, as much {{meaning as}} {{possible}} should be {{thrown into the}} formation of the word itself; the aids of derivation and analogy being made available to keep alive a consciousness of all that is signified by it. In this respect those languages have an immense advantage which form their compounds and derivatives from native roots, like the German, and not from those of a foreign or dead language, as is so much the case with English, French, and Italian; and the best are those which form them according to fixed analogies, corresponding to the relations between the ideas to be expressed. All languages do this more or less, but especially, among modern European languages, the German; while even that is inferior to the Greek, in which the relation between the meaning of a <b>derivative</b> <b>word</b> and that of its primitive is in general clearly marked by its mode of formation, except in the case of words compounded with prepositions, which are often, in both those languages, extremely anomalous.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the skills}} of {{speaking}} {{in a foreign language}} which has its own difficulties is correct pronunciation. English is not an exception to this rule and one of the challenging parts of this language is the process called vowel reduction which has always been problematic for language learners. This study has been conducted to investigate observing of English vowel reduction in pronunciation of EFL teachers of high schools in Ilam city. For this purpose, it examines the effects of gender, experience and academic degree on the observing of vowel reduction in <b>derivative</b> and function <b>words.</b> The participants of the study were 60 EFL teachers with B. A., M. A., and PhD degrees teaching English in high schools of Ilam city, 30 being male and 30 female. They ranged from 1 to 30 years of teaching experience. The instrument used in the study was a checklist comprising of 30 sentences containing <b>derivative</b> and function <b>words</b> in which the vowel reduction occurs. The results showed that there was a meaningful relationship between gender of the participants and vowel reduction in general and vowel reduction in <b>derivative</b> <b>words</b> but not with function words. Males performed better than females in pronouncing the reduced vowels. There was a meaningful relationship between teaching experience and vowel reduction in general, vowel reduction in <b>derivative</b> <b>words</b> and in function words. The group with 16 to 20 years of teaching experience had the highest mean. The second highest mean belonged to the group of 21 to 25 years of experience. The results also showed that until 20 years of teaching experience, the means of pronunciation increase and after that decrease gradually. There was a meaningful relationship between academic degree and vowel reduction in general, vowel reduction in <b>derivative</b> <b>words</b> and in function words.

50|$|The word ‘Korzok’ is a {{derivative}} of two words, namely ‘Kor’ meaning {{a place in}} the Ladakhi language and ‘Zok’ which is said to be {{a derivative}} of the word ‘dzot-pa’ meaning “manager”. Over the years, the last letter of the word was changed to ‘k’ to the <b>derivative</b> <b>word</b> Zok and together with Kor came to be known as “Korzok”. Another explanation attributed is that shepherds working for the monasteries in the nearby hamlets kept the king’s cattle at this place, not only to tend them but to also extract milk, cheese and butter.

40|$|In Japanese language, <b>derivative</b> <b>word</b> {{consists}} of a noun and some following suffixes, and those components are concatenated into a sequence without separators. This construction often cause ambiguity in parsing or Kana-Kanji conversion. Some methods to treat derivatives have been developed; 1) recognizing arbitrary combination of any noun and any suffix, 2) registering collected derivative words directly into the word dictionary, and 3) using semantic category to enable selectional restriction. However, these methods have too simple mechanism to derive correct analysis. In our previous paper, we proposed 4) an example-based method in which collected sample words are generalized for wider coverage of derivative words. In this paper, we compare these methods through experiments. To realize fair comparison, all methods were represented in Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) and equally tuned with the same training method Maximum Likelihood Estimate.

40|$|In modern {{linguistics}} since American Structuralism onwards {{and especially}} in the contributions of generative morphologists, the notion of ‘head’ as “the most important constituent” has been the main target of the analysis devoted to compounds. Once discarded the criterion of the position of the head, inasmuch as it is a parameter depending on the single languages, several other criteria have been used for its identification as a constituent whose properties are transmitted to the whole compound, by means of the so-called “percolation” either a) of the grammatical category (cf. Lieber 1981) - e. g. the nominal category trasmitted from the head utpalam ‘Nymphaea’ to the compound nīlotpalam ‘blu Nymphaea’ or b) of the morphological features (cf. Booij 2007), such as the gender - e. g. nīlotpalam is a neuter noun because utpalam is neuter; or c) of the semantic type (cf. Allen 1978), i. e. of the kind of objects that the compound denotes - e. g. the nīlotpalam is an utpalam. Nevertheless, such classifications often imply a clearcut notion of ‘adjective’ and ‘noun’, which - as semantics studies (e. g. Kamp 1975; Dixon 1982) have parallelously shown - are categories far from granted and relying on a subordinate-principal opposition, whose shortcomings had already been pointed out by the first Pāṇini's commentators. Moreover, in some well-known occurrences of karmadhārayas such as rājarṣi and nīlalohita, or the supposed comparison-based compounds of the kind śastrīśyāma- and puruṣavyāghra-, it is compulsory to combine more than one test and to postulate some additional rule to arrive at a clear identification of the 'head'. Similar difficulties arise in the analysis of (‘headless’) bahuvrīhis. Analogously, the extension of the notion of head to the derivational suffixes raises several doubts about the classical parameters adopted for identifying the head of a syntactic structure. Among these (which are listed e. g. by Bauer 1990 : 2 f. - cf. Scalise-Vogel 2010 : 8), perhaps the most evidently misleading could be “the head is an obligatory constituent in the phrase”. In point of fact, if we consider for instance a taddhita-formation such as vāstraḥ in the sense of vastrena parivṛtaḥ rathaḥ “a chariot covered by a cloth” in accordance with Pāṇini’s rule A 4. 2. 10, undoubtedly the suffixal head is always an obligatory constituent but the most visible unit in the <b>derivative</b> <b>word</b> (i. e. the lexical material which is actually involved - cf. A 4. 1. 82) is not the head, but the nominal stem vastra- “cloth”, modified according to the specific affixation rule (vástra- + áṆ > vāstráḥ). In the proposed communication we will try to face some of the linguistic problems here mentioned, by interpreting them in the light of Pāṇini’s marked choice of concentrating on the ‘non-head’ constituent of these complex words - precisely on their upasarjana. Both in compounds and in secondary derivatives, indeed, the upasarjana loses its original independence of meaning but determines the meaning of another linguistic form to which it is subordinated. Thus even a upamāna-word such as śas̄trī- can be considered {{as a part of the}} list of the subordinate lexemes which can modify the sāmānyavacanas which are lexically headed by śyāma (A 2. 1. 55), or a upamita-word such as puruṣa- in the list of the 'kind of' vyāghras (A 2. 1. 56). This joint paper is crucially based on the problems tackled in Kātyāyana and Patañjali’s commentaries on A 2. 1. 55 - 56 (particularly about the co-reference of the two constituents of these compounds) in the attempt of putting them in closer relation with the other rules involving the upasarjana-category. The aim is that of spelling out the core features of Pāṇini's upasarjana-based account of morphological subordination, highligting the morphological, semantic and lexical implications of his choice...|$|E
