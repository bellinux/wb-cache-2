5|$|In 293, emperor Diocletian {{created a}} new {{administrative}} system (the tetrarchy), to guarantee security in all endangered regions of his Empire. He associated <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> co-emperor (Augustus), and each co-emperor then adopted a young colleague given the title of Caesar, to share in their rule and eventually to succeed the senior partner. The tetrarchy collapsed, however, in 313 {{and a few years}} later Constantine I reunited the two administrative divisions of the Empire as sole Augustus.|$|E

5|$|Three weeks later, some {{children}} {{playing in the}} street wandered into the yard of the now-vacant house. One of them fell into the cellar and discovered the tunnel. While the prison's Board of Inspectors was unable to identify the inmate involved in the escape attempt, the warden punished Berkman by sending him to solitary confinement for nearly a year. Days after {{he was released from}} solitary, Berkman tried to hang <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strip of his blanket.|$|E
5|$|William Henry Harrison, Whig Party presidential nominee, {{defeated}} US President Martin Van Buren in the 1840 general election. Upon Harrison's death {{shortly after}} his inauguration, Vice-President John Tyler assumed the presidency. President Tyler was expelled from the Whig party in 1841 for repeatedly vetoing their domestic finance legislation. Tyler, isolated and outside the two-party mainstream, turned to foreign affairs to salvage his presidency, aligning <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> southern states' rights faction that shared his fervent slavery expansionist views.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} flashbacks reveals that an oracle had foretold that {{the demise of}} Olympus would come not by the revenge of the Titans, who had been imprisoned after the Great War, but by a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus and Ares {{believed}} this warrior to be Deimos, the brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand, and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but was swept aside and subsequently scarred across his right eye by the Olympian. Athena stopped Ares from killing Kratos, knowing his eventual destiny. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured by Thanatos. In honor of his sibling, Kratos marked <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark.|$|E
5|$|As the Arabs customarily did not {{campaign}} during winter, Asad demobilized his men. On Harith's urging, on {{the other}} hand, the Turgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack south of the Oxus, hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Arabs. In this he was joined not only by Harith and his followers, but by {{the great majority of}} the native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan. Asad quickly mobilized his forces and managed to catch the khagan <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small part of his army and defeat them at Kharistan. Although both the khagan and Harith escaped capture, the Battle of Kharistan struck a blow to the khagans prestige, and Suluk's murder by his rivals a short while afterwards saved the Muslims from worse.|$|E
5|$|As {{they make}} their way to the tower, Nicholai disappears and is presumed dead, while Nemesis corners the {{remaining}} members of the group on the cable car headed to the tower. Mikhail sacrifices <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grenade, causing the car to crash into the tower's main courtyard and separating Jill and Carlos briefly. At the Clock Tower, Jill summons the helicopter by ringing the Clock Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis, which destroys the helicopter and infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but falls unconscious due to the T-Virus. Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within the Clock Tower. Three days later, he manages to find a cure for Jill's T-Virus infection in the Raccoon City General Hospital. He returns to Jill and injects her with a vaccine, saving her.|$|E

5|$|Bolstered by {{the failure}} of the English Short Parliament, the Scottish Parliament {{declared}} itself capable of governing without the king's consent, and in August 1640 the Covenanter army moved into the English county of Northumberland. Following the illness of the earl of Northumberland, who was the king's commander-in-chief, Charles and Strafford went north to command the English forces, despite Strafford being ill <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> combination of gout and dysentery. The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years' War, had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts. They met virtually no resistance until reaching Newcastle upon Tyne, where they defeated the English forces at the Battle of Newburn and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring county of Durham.|$|E
5|$|By 25 September, {{the area}} {{occupied}} by the Lonsdale Force saw heavy fighting against self-propelled guns, flamethrower tanks, and infantry. There were no PIATs available to the force by now; instead Cain armed <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two-inch mortar. Mortars are muzzle-loading indirect fire weapons but Cain was forced to fire it on an almost horizontal plane due to the enemy's proximity. His citation states that his leadership ensured that the South Staffordshire gave no ground and drove the enemy off in complete disorder. By {{the end of the}} battle, Cain had been reportedly responsible for the destruction or disabling of six tanks, four of which were Tigers, {{as well as a number}} of self-propelled guns.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{once again}} found <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{chance in the}} Bayern box, but keeper Oliver Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. At the other end, Basler came close with another free kick before Alexander Zickler sent a shot just wide {{from the edge of}} the box. As half time approached, United winger Ryan Giggs, playing out of {{position}} on the right, sent a weak header towards Kahn from a Cole cross, but that was as close as they were to come to a goal in the first half.|$|E

5|$|During high school, Barbera {{worked as}} a tailor's {{delivery}} boy. During the Great Depression, he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a magazine called The NY Hits Magazine. He supported <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> job at a bank, and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began {{to be published in}} Redbook, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier'sâ€”the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry. Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Woodruff disguises <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{beard and}} monocle and assumes a new {{identity}} {{in an attempt to}} court Allen. She is able to recognize him as Woodruff because of his fear of fire tongs. Because she is friends with the governor, she is able to arrange her husband's release from prison. Victor locates Woodruff in a casino and kills him. At trial, he declares that the prohibition against double jeopardy prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 {{can look}} back on a varied life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E

5|$|Hess {{was moved}} to Maindiff Court Hospital on 26 June 1942, where he {{remained}} {{for the next three}} years. The facility was chosen for its added security and the need for fewer guards. Hess was allowed walks on the grounds and car trips into the surrounding countryside. He had access to newspapers and other reading materials; he wrote letters and journals. His mental health remained under the care of Dr Rees. Hess continued to complain on and off of memory loss and made a second suicide attempt on 4 February 1945, when he stabbed <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bread knife. The wound was not serious, requiring two stitches. Despondent that Germany was losing the war, he took no food for the next week, only resuming eating when he was threatened with being force-fed.|$|E
5|$|In the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, {{managing}} to free Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon called Haos from the location. Heavily wounded, {{and in a}} desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sample of the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle, temporarily defeating Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation would worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod. After Chris' pod is launched, Haos makes one last attempt to kill Chris but is killed himself by a powerful lightning charge from Piers, which ensures Chris' escape and the destruction of the Neo-Umbrella base. At the same time, Jake and Sherry escape the facility pursued relentlessly by Ustanak, eventually {{managing to}} kill him as they ride a rocket-powered lift back to the surface.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured {{that he still}} {{attended}} school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education. He supported <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> range of jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor. At 14, shortly after his mother's relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in London's West End. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in Harry Arthur Saintsbury's Jim, a Romance of Cockayne. It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplin's comic performance, however, was singled out for praise {{in many of the}} reviews.|$|E
