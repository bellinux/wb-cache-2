40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of local and}} global controllers is conducted for helicopter vibration reduction using actively controlled single/dual trailing-edge flaps. It is found that for high-speed flight conditions, both local and global controllers perform equally well. However, for low-speed flight, local controller gives a marginally better optimal solution compared to the global controller but {{at the cost of}} much greater computation time. An objective function containing the hub vibratory loads is minimized using the global controller. The control effort is weighted such that each flap is used to complete authority. A reduction of 73 % and 75 % in hub vibration is obtained at high-speed flight using single and <b>dual</b> <b>flap</b> configurations, respectively. At low-speed flight, single and <b>dual</b> <b>flap</b> configurations gave 52 % and 63 % reduction in vibration, respectively. Numerical studies using an aeroelastic simulation show that the vibration control system performs well up to +/- 5 degrees error in flap phasing from optimal phase. The control law is insensitive to small perturbations (up to +/- 0. 3 deg) in the optimal flap harmonics and is fairly insensitive to stiffness and mass changes of the rotor blade as well as noise in the measured hub load data. <b>Dual</b> <b>flap</b> configuration was found to be more insensitive to errors in optimal flap control harmonics than single flap configuration...|$|E

Simultaneous vibration reduction and performance enhance-ment is demonstrated under level flight condition at high advance ratios, where dynamic stall effects are significant. Power reduction is achieved using the adaptive Higher Har-monic Control (HHC) algorithm in closed loop, with 2 - 5 /rev flap control harmonics.

40|$|In {{the current}} work, the {{application}} and advantages of multiple active trailing-edge flaps for helicopter vibration control in forward flight are investigated. Small active flaps {{of this type}} can be actuated using smart materials. A comprehensive aeroelastic analysis is used to model a helicopter with multiple trailing-edge flaps. The objective function containing the hub vibratory loads and flap control effort is minimized by an optimal controller. The control effort is differentially weighted for different flaps, such that all trailing-edge flaps are exploited to their full authority and limited to ± 2 degrees peak deflection. Numerical results are obtained for one, two and three flaps and their optimal locations identified. A reduction of 76 % in the hub vibration level is achieved at an advance ratio (nondimensional forward speed) of 0. 3 using three flaps. For the four-bladed, soft-inplane, hingeless rotor considered in this work, {{it is observed that}} the extent of hub vibration reduction {{is directly related to the}} effect of trailing-edge flap motion on the contribution of the second flapwise bending mode to blade motion. It is also shown that multiple flaps can effectively modify the participation of second flapwise bending mode at a much lower control power than is needed with single and <b>dual</b> <b>flap</b> configurations. Furthermore, multiple flaps are shown to allow redundancy in operation and are considerably more effective than single flaps in low speed transition flight regimes because of their capability in distributing the airloads...|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{understanding}} of fish maneuvering and {{its application to}} underwater rigid bodies are considered. The goal is to gain insight into stealth. The recent progress made in NUWC is reviewed. Fish morphology suggests that control fins for maneuverability have unique scalar relationships irrespective of their speed type. Maneuvering experiments are carried out with fish that are fast yet maneuverable. The gap in maneuverability between fish and small underwater vehicles is quantified. The hydrodynamics of a dorsal fin based brisk maneuvering device and a <b>dual</b> <b>flapping</b> foil device, as applied to rigid cylindrical bodies, are described. The role of pectoral wings in maneuvering and station keeping near surface waves is discussed. A pendulum model of dolphin swimming is presented to show that body length and tail flapping frequency are related. For nearly neutrally buoyant bodies, Froude number and maneuverability are related. Analysis of measurements indicates that the Strouhal number of dolphins is a constant. The mechanism of discrete and deterministic vortex shedding from oscillating control surfaces has the property of large am-plitude unsteady forcing and an exquisite phase dependence, which makes it inherently amenable to active control for precision maneuvering. Theoretical control studies are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of maneuverability of biologically inspired bodies under surface waves.

40|$|With {{the pursuit}} of more {{advanced}} and environmentally-friendly technologies of today’s society, the airline industry has been pushed further to investigate solutions that will reduce airport noise and congestion, cut down on emissions, and improve the overall performance of aircraft. These items directly influence airport size (runway length), flight patterns in the community surrounding the airport, cruise speed, and many other aircraft design considerations which are setting the requirements for next generation aircraft. Leading the research in this movement is NASA, which has set specific goals {{for the next generation}} regional airliners and has categorized the designs that meet the criteria as Cruise Efficient Short Takeoff and Land (CESTOL) aircraft. With circulation control (CC) technology addressing most of the next generation requirements listed above, it has recently been gaining more interest, thus the basis of this research. CC is an active flow control method that uses a thin sheet of high momentum jet flow ejected over a curved trailing edge surface and in turn utilizes Coanda effect to increase the airfoil’s circulation, augmenting lift, drag, and pitching moment. The technology has been around for more than 75 years, but is now gaining more momentum for further development due to its significant payoffs in both performance and system complexity. The goal of this research was to explore the design of the CC flap shape and how it influences the local flow field of the system, in attempt to improve the performance of existing CC flap configurations and provide insight into the aerodynamic characteristics of the geometric parameters that make up the CC <b>flap.</b> Multiple <b>dual</b> radius <b>flaps</b> and alternative flap geometry, prescribed radius, flaps were developed by varying specific flap parameters from a baseline <b>dual</b> radius <b>flap</b> configuration that had been previously developed and researched. The aerodynamics of the various flap geometries were analyzed at three different flight conditions using two-dimensional CFD. The flight conditions examined include two low airspeed cases with blown flaps at 60 ° and 90 ° of deflection, and a transonic cruise case with no blowing and 0 ° of flap deflection. Results showed that the shorter flaps of both flap configurations augmented greater lift for the low airspeed cases, with the <b>dual</b> radius <b>flaps</b> producing more lift than the corresponding length prescribed radius. The large lift generation of these flaps was accompanied by significant drag and negative pitching moments. The incremental lift per drag and moment produced was best achieved by the longer flap lengths, with the prescribed radius flaps out-performing each corresponding <b>dual</b> radius. Longer <b>flap</b> configurations also upheld the better cruise performance with the least amount of low airspeed flow, drag, and required angle of attack for a given cruise lift coefficient. The prescribed radius flaps also presented a favorable trait of keeping a more continuous skin friction distribution over the flap when the flaps were deflected, where all dual radius configurations experienced a distinct fluctuation at the location where the surface curvature changes between its two radii. The prescribed radius flaps displayed a similar behavior when the flaps were not deflected, during the cruise conditions analyzed. Performance trends for the different flap configurations, at all three flight conditions, are presented {{at the end of each}} respective section to provide guidance into the design of CC geometry. The results of the presented research show promise in modifying geometric surface parameters to yield improved aerodynamics and performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{vibration}} has limited {{the use of}} helicopters in both civil and military applications. In this research, further analysis has been performed for the various on-blade approaches available for vibration reduction using a unique optimization framework. 	For passive optimization, an aeroelastic environment with several well-established analysis codes from different sources was developed {{that can be used}} to analyze and design composite rotor blades for minimum vibration or maximum performance. This design environment enables conceptual/early preliminary multidisciplinary rotor blade design with realistic structural properties for modern composite rotor blades. 	For the design of a rotor blade with active twist, a new design strategy was introduced where the amplitude of dynamic twist is maximized. The optimization framework included the aeroelastic design environment described earlier along with surrogate based optimization technique. The surrogate based optimization is performed in combination with Efficient Global Optimization algorithm. Results showed that the amplitude of dynamic twist is a true indicator of control authority of active twist rotor for vibration reduction. Furthermore, the optimization framework was extended to include discrete design variables in the optimization and the solution for mixed-variable design problem was obtained using three different techniques. 	After modifying the aeroelastic analysis to account for the presence of active flaps, a Mach-scaled composite rotor blade was designed using the same mixed design variable optimization framework to enhance the vibration reduction capabilities of the active flap. In this case also, the amplitude of dynamic twist was used as the objective function and the analysis was carried out at three different spanwise flap locations. This thesis also includes work related to the design and fabrication of a composite rotor blade with <b>dual</b> <b>flaps</b> which can be tested in a Mach-scaled spin test stand.

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} optimal locations of <b>dual</b> trailing-edge <b>flaps</b> and blade stiffness to achieve minimum hub vibration levels in a helicopter, with low penalty {{in terms of}} required trailing-edge flap control power.

Pareto-optimal points minimizing both helicopter vibration and flap power ale obtained using the response surface and neural network metamodels.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of piezoceramic {{actuator}} hysteresis on helicopter vibration control using <b>dual</b> trailing-edge <b>flaps.</b> Piezoceramic stack actuators are promising candidates for trailing-edge flap actuation in full-scale helicopters. However, they are inherently nonlinear {{in response to an}} applied electric field and exhibit hysteretic behavior between the applied electric field and displacement. In this study, bench-top tests are conducted on a commercially available piezoceramic stack actuator, and its dynamic hysteretic behavior is studied. A Preisach-type dynamic hysteresis model is used to describe the hysteresis in the stack actuator. The unknown coefficients in the model are obtained through identification from experimental data. An aeroelastic model of the helicopter with multiple trailing-edge flaps is then used to predict the hub vibration levels under different flight conditions. The optimal actuator control input for hub vibration suppression in the presence of actuator hysteresis is considerably different from the case of an ideal-linear actuator. Numerical results show the importance of modeling actuator hysteresis in helicopter vibration control using trailing-edge flaps. Ignoring or inaccurate modeling of hysteresis in the piezoceramic actuator can lead to inaccurate phasing of the trailing-edge flap motion which directly affects the performance of the vibration control system...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} 20 years, the neural anatomy of many flaps has been investigated, {{although}} no extensive {{studies have been}} reported yet on the anterolateral thigh flap. The goal {{of this study was}} to describe the sensory territories of the nerves supplying the anterolateral thigh flap with dissections on fresh cadavers and with local anesthetic injections in living subjects. The sensate anterolateral thigh flap is typically described as innervated by the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve. Two other well-known nerves, the superior perforator nerve and the median perforator nerve, which enter the flap at its medial border, might have a role in anterolateral thigh flap innervation. Twenty-nine anterolateral thigh flaps were elevated in 15 cadavers, and the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve, the superior perforator nerve, and median perforator nerve were dissected. In the injection study, the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve, superior perforator nerve, and median perforator nerve in 16 thighs of eight subjects were sequentially blocked. The resulting sensory deficit from each injection was mapped on the skin and superimposed on the marked anterolateral thigh flap territory. The study shows that the sensate anterolateral thigh flap is basically innervated by all three nerves. The lateral cutaneous femoral nerve was present in 29 of 29 thighs, whereas the superior perforator nerve was present in 25 of 29 and the median perforator nerve in 24 of 29 thighs. Furthermore, in the proximal half of the flap, the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve lies deep,, whereas the superior perforator nerve and median perforator nerve lie more superficially. Whereas the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve innervates the entire flap, the superior perforator nerve innervates 25 percent of the flap and the median perforator nerve innervates 60 percent of the flap. Clinically, a small anterolateral thigh flap (7 X 5 cm) can be raised sparing the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve and using only the selective areas innervated by the superior perforator and median perforator nerves. Alternatively, a large anterolateral thigh flap can be raised with this multiple innervation. This can be helpful if one wants to harvest the flap under local anesthesia. Sensate bilobed flaps can be harvested when <b>dual</b> innervated <b>flaps</b> are required...|$|R
50|$|In around 1942 the Swiss army {{initiated}} a competition {{for a new}} service machine gun to replace both the “heavy” MG 11 and the “light” Lmg25, adopted in 1911 and 1925 respectively. Three participants joined the competition-government-owned Waffenfabrik Bern, and privately owned factories SIG and Hispano-Suiza. Waffenfabrik Bern based its development on the hugely successful German MG 42. The first prototypes emerged in around 1944, and looked much like MG42, although the shape of receiver and butt was somewhat different. The final design, which appeared in 1950, was in most respects similar to the MG 42, although many parts were produced by machining instead of stamping, and the locking system was changed from roller to flap locking. The resulting weapon was heavier than the German original, and much more finely made and finished. In certain respects it was a “Rolex” of machine guns. Until very recently MG 51 served as a primary infantry and vehicle machine gun for Swiss army, although it is now being gradually replaced in service with lighter and less expensive, but also less powerful 5.56mm FN Minimi machine gun of Belgian origin and manufacture. The MG 51 is a short-recoil-operated, locked breech, air-cooled and automatic only, belt-fed weapon. It uses a modified MG 42 type locking system with a two-piece bolt and <b>dual</b> locking <b>flaps</b> located in the front part of the bolt. These flaps engage the cuts made in the short barrel extension to provide rigid locking. Upon recoil, the flaps are retracted {{toward the center of}} the bolt, to unlock it. An additional lever-type bolt accelerator is provided; it is located in receiver, next to the barrel breech and below the bolt. The gun housing also somewhat resembles the German MG 42, although it is made from two separate parts - the barrel jacket (made from stamped steel) and receiver (a solid machined body). The barrel jacket is permanently welded to the front of the receiver. The barrel can be changed rapidly if required; the barrel change procedure is similar to that of the MG 42, with the locking latch located at the right side of the jacket, which is opened to provide a barrel replacement window.|$|R
