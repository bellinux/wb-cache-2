40|$|An {{approach}} {{to the definition of}} characteristics of a direct central shock of two different elastic cylindrical bodies has been developed. It is supposed that bodies are made from different materials and have different masses and forms of the <b>frontal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The contact area size changes while impacting and is directly determined during the solution. Shock is considered on a small time interval, during which the perturbation has no time to come to the free <b>frontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> of bodies (supersonic stage). The solution of the problem leads to the determination of key features of the shock interaction and their dependence on the shape of the <b>frontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> of bodies, their mass, and material characteristics...|$|R

50|$|Sectional {{density is}} a very {{important}} aspect of a projectile or bullet, and is for a round projectile like a bullet the ratio of <b>frontal</b> <b>surface</b> area (half the bullet diameter squared, times pi) to bullet mass. Since, for a given bullet shape, <b>frontal</b> <b>surface</b> increases as the square of the calibre, and mass increases as the cube of the diameter, then sectional density grows linearly with bore diameter. Since BC combines shape and sectional density, a half scale model of the G1 projectile will have a BC of 0.5, and a quarter scale model will have a BC of 0.25.|$|E

50|$|Membraniporidae is a bryozoan {{family in}} the {{suborder}} Malacostega. Membranipora form encrusting or erect colonies; they are unilaminar or bilaminar and weakly to well-calcified.

An intertentacular organ is also present. The larvae are not brooded. The ancestrula is generally twinned. Kenozooids may be present in a few species; modified zooids analogous to avicularia are rare.|$|E

40|$|Intrinsic {{oscillations}} {{of stable}} geophysical <b>surface</b> <b>frontal</b> currents of the unsteady, nonlinear, reduced-gravity shallow-water equations on an f plane are investigated analytically and numerically. For frictional (Rayleigh) currents characterized by linear horizontal velocity components and parabolic cross sections, the primitive equations {{are reduced to}} a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations. In the inviscid case, two periodic analytical solutions of the nonlinear problem describing 1) the inertially reversing horizontal displace-ment of a <b>surface</b> <b>frontal</b> current having a fixed parabolic cross section and 2) the cross-front pulsation of a coastal current emerging from a motionless <b>surface</b> <b>frontal</b> layer are presented. In a linear and in a weakly nonlinear context, analytical expressions for field oscillations and their frequency shift relative to the inertial frequency are presented. For the fully nonlinear problem, solutions referring to a <b>surface</b> <b>frontal</b> coastal current are obtained analytically and numerically. These solutions show that the currents oscillate always superinertially, the frequency and the amplitude of their oscillations depending on the magnitude of the initial disturbance and on the squared current Rossby number.
