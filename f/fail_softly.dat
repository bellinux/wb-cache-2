40|$|Because of {{the nature}} of the {{problem-solving}} domains in which expert sys-tems operate, there are usually choices about what to do next. Many dif-ferent rules are potentially useful to extend the current solution state. The control problem is to select the rule or rules that most likely will lead to acceptable behavior. For many years, workers in Artificial Intelligence have tried to duck the control problem by compiling both control and application knowledge into the same large-grained rules. However, the desire to build systems that work in larger domains, <b>fail</b> <b>softly</b> at the boundaries of their competence, and are able to explain their behavior puts the importance of the control problem into sharp focus...|$|E

The relation among object predicates is defined by object trees that are fully capable of dynamic growth and maintenance. The qualitatively fuzzy inference engine and the developed expert system can then acquire a virtual-rule space that is exponentially (subject to machine implementation constants) larger than the actual, declared-rule space and with a decreasing non-zero likelihood of error. This capability is called knowledge amplification, and the methodology is named KASER. KASER is an acronym for Knowledge Amplification by Structured Expert Randomization. It can handle the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck in expert systems. KASER represents an intelligent, creative system that <b>fails</b> <b>softly,</b> learns over a network, and has enormous potential for automated decision making. KASERs compute with words and phrases and possess capabilities for metaphorical explanations...|$|R
