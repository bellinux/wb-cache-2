[...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the time for us to be thinking about history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>people</b> in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E

[...] GK Matthews, a senior toxicologist at the DH, suggested a team of medical experts {{should be sent to}} the area immediately but a month later said he had been [...] "overruled". The National Union of Public Employees said that the procedure by which the driver had access to the site was common through the region and that they believed this was connected with reduced staffing levels and privatisation plans. They added that they were concerned about the three-week delay in reporting what had happened, and that SWWA district manager John Lewis had been [...] "instructed at a very high level to say nothing". Lewis (not a member of the union) had been dismissed; the union said [...] "To single him out is unfair".|$|E

[...] Again, those who deny resurrection and afterlife, and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) {{and is about to}} escape the body? (...) [...] It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to Godto go back to life to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted (...) [...] Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: [...] "Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense." [...] At another place, the Quran urges mankind: [...] "And die not except in a state of Islam" [...] (...) because [...] "Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam" [...] (...) [...] Other verses related with this issue are: [...] "He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving" [...] (...) [...] "Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Pulque {{has been}} drunk in {{the lands of}} central Mexico {{and other parts of}} Mesoamerica since before the times of the Aztecs, who {{regarded}} the maguey plant as a divine gift. Although the natives originally had many uses for the maguey plant, the sap became the most sacred and important part of the plant because of its intoxicating qualities. The Aztecs strictly controlled the consumption of the drink, regulating who could drink, when people could drink, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>people</b> could drink, and even how people could drink. Priests and warriors of status were the only ones allowed to drink the [...] "gods' beverage" [...] on any day other than very special occasions. Many times, prisoners about to be sacrificed were given pulque to further please the gods. Other more [...] "ordinary" [...] people who drank pulque more frequently were the elderly, the sick, and pregnant women, because of the belief that the drink had healing powers. People were not allowed to drink to excess, as drunkenness was highly looked down on and only allowed to priests during specific rituals. Because of this, [...] "Aztecs permitted four cups at the most and controlled the size according to age and gender." [...] When drinking pulque during Aztec times, it was also required to pour some of the beverage on the ground, typically at the four sides of the room a person was in.|$|E
