40|$|To date, it {{is unclear}} whether adverse effects by {{genotoxic}} anthropogenic pollutants in the aquatic environment are linked to the decline of fish populations observed in European and North American freshwaters. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} investigations into the relationship between genotoxic stress and detrimental effects on development and reproduction in fish. In order to contribute to this field, the present thesis investigates effects of the alkylating genotoxin methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) on genetic integrity, histological status and reproduction in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In addition, in their unexposed offspring (F 1), larval development, histological status and reproduction as well as development in the F 2 generation were examined at the population level in order to identify potential inheritable effects of genotoxicity. First, methods for the use of primary gonad cells from zebrafish in the alkaline comet assay and histological sections of testis and ovary in the micronucleus test were developed. After in vivo exposure of adult zebrafish to MMS for up to two weeks, in the comet assay, concentrations-dependent genotoxic effects were detected in gonads, liver and gills. Likewise, the micronucleus frequency was elevated by MMS in all of these organs. Thus, the concentration range adequate for MMS exposure in the designated multi-generation experiment was identified. In the next step, zebrafish (F 0) were exposed to MMS in vivo from fertilization until the age of one year. Mortality of F 0 fish clearly depended on MMS concentrations. In exposed fish, times of first spawning were delayed and fertility was reduced. However, no unequivocal effects on growth were found. In F 1 fish derived from MMS-exposed fish, teratogenic effects were increased, larval survival was reduced and sex ratio was shifted towards females. However, compared to the exposed F 0 <b>generation,</b> <b>fertility</b> of the non-exposed F 1 generation recovered. Development and survival rates recovered in the F 2 generation. Significant genotoxic effects were found in the livers, gills and gonads of either sex of the F 0 generation. Regarding histopathological aberrations and external lesions, mainly malformations of eyes, gills and liver and a number of neoplasia were observed in both the F 0 and F 1 generation. According to indirect measurement of MMS concentrations using ion chromatography, real concentrations in the replicate tanks were similar. Taken together, chronic exposure of zebrafish to MMS led to DNA damage in somatic and generative tissues, induced the formation of a multitude of histopathological aberrations and affected survival, reproduction and development in exposed fish and their offspring. Regarding several endpoints, cessation of exposure allowed for recover over the generations. Combining these results with data of previous studies and transferring them to the environmental situation, there is considerable evidence that anthropogenic genotoxicants play a role in the decline of wild fish populations...|$|E
40|$|Is {{there an}} {{economic}} rationale for pronatalist policies? We propose and analyze a particular market failure {{that leads to}} inefficiently low fertility in equilibrium. The friction {{is caused by the}} lack of ownership of children: if parents have no claim on their children’s income, the private benefit from producing a child can be smaller than the social benefit. We analyze an overlapping-generations model with fertility choice and parental altruism. Ownership is modeled as a minimum constraint on transfers from parents to children. Using the efficiency concepts proposed in Golosov, Jones, and Tertilt (2007), we find that whenever the transfer floor is binding, fertility choices are inefficient. Second, we show that the usual conditions for efficiency are not sufficient in this context. Third, in contrast to settings with exogenous fertility, a PAYG social security system cannot be used to implement efficient allocations. To achieve an efficient outcome, government transfers need to be tied to fertility choice. Keywords; overlapping <b>generations,</b> <b>fertility,</b> efficiency...|$|R

The relationship is reversed only if debt is sufficiently low and the share of capital (labor) in the economy is sufficiently low (high). Hence, our analysis would recommend that developed, capital intensive economies (such as OECD countries) aiming at a fertility recovery should reduce national debt, while developing, labor intensive economies, aiming at reducing fertility, should increase (reduce) national debt {{only if they are}} debt virtuous (vicious). overlapping <b>generations,</b> endogenous <b>fertility,</b> debt. ...|$|R
40|$|Age at {{marriage}} is increasing is decreasing {{in nearly all}} regions of the world. Five hypotheses for changes in marriage trends (economic modernization, supply and demand, social/cultural influences, healthcare quality, and longevity risk sharing) are tested through cross-country regression analyses of the timing and prevalence of marriage, using 40 explanatory variables from 156 countries. Ample evidence {{of the impact of}} economic modernization and education is found. The influence of cultural beliefs is evidenced by the presence of religious variables in several selected regression equations. Social Security 2 ̆ 7 s benefit-to-cost ratio is found to be higher the smaller the marriage age gap. A downward trend of marriage age difference implies increased costs to the Social Security program, implying a larger income transfer from future <b>generations.</b> <b>Fertility</b> rate exhibits considerable cross-country variations and have declined significantly across time in most countries. The extent to which fertility behaviors are influenced by exogenous components such as financial development and social security tax is analyzed, using a panel data from 169 countries from 1972 – 2000. To confront an endogeneity problem, the national legal origin is used as an instrumental variable. To overcome an omitted variable bias, an exogenous measure of family planning effort is included in panel regression models. The result indicates that people in countries with lower levels of financial development tend to have more children to substitute an investment in the capital markets, which is not easily accessible or not available to them. This evidence shed light on the welfare implication regarding a “poverty trap” problem in that those who are already poor or those in less financially developed countries {{are more likely to have}} more children, which will lower their overall welfare, and further reduce their chance to invest in the capital markets. Social security tax also has a negative impact on fertility behaviors. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a general {{equilibrium}} model with overlapping <b>generations,</b> endogenous <b>fertility</b> and public pensions. By assuming Cobb– Douglas technology and logarithmic preferences, we show that {{the introduction of a}} fertility-related component in the pay-as-you-go pension scheme may destabilise the long-term equilibrium and cause endogenous fluctuations when individuals have static expectations. The possibility of cyclical instability increases (resp. reduces) when both the subjective discount factor and relative weight of individual fertility in pay-as-you-go pensions (resp. the parents’ taste for children) increase(s). Interestingly, when public pensions are contingent on the individual number of children, the financing of smallsized benefits may cause the occurrence of a flip bifurcation, two-period cycles and cycles of a higher order. In addition, we show through numerical simulations that these results hold in a more general setting with a constant inter-temporal elasticity of substitution utility function and a constant elasticity of substitution production function. Our findings identify a possible novel factor responsible for persistent deterministic fluctuations in a context of overlapping generations, while also representing a policy warning regarding the destabilising effects of fertility-related pension reforms, which are currently high in both the theoretical debate and the political agendas of several developed countries...|$|R
