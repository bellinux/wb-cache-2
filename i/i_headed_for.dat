60|$|It {{was with}} very {{different}} feelings from those which had animated the bosom when approaching the Bassett twenty-four hours before {{in the same manner}} in this same drawing-room that <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> where she sat.

60|$|I {{could guess}} that {{the scene on}} deck was a spectacle, and at six o'clock, as gray light showed through my ports in the {{intervals}} {{when they were not}} submerged, I essayed the side-board of my bunk like a gymnast, captured my careering slippers, and shuddered as I thrust my bare feet into their chill sogginess. I did not wait to dress. Merely in pyjamas <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the poop, Possum wailing dismally at my desertion.|$|E

If I were sure of some time getting a supervisor's job, or even an {{assistant}} supervisor's position, the outlook {{would not be so}} hopeless. But to get even that far means years of work, years of riding." [...] And then, as he thought of his lonely cabin, so unsuited to a woman's life, he said: [...] "No, I must quit the service; that's sure." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the Great Indian Desert {{upon the}} proper date, as I had promised, {{and the night}} Mail set me down at Marwar Junction, where a funny little, happy-go-lucky, native managed railway runs to Jodhpore.

60|$|I guess I {{was about}} due {{that night to}} meet someone from the country. There still come days in the spring when the country seems to get a stranglehold on me and start in pulling. This {{particular}} day {{had been one of}} them. I got {{up in the morning and}} looked out of the window, and the breeze just wrapped me round and began whispering about pigs and chickens. And when I went out on Fifth Avenue there seemed to be flowers everywhere. <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the Park, and there was the grass all green, and the trees coming out, and a sort of something in the air--why, say, if there hadn't have been a big policeman keeping an eye on me, I'd have flung myself down and bitten chunks out of the turf.|$|E

60|$|At the top, I {{found myself}} in a vacant lot. On one side was a low wall that {{separated}} it from the street. There {{was no time for}} minute investigation. They were at my heels. <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the wall and vaulted it. And right there was where I got the surprise of my life. One is used to thinking that one side of a wall is just as high as the other side. But that wall was different. You see, the vacant lot was much higher than the level of the street. On my side the wall was low, but on the other side--well, as I came soaring over the top, all holds free, {{it seemed to me that}} I was falling feet-first, plump into an abyss. There beneath me, on the sidewalk, under the light of a street-lamp was a bull. I guess it was nine or ten feet down to the sidewalk; but in the shock of surprise in mid-air it seemed twice that distance.|$|E
6000|$|A hard {{town for}} [...] "scoffings," [...] {{was what the}} hoboes called it at that time.

Why, I was so hard put in that town, one day, that I gave the porter the slip and invaded the private car of some {{itinerant}} millionnaire. The train started as I made the platform, and <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the aforesaid millionnaire with the porter one jump behind and reaching for me. It was a dead heat, for I reached the millionnaire at the same instant that the porter reached me. I had no time for formalities. [...] "Gimme a quarter to eat on," [...] I blurted out. And as I live, that millionnaire dipped into his pocket and gave me ... just ... precisely ... a quarter. It is my conviction that he was so flabbergasted that he obeyed automatically, and it has been a matter of keen regret ever since, on my part, that I didn't ask him for a dollar. I know that I'd have got it. I swung off the platform of that private car with the porter manoeuvring to kick me in the face. He missed me. One is at a terrible disadvantage when trying to swing off the lowest step of a car and not break his neck on the right of way, with, at the same time, an irate Ethiopian on the platform above trying to land him in the face with a number eleven. But I got the quarter! I got it! ...|$|E

60|$|Having {{assembled}} the Delta and Epsilon, {{one on each}} side of me, I received the report from Miriam and Var, the respective commanders. Each had expended twelve torpedoes, and between them they had sunk twenty-two steamers. One man had been killed by the machinery on board of the Delta, and two had been burned by the ignition of some oil on the Epsilon. I took these injured men on board, and I gave each of the boats one of my crew. I also divided my spare oil, my provisions, and my torpedoes among them, though we had the greatest possible difficulty in those crank vessels in transferring them from one to the other. However, by ten o'clock it was done, and the two vessels were in condition to keep the sea for another ten days. For my part, with only two torpedoes left, I headed north up the Irish Sea. One of my torpedoes I expended that evening upon a cattle-ship making for Milford Haven. Late at night, being abreast of Holyhead, I called upon my four northern boats, but without reply. Their Marconi range is very limited. About three in the afternoon of the next day I had a feeble answer. It was a great relief to me to find that my telegraphic instructions had reached them and that they were on their station. Before evening we all assembled in the lee of Sanda Island, in the Mull of Kintyre. I felt an admiral indeed when I saw my five whale-backs all in a row. Panza's report was excellent. They had come round by the Pentland Firth and reached their cruising ground on the fourth day. Already they had destroyed twenty vessels without any mishap. I ordered the Beta to divide her oil and torpedoes among the other three, so that they were in good condition to continue their cruise. Then the Beta and <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> home, reaching our base upon Sunday, April 25th. Off Cape Wrath I picked up a paper from a small schooner.|$|E
