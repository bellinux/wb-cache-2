Other observed visitors include the <b>great</b> <b>cormorant</b> (Phalacrocorax carbo novaehollandiae), nankeen kestrel (Falco cenchroides cenchroides), banded lapwing (Vanellus tricolor), greater sand plover (Charadrius leschenaultii), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus variegatus), greenshank (Tringa nebularia), sanderling (Calidris alba), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys) and brown songlark (Cincloramphus cruralis).|$|E
5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the <b>great</b> <b>cormorant.</b> Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E

50|$|The {{islands are}} {{a haven for}} seabirds. The species include mute swan, black guillemot, great crested grebe and {{numerous}} species of sea gulls. Recently <b>great</b> <b>cormorants</b> have spread to the archipelago and their numbers are increasing. This not necessarily viewed as a good thing by nature lovers, since <b>great</b> <b>cormorants</b> live in dense colonies which will eventually poison surrounding plant life by their excrement.|$|R
25|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the <b>great</b> <b>cormorant.</b> Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, useful for detecting predators, while those with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate distances when hunting. The American woodcock probably has the largest visual field of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane, and 180° in the vertical plane.|$|E
25|$|The {{park has}} some 8,800 trees, {{including}} Ginkgo biloba, Cinnamomum camphora, Zelkova serrata, Formosan cherry, Somei-Yoshino cherry, and Japanese cherry. There {{is a further}} 24,800m2 of shrubs. Shinobazu Pond is a small lake with an area of 16 ha, extensive lotus beds, and marshland. It provides an important wintering ground for birds. Species commonly found include the tufted duck, Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, common pochard, little grebe, great egret, and <b>great</b> <b>cormorant.</b> The Baer's pochard, ring-necked duck, and American wigeon have also been recorded.|$|E

40|$|Since 2005, <b>great</b> <b>cormorants</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} on the Lake Góreckie (Wielkopolski National Park) shoreline. The population of these birds occurring within the lake has gradually increased. In autumn 2008, more than 100 individuals were observed. In the period 2009 - 2012 the number of birds occupying the island periodically exceeded 250 individuals. So far, there is no breeding colony of <b>great</b> <b>cormorants,</b> but the birds have established a roosting colony on the island. In the period 2009 - 2012 we conducted research {{on the impact of}} the colony of <b>great</b> <b>cormorants</b> on the accumulation of nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements in soils beneath the colony and transfer of chemical elements from the colony to a nearby freshwater ecosystem. Our results show that a relatively small and recent colony of <b>great</b> <b>cormorants</b> can significantly affect the chemistry of soil. Compared to a control, the soil beneath the colony was characterized by statistically higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. A significant accumulation of nutrients was observed in the topsoil zone (to a depth of about 20 cm). Enrichment of soil in chemical elements has resulted in their further transport to a nearby lake. Compared to the control, the groundwater and surface runoff from the colony area revealed several-fold higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. The maximum abundance of cormorants in the roosting colony was reflected in the elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the littoral water near the colony. Our study demonstrates that the roosting colony of <b>great</b> <b>cormorants</b> can {{play a significant role in}} accelerating the eutrophication of surface waters...|$|R
40|$|Colonization of {{new species}} into an {{established}} community generally results in interspecific competition over resources between the colonist and existing members of the community. Interspecific competition {{has been suggested}} to influence extinction rates, population dynamics, community structure, niche differentiation and evolution. In this study, we observe possible interspecific competition over breeding sites resulting in niche differentiation and coexistence of <b>Great</b> <b>Cormorants</b> Phalacrocorax carbo and Common Guillemots Uria aalge in a seabird cliff community. In Sweden, <b>Great</b> <b>Cormorants</b> have naturally increased and expanded {{during the last two}} decades. Here, we show that most Common Guillemots previously bred on cliff ledges with high roof heights before the studyisland was colonized by <b>Great</b> <b>Cormorants,</b> but are now mainly found breeding on cliff ledges with lower roof heights. A temporary decline in the Common Guillemot population coincided with the colonization event and we discuss the potential for this decline to be caused by increased nest-site competition combined with high nest-site fidelity...|$|R
25|$|Birds of {{the delta}} are both winter {{visitors}} and passage migrants including <b>great</b> <b>cormorant</b> (Phalacrocorax carbo), {{a wide variety of}} Anatidae, Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), about thirty species of migratory shorebirds, the whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybrida), the Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia), and the brown-headed gull (Larus brunnicephalus), which is very common. One of the most numerous wintering shorebird is the lesser sand plover (Charadrius mongolus), which occurs in flocks of many thousands along the outer coast {{of the delta}}. The wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola) and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) are also abundant.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that the herons have nested near Juodkrantė since 17th century, but the cormorants arrived only {{at the beginning of}} 19th century. The cormorants were exterminated {{at the end of the}} 19th century due to Prussian administration regulations and started to reappear only in the 1970s. The large cormorant colony has damaged the old and fragile forest because the birds' excrement burns tree roots. During last 15 years about 10 ha (25 acres) of forest has died. Fishermen blame the birds for diminishing fish catches, but unlike in Prussia, the regulations now do not allow killing them as both grey heron and <b>great</b> <b>cormorant</b> are protected species in Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|After fishing, {{cormorants}} go ashore, and {{are frequently}} seen holding their wings {{out in the}} sun. All cormorants have preen gland secretions that are used ostensibly to keep the feathers waterproof. Some sources state that cormorants have waterproof feathers while others {{say that they have}} water permeable feathers. Still others suggests that the outer plumage absorbs water but does not permit it to penetrate the layer of air next to the skin. The wing drying action is seen even in the flightless cormorant but commonly in the Antarctic shags and red-legged cormorants. Alternate functions suggested for the spread-wing posture include that it aids thermoregulation, digestion, balances the bird or indicates presence of fish. A detailed study of the <b>great</b> <b>cormorant</b> concludes that it is without doubt to dry the plumage.|$|E

40|$|The {{area where}} the colony of <b>great</b> <b>cormorants</b> in Curonian Spit (Lithuania) prospers from 1989 is the study object of “Koreko” project. Based on geochemical results of 90 samples of topsoil from 6 zones which differ {{according}} {{to the influence of}} the <b>great</b> <b>cormorants</b> the following main accumulating chemical elements were revealed: S, Cu, P, Cl, Ti and Ca. The contents of some other harmful chemical elements (Cr, Zn, Ni, Pb and Sb) are also elevated in the influence zones of cormorants. Energy-dispersive analysis was used for determination of the contents of 33 chemical elements...|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is spread}} over 2 km2. It {{is home to}} flamingos, yellow-billed storks, ospreys, grey herons, <b>great</b> <b>cormorants,</b> kingfishers, baya weavers, garganeys, among others. It is often visited by bird watchers.|$|R
25|$|Smooth Island {{is home to}} a {{wide range}} of native Australian birds. Recorded {{breeding}} seabird species are little penguin (Eudyptula minor), little pied cormorant, black-faced cormorant, <b>great</b> <b>cormorant</b> and short-tailed shearwater (Ardenna tenuirostris). The latter predominantly habitates inland from the western to southern coasts. The following native birds occupy the island: Tasmanian nativehen and forest raven. The Pacific gull also occupies the island. A survey by the Department of the Environment (Australia) in 2010 revealed the presence of the Eurasian skylark (Alauda arvensis), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and common blackbird (Turdus merula) on the island. The presence of sea eagle, wedge-tailed eagle, kelp gull, tern, silver gull, oystercatcher, cormorant and gannet species have also been described. No reptiles have been recorded on the island apart from a small population of blue tongue lizards. The hooded plover (Thinornis cucullatus) is a threatened species which may be present on Smooth Island.|$|E
2500|$|No {{consistent}} distinction {{exists between}} cormorants and shags. The names 'cormorant' and 'shag' were originally the common {{names of the}} two species of the family found in Great Britain, Phalacrocorax carbo (now referred to by ornithologists as the <b>great</b> <b>cormorant)</b> and P. aristotelis (the European shag). [...] "Shag" [...] refers to the bird's crest, which the British forms of the <b>great</b> <b>cormorant</b> lack. As other species were discovered by English-speaking sailors and explorers elsewhere in the world, some were called cormorants and some shags, depending on whether they had crests or not. Sometimes the same species is called a cormorant {{in one part of}} the world and a shag in another, e.g., the <b>great</b> <b>cormorant</b> is called the black shag in New Zealand (the birds found in Australasia have a crest that is absent in European members of the species). Van Tets (1976) proposed to divide the family into two genera and attach the name [...] "cormorant" [...] to one and [...] "shag" [...] to the other, but this flies in the face of common usage and has not been widely adopted.|$|E
2500|$|Skopelos has {{a variety}} of fauna - {{including}} about 60 species of wild birds-native and migratory. There are several birds of prey, most common being the Eleonora's falcon (Falco Eleonorae), the European scops owl (Otus Scops) and the common buzzard (Buteo buteo). Also to be seen are kestrels, eagles, and vultures, and very obvious throughout the island is the hooded crow (Corvus cornix). Occasionally [...] grey herons and kingfishers and, more commonly, the <b>great</b> <b>cormorant</b> (Phalacrocorax carbo), the herring gull (Larus argentatus) and the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) are seen along the coast. Severe winter weather can temporarily introduce rarely seen mainland birds. In March 2007 the Municipal Authorities cleaned a wetland habitat near the town beach at the outlet to the sea of Skopelos' only permanently flowing stream. The area had been home to frogs and the birds that fed on them.|$|E

40|$|Conflict {{arises in}} {{fisheries}} worldwide when piscivorous birds target fish species of commercial value. This paper presents {{a method for}} estimating size selectivity functions for piscivores and uses it to compare predation selectivities of <b>Great</b> <b>Cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis L. 1758) with that of gill-net fishing on a European perch (Perca fluviatilis L. 1758) population in the Curonian Lagoon, Lithuania. Fishers often regard cormorants as an unwanted "satellite species", but the degree of direct competition and overlap in size-specific selectivity between fishers and cormorants is unknown. This study showed negligible overlap in selectivity between <b>Great</b> <b>Cormorants</b> and legal-sized commercial nets. The selectivity estimation method has general application potential for use in conjunction with population dynamics models to assess fish population responses to size-selective fishing {{from a wide range}} of piscivorous predators...|$|R
