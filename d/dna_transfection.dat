50|$|The {{discovery}} that mediating positive charge on PAMAM dendrimer surfaces decreases their cytotoxicity has interesting implications for <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> applications. Because the cell membrane has a negatively charged exterior, and the DNA phosphate backbone is also negatively charged, the transfection of free DNA {{is not very}} efficient simply due to charge repulsion. However, it would be reasonable to expect charged interactions between the anionic phosphate backbone of DNA and the amino-terminated surface groups of PAMAM dendrimers, which are positively ionized under physiological conditions. This {{could result in a}} PAMAM-DNA complex, which would make <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> more efficient due to neutralization of the charges on both elements, while the cytotoxicity of the PAMAM dendrimer would also be reduced.

50|$|In {{the context}} of {{existing}} approaches to gene transfer, PAMAM dendrimers hold a strong position relative to major classical technologies such as electroporation, microinjection, and viral methods. Electroporation, which involves pulsing electricity through cells to create holes in the membrane through which DNA can enter, has obvious cytotoxic effects and is not appropriate for in vivo applications. On the other hand, microinjection, the use of fine needles to physically inject genetic material into the cell nucleus, offers more control but is a high-skill, meticulous task in which a relatively low number of cells can be transfected. Although viral vectors can offer highly specific, high-efficiency transfection, the generation of such viruses is costly and time-consuming; furthermore, the inherent viral nature of the gene transfer often triggers an immune response, thus limiting in vivo applications. In fact, many modern transfection technologies are based on artificially assembled liposomes (both liposomes and PAMAMs are positively charged macromolecules). Since PAMAM dendrimers and their complexes with DNA exhibit low cytotoxicity, higher transfection efficiencies than liposome-based methods, and are effective across {{a broad range of}} cell lines, they have taken an important place in modern gene therapy methodologies. The biotechnology company Qiagen currently offers two <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> product lines (SuperFect and PolyFect) based on activated PAMAM dendrimer technology.|$|E
40|$|Calcium phosphate-mediated <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> and {{retroviral}} infection are two alternative gene transfer techniques designed to introduce specific DNA fragments into the chromosomes of recipient cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gene {{transfer}} {{is a potential}} treatment modality of genetic disease. Efficient, practical methods of <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> are currently under investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A beta-galactosidase reporter plasmid interacted electrostatically with histones, poly-L-Lys, poly-L-Arg, and a combination of poly-L-Lys and poly-L-Arg. This complex was then used to transfect COS- 7 cells. beta-galactosidase activity was quantified and {{used to compare the}} efficiency of gene transfection in vitro. A comparison was also made of <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> with the most active histone subclass, i. e., histone H 2 A, in the absence and presence of an anionic liposome. RESULTS: There was a marked increase in <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> in the presence of histone H 2 A when compared with the control, whereas each of the other histones and polycations showed little, if any, effect. The extent of activation depends strongly on the DNA/histone ratio and is also a function of the molarity of the final Tris-acetate, pH 8, solution. The anionic liposomes used demonstrated an inhibitory effect. CONCLUSIONS: Histone H 2 A significantly enhances in vitro <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> whereas other histones and anionic liposomes do not. A study of the difference between histone H 2 A and other histone subclasses may serve to clarify some of the mechanisms and the essential components of efficient gene delivery...|$|E

We have systematically investigated transcriptional activation by vMyb and have made several new observations: (i) v-Myb is a very weak activator when compared to GAL 4; (ii) very weak transcriptional activation by v-Myb is sufficient for transformation, whereas very strong transcriptional activation by a vMyb-VP 16 fusion protein is not; and (iii) v-Myb can activate transcription by two genetically distinct mechanisms, only one of which requires the presence of Myb-binding sites...|$|R

40|$|Non-viral vectors {{have been}} used to deliver {{therapeutic}} genes to treat different diseases. There are a variety of non-viral vectors such as liposomes, cationic polymers and peptides. Among all, pH responsive peptides showed excellent <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> efficiency in many types of cell. These peptides are capable of changing their structural conformation as pH decreases, adopting a disordered structure which can destabilize endosomal membrane and therefore enhancing the release of DNA from endosomes into cytosol. Traditional pH responsive histidine-rich peptides showed good <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> efficiency and low toxicity to the cells when compared with other non-viral vectors. However, their low pKa value restricted these peptides to be protonated only at late endosomal stage, in which DNA is extremely susceptible to endosomal degradation. This hindered the DNA to be released to the cytosol efficiently and therefore reduced <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> efficiency. In response to this, it is of great interest to probe into the insertion of either 2, 3 -diaminopropionic acid (Dap) or methylated- 2, 3 -diaminopropionic acid Dap(Me) to the peptide as alternative pH sensitive components. The pKa values for both Dap and Dap(Me) peptides are higher than that of histidine. It is anticipated that the higher pKa value, the protonation of peptide could be happened at an earlier stage of endosomal maturation. Such protonation of peptide destabilizes the endosome membrane rapidly, causing the release of DNA to the cytosol effectively and hence improving <b>DNA</b> <b>transfection</b> efficiency. In this experiment, LADap(Me) 4 -L 1 peptide was the optimal candidate within the series.

Our results show that HBV CCC DNA formed in hepatoma cells was derived predominantly from RC DNA with a precise junction sequence. In contrast to that of DHBV, HBV CCC DNA formation in cultured cells was accompanied by the accumulation of a RC DNA species from which the covalently attached viral reverse transcriptase (RT) protein was removed (protein-free or PF-RC DNA). Furthermore, whereas envelope deficiency led to increased CCC DNA formation in DHBV, it resulted mainly in increased PF-RC, but not CCC, DNA in HBV, suggesting that the envelope protein(s) may negatively regulate a step in CCC DNA formation that precedes deproteination in both HBV and DHBV.

One of the stable transfected cell lines expressed, {{in addition to the}} expected normal αA- and alternatively spliced αAins-crystallins, two slightly larger, immunologically cross-reacting proteins. These proteins were found to be encoded by a mutant αA-crystallin gene with a large intragenic duplication, arisen by illegitimate recombination at two CCCAT homologies, ≈ 1. 8 kilobases apart in the normal hamster αA-crystallin gene. As a consequence, a tandem-duplicated exon 3 sequence is present in the mature mRNA of this gene, resulting in a 41 -residue repeat in the translated proteins. Cells expressing the elongated αA-crystallins have normal growth characteristics and the usual diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of immunoreactive αA-crystallin. Size-exclusion chromatography of cell extracts indicated that the mutant proteins are readily incorporated into the normal large water-soluble αA-crystallin complexes, showing that the insert does not disturb the integrity of these complexes.
