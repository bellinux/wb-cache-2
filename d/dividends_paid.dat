5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding scale, ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the <b>dividends</b> <b>paid</b> to investors were low.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the river}} was a free river, there are no figures for traffic on the lower river. However, it {{connected}} {{to a number of}} waterways on which tolls were collected, and so an indication of the traffic can be gained from the figures for these waterways. The main cargoes on Beverley Beck in 1730 were coal, bricks, turfs and wool, together with cereal crops, consisting of wheat, barley, oats and malt. Receipts from tolls more than doubled between 1732 and 1748, after which the tolls were let to an independent collector. The annual rent charged for this privilege doubled again between 1748 and 1792. There was a steady expansion of trade on the Driffield Navigation during the same period, as the <b>dividends</b> <b>paid</b> to shareholders rose from 1.5 to 4 per cent. In 1789, Bainton, Boyes and Co negotiated a lump sum payment to cover coal from the Aire and Calder Navigation to their new carpet factory and the export of their carpets in the downstream direction. The factory later became a corn mill.|$|E

This study conducted at the banking sector listed in Indonesia stock exchange period from 2011 until 2014. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) by Amos Software 21. 00 was used to analyze the data, and the result shows high goodness of fit while the simultaneous and individual tests generate significant result except the direct influence of liquidity toward growth of stock price. The results of this study shows that; (1) the ratio of liquidity does not affect to the growth of stock price, (2) The ratio of liquidity has positive effect and significantly to <b>dividend</b> <b>paid</b> out, (3). The profitability ratio has positive effect and significantly to the growth of stock price, (4). The ratio of profitability has positive effect and significantly to <b>dividend</b> <b>paid</b> out, (5). The <b>dividend</b> <b>paid</b> out has positive effect and significantly to growth of stock price, so we may conclude that the result evidently shows the <b>dividend</b> <b>paid</b> out was able to mediate the influence of liquidity and profitability toward growth of stock price...|$|R

Shortly after the report's publication and a sharp drop in Citigroup's stock, Charles Prince resigned as the bank's CEO and his successor slashed the dividend. Earlier that year, Forbes magazine had listed Whitney as the second-best stock picker in the capital-market industry. Citigroup stock went on to lose 97% of its value by early 2009.|$|E

Tests by the Federal government revealed that Wells Fargo needed an additional $13.7billion in order to remain well capitalized if the economy were to deteriorate further under stress test scenarios. On May 11, 2009 Wells Fargo announced an additional stock offering which was completed on May 13, 2009 raising $8.6billion in capital.

25|$|The bank charter had various clauses to {{help prevent}} {{possible}} insolvency and reduce risks. Bank officers were not permitted to receive loans at a rate different from that offered to the public. The bank could not issue securities on its own stock, and any loan over $500 had {{to be approved by}} five-sevenths of banks board members. Any losses were to be paid by the individual shareholders up to an amount equal to their stock value. At it highest point, in 1851, the bank had $4 million of bank notes in circulation and $2 million in specie reserves. The bank was an early success. Many who had purchased the stock on credit found that the <b>dividends</b> <b>paid</b> out exceeded the interest they were charged, {{and by the time the}} bank's charter expired almost all of the public stock had been paid for with investors receiving as much a 650% return on investment when the bank closed.|$|E

[...] The case did not involve compensation for labor or services.

500|$|The {{bridge was}} not a {{commercial}} success. It was [...] long and only [...] wide, making it impractical for larger vehicles to use. Holland's design consisted of nineteen separate narrow spans, the widest being only [...] wide, and boats {{found it difficult to}} navigate beneath the bridge; {{there were a number of}} accidents including serious injuries and deaths. Repeatedly rammed by passing shipping, the bridge required frequent costly repairs, and <b>dividends</b> <b>paid</b> to investors were low. During a particularly cold winter in 1795 the bridge was badly damaged by ice, necessitating lengthy and expensive reconstruction, and no dividends at all were paid for the next three years. Concerns were expressed in Parliament about the reliability of the bridge, and the Battersea Bridge Company was obliged to provide a ferry service at the same rate as the bridge tolls, in the event of the bridge being closed for repairs.|$|E

2500|$|Cash {{dividends}} are {{the most}} common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via electronic funds transfer or a printed paper check. Such dividends are a form of investment income and are usually taxable to the recipient in the year they are paid. This is the most common method of sharing corporate profits with the shareholders of the company. For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the cash dividend is 50 cents per share, the holder of the stock will be paid $50.
