5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as phosphatidylcholine {{are a key}} constituent of {{the intestinal}} mucus barrier, and therefore may contribute to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, {{are present in the}} apical membrane of the <b>gut</b> epithelia, and are also important for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved <b>gut</b> microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays {{a crucial role}} in the immune system. The microorganisms that make up the <b>gut</b> flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to <b>gut</b> immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guts</b> (Gattsu) is a {{wandering}} mercenary whose {{entire world}} from birth is warfare and bloodshed. Born from a hanged corpse, the adoptive mother who rescued him dies from the plague when <b>Guts</b> is {{only two years}} old, {{and from then on}} <b>Guts</b> learns to fight in the mercenary band led by his adoptive father Gambino. Gambino is cruel to <b>Guts</b> even as he teaches the boy warfare, selling access to <b>Guts</b> to a rapist among the mercenaries and later attempting to murder <b>Guts</b> in a drunken rage. <b>Guts</b> flees after killing his adoptive father in self-defense.|$|R
50|$|There is {{one major}} stat a monster has {{which is only}} obvious in battle, it's <b>guts</b> {{regeneration}} rate. Every time you do a move, it costs {{a certain amount of}} <b>guts,</b> if you don't have enough <b>guts</b> to do a certain move, you have to wait until you regenerate enough <b>guts</b> to do it.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the start}} of each match, each player is {{assigned}} an amount of [...] "guts" [...] proportional to their level. Every default move they perform during the match takes a small amount from their <b>guts.</b> The more work a player does on the field, the more <b>guts</b> they lose. Thus, <b>guts</b> {{can be thought of as}} a measure of energy a player has. Special abilities will take a huge amount of <b>guts</b> from the player, rendering him useless after they perform one or two. When the player is very low on <b>guts,</b> all he is able to do is pass to another player with more <b>guts,</b> or keep running with the ball. After every half-time, some of the player's <b>guts</b> are replenished.|$|R
5|$|Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested {{material}} {{through the}} mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them. The <b>gut</b> is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the <b>gut</b> or pharynx (throat).|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses {{replicate}} {{mainly in}} the <b>gut,</b> and infect enterocytes of the villi of the small intestine, leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium. The triple protein coats make them resistant to the acidic pH of the stomach and the digestive enzymes in the <b>gut.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} inside {{the base of the}} crown of tentacles but to one side. The <b>gut</b> runs from the mouth {{to one side of the}} stomach, in the bottom of the ampulla. The {{intestine}} runs from the stomach, up the other side the body, and exits at the anus, outside and a little below the crown of tentacles. The <b>gut</b> and intestine are both supported by two mesenteries (partitions that run the length of the body) connected to the body wall, and another mesentery connects the <b>gut</b> to the intestine.|$|E

5|$|The {{surrounded}} sac {{becomes the}} primitive <b>gut.</b> Sections of this <b>gut</b> begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, {{such as the}} esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The esophagus develops {{as part of the}} foregut tube. The innervation of the esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} {{muscle is}} derived from mesoderm and {{plays a role in}} the embryological rotation of the <b>gut,</b> by offering a point of fixation for the rotating <b>gut.</b> It is also thought to help digestion by widening the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare abnormality caused by a congenitally-short suspensory muscle.|$|E
5|$|Toroids : The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata {{from the}} Nama Group, Namibia, has been {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large <b>gut</b> cavity and a transversely ridged ectoderm. The organism is {{in the shape of}} a flattened torus, with the long axis of its toroidal body running through the approximate center of the presumed <b>gut</b> cavity.|$|E

40|$|Production of <b>gutted,</b> or helper-dependent, {{adenovirus}} vectors {{by current}} methods is inefficient. Typically, a plasmid {{form of the}} <b>gutted</b> genome is transfected with helper viral DNA into 293 cells; the resulting lysate is serially passaged to increase the titer of <b>gutted</b> virions. Inefficient production of <b>gutted</b> virus particles after cotransfection is likely due to suboptimal association of replication factors with the abnormal origins found in these plasmid substrates. To test this hypothesis, we explored whether <b>gutted</b> virus production would be facilitated by transfection into cells expressing various viral replication factors. We observed that C 7 cells, coexpressing adenoviral DNA polymerase and preterminal protein, converted plasmid DNA into replicating virus approximately 50 times more efficiently than did 293 cells. This property of C 7 cells {{can be used to}} greatly increase the efficiency of <b>gutted</b> virus production after cotransfection of <b>gutted</b> and helper viral DNA. These cells should also be useful for generation of recombinant adenovirus from any plasmid-based precursor...|$|R

5|$|Archaea {{can also}} be commensals, benefiting from an {{association}} without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii {{is by far the}} most common archaean in the human flora, making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human <b>gut.</b> In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the <b>gut</b> to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the rhizosphere).|$|E
5|$|C. elegans is an unsegmented pseudocoelomate, and lacks a {{respiratory}} and a circulatory system. It possesses <b>gut</b> granules which emit {{a brilliant}} blue fluorescence, {{a wave of}} which is seen at death in a 'death fluorescence'.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gutting</b> {{was born}} in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and was ordained a priest on July 3, 1949. <b>Gutting</b> was {{appointed}} auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Speyer, as well as titular bishop of Sufar, on May 31, 1971 and ordained a bishop on September 12, 1971. <b>Gutting</b> retired as auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Speyer on February 24, 1994.|$|R
5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the <b>gut,</b> and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the <b>gut,</b> and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human <b>gut</b> flora of the intestines can contribute to <b>gut</b> immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this <b>gut</b> flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the <b>gut</b> through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy <b>gut</b> microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E
50|$|Philosopher Gary <b>Gutting</b> rejects Russell's Teapot {{for similar}} reasons, arguing that Russell's {{argument}} accords theism far less support {{than it actually}} has. <b>Gutting</b> points out that numerous sensible, competent people appeal to personal experience and arguments in support of God's existence. Thus, to simply reject the existence of God, out of hand, seems unjustified, according to <b>Gutting.</b>|$|R

5|$|More {{controversial}} is {{the addition}} of ezetimibe, which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the <b>gut.</b> While it reduces LDL cholesterol, {{it does not appear}} to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the intima-media thickness.

5|$|Narayan uses a sarangi {{obtained}} from Uday Lal and built in Meerut in the 1920s or 1930s in his concerts and recordings. He plays on foreign harp strings {{to produce a}} clearer tone. Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument and added a fourth string, but removed it because it hindered playing. In the 1940s, he exchanged <b>gut</b> with steel for the first string and {{found it easier to}} play, but reverted to using only <b>gut</b> strings because the steel string altered the sound.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guts</b> {{made his}} first title defense in September, 1974, and beat González again in November, 1974 for his second title defense. The next {{challenger}} was Scotsman Ken Buchanan, who was 56-2-0 (25KOs) and had not lost {{in the last three}} years. The fight was scheduled for February, 1975. Buchanan led the early and middle rounds by points, but <b>Guts</b> fought back in the later rounds, swinging his ams around almost blindly to slow Buchanan's pace. The fight ended lopsidedly, with <b>Guts</b> slugging Buchanan for the last three rounds. All three judges awarded <b>Guts</b> the win.|$|R
50|$|<b>Guts</b> {{moved up}} to Junior Welterweight (current Super Lightweight/Light Welterweight) in 1977, {{challenging}} Saensak Muangsurin, but was knocked out in the 6th round. Despite having moved up a weight class, <b>Guts</b> still had to shed 15 kg off his natural weight to make the weight-in. <b>Guts</b> retired after losing again in a non-title match on June 20, 1978. His record was 31-14-6 (17KOs).|$|R
50|$|Out {{of all of}} Acker’s books, Blood and <b>Guts</b> in High School has {{received}} the widest criticisms and reviews.
