60|$|This is {{the plain}} {{matter of fact}} which Bunyan {{establishes}} from the sacred Scriptures, but he was, as to lettered lore, an unlearned man; at all events, no man could say of him that 'much learning has made thee mad.' Bunyan's is the plain common-sense scriptural account of this building; but he differs greatly from almost all our learned commentators--they imagining that this house was near the temple of Jerusalem. The Assembly of Divines, in their valuable annotations, suggest {{that it was so}} called 'because great store of trees, as in Lebanon, were planted about it; and gardens, orchards, and all manner of delightful things were added thereto': to aid this conjecture, they quote Ecclesiastes 2:4, 6. Poole says that it was 'a house so called, either, first, because it was built in the mountain and forest of Lebanon, for recreation in summer time; but generally held to have been near Jerusalem; or rather, secondly, from some resemblance it had with Lebanon for its pleasant shades and groves.' Diodati considers it the same with Solomon's palace, but called the house of Lebanon by reason of the groves planted about it; or of the great number of cedar columns brought from Lebanon, and used in its construction. Even Bunyan's favourite translation, made at Geneva by the Puritans, while it gives two wood-cuts of 'The King's house IN the wood of Lebanon,' a marginal note is added--'For the beauty of the place, and great abundance of cedar trees that went to the building thereof, it was compared to Mount Lebanon.' Calmet, in his very valuable translation, accompanied by the Vulgate Latin, gives the same idea: 'Il batit encore le palais appelle la maison du Leban, a cause de la quantite prodigeuse de cedres qui entraient dans la structure de cet edifice.' [Translation: 'Another thing he did was build the palace which was called the house of Lebanon because of the prodigious quantity of cedars used in its construction.'] Bishop Patrick places this house in or near to Jerusalem, 'In a cool, shady mountain, which made it resemble Mount Lebanon.' Dr. Gill was of opinion that this house was near Jerusalem; because it was a magazine of arms, and a court of judicature, and had its name from being built of the cedars of Lebanon, and among groves of trees. Josephus, in his Antiquities of the Jews, book 8, chapter 6, section 5, states that when the Queen of Sheba came to Judea, she was amazed at the wisdom of Solomon, and surprised at the fineness and largeness of his royal palace; 'but she was beyond measure astonished at the house which was called the forest of Lebanon.' Matthew Henry follows the opinion of Bunyan; 'I rather incline to think it was a house built in the forest of Lebanon itself, whither, though far distant from Jerusalem, Solomon having so many chariots and horses, and those dispersed into chariot cities, which probably were his stages, he might frequently retire with ease.' <b>Express</b> <b>notice</b> is taken of Lebanon, as the place of a warlike building, in 2 Kings 19, and in Canticles 7:4.|$|E

5000|$|GAO {{issued a}} {{decision}} on 31 Jan 06 in DOR Biodefense Inc. and Emergent BioSolutions, B-296358.3 and B-296358.4 regarding whether a modification is {{within the scope of}} the original competition under the Competition In Contracting Act (CICA). Modifications outside the scope of the original competition must be competed or justified as sole source actions. Scope analysis is not mechanical, but requires an integrated assessment of multiple factors, including contract type, specification or statement of work, cost and performance period. Whether the modification requires competition also depends upon whether the original solicitation adequately advised offerors of the potential for that type of change, and thus whether the modification would have changed the field of competition. In Biodefense, the Army issued a single award ten year indefinite quantity contract for development and certification of vaccines for biological defense. The challenged modification was exercise of an optional CLIN for development of a type of vaccine not expressly listed in the solicitation's option that extended the performance period for the option by 8 years at a significant increase in cost. The GAO determined that this modification was, nevertheless, within the overall scope of the original competition based on the broad developmental purpose of the contract and the solicitation's <b>express</b> <b>notice</b> to offerors that additional vaccine types could be added after award and that changes in regulation may affect performance period and costs. The discussion of actions taken by the Army in the original solicitation to put competitors on notice of the potential for post-award modifications provides good practice insight.

50|$|This {{has become}} a more {{difficult}} area as states are not consistent {{on the nature of}} a partnership. Some states opt for the partnership as no more than an aggregate of the natural persons who have joined the firm. Others treat the partnership as a business entity and, like a corporation, vest the partnership with a separate legal personality. Hence, for example, in English law, a partner is the agent of the other partners whereas, in Scots law where there is a separate personality, a partner is the agent of the partnership. This form of agency is inherent in the status of a partner and does not arise out of a contract of agency with a principal. The English Partnership Act 1890 provides that a partner who acts within the scope of his actual authority (express or implied) will bind the partnership when he does anything in the ordinary course of carrying on partnership business. Even if that implied authority has been revoked or limited, the partner will have apparent authority unless the third party knows that the authority has been compromised. Hence, if the partnership wishes to limit any partner's authority, it must give <b>express</b> <b>notice</b> of the limitation to the world. However, there would be little substantive difference if English law was amended: partners will bind the partnership rather than their fellow partners individually. For these purposes, the knowledge of the partner acting will be imputed to the other partners or the firm if a separate personality. The other partners or the firm are the principal and third parties are entitled to assume that the principal has been informed of all relevant information. This causes problems when one partner acts fraudulently or negligently and causes loss to clients of the firm. In most states, a distinction is drawn between knowledge of the firm's general business activities and the confidential affairs as they affect one client. Thus, there is no imputation if the partner is acting against the interests of the firm as a fraud. There {{is more likely to be}} liability in tort if the partnership benefited by receiving fee income for the work negligently performed, even if only as an aspect of the standard provisions of vicarious liability. Whether the injured party wishes to sue the partnership or the individual partners is usually a matter for the plaintiff since, in most jurisdictions, their liability is joint and several.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{right to}} privacy is a {{fundamental}} right guaranteed by section 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. The question {{that needs to be}} answered is whether an employee has a {{right to privacy}} in the workplace and, if indeed so, to what extend. If it is established that an employee does indeed have a right to privacy in the workplace, it will be no surprise that the employer might want to limit this right in order to protect his business interests, confidential information, and stock. It should be quite obvious that there is a potential conflict of interest between the rights and interests of the employer and employee. The purpose of this mini-dissertation is to find some guidelines to regulate this aspect and to look at {{the ways in which the}} right to privacy can be legitimately limited. No right is absolute. Section 36 of the Constitution provides that a fundamental right can be limited in certain circumstances. Furthermore, in accordance with the common law, an employee must have a "legitimate expectation of privacy" before it can be said that this right has been violated. This means that a person must have a subjective expectation of privacy that the community regards as objectively reasonable. Specific cases of violation will be investigated: in particular e-mail monitoring, phone tapping and searches. Legislation that regulates monitoring in particular is the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communications-related Information Act 70 of 2002. This act puts a general ban on monitoring of a third party's communications, save for some exceptions. As will be seen, relevant defences in claims for invasion of privacy will include consent and necessity. An employee may consent to the monitoring of his communications by the employer. This consent can be given expressly or by implication. Some of the ways in which the employer can obtain this consent, is by a provision in the contract of employment, a clear policy in this regard, or by giving <b>express</b> <b>notice.</b> Once again the test that needs to be applied is that of "legitimate expectation". On the other hand, necessity might warrant the monitoring of an employee's communications. If monitoring was indeed necessary, is a question that will depend on the facts of each relevant case. The position in South African law will be compared to that of the English law. These two systems regulate the right to privacy in the workplace in much the same way. It does seem that there is a tendency beginning in English law to move away from the "contracting out" of fundamental rights, like the right of privacy. This is done in order to protect the interests of the employee, who does not have the same bargaining power as the employer, who most of the time has more leverage on his side. This is certainly a legitimate concern, but if this position can be applied in our law, is an open question. In my opinion there should be no objections to an employee's own decision to limit his right to privacy in his workplace. Master...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the thesis}} of Costas Douzinas, the {{concepts}} of law and human rights are contradictory categories. Law, in modernity, tries to justify a project of violence to avoid divine wrath. Human rights, on the other hand, seem to settle with {{an interpretation of the}} message of compassion and charity written in the gospels. The first is an ideological interpretation of the biblical texts, while the second is an interpretation based in greater measure on the questions of the philosophical anthropology on being, the reason for being, and the search for the truth. This article proposes, in light of the questions proposed by Costas Douzinas and René Girard, among others, a reading that suggests an answer which may pose a risk to this contradiction. The risk is that seeing law as an expression of the modern Rule of Law enters into a crisis. The modern processes of <b>expressing</b> violence will <b>notice</b> this. The protagonist behind the curtain revealed in the stage of law is not law itself, but the victim of the sacrifice. This threatens the sustainability of law as a closed and coherent scientific system. De acuerdo a las tesis de Costas Douzinas, los conceptos de ley y derechos humanos resultan ser categorías contradictorias. La ley, en la modernidad, trata de justificar un proyecto de violencia para evitar la ira divina. Los derechos humanos, por su parte, parecen asentarse en una interpretación del mensaje de compasión y caridad del evangelio. La primera es una interpretación ideológica de los textos bíblicos; la segunda, una interpretación más asentada en los cuestionamientos de la antropología filosófica por el ser, la razón del ser y la búsqueda de la verdad. Este artículo propone, a la luz de los interrogantes de Costas Douzinas y René Girard, entre otros, una lectura que sugiere una respuesta que puede resultar riesgosa a esta contradicción. El riesgo consiste en que la manera de ver la ley como expresión del moderno Estado de derechoentra en crisis. Los procesos de expresión de la violencia moderna advertirán esto.

That is why, the writer wanted to reveal the types of opening discourse used by the host and the guests of "Lepas Malam" television talk show. The data were taken from fourteen episodes of "Lepas Malam" talk show within four months. The data were in the form of first utterances produced by a host (Farhan) and the 33 guests of the show. As an attempt to identify the types of opening discourse used by the host and the guests in a television talk show. This study used several theories. First was the opening theory from several researchers. Then, initiating acts and responding act by Stenstrom (1994). Last was the adjacency pair by Sacks (Couldhard, 1985). These theories were combined to categorize the type of opening discourse. The initiating acts by Stenstrom and some of Sack?s first pair of adjacency pair were combined as the host types of opening discourse. While, the responding acts by Stenstrom and some of the second pair part of adjacency pair by Sack were combined as the types of opening discourse by the guests. In conducting this study, the writer used a descriptive quantitative. The finding indicated that address another person and greeting were the most common type of opening discourse used by the host. The host used address another person in several ways, which were, address using family or siblings term, address using family or sibling term and name, address using the guest?s name, address using the guest?s full name, and address using the guest?s professions or job positions. Then, the most common greeting was the "how are you?" question. Meanwhile, the common types of opening discourse used by the guests was the acknowledge reply.
