40|$|The Fourier-Bessel {{expansion}} of a function on a circular disc yields a simple series representation for the end-to-end {{probability distribution function}} w(R,phi) encountered in a planar persistent random walk, where the direction taken in a step depends on the relative orientation towards the preceding step. For all but the shortest walks, the proposed method provides a rapidly converging, numerically stable algorithm that is particularly useful for the precise study of intermediate-size chains {{that have not yet}} approached the diffusion limit. As a practical application, we examine the <b>force-extension</b> <b>diagram</b> of various planar polymer chains. With increasing joint stiffness, a marked transition from rubber-like behaviour to a form of elastic response resembling that of a flexible rod is observed. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|Objective: An ideal {{orthodontic}} {{force system}} should exert continuous light force. Thus, many {{efforts have been}} made to improve the memory characteristics of elasto-meric chains. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare elastomeric chains (ECs) claimed by their manufacturers to offer high memory with traditional ones according to their <b>force-extension</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Materials and Methods: In this in-vitro study, ECs were divided into six groups, each containing 40 pieces of chain, from three brands (American Orthodontics, GAC and Ortho-Technology). Each brand was divided into two groups with respect to their claimed characteristics (with or without memory). Each sample was stretched to twice its original length and kept constant in 37 °C distilled water. <b>Force-extension</b> <b>diagrams</b> were drawn by universal testing machine at 0, 1, 8, 24, 72 hours and 1, 2, 4 -week inter-vals. Additionally, the amounts of elongation required to deliver 200 g force were calculated. To compare the results, ANOVA and Tukey tests were performed. Results: Force-decay rate was significantly different between traditional and memor...|$|R
40|$|While {{stretching}} of most polymer chains {{leads to}} rather featureless <b>force-extension</b> <b>diagrams,</b> some, notably DNA, exhibit non-trivial behavior {{with a distinct}} plateau region. Here we propose a unified theory that connects force-extension characteristics of the polymer chain with the convexity properties of the extension energy profile of its individual monomer subunits. Namely, if the effective monomer deformation energy {{as a function of}} its extension has a non-convex (concave up) region, the stretched polymer chain separates into two phases: the weakly and strongly stretched monomers. Simplified planar and 3 D polymer models are used to illustrate the basic principles of the proposed model. Specifically, we show rigorously that when the secondary structure of a polymer is mostly due to weak non-covalent interactions, the stretching is two-phase, and the force-stretching diagram has the characteristic plateau. We then use realistic coarse-grained models to confirm the main findings and make direct connection to the microscopic structure of the monomers. We demostrate in detail how the two-phase scenario is realized in the α-helix, and in DNA double helix. The predicted plateau parameters are consistent with single molecules experiments. Detailed analysis of DNA stretching demonstrates that breaking of Watson-Crick bonds is not necessary for the existence of the plateau, although some of the bonds do break as the double-helix extends at room temperature. The main strengths of the proposed theory are its generality and direct microscopic connection. Comment: 16 pges, 22 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMuscle {{contraction}} {{is brought}} about by the cyclical interaction of myosin with actin coupled to the breakdown of ATP. The current view of the mechanism is that the bound actomyosin complex (or “cross-bridge”) produces force and movement by a change in conformation. This process is known as the “working stroke. ” We have measured the stiffness and working stroke of a single cross-bridge (κxb, dxb, respectively) with an optical tweezers transducer. Measurements were made with the “three bead” geometry devised by Finer et al. (1994), in which two beads, supported in optical traps, are used to hold an actin filament in the vicinity of a myosin molecule, which is immobilized on the surface of a third bead. The movements and forces produced by actomyosin interactions were measured by detecting the position of both trapped beads. We measured, and corrected for, series compliance in the system, which otherwise introduces large errors. First, we used video image analysis to measure the long-range, force-extension property of the actin-to-bead connection (κcon), which is the main source of “end compliance. ” We found that <b>force-extension</b> <b>diagrams</b> were nonlinear and rather variable between preparations, i. e., end compliance depended not only upon the starting tension, but also upon the F-actin-bead pair used. Second, we measured κxb and κcon during a single cross-bridge attachment by driving one optical tweezer with a sinusoidal oscillation while measuring the position of both beads. In this way, the bead held in the driven optical tweezer applied force to the cross-bridge, and the motion of the other bead measured cross-bridge movement. Under our experimental conditions (at ∼ 2 pN of pretension), connection stiffness (κcon) was 0. 26 ± 0. 16 pN nm− 1. We found that rabbit heavy meromyosin produced a working stroke of 5. 5 nm, and cross-bridge stiffness (κxb) was 0. 69 ± 0. 47 pNnm− 1...|$|R

40|$|A double {{stranded}} DNA molecule {{under the}} stress of a pulling force acting on the strand terminals exhibits a partially denatured structure or can be completely unzipped depending {{the magnitude of the}} pulling force. A scaling argument for relationships amongst basic length scales is presented that takes into account the heterogeneity of the sequence. The result agrees with our numerical simulation data, which provides a critical test of the power laws in the unzipping transition region. 1 The characteristics of the structure of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) have been recently probed through mechanical manipulation at a microscopic level by applying an external force. [1, 2] From a theoretical modelling perspective, we have just begun to understand these experimental results, which are usually provided in the form of manipulating force verses extension. Most of the current theoretical work is based a homopolymer model, in which the binding forces between nucleotides in various types are treated equally [2 – 5]. One of the theoretical efforts is to reproduce the <b>force-extension</b> phase <b>diagram</b> observed experimentally...|$|R
