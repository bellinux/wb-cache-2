50|$|Federer {{was in a}} {{cast and}} {{crutches}} for several weeks and underwent an ultrasound and lymph drainage {{in order to be}} fit to compete for the Year-End Championships, where he was the two-time defending champion. Federer traveled to Shanghai but was unsure if {{he would be able to}} play even two days before the start of the tournament. The tournament appeared to be in shambles as many of the top eight including Marat Safin, Andy Roddick, Rafael Nadal, and Andre Agassi had already withdrawn with various injuries, and Lleyton Hewitt chose not to compete in order to spend time with his wife and his newborn child. A hobbled Federer struggled throughout all three of his round robin matches but was able to make the semifinals. In the semifinals he faced Gastón Gaudio, the 2004 French Open champion, and delivered an inexplicable demolition of the Argentine 6-0, 6-0. In the final he faced long-time nemesis David Nalbandian who prevailed in a fifth-set tiebreaker to deny Federer his third consecutive Masters Cup. This loss ended his 35-match winning streak that stretched back to the French Open and his record 24 consecutive finals won.
