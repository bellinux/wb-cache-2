Due to the discontinuation of Shelby GT500, the 2015 Super Snake lost its GT500 tag, but still <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> called it as GT500 Super Snake. Like the 2015 Shelby GT, {{it is also}} based on 2015 Ford Mustang GT. The 2015 Super Snake has a 5.0L V8 Shelby/Ford Racing supercharger engine rated at 650+hp (750+hp via Shelby/Whipple Supercharger). Shelby says the test car produces 850 hp at the crank. But the car's 12.3-second, 116-mph quarter-mile run speaks to a horsepower number far less than 750, let alone 850. A stock Camaro ZL1 is quicker. Tuner cars {{such as this one}} lack SAE-certified horsepower and torque ratings.|$|E

60|$|Second. When {{people come}} into the {{presence}} of God without having their eye upon the Divine Majesty, through the flesh and blood of the Son of Mary, the Son of God, then also do they come before God, and do whatsoever they do from a legal spirit, an old-covenant spirit. As, for instance, you <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> it is true, {{they will go to}} prayer, in appearance very fervently, and will plead very hard with God that He would grant them their desires, pleading their want, and the abundance thereof; they will also plead with God His great mercy, and also His free promises; but yet they neglecting the aforesaid body or Person of Christ, the righteous Lamb of God, to appear before Him in, I say, in thus doing they do not appear before the Lord no otherwise than in an old-covenant spirit; for they go to God as a merciful Creator, and they themselves as His creatures; not as He is, their Father in the Son, and they His children by regeneration through the Lord Jesus. Ay, and though they may call God their Father, in the notion--not knowing what they say, only having learned such things by tradition--as the Pharisees did, yet Christ will have His time to say to them, even to their faces, as He did once to the Jews, Your father, for all this your profession, is the devil, to their own grief and everlasting misery (John 8:44).|$|E
