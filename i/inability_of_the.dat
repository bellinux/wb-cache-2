5|$|In May 1991, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG), {{subsequently}} {{renamed the}} Croatian Army (HV) in November, was {{formed as a}} result of growing support for the RSK from the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Police to cope with the situation.|$|E

5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E

40|$|Dormant {{seeds of}} cocklebur (Xanthium pennsylvanicum Wallr.) were {{characterized}} by <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> ability to form chlorophyll. Such an <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> cotyledons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dormant seeds was improved by <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> various factors and reagents which were capable <b>of</b> breaking <b>the</b> dormancy and <b>of</b> increasing cotyledon enlargement. Of these, ethylene, benzyladenine, and high temperature treatments were particularly effective, and, in turn, oxygen enrichment, gibberellic acid, thiourea, carbon doxide, and potassium nitrate were also promotive to <b>the</b> greening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dormant cotyledons. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> benzyladenine, oxygen enrichment, and high temperature were reduced in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> absorbents for endogenously evolve carbon dioxide and ethylene. δ-Aminolevulinic acid could not restore their greening ability...|$|R
40|$|As buffer cache {{is used to}} {{overcome}} the speed gap between processor and storage devices, performance of buffer cache is a deciding factor in verifying the system performance. Need of improved buffer cache hit ratio and <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Least Recent Used replacement algorithm inspire <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed algorithm. Data reuse and program locality are the basis for determining the cache performance. The proposed algorithm determines the temporal locality by detecting the access patterns in the program context from which the I/O request are issued, identified by the program counter signature, and the files to which the I/O request are addressed. For accurate pattern detection and enhanced cache performance re-reference behavior exploited in the cache block are associated with unique signature. Use of multiple caching policies {{is supported by the}} proposed algorithm so that the cache under that pattern can be best utilized...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E
5|$|Haydock also {{considered}} a {{theme in the}} film to be the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church to fulfill individual spiritual needs. This {{is said to be}} shown through many of Joan's encounters with the church; as a girl she is scolded for going to confession too often, denied communion and forced to sneak into the church to take it herself, and during her trial, where she is denied confession until The Conscience confesses her instead.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, the horns {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull to survive rapid head blows.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> {{choosing}} from a set {{of design}} alternatives based upon multiple, conflicting and uncertain criteria is investigated. Multiple attributes can arise when different disciplines contribute to <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a product or process. The Overlap Measure Method developed in this paper models two sources of uncertainties – imprecise attribute values provided to the decision maker from the various disciplines and <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision-maker to specify an exact desirable attribute level. Additionally, this method also provides the necessary steps to mitigate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> these sources <b>of</b> uncertainties using <b>the</b> Overlap Measure metric. The Overlap Measure Method {{can be applied to}} any theoretically sound multiattribute decision making method and in this paper is applied to the Hypothetical Equivalents and Inequivalents Method.

40|$|In this article, <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> {{choosing}} from a set {{of design}} alternatives based upon multiple, conflicting, and uncertain criteria is investigated. <b>The</b> problem <b>of</b> selection over multiple attributes becomes harder when risky alternatives exist. The overlap measure method developed in this article models two sources of uncertainties – imprecise or risky attribute values provided to the decision maker and <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision-maker to specify an exact desirable attribute value. Effects of these uncertainties are mitigated using the overlap measure metric. A subroutine to this method, called the robust alternative selection method, ensures that the winning alternative is insensitive to changes in <b>the</b> relative importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different design attributes.

Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (<b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|The 27th Regiment became {{locked in}} fierce {{fighting}} with the Partisan 27th East Bosnia Division and 38th Bosnia Division, which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica. The <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to encircle the Partisan force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica–Han Pijesak road to the east.

30|$|This paper {{strives to}} point out <b>the</b> working <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current control logics in the current {{building}} energy systems and the required advances in that field by pinpointing {{the differences in the}} building responses and why all buildings are not the same; what is the required control changes to integrate renewables so as to utilize the renewables effectively and why the control approach for different buildings must vary. In this simulation case study, four different building standards in Germany from vast building standards are taken. These four building types are Sonnenhaus, KfW 55, Passive house and WSchVO 95. All these house types have different energy demands, different building characteristics and range not only from old house (WSchVO 95) to new (KfW 55) but also from less energy requirement (Passive house) to high solar energy fraction (Sonnenhaus). The buildings have the same building geometry or structure and only the building envelope’s details are changed according to <b>the</b> requirement <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building type. All the buildings are single family houses with same geometry but in accordance with each standard.|$|R
25|$|In 1878, the Wisconsin Synod withdrew its {{demand that}} the state synods had to be {{independent}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missouri or Ohio Synods. The Missouri Synod needed {{to build a new}} seminary, since location at its current campus was strained. Although there was considerable plans to build a new joint Synodical Conference seminary outside of Chicago, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hesitance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wisconsin Synod on this subject and <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other members besides Missouri to contribute financially to the new project, it was tabled, and ultimately never happened.|$|R
40|$|Yearly {{increases}} in computer performance have diminished as of late, mostly due to <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> transistors, <b>the</b> building blocks <b>of</b> computers, to deliver <b>the</b> same rate <b>of</b> performance {{seen in the}} 1980 ’s and 90 ’s. Shifting away from traditional CPU design, accelerator architectures {{have been shown to}} offer a potentially untapped solution.

5|$|The {{economy of}} the small island of Cyprus with 840,000 people was hit by several huge blows in and around 2012 including, amongst other things, the €22 billion {{exposure}} of Cypriot banks to the Greek debt haircut, the downgrading of the Cypriot economy into junk status by international rating agencies and the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government to refund its state expenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{next major}} Japanese {{reinforcement}} effort failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, undertaken as Shōji and his troops struggled to reach friendly lines near the Matanikau. Although most of Shōji's troops had escaped from Koli Point, the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese {{to keep their}} forces on Guadalcanal adequately supplied or reinforced prevented them from contributing effectively to {{what turned out to}} be Japan's ultimately unsuccessful effort to hold the island or retake Henderson Field from Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the growing}} {{tensions}} became hampered by increasing support of SAO Krajina being provided by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). The <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Police {{to cope with the}} situation led to the establishment of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) in May 1991. However, the development of the ZNG into a military force was hampered by a UN arms embargo, introduced in September, while the military conflict in Croatia continued to escalate—the Battle of Vukovar started on 26 August.|$|E

25|$|When Jazani entered <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Tehran, <b>the</b> {{country was}} facing {{political}} and economical problems {{that led to}} a retreat for the Shah. These problems were caused by <b>the</b> <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shah's economic policies and the extreme military expenses begun after the Coup d'ètat in 1953. In <b>the</b> spring <b>of</b> 1960 due to mounting debt and inflation <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> Iran requested immediate financial assistance from the World Bank and <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. The World Bank demanded the Iranian government to fix budget problems, reduce salaries, and balance certain economical plans in order to receive 35 million dollars <b>of</b> assistance. <b>The</b> administration <b>of</b> John F. Kennedy also demanded political and economical reform in the Shah's government for 85 million dollar assistance. Economical problems and external pressure to perform the reforms, led to instability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime. The Shah {{in order to deal with}} this problem announced <b>the</b> elections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th majlis would be free to all organizations. Although this promise did not come to reality, it showed <b>the</b> retreat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime and <b>the</b> opening <b>of</b> a political climate in Iran. <b>The</b> leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iranian National Front (جبهه ملی ایران) officially announced <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second national front movement and began their activities.|$|R
50|$|After {{his return}} home and <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> his wife, Andrei becomes more cynical, losing his {{interest}} in war and politics. <b>The</b> Battle <b>of</b> Austerlitz made him see the chaos in war, and <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> even <b>the</b> great figures <b>of</b> history to change <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> events. Focusing completely on <b>the</b> education <b>of</b> his son, he only enters public service under his father because the latter wished so. A visit by Pierre Bezukhov, who recently joined the Freemasons and attempts to explain his philosophies to the pessimistic and disillusioned Andrei, makes Andrei realise that his life is not over yet. Although Pierre's philosophies fail to convince him, he finds joy in his life again.|$|R
5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. The <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sovereign to monopolize political authority was linked to the rise of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from {{the spirit of the}} Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|On {{an early}} test run the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum power {{output of the}} Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, and the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarines}} {{have been}} the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the design phase, including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative press has led to a poor public perception of the Collins class.|$|E
5|$|Allied armies {{had also}} reached the pre-war German {{territorial}} borders and now occupied some German towns and cities. In the West the defeat in Normandy and the Allied advance across Western Europe had significant {{consequences for the}} Luftwaffe's ability to defend Germany from British night attacks. The Kammhuber Line—German air defence system—which had extended through occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands was now broken and much of its early warning network had been lost. Along with the battlefield reverses was the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe to produce enough experienced night fighter crews which was exacerbated by the crippling shortage of fuel {{at this stage in}} the war which contributed to the collapse of training programs and grounded combat units. Equally serious was the threat posed by RAF de Havilland Mosquito night fighter intruders operating over Germany.|$|E

(1) First of those features is Kołakowski's <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> completability, <b>the</b> anti-code disposition. (2) The second trait is the moral attitude, an intention to influence on people's morality by convincing them that social and internal (necessarily bound with social) changes are desirable; that an existential calm demolishes morality.
