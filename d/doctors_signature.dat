The algorithm is applied for embedding watermarks like patient identification /source identification or <b>doctors</b> <b>signature</b> in binary image format into host digital radiological image for potential telemedicine applications. Performance of the algorithm is analysed by varying the gain factor, subband decomposition levels, {{and size of}} watermark. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method achieves higher watermarking capacity. Keywords—Watermarking, spread-spectrum, discrete wavelet transform, telemedicine I...|$|E

It embeds watermark like patient's name, disease's name, hospital's name, and <b>doctor's</b> <b>signature</b> into original medical image. This watermarking algorithm provides privacy of patient. Many performance factors {{are considered to}} evaluate the performance parameters of the proposed scheme. The performance evolution factors include PSNR, and measuring their correlation with degradation of the whole image...|$|R

He is successfully exchanged for money, to the anger of Lester. To pay back Lester, Ferguson persuades him that Hibbs {{can be used to}} drive a regular truck shipment they have been contracted to undertake from Kuwait to Basra, which routinely runs empty while Pacific Solutions are still paid for the job. Ferguson and Lester meet Sadiq to sign off on a contract. After Ferguson attempts a last minute change to the [...] total from $6,000 to $60,000, the doctor refuses to sign the contract, to the annoyance of Lester who sees an avenue to millions of dollars' worth of contacts closed. Back at base, Ferguson forges the <b>doctor's</b> <b>signature</b> on the contract and tells Lester to go ahead with it. Sadiq gets into an argument with three young militiamen who want treatment for a wounded member, but object to the hospital's continued use of women doctors against mosque instructions. As he leaves for home, he is kidnapped by unseen assailants as he stands next to his car.|$|R
40|$|Background: Radiology request {{forms are}} {{essential}} communication tools used by doctors referring patients for radiological investigations. Their importance, however, is highly underestimated. We {{set out to}} perform a process audit of the adequacy of completion of such request forms in St. Luke's Hospital, Malta. Methods: A representative sample of 200 randomly selected request forms received by the radiology department in early September 2004 was reviewed. These included requests {{for a variety of}} examinations from different departments within St. Luke's Hospital. A database of the collected forms was created, noting which of the various fields were adequately completed. Results: Only 4 % of the 200 request forms reviewed were completed in full. The percentages of the various fields completed were: patient's name and surname - 100 %; patient's full address - 77 %; patient's age - 29 %; referring ward - 95 %; referring <b>doctor's</b> <b>signature</b> - 100 %; referring doctor's name and surname - 34 %; name of responsible consultant - 91 %; question to be answered - 25 %. The patient's clinical background field was filled in 93 %. However, these were more often than not incomplete and unable to fulfil their purpose. Conclusions: There is ample room for change in current local practice...|$|R

Production on the episode was scheduled to start on 8 September. Owing to his work on Lost River, which required him to have a buzz cut, Matt Smith had to wear a wig to mimic the <b>Doctor's</b> <b>signature</b> hairstyle. In August 2013, it was revealed that the Cybermen would feature in the Christmas episode, when one of the show's regular stunt artists, Darrelle [...] "Daz" [...] Parker, tweeted that she would be playing a Cyberman.On 23 November 2013, the teaser trailer released on BBC One after [...] "The Day of the Doctor" [...] revealed that the Daleks, Weeping Angels, and the Silence would also be appearing in the episode. Although the Daleks and the Cybermen had previously met in [...] "Doomsday" [...] and [...] "The Pandorica Opens", this marks {{the first time that the}} four species have appeared in an episode together. Revealed in the trailer is the Doctor's return to Trenzalore and the tagline [...] "Silence Will Fall", which has been repeated through Matt Smith's run as the Doctor.|$|R
5000|$|According to law {{approval}} for an abortion requires {{the signature of}} at least one physician (and in some cases two), and in some cases additional permission from Valvira (the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health). The period of the pregnancy also affects the granting of permission. The key periods are 0-12 weeks, 13-20 weeks, and over 20 weeks. One <b>doctor's</b> <b>signature</b> is enough in the case of terminations 0-12 weeks when the applicant is under 17 years old or has passed her 40th birthday, or if the applicant has already given birth to 4 or more children regardless of age. Otherwise two doctors' signatures are required. Reasons for approval are the potential physical or mental distress if the pregnancy runs to term; or if the pregnancy arises from a serious crime (e.g. rape or incest) or if an illness of either parent would make it difficult to provide a normal upbringing for the child. Reference to Valvira for review and decision is needed in all cases between 13-20 weeks; or when there are grounds that the fetus is abnormal (in which case the 20 weeks is extended to 24 weeks); or in any case where the doctor has given a negative decision. Above 20 weeks, a threat to the physical life of the mother is the only valid reason for terminating a pregnancy.|$|R
40|$|A wavelet-based {{multiple}} watermarking {{scheme is}} proposed, which addresses {{the problems of}} medical confidentiality protection and both origin and data authentication. The scheme embeds multiple watermarks serving different purposes: a robust watermark containing the <b>doctor's</b> digital <b>signature</b> for authentication, a caption watermark with patient's personal and examination related data, and a fragile watermark {{for the purpose of}} data integrity control. Thus, the proposed added-value tool offers alternatives for different issues associated with medical data management and distribution. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the watermarking scheme, which fulfills the strict requirements concerning the acceptable alterations of medical images...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A {{medical record}} is a {{systematic}} documentation of a patient’s medical history {{and care for}} legal and future use. A poor quality medical record can negatively affect patient care and safety. The study aims to assess the adequacy of medical records in Bir Hospital, a central hospital. Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted by analyzing consecutive discharge summaries of patients admitted during a 6 month period in a single unit of a tertiary care center. The discharge summary format of the hospital was taken as the standard and evaluation for adequacy of data entered was assessed. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze various statistical discrepancies. Results: Patient’s condition at discharge was missing in 86 (66. 15 %). Patient’s address was missing in 21 (16. 1 %) cases. Almost all the discharge sheets lacked mailing address. Total 96 (73. 8 %) had use of abbreviations diagnosis. Age and sex were missing in 1 (0. 76 %). <b>Doctor’s</b> <b>signature</b> was illegible in 103 (79. 3 %) and missing in 2 (1. 5 %) summaries. Doctor’s name and their level/position were missing in 118 (90. 76 %) and 125 (96. 1 %) respectively. Total 126 patients (96. 9 %) were not given any instructions on discharge. Conclusions: The discharge summaries analyzed were seen to be inadequate especially in documenting course during the hospital stay, condition at discharge, appropriate instructions and the treating physician’s details. These can probably be addressed by introducing electronic medical records if feasible. Otherwise, the discharge summary should be standardized and doctors should be trained to write legible, complete discharge summaries. Key Words: discharge, hospital, records, summarie...|$|R

40|$|Background: Laboratory request forms provide {{information}} about the laboratory test being requested for. They carry demographic data and other information such as location of patient, laboratory number, <b>doctor’s</b> name, <b>signature</b> of the <b>doctor,</b> telephone number of the requesting doctor. Omission {{of information on the}} forms may lead to laboratory errors. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the level of completion of laboratory request forms at the haematology department of a Ghanaian tertiary hospital. Methods: Three thousand request forms submitted to the haematology department between January and April 2010 were retrieved and studied. The information provided on each request form was recorded in a spread sheet and analyzed. Results: The patient’s age and sex were missing in 25. 6 % and 32. 7 % of the forms respectively. About half of the request forms did not have the patient’s location. No clinical detail was provided on 22. 7 % of the forms. Doctors were more likely to sign their request forms and provide a name but they all failed to provide an address or a contact telephone number. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that, the standard of completion of request forms was poor. Essential information required on the forms was often missing. This can lead to limited advice given by laboratory physicians and may increase the potential for errors. Conversely, provision of all the information needed on the forms will aid laboratory diagnosis and enhance patient care and save time and resources. There should be closer interaction between clinicians and laboratory personnel to improve quality of services...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Evaluation of {{the quality}} of {{services}} and provided cares through comparing them with existing standards in order to identify and prioritize problems and trying to fix them are important steps in the audit of clinical functions.  This study aimed {{to improve the quality of}} performance of medical records registrations about patients admitted to hospital Shahid Madani and deals with the audit of records listed them. Material and Methods: To perform this study, data were collected using researcher checklist.  Target data of 30  medical records were gathered.  We used software package of Mini Tab and SPSS to develop process statistical control charts and for statistical analysis of data, respectively. Results: By plotting control charts, we determined three specific reasons in the ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE SUMMARY SHEET, four specific reasons in the SUMMARY SHEET, and three specific reasons in CONSULTATION REQUEST SHEET.  The lack of the standard form (on-delivered copies of a summary form)  “with 90 %”, lack of the main form in patient's clinical record “with 83. 3 %”, lack of the patient's procedure “with 73. 3 %”are ranked as the most defects in SUMMARY SHEET.  In the CONSULTATION REQUEST SHEET, failure to comply with <b>doctor's</b> stamp and <b>signature</b> standard with “ 20 %” has highest percentage of defects.
