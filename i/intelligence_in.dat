40|$|Children {{are unique}} {{individuals}} who have their own ways {{to learn about the}} world and solve problems. It is supported by Gardner‘s ideas about multiple intelligences. Gardner (1993, 1998) suggested several kinds of <b>intelligences.</b> <b>In</b> their attempt to learn about the world, children make use of all resources, including their multiple intelligences. The application of multiple <b>intelligences</b> <b>in</b> teaching young learner seems to be apparent in Tetsuko Kuroyanagi‘s autobiographical memoir, ―Totto-chan: The Little Girl at the Window‖. This study identified and analyzed the techniques used to apply multiple <b>intelligences</b> <b>in</b> teaching young learners in Totto-chan‘s elementary school, Tomoe Gakuen. Based on the identification and analysis conducted in ―Totto-chan‖, this study elaborated the techniques in teaching English for young learners. In particular, this study proposed teaching techniques for four language skills. This study will be of great benefit for English teachers for young learners to enrich their teaching techniques that accord with the children nature of development...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a study conducted}} in a Mexican English teacher education program about multiple intelligences. Seventy-four first year students participated in the study. Findings reveal that the highest kinds of intelligences were the bodily kinesthetic, the interpersonal, the intrapersonal, and the musical; the lowest ones were the naturalist, the existential, the verbal linguistic, the logical mathematical, and the visual spatial. The authors {{suggest that it is}} important to diagnose and promote these <b>intelligences</b> <b>in</b> trainees in a systematic way in order to equip them with knowledge and experience of multiple <b>intelligences</b> <b>in</b> order to use them in their future teacher practice...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: to {{investigate}} which <b>intelligence,</b> described <b>in</b> the Theory of Multiple Intelligences, favors {{the development of}} language (linguistic intelligence) of the patients, {{in relation to the}} studied variables: development phase (children and adolescents), sex and preferential intelligences. Methods: the quantitative-qualitative approach was used, with the identification by content analysis of the preferred intelligences of the 107 patients participating in the investigation and the <b>intelligences</b> contemplated <b>in</b> each therapy. After the coding of these data in numbers, the results obtained in the 1, 802 therapies analyzed were compared with the development phase, sex and preferential intelligences, using a statistical test. Results: in the analysis of the data, it was evidenced that the results obtained in the therapy differ between children and adolescents, according to the intelligences contemplated, which is also observed when considering females and males, but to a lesser extent. Conclusion: it is important to observe the characteristics of age, sex and preferential <b>intelligences,</b> <b>in</b> relation to the contemplation of the different <b>intelligences</b> <b>in</b> the activities developed in the therapy, with a view to the qualification of the results...|$|R
