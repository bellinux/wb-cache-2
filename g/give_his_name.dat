5|$|R v Hopley (more {{commonly}} known as the Eastbourne manslaughter) was an 1860 legal case in Eastbourne, England, concerning the death of 15-year-old Reginald Cancellor (some sources <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> as Chancellor and his age as 13 or 14) at the hands of his teacher, Thomas Hopley. Hopley used corporal punishment with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor's part, but instead beat the boy to death.|$|E
25|$|However, on June10, 1610, the timely {{arrival of}} another relief fleet, bearing Governor Baron De La Warr (who would {{eventually}} <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> to the colony of Delaware), which met the two ships as they descended the James River, granted Jamestown a reprieve. The Colonists called this The Day of Providence. The fleet brought not only supplies, but also additional settlers. All the settlers {{returned to the}} colony, though {{there was still a}} critical shortage of food.|$|E
25|$|Peace was remanded for a week, {{in which}} he refused to <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> But in captivity, {{he wrote a letter}} to a {{business}} colleague who decided to co-operate with police, and revealed its author as Peace, writing under his pseudonym John Ward. Under that name, he was tried at the Old Bailey for burglary and the attempted murder of PC Robinson. The evidence against the prisoner was clear enough, and he was sentenced by Mr. Justice Hawkins to penal servitude for life.|$|E

25|$|In August 1899 the 6th Battalion, Rifles of the Canadian Non-Permanent Active Militia, {{located in}} Vancouver, British Columbia, asked Prince Arthur to <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> to the {{regiment}} {{and act as}} its honorary colonel. The regiment had recently been converted to the infantry role from the 2nd Battalion, 5th British Columbia Regiment of Canadian Artillery. With the Prince's agreement the unit was renamed 6th Regiment, Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles (DCORs) on 1 May 1900. He was subsequently appointed colonel-in-chief of the regiment, then known as The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own), in 1923. He held that appointment until his death.|$|E
25|$|So {{the layout}} stayed put, {{although}} in 1823-4 Schinkel {{did get to}} rebuild the Potsdam Gate. Formerly {{little more than a}} gap in the customs wall, it was replaced by a much grander affair consisting of two matching Doric-style stone gate-houses, like little temples (a nod to Friedrich Gilly perhaps), facing each other across Leipziger Straße. The one on the north side served as the customs house and excise collection point, while its southern counterpart was a military guardhouse, set up to prevent desertions of Prussian soldiers, which had become a major problem. The new gate was officially dedicated on 23 August 1824. The design also included a new look for Leipziger Platz. Attempts to create a market there to draw off some of the frenetic commercial activity in the centre of the city had not been successful. And so Schinkel proposed {{to turn it into a}} fine garden, although this part of the design was not implemented. It was a rival plan by gardener and landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné (1789–1866), drawn up in 1826, that went ahead in 1828 but with modifications. In later years Lenné would completely redesign the Tiergarten, a large wooded park formerly the Royal Hunting Grounds, also <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> to Lennéstraße, a thoroughfare forming part of the southern boundary of the park, very close to Potsdamer Platz, and transform a muddy ditch to the south into one of Berlin's busiest waterways, the Landwehrkanal.|$|E
500|$|Tamerlane and Other Poems was {{published}} anonymously with the credit granted to [...] "a Bostonian". His name, typically listed as [...] "Edgar A. Poe", was not published {{with his work}} until his second collection, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems in late 1829. Poe may {{have chosen not to}} <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> so that his foster father, John Allan, would not know where he was; moreover, his choice to embrace his Bostonian heritage may have been an attempt to distance himself from the Allan family in Richmond. Boston was, at the time, a center for publishing and the literary world. By the time the book was released, Poe was already in the Army.|$|E

500|$|With Elizabeth's accession, {{it seemed}} {{probable}} that the royal house would bear her husband's name, becoming the House of Mountbatten, {{in line with}} the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, [...] "I am the only man in the country not allowed to <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> to his own children." [...] In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{disappearance}} from Æthelstan's court after 935, {{there is}} no further report of Constantine until 937. In that year, together with Owain and Olaf Guthfrithson of Dublin, Constantine invaded England. The resulting battle of Brunanburh—Dún Brunde—is reported in the Annals of Ulster as follows:a great battle, lamentable and terrible was cruelly fought... in which fell uncounted thousands of the Northmen. ...And on the other side, a multitude of Saxons fell; but Æthelstan, {{the king of the}} Saxons, obtained a great victory. The battle was remembered in England a generation later as [...] "the Great Battle". When reporting the battle, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle abandons its usual terse style in favour of a heroic poem vaunting the great victory. In this the [...] "hoary" [...] Constantine, by now around 60 years of age, is said to have lost a son in the battle, a claim which the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba confirms. The Annals of Clonmacnoise <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> as Cellach. For all its fame, the site of the battle is uncertain and several sites have been advanced, with Bromborough on the Wirral the most favoured location.|$|E
500|$|While {{little is}} known about his early life, a Flemish origin along with a French {{upbringing}} has been suggested from variations on the spelling of his name, and he may originally have been from the vicinity of Liège or Namur, in present-day Belgium. He moved to Italy as a young man, and was present in Florence by the late 1520s, therefore having an opportunity to meet or work with Philippe Verdelot, who wrote the earliest named madrigals. In or immediately before 1538 he moved to Rome where he obtained an appointment with the papal choir at St. Peter's Basilica; many composers from the Netherlands served as singers there throughout this era, and it is even possible that he went to Rome before coming to Florence. Still in Rome, in January 1539, he probably was made a member of the Julian Chapel (the records <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> as [...] "Jacobus flandrus", suggesting a Flemish origin, but it cannot be known with certainty if this record referred to Arcadelt). After some months there he {{became a member of the}} Sistine Chapel, where he was appointed [...] "magister puerorum." [...] The same year saw the publication of no less than four books of his madrigals. The first of these collections, Il primo libro di madrigali, went through 45 editions, becoming the most widely reprinted collection of madrigals of the time.|$|E

500|$|Because written sources {{covering}} the era are scarce, Mindaugas's [...] origins and family tree {{have not been}} conclusively established. The Bychowiec Chronicles, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, have been discredited in this regard, since they assert an ancestry from the Palemonids, a noble family said to have originated within the Roman Empire. His year of birth, sometimes given as c. 1200, is at other times left as a question mark. His father is mentioned in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle as a powerful duke (ein kunic grôß), but is not named; later chronicles <b>give</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> as Ryngold. Dausprungas, mentioned {{in the text of}} a 1219 treaty, is presumed to have been his brother, and Dausprungas' sons Tautvilas and Gedvydas his nephews. He is thought to have had two sisters, one married to Vykintas and another to Daniel of Halych. Vykintas and his son Treniota played major roles in later power struggles. Mindaugas had at least two wives, Morta and Morta's sister, whose name is unknown, and possibly an earlier wife; her existence is presumed because two children – a son named Vaišvilkas and an unnamed daughter married to Svarn in 1255 – were already leading independent lives when Morta's children were still young. In addition to Vaišvilkas and his sister, two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, are mentioned in written sources. The latter two were assassinated along with Mindaugas. Information on his sons is limited and historians continue to discuss their number. He may have had two other sons whose names were later conflated by scribes into Ruklys and Rupeikis.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, Lübeck's {{position}} in Hamburg {{was a prominent}} one.

It may be that this Adam mac Domnaill was a son of Domnall mac Uilleim. If this is so, then the presence of his son in Cupar, south of the Mounth, reinforces the conviction that Domnall fought, not for the Mormaerdom of Moray, but for the kingship of Scotland.
