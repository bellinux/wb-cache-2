5|$|A Mutant who {{was once}} Xavier's ally and close-friend, Magneto now {{believes}} mutants are superior to humans. Magneto wields the ability to manipulate metal magnetically, {{as well as the}} ability to create magnetic fields. He wears a helmet that renders him immune to Xavier's and all telepathic-based abilities. Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information on Cerebro, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation and engineering.|$|E

It is generally agreed that the species is native to Europe; Watling <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that there exists little difference between specimens collected from Spain and Scotland, at both the morphological and genetic level.|$|E
5|$|In addition, isotopic {{analysis}} of exposed terrestrial rocks <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> the cosmogenic (cosmic ray) production of 21Ne. This isotope {{is generated by}} spallation reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> {{that the}} Microsporidia, unicellular parasites {{of animals and}} protists, are fairly recent and highly derived endobiotic fungi (living within the tissue of another species). One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative. Hibbett and colleagues suggest that this analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status, it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group.|$|E
5|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans. Although {{occupational exposure}} to cadmium {{is linked to}} lung and prostate cancer, {{there is still a}} substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E

Her painting Prevention of AIDS (1992) was reproduced on posters and postcards aimed at raising awareness of HIV/AIDS, and was one of several of her images commissioned by the federal Department of Health to highlight issues regarding the disease in the Indigenous community. In 2000, two years after the death of activist Mum (Shirl) Smith, Bancroft and the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative organised a fund-raising exhibition of art works in Smith's honour.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E
5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E
