We constructed three recombinant plasmids with cDNAs that encode preprosporamin, prosporamin, and sporamin, and these three were expressed in Escherichia coli cells as fusion proteins. All three forms of sporamin expressed in E. coli were shown to have strong inhibitory activity to trypsin in vitro, suggesting that post-translational modifications are not essential for trypsin inhibitory activity.

Methods. Mice were fed either 20 % casein diet, 20 % soy protein isolate diet, 10 % <b>glycinin</b> diet containing 10 % casein, or 20 % <b>glycinin</b> diet. One week later, the right sciatic nerve was cut.

Protein quality of <b>glycinin</b> (11 S) is {{higher than that of}} β-conglycinin (7 S), due to the presence of higher amounts of s-containing amino acids (methionine and cysteine) in <b>glycinin</b> than β-conglycinin. Of the amino acids in <b>glycinin,</b> 3 %- 4. 5 % are methionine and cysteine but these important amino acids are not found in β-conglycinin (especially β-subunit). Pot studies were conducted with soybean [Glycine max (L) Merr. ] grown under various levels of KCl and CaHPO 4 and the effects of salts (fertilizers) on <b>glycinin</b> and β-conglycinin subunits were evaluated.

The appearance of <b>glycinin</b> and β-conglycinin degradation products was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cotyledon extracts followed by electroblotting to nitrocellulose and immunostaining using <b>glycinin</b> and β-conglycinin specific antibodies. The three subunits of β-conglycinin were preferentially metabolized. Of the three subunits of β-conglycinin, the larger α and α′ subunits are rapidly degraded, generating new β-conglycinin cross-reactive polypeptides of 51, 200 molecular weight soon after imbibition of the seed. After 6 days of growth the β-subunit is also hydrolyzed. At least six polypeptides, ranging from 33, 100 to 24, 000 molecular weight, appear as apparent degradation products of β-conglycinin. The metabolism of the <b>glycinin</b> acidic chains begins early in growth.

For the vegetable proteins, adsorption was slow. This resulted in lower foamability, especially for <b>glycinin...</b>|$|E

Here, {{the impact of}} heating at 100 °C in water or aqueous ethanol [10 or 50 % (v/v) ] on denaturation and covalent network formation of three model proteins [bovine serum albumin (BSA), soy <b>glycinin</b> and wheat gliadin] was examined. Already at room temperature 50 % (v/v) ethanol induced disulfide cross-linking between BSA proteins. Increased ethanol concentrations reduced heat-induced polymerization of soy <b>glycinin</b> and wheat gliadin. The use of aqueous ethanol limited the extent of β-elimination, sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange reactions and sulfhydryl oxidation. Gliadin and soy <b>glycinin</b> had higher colloidal stability in 50 % (v/v) ethanol than in water. The conformation of BSA and soy <b>glycinin</b> already changed at lower temperatures in 50 % (v/v) ethanol than in water. In all media, different proteins influenced each other’s denaturation and/or polymerization. During heating in water but not in 50 % (v/v) ethanol, gliadin-BSA and gliadin-soy <b>glycinin</b> mixtures polymerized more than expected than the isolated proteins. Thus, phase-separation of proteins did not limit intermolecular disulfide formation. Pretreatment of proteins with aqueous ethanol did not substantially influence their subsequent polymerization during prolonged heating in water. However, ethanol pretreatment of gluten impacted heat-induced polymerization of BSA in gluten-BSA mixtures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} the solubility of <b>glycinin,</b> a major soy protein, and its structural properties at a quaternary, tertiary, and secondary folding level under conditions representative for food products. When the ionic strength is lowered from 0. 5 to 0. 2 or 0. 03, the basic polypeptides shift more to the exterior of the <b>glycinin</b> complex, as determined at pH 7. 6 by labeling solvent-exposed lysines, supported by the study of the proteolytic action of clostripain on <b>glycinin.</b> This structural reorganization caused the pH of minimal solubility to shift to higher values. Ultracentrifugational analysis shows that at pH 7. 6 and an ionic strength of 0. 5 <b>glycinin</b> forms hexameric complexes (11 S), whereas at pH 3. 8 and at an ionic strength of 0. 03 <b>glycinin</b> exists as trimers (7 S). Intermediate situations are obtained by modulation of pH and ionic strength. The observed quaternary dissociation correlates with an increased amount of nonstructured protein at a secondary level and with changes in tertiary folding as determined using circular dichroism. Tryptophan fluorescence shows no significant structural changes for different ionic strengths but demonstrates a more tightly packed fluorophore environment when the pH is lowered from 7. 6 to 3. 8...|$|E
40|$|Protein-lipid {{complexes}} {{are known}} to result from complex molecular interactions which contribute to physiochemical and functional properties of foods. To identify the interactions of food proteins with lipids and the associated changes in properties, the following factors were investigated: incubation temperature, pH, type of lipids (phospholipid, triglyceride and fatty acids) and different proteins (ovalbumin and soybean <b>glycinin).</b> The effects of lipids on physiochemical and functional characteristics of ovalbumin and <b>glycinin</b> were investigated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), fluorescence, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and emulsification and gelation properties. The results showed that pH, temperature {{and the type of}} lipids affected both ovalbumin-lipid interactions and physiochemical properties of ovalbumin. Changes in the electrophoretic behavior of ovalbumin were related to the presence of lipids, and the relative fluorescence of ovalbumin decreased in the presence of lipids at different pH values. In addition, lipids increased the stability of ovalbumin as revealed by the thermal denaturation (Td) and by the enthalpy transition (DeltaH). FTIR spectra in the amide I absorption region revealed that lipids affected the secondary structure of ovalbumin. Changes in the integrated intensity of the amide II band between (1520 [...] 1555) cm - 1 in the presence of D 2 O showed that H-D exchange of ovalbumin decreased in the presence of lipids. Emulsifying properties, gel strength and water holding capacity (WHC) of ovalbumin increased significantly (P cocoa butter > oleic acid > linoleic acid > linolenic acid > stearic acid. It is likely that the degree of polarity of lipids {{play an important role in}} protein-lipid interactions and in the enhancement of the functional properties of ovalbumin. The effects of soybean oil (SO), soybean lecithin (SL) and a mixture of both (SOL) on physiochemical and functional properties of soybean <b>glycinin</b> were studied at pH 8. 0, with incubation at 40 °C. Changes in the electrophoretic behavior were related to the presence of lipids. Relative fluorescence of <b>glycinin</b> decreased in the presence of lipids. Lipids increased the thermal stability (Td) of <b>glycinin</b> from 89. 7 °C to 92. 0 °C, 94. 3 °C and 93. 4 °C with SO, SL and SOL respectively. FTIR spectra indicated changes in both; the secondary structure and H-D exchange of <b>glycinin</b> in the presence of lipids. Gel strength, WHC and emulsifying properties of <b>glycinin</b> increased significantly (P SOL > SO. SEM showed difference in the microstructure of <b>glycinin</b> gels with the different lipids used. Overall, the results demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative effects on the physiochemical and functional properties of ovalbumin and <b>glycinin</b> as a result of protein-lipid interactions...|$|E

The clone spanning a total of 1836 bp, predicted protein of 529 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 60, 447. 61 Da. Peanut Gly- 1 sequence comparison shows high level of sequence homology with other two peanut <b>glycinin</b> (arachin) genes [Ara h 3 (95 %) and Ara h 4 (94 %) ] and <b>glycinin</b> (legumin) genes of other legumes such as soybean, broad bean, French bean and pea etc., both at nucleotide (67 to 69 %) and amino acid (60 to 63 %) levels. The N- and C-terminals of peanut Gly- 1 are highly conserved with other <b>glycinin</b> genes; central region of the gene possess three variable regions, which also show conservation with other <b>glycinin</b> genes. Peanut glycinin- 1 gene deciphers 11 S type A seed storage protein. Mapping for conserved domains indicate that Peanut Gly- 1 consists of bi-cupin domain. RNA gel blot studies demonstrate that the gene expressed during embryo development that is transcriptionally activated early in embryogenesis (white pod maturity) and is repressed late in seed maturation (orange pod maturity stage).

40|$|A {{simplification}} of the pilot-plant scale modified Nagano method yielding two protein fractions, <b>glycinin</b> and â-conglycinin, by pH {{adjustment and}} ultrafiltration membrane separation {{was developed and}} compared with our pilot-plant-scale modified Nagano procedure and with a soy protein isolate pilot-plant procedure as our reference process. Two protein fractions, <b>glycinin</b> and â-conglycinin, were produced from our simplified process and compared to the three protein fractions, <b>glycinin,</b> â-conglycinin, and an intermediate protein mixture, produced with the modified Nagano method. The pilot-plant yields of <b>glycinin,</b> â-conglycinin, and intermediate mixture fractions from the modified Nagano method were 9. 4, 10. 3, and 4. 8 % [dry basis (db) ], respectively. The yield of <b>glycinin</b> fraction of the simplified method was 9. 7 % (db), {{and it had a}} protein content and purity similar to those obtained with the modified Nagano method. The yield of the â-conglycinin fraction was 19. 6 % (db), which was twice that of the modified Nagano process. The protein content of â-conglycinin was 91. 6 % (db), and the purity was 62. 6 % of the protein content, which was 9 % lower in purity than the modified Nagano method. Process optimization of the simplified method suggested the best operating conditions for the membrane filtration system were 20 - 25 psi inlet pressure and 200 - 250 L/min ultrafiltration recirculation speeds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to quantify the accumulation of the major seed storage protein subunits, β‑conglycinin and <b>glycinin,</b> and how they influence yield and protein and oil contents in high‑protein soybean genotypes. The relative accumulation of subunits was calculated by scanning SDS-PAGE gels using densitometry. The protein content of the tested genotypes was higher than control cultivar in the same maturity group. Several genotypes with improved protein content and with unchanged yield or oil content were developed {{as a result of}} new breeding initiatives. This research confirmed that high‑protein cultivars accumulate higher amounts of <b>glycinin</b> and β‑conglycinin. Genotypes KO 5427, KO 5428, and KO 5429, which accumulated lower quantities of all subunits of <b>glycinin</b> and β‑conglycinin, were the only exceptions. Attention should be given to genotypes KO 5314 and KO 5317, which accumulated significantly higher amounts of both subunits of <b>glycinin,</b> and to genotypes KO 5425, KO 5319, KO 539 and KO 536, which accumulated significantly higher amounts of β‑conglycinin subunits. These findings suggest that some of the tested genotypes could be beneficial in different breeding programs aimed at the production of agronomically viable plants, yielding high-protein seed with specific composition of storage proteins for specific food applications.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour of soy <b>glycinin</b> systems following {{application of}} industrially relevant high hydrostatic pressure (600 MPa for 15 min at ambient temperature) was investigated throughout the experimental range up to 80 % (w/w) solids content, and results {{were compared to}} conventional thermal treatment. Using small-deformation dynamic oscillation in shear, modulated differential scanning calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray scattering, it was demonstrated that soy <b>glycinin</b> with twelve disulphide linkages displays extensive unfolding at low to intermediate solid levels (30 e 60 %, w/ w). In contrast, it largely maintains native conformation at 70 and 80 % (w/w) solids showing about 20 % denaturation, {{as compared to the}} thermal transition of native counterparts. Experimental data from infrared spectroscopy also argue for retention of the native conformation in condensed soy <b>glycinin</b> systems comprising mainly beta sheets in the secondary structure. At subzero temperatures, condensed <b>glycinin</b> at atmospheric and pressurised conditions undergoes vitrification phenomena recording experimental glass transition temperatures.
