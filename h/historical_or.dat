5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments.

5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology.

The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Historians Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, and geographers Pausanias and Strabo, who {{traveled}} throughout the Greek world and noted {{the stories they}} heard, supplied numerous local myths and legends, often giving little-known alternative versions.

5|$|Many Māori {{place names}} possess either <b>historical</b> <b>or</b> mythological significance.

5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} ironically great tragedy and comedy.

5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a <b>historical</b> <b>or</b> a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E
5|$|Although popular legends {{claim that}} Sable Island horses swam ashore from the island's many shipwrecks, or were {{introduced}} by 16th-century Portuguese explorers, {{this is not}} supported by <b>historical</b> <b>or</b> genetic evidence. In reality, the horses were deliberately introduced to the island during the 18th century. The first recorded horses were brought by a Boston clergyman, the Reverend Andrew Le Mercier, in 1737 but most were stolen by passing mariners. The present-day horses are thought by most historians and scientists to have descended mostly from horses seized by the British from the Acadians during the Expulsion of the Acadians. The Acadian horses were descendents of several shipments of French horses, including members of the Breton, Andalusian and Norman breeds, later crossed with horses from New England, including Spanish Barbs. The Boston merchant and shipowner Thomas Hancock purchased some Acadian horses and transported them to Sable Island in 1760, where they grazed the island as pasture. Although {{often referred to as}} ponies due to their small size, they have a horse phenotype and an ancestry composed solely of horses.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of <b>historical</b> <b>or</b> religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E

5|$|Giorgio de Santillana, {{professor}} of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with Hertha von Dechend {{believed that the}} old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial cosmology clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths {{are representative of the}} forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate astronomy that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no <b>historical</b> <b>or</b> factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the precession of the equinoxes. Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|In 1300 or shortly after, Villani {{began working}} on the Cronica, which was divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, {{starting}} at conventionally biblical times {{with the story of}} the Tower of Babel up to the year 1264. The second phase, in six books, covered the history from 1264 until his own time, {{all the way up to}} 1346. He outlined the events in his Cronica in year-to-year accounts; for this he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. He wrote his Cronica in the vernacular language rather than Latin, the language of the educated elite. His chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, sometimes with little interpretation. This often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, especially in the biographies of <b>historical</b> <b>or</b> contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs).|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, gardens became {{focused on}} the plant conservation. The Botanic Gardens Conservation Secretariat was {{established}} by the IUCN, and the World Conservation Union in 1987 {{with the aim of}} coordinating the plant conservation efforts of botanical gardens around the world. It maintains a database of rare and endangered species in botanical gardens' living collections. Many gardens hold ex situ conservation collections that preserve genetic variation. These may be held as: seeds dried and stored at low temperature, or in tissue culture (such as the Kew Millennium Seedbank); as living plants, including those that are of special horticultural, <b>historical</b> <b>or</b> scientific interest (such as those held by the NCCPG in the United Kingdom); or by managing and preserving areas of natural vegetation. Collections are often held and cultivated with the intention of reintroduction to their original habitats. The Center for Plant Conservation at St Louis, Missouri coordinates the conservation of native North American species.|$|E
