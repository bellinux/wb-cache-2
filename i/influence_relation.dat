Moreover, all hierarchies for the <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> are achievable in the class of complete VGA. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that all hierarchies are achievable in a subclass of weighted VGA, the class of weighted games for which a single weight is assigned to voters. Secondly, we conduct a partial study of achievable hierarchies within the subclass of H-complete games, that is, complete games under stronger versions of <b>influence</b> <b>relation.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Weighted {{games for}} several levels of {{approval}} in {{input and output}} were introduced in [9]. An extension of the desirability relation for simple games, called the <b>influence</b> <b>relation,</b> was introduced for games with several levels of approval in input in [24] (see also [18]). However, there are weighted games not being complete for the <b>influence</b> <b>relation,</b> something different to what occurs for simple games. In this paper we introduce several extensions of the desirability relation for simple games and from the completeness of them it follows the consistent link with weighted games, which solves the existing gap. Moreover, we prove that the <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> {{is consistent with a}} known subclass of weighted games: strongly weighted games. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> was {{introduced}} by Isbell [Isbell, J. R., 1958. A class of simple games. Duke Math. J. 25, 423 - 439] to qualitatively compare the a priori influence of voters in a simple game, which by construction allows only "yes" and "no" votes. We extend this relation to voting games with abstention (VGAs), in which abstention is permitted as an intermediate option between a "yes" and a "no" vote. Unlike in simple games, this relation is not a preorder in VGAs in general. It is not complete either, but we characterize VGAs {{for which it is}} complete, and show that it is a preorder whenever it is complete. We also compare the <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> with recent generalizations to VGAs of the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf-Coleman power indices [Felsenthal, D. S., Machover, M., 1997. Ternary voting games. Int. J. Game Theory 26, 335 - 351; Freixas, J., 2005 a. The Shapley-Shubik power index for games with several levels of approval in the input and output. Dec. Support Systems 39, 185 - 195; Freixas, J., 2005 b. The Banzhaf index for games with several levels of approval in the input and output. Ann. Operations Res. 137, 45 - 66]. For weakly equitable VGAs, the <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> is a subset of the preorderings defined by these two power theories. We characterize VGAs for which the three relations are equivalent.

However, drawing inferences in cognitive maps, {{especially when the}} problem is complex, {{may not be an}} easy task. The main reason of this limitation in cognitive maps is that they do not model uncertainty with the variables. Our contribution in this paper is twofold: we firstly enrich the cognitive map formalism regarding the <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> and then we propose to built a Bayesian causal map (BCM) from the constructed cognitive map in order to lead reasoning on the problem.

40|$|Abstract. Data Mining {{explanatory}} models {{must deal}} with relevance: how val-ues of different data items {{are relevant to the}} values of other data items. But to be able to construct explanatory models, and in particular causal explanatory mod-els, we must do so by first understanding irrelevance and exactly how irrelevance plays a role in explanatory models. The reason is that the conditional irrelevance or conditional no <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> defines the boundaries of the ballpark within which an explanatory model lives. This paper reviews the theory of no influence in the mathematical relation data structure. We discuss the relationship this theory has to graphical models and we define a coefficient of no influence and give a method for the estimation of its p-value. ...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{analysis}} and visualization of time-varying multivariate data {{is crucial for}} understanding complex and dynamic variable interaction and temporal evolution. Advances made {{in this area are}} mainly on query-driven visualization and correlation exploration. Solutions and techniques that investigate the important aspect of causal relationships among variables have not been sought. In this paper, we present a new approach to analyzing and visualizing timevarying multivariate volumetric and particle data sets through the study of information flow using the information-theoretic concept of transfer entropy. We employ time plot and circular graph to show information transfer for an overview of relations among all pairs of variables. To intuitively illustrate the <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> between a pair of variables in the visualization, we modulate the color saturation and opacity for volumetric data sets and present three different visual representations, namely, ellipse, smoke, and metaball, for particle data sets. We demonstrate this information-theoretic approach and present our findings with three time-varying multivariate data sets produced from scientific simulations. ...|$|E

Unlike illustrations given in the previous section, we do not {{consider the case of}} measuring influence between two users but rather global candidates’ influence in the network. Also, the measure takes into account both the direct and indirect influence. The direct influence (first-level influence) takes into account only the direct links between the users in the <b>influence</b> graph. <b>Relations</b> representing the direct influence are retweets, mentions, and replies. In the indirect influence, we can consider the retweets of replies and the retweets of mentions. Those relations are called indirect ones as they are performed on indirect nodes in the network (e.g., a user may retweet another’s tweet indirectly through an intermediate user). The indirect influence is a more complex form of dialog compared to the direct <b>influence.</b> <b>Relations</b> or patterns are determined depending on the domain.|$|R

Based on {{the deep}} {{analysis}} of injection molding process and factors influenced {{on the quality}} of injection-molded parts, and considering of the non-linear, multi-variable coupling of process and the problem of data deficiencies, a feed-forward three-layer neural network was presented to predict the part weight based on the melt temperature, holding pressure and holding time, which is the most important quality index of injection-molded parts. Furthermore, an architecture optimization approach for neural networks was used and the performance of ANN was evaluated and tested by its application to verification tests with process parameters randomly selected which all of them were not used in the network training. Results showed that the ANN predictions yield mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in the range of 0. 1 % and the maximum relative error (MRE) in the range of 0. 47 % for the test data set, and which can comparatively accurately reflect the <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> of the injection process parameters on part’s quality indexs under the circumstance of data deficiencies...|$|E

40|$|We study {{political}} influence in institutions where members choose from among several options {{their levels of}} support to a collective goal, these individual choices determining {{the degree to which}} the goal is reached. Influence is assessed by newly defined binary relations, each of which compares any two individuals on the basis of their relative performance at a corresponding level of participation. For institutions with three levels of support (e. g., voting games in which each voter may vote "yes", "abstain", or vote "no"), we obtain three influence relations, and show that the strict component of each of them may be cyclical. The cyclicity of these relations contrasts with the transitivity of the unique <b>influence</b> <b>relation</b> of binary voting games. Weak conditions of anonymity are sufficient for each of them to be transitive. We also obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for each of them to be complete. Further, we characterize institutions for which the rankings induced by these relations, and the Banzhaf-Coleman and Shapley-Shubik power indices coincide. We argue that the extension of these relations to firms would be useful in efficiently allocating workers to different units of production. Applications to various forms of political and economic organizations are provided. ...|$|E
