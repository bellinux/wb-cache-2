Thus us used {{for the creation of a}} screening methodology for prioritizing <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> with regards to susceptibility to fatigue damage. The methodology provides the user with a toolset for identification and evaluation of the various <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> in operation. An acceptance criterion of a damping ratio of 0. 3 for <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> has been identified. Pipes with a damping ratio lower than 0. 3 has been shown to experience high amplitudes in the case of resonance freqiencies...|$|R

However, there are potential risks with underground <b>service</b> <b>pipe.</b> The scientific and reasonable gas <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> should be to minimize the accidents and easy to installed and guarantee the economical in the case of ensuring gas use. Comparing and analyzing the two ways frequently used in daily life from the aspect of pipe materiel and pipe laying methods, drawbacks of them are identified. Finally, the main use of PE pipe is recommended and measures to transform are proposed, which eliminate the security risk after improvement, and obtain the economic benefit in the long term...|$|R

40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracks (SCC) {{had been}} found in a natural gas transmission pipeline during a dig-up and inspection program. The question was raised as to whether the SCC was active or dormant. This paper describes the resultant investigation to determine if a particular service crack was actively growing. The strategy adopted was to assess the appearance of the fracture surface of the service crack and to compare with expectations from laboratory specimens with active SCC. The conclusions from this study are as follows. To judge whether a crack in the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> is active or dormant, it is reasonable to compare the very crack tip of the service crack and a fresh crack in a laboratory sample. If the crack tip of the active laboratory sample {{is similar to that of}} the <b>service</b> <b>pipe,</b> it means the crack in the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> is likely to be active. From the comparison of the crack tip between the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> and the laboratory samples, it appears likely that the cracks in the samples extracted from service were most likely to have been active intergranular stress corrosion cracks.

40|$|Longitudinally-welded 72 mm ID <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> (HSP) {{made from}} {{titanium}} grade 2 {{is used by}} the two suppliers of the helium tanks for the EU-XFEL accelerator. From the perspective of the PED DESY is legally designated as the manufacturer and is responsible for conformity to all relevant codes. During module assemblies at CEA Saclay the orbital welds of the interconnection bellows between cavities showed pores with dimensions outside the specifications set by DESY. These welds needed to be redone which caused a project delay of several months. The X-ray examination of the HSP showed that the pipes already exhibited many out-of- DESY spec pores in the longitudinal welds and were most likely the main cause of the problems in the orbital welds. It was decided to replace the extremities of the <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> with seamless titanium tubes both on “naked” helium tanks as well as on tanks with cavities already welded in. At DESY more than 750 <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> were exchanged over a period of 2 years.
