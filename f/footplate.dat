5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and <b>footplate,</b> {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the <b>footplate.</b> The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The <b>footplate</b> was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E
5|$|The {{reception}} {{given by}} <b>footplate</b> crews {{was such that}} more of the class were constructed for {{other parts of the}} network, although the electrification of the Southern's Eastern Section meant that they were dispersed from their original stamping grounds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Footplates</b> {{have to be}} cool, dry and sterilized before use.|$|R
50|$|The Class 420 was {{a typical}} long-boiler, inside-frame 0-8-0 {{locomotive}} of the era, that showed its Austrian derivation with its two-shutters smokebox door, and its outside Stephenson valve gear. The locomotives built before 1884 had the distinction of having curved <b>footplating</b> over the wheels, while later units had straight <b>footplating</b> and small splashers. Some of the locomotives were given a replacement boiler before 1914, but their performance remained mostly unchanged.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Footplates,</b> {{also known}} as footpads or baseplates, are {{at the base of}} columns and serve as anchors to give the rack more stability: anchor bolts are {{inserted}} through the baseplate’s holes to attach the column to the concrete floor. <b>Footplates</b> are made of thicker steel and in some geographic locations, they must be of a certain size and seismic rating. Footpads increase the pallet rack’s overall stability and weight-bearing capacity.|$|R
5|$|The LNER {{promoted}} their rebranding {{by offering}} Gill (who was fascinated with railway engines) a <b>footplate</b> {{ride on the}} Flying Scotsman express service; he also painted for it a signboard {{in the style of}} Gill Sans, which survives {{in the collection of the}} St Bride Library.|$|E
5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive <b>footplate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the <b>footplate.</b> They also had higher running plates {{along the sides of}} the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels. Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E
5000|$|Frame lengths, {{extended}} {{forward on}} the 1879 batch to accommodate the bogie, or extended rearward to accommodate extended <b>footplates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Safety {{features}} include unitary construction body, 4-wheel disc brakes, ABS+ASR, one-step easy-pass with special <b>footplates</b> for wheelchair access and non-step inside.|$|R
50|$|Outdoor Stairlifts {{come with}} seats, perches, <b>footplates</b> or {{platforms}} and are sold worldwide. They {{are similar to}} indoor stairlifts but with improved weatherproofing.|$|R
5|$|The {{benefits}} {{gained by}} Maunsell's modifications {{showed in the}} improved performance of the first batch of Maunsell S15s over their Urie-built predecessors. A third batch was ordered in 1931, coinciding with a downturn in the volume of freight due to the economic depression. This meant that {{the last of the}} S15 class was not completed until 1936, although weight-saving modifications were undertaken to this batch. A final modification was also applied to the class at this time, when all locomotives were equipped with smoke deflectors to improve visibility from the <b>footplate</b> when travelling at speed. This modification was a feature that became common to most Maunsell-influenced designs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 29 November 1877, heavy rain caused the dam of the Rhodgeidio mill near Llanerchymedd to breach, and the surge of water washed away the wooden Caemawr bridge over the Afon Alaw. The first train {{of the day was}} driven by William Taylor, with fireman John Saunders and railway {{inspector}} John Davies also on the <b>footplate.</b> The train also included two coal trucks, a passenger coach, and a guard's van, with Edward Hughes serving as the guard. The whole train went {{over the side of the}} bridge into the river. Edward Hughes dragged himself out, and was taken to the nearest farm. John Davies was scalded to death, and Taylor and Saunders were found injured, and could not be freed until mid-day. John Saunders later died from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} found that crewing {{of the train}} was insufficient. There was no traction inspector on board. WCRC had discontinued the use of traction inspectors by 2012. A traction inspector's duties include assisting the driver with the sighting of signals. Two members of the train support crew were also on the <b>footplate</b> of Tangmere, {{but they had no}} responsibility in respect of the operation of the train. No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault was found with either, although some of the sensors were not being recorded by the On Train Data Recorder (OTDR). The RAIB were able to reconstruct the sequence of events from the data that was recorded by the OTDR.|$|E

40|$|Fragments of otospongiotic and otosclerotic <b>footplates</b> were {{investigated}} by immunohistochemical methods. Antibodies IgG, IgA, IgM {{were found to}} be found to the vascular connective tissue of the resorption lacunae, IgG also to osteocytes. The application of antibodies against mumps, measles and rubella antigens showed the expression of the relevant viral antigens in the large cells of the resorption lacunae, in the vascular connective tissue, and in osteocytes, osteoclasts and chondrocytes, present in or around the otospongiotic areas. In the sclerotic stage only the perivascular connective tissue and chondrocytes have expressed viral antigens whereas IgG was restricted to the osteocytes of the sclerotic focus and to the residual perivascular tissue. Two <b>footplates</b> with postinflammatory sclerosis serving as controls revelaed only IgG in some chondrocytes. Healthy <b>footplates</b> showed neither a deposition of antibodies nor any expression of viral antigens. These results favour a viral aetiology of otosclerosis as an inflammatory vasclar reaction of the otic capsule initiated or caused by the viruses of measles, rubella and mump...|$|R
50|$|Elliptical {{trainers}} {{provide the}} benefits of exercises such as jogging or running, without {{the wear and tear}} on the joints because the feet never leave the <b>footplates.</b> Kettler elliptical trainers offer superior fat burning benefits.|$|R
5|$|The main visual {{difference}} between the Kand K1classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve gear assembly from the elements. It also featured a new cab design with redesigned single front spectacle plates, {{and a pair of}} substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the Kclass locomotives had allowed the provision of a <b>footplate</b> that curved from the buffers to the water tanks. The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No.A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos.A891-A900) alongside a batch of five N1class 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No.A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the <b>footplate</b> from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the <b>footplate</b> of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E
50|$|Angle-supported {{intraocular lenses}} are {{a special kind}} of intraocular lens that can be {{implanted}} surgically into the anterior chamber of the eye. These lenses are called angle-supported because the <b>footplates</b> of the lens rest in the irido-corneal angle.|$|R
5000|$|Jim Hill was {{an engine}} driver {{who worked the}} line for many years. His reminiscences {{can be found in}} the book Buckjumpers, Gobblers and Clauds : A Lifetime on Great Eastern and LNER <b>Footplates</b> (Bradford Burton 1981 [...] ) ...|$|R
5000|$|T413: Built in 1956 for {{the narrow}} gauge Fyansford Cement Works Railway, Geelong as D1, {{it was sold}} to Victorian Railways, renumbered T413 and had its <b>footplates</b> {{replaced}} with similar ones to those already on their pre-existing Ts.|$|R
25|$|Clarkson {{was on the}} <b>footplate</b> {{throughout}} the journey, acting as the fireman for periods. After the race, he was understood to have been impressed with Tornado.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} boiler was {{the shape}} of a hammer and was required to be fitted to the frame before the <b>footplate,</b> cylinders or blower could be added.|$|E
25|$|Novelty is {{regarded}} as the first tank engine as the fuel was carried in baskets on the <b>footplate</b> and water was in a well tank between the wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The added texture {{reduces the}} risk of slipping, making diamond plate a {{solution}} for stairs, catwalks, walkways, and ramps in industrial settings. Its non-skid properties mean that diamond plate is frequently used on the interior of ambulances and on the <b>footplates</b> of firetrucks. Additional applications include truck beds and trailer floors.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{original}} Acrow prop was only intended for vertical support, the range {{has since been}} extended. Shoring 'push and pull' props with swivelling <b>footplates</b> are available and are used to support concrete formwork. Horizontal strutting props are used for shoring trenchwork. These are similar, but have a 'claw' form to their baseplates.|$|R
50|$|Initially schooled at Eton, in 1868, {{he went on}} to Trinity College, Cambridge, {{where he}} made friends with the local railway people, cadging lifts on the <b>footplates</b> of locos. He {{graduated}} in 1872 with a Master's degree in Applied Science. As a landed gentleman, however, convention frowned on him developing an engineering career.|$|R
25|$|K 192: State Coal Mine, Wonthaggi, Victoria Painted all-over {{black with}} red under the {{locomotive}} <b>footplate,</b> but with black buffer beam. For a time, the engine wore {{the identity of}} K 170.|$|E
25|$|A {{double bass}} drum pedal {{operates}} {{much the same}} way only with a second <b>footplate</b> controlling a second beater on the same drum. Most commonly this is attached by a shaft to a remote beater mechanism alongside the primary pedal mechanism. One notable exception to this pattern is the symmetrical Sleishman twin bass drum pedal.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with many LMS standard {{features such as}} a self-cleaning smokebox, rocking firegrate, self-emptying ashpan, side window cab and a simplified <b>footplate</b> together with others which followed NCC practice, such as a water top-feed on a parallel boiler (as opposed to the taper boilers {{being used by the}} LMS at the time), Dreadnought type vacuum brake gear, Detroit sight feed cylinder lubricator and a cast number plate.|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{mineralization}} in 35 <b>footplates</b> (28 otosclerotic obtained from patients who underwent stapedectomy and 6 normal obtained from patiens who underwent labirintectomy for sever Menieres disease, as control group) has been detected by quantitaive electron microprobe analysis. The optimal section of samples {{for the analysis}} were obtained by grinding the <b>footplates</b> (embedded in Epoxic resin) with Boron Carbide and then polished with a diamond past. A scanning electron microscope (SEC) ETEC autoscan, operating at 15 KV, and an energy dispersive system (EDS) EEDS ORTEC for the X-ray analysis, were employed to analyze elements with athomic number higher than 10. Natural chloro. apatite was used as standard and a modified computer program was used to convert the X-ray counts to wight percent oxides. Several points of analysis were carried out between core and rim, or rim to rim, of samples; this method gives an accurate evaluation of spot chemical composition. The total ammount of demineralized tissue (Δ), the Ca/P ratio (competent to Octacalciumphosphate OCP) increased and well-defined Aluminium content. Sclerotic <b>footplates</b> show a modified structure due to numerous irregular lacunae enclosed by well mineralized bone with Ca/P ratio (copetent to Hydroxyapatite HA) and absence of aluminium. Even though at present we cannot explain the presence of Aluminium, the finding of OCP in the spongiotic lesion may {{play an important role}} in the explanation of chrystallochemical action of Sodium FLuoride in the treatment of otosclerosis...|$|R

Such customization may encompass the seat dimensions, height, seat angle, <b>footplates,</b> leg rests, front caster outriggers, adjustable backrests and controls. Various optional accessories are available, such as anti-tip bars or wheels, safety belts, adjustable backrests, tilt and/or recline features, extra support for limbs or head and neck, holders for crutches, walkers or oxygen tanks, drink holders, and mud and wheel-guards as clothing protectors.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground and aimLocal {{anesthesia}} nowadays {{became more}} {{popular in the}} ophthalmic surgery, especially in implantable collamer lens (ICL) procedure, with fewer complications and more patient satisfaction. Here we design a study to evaluate deep topical fornix nerve block (DTFNBA) versus topical anesthesia. MethodsA double blinded randomized prospective controlled study of 107 eyes that were scheduled for implantable collamer lens procedure was included and divided randomly into two groups, group I topical anesthesia (n= 53), group II DTFNBA (n= 54). The two groups were monitored for pain and patient compliance. ResultsIn group I, receiving topical anesthesia 27 patients (50. 09 %) reported pain, especially with implantation of the lens, tucking of the lens <b>footplates</b> and peripheral iridectomy that necessitated intracameral lidocaine injection. The others (n= 26) showed different grades of discomfort that was tolerated {{without the need for}} intracameral lidocaine. 40 patients (74. 07 %) in group II (DTFNBA), tolerated the surgery well, and slight discomfort was reported as a sensation of heaviness during the tucking of <b>footplates.</b> None of the patients had pain strong enough to require intracameral injection of lidocaine (p< 0. 05). ConclusionsPlacing the anesthetic in the fornix makes the DTFNBA more effective and reliable block...|$|R
