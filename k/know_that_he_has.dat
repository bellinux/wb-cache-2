5|$|Black {{comes to}} in a {{hospital}} bed, tended to by his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher). She explains to him what has happened, and turns {{on the evening news}} to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E
25|$|Fitzy Fitzgerald (Cavan Cunningham) is {{the mayor}} of Dog River. He tends to take his {{position}} very seriously. He is quite paranoid about losing his job and thinks that anyone will do anything for the position of mayor, although no one really wants it. Not a lot is revealed about his personal life; however, we do <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> at least one child, and several episodes imply {{that he may have}} a son.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked [...] "How can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something, or just thinks that he or she has imagined it?" [...] In regards to the possibility of a placebo trial, Leavitt commented [...] "I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he has imagined something while we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the third}} death anniversary of our death, {{we are seeing}} the release of the {{juvenile}} convict. Where is justice in that? I do not know whether he is 16 or 18. I only <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> committed a brutal crime and there should be no age limit for punishment; [...] the juvenile convict should be sentenced to death, fast-track courts be set up in all the courts to offer speedy justice to sexual assault victims, amendments to the Juveniles Justice Act be passed and utilisation of Nirbhaya Fund for setting up high quality forensic labs in all states.|$|E
500|$|In Longacre's {{first years}} as chief engraver, no {{original}} designs were required for coins. [...] Gobrecht had redesigned every denomination of U.S. coinage between 1835 and 1842, {{and his successor}} had time to learn arts necessary for coin production {{that he had not}} needed as a maker of print engravings. [...] These arts included coin design, making of punches for design elements, and die sinking. Longacre's work in the private sector had involved cutting lines into a copper plate which was then used to print reproductions. Patterson wrote in August 1845 to Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker that Longacre [...] "is a gentleman of excellent character, highly regarded in this community, and has acquired some celebrity as an engraver of copper; but he is not a Die-Sinker. [...] Indeed I do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> ever made an attempt in this art." [...] By December of that year, the Mint director had written to Walker in praise of Longacre, stating that the engraver had [...] "more taste and judgment in making devices for an improved coinage here than have been exhibited by any of his predecessors. [...] He has shown too that he is quite competent to make the required model from his drawings." [...] Taxay attributed Patterson's lavish praise of Longacre to continued attempts by Leonard to gain the post of chief engraver.|$|E

2500|$|Constructive trusts, under Section 53(2) of the Law of Property Act 1925, do {{not require}} any {{particular}} formalities on creation, unlike express trusts. For them to be valid, however, the defendant (or [...] "trustee" [...] of the constructive trust) must <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> dealt with property in an [...] "unconscionable manner". In Westdeutsche Landesbank v Islington London Borough Council, Lord Browne-Wilkinson wrote that [...] "Since the equitable jurisdiction to enforce trusts depends upon {{the conscience of the}} holder of the legal interest being affected, he cannot be a trustee of the property if and so long as he is ignorant of the facts alleged to affect his conscience".|$|E
