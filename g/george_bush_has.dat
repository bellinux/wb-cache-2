40|$|Excerpt] In a 2002 study, the US Government Accountability Office {{reported}} {{that more than}} 32 million workers in the United States lack protection {{of the right to}} organise and to bargain collectively. But since then, the situation has worsened. A series of decisions by the federal authorities under President <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> stripped many more workers of organising and bargaining rights. The administration took away bargaining rights {{for hundreds of thousands of}} employees in the new Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department. 18 In the years before the 2009 change of administration, a controlling majority of the five-member National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), appointed by President Bush, denied protection to graduate student employees, disabled employees, temporary employees and other categories of workers. An October 2006, a NLRB decision was especially alarming for labour advocates. The NLRB set out a new, expanded definition of 2 ̆ 7 supervisor 2 ̆ 7 under the section of US labour law that excludes supervisors from protection of the right to organise and bargain collectively. This exclusion has enormous repercussions for millions of workers who might now become 2 ̆ 7 supervisors 2 ̆ 7 and lose protection of their organising and bargaining rights. 21 This case is discussed in more detail below in connection with a complaint to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association...|$|E
40|$|Whatever court tries Saddam, {{it must be}} seen in {{the eyes}} of the world as fair, write Andrew Byrnes and Hilary Charlesworth IT IS not yet clear what type of court will be used to try Saddam Hussein for the atrocities that he and his regime inflicted on the Iraqi people and their neighbours. The US President, <b>George</b> <b>Bush,</b> <b>has</b> {{suggested}} that it will be a primarily Iraqi tribunal, but one that can withstand international scrutiny. What are the options? Any tribunal must satisfy international standards of impartiality and competence and observe due process. While the defendants must be assured a fair opportunity to present their case, it would be undesirable for a trial to drag on for years or to become a forum for political grandstanding. This is why it must be properly resourced. One possibility is trial before a national tribunal. The Iraqi Governing Council last week proclaimed a law establishing a special tribunal to try Iraqi nationals who had committed crimes against humanity and war crimes inside or outside Iraq during the Baathist period (1968 - 2003). This tribunal will comprise Iraqi judges and prosecutors (the council may appoint non-Iraqi judges if it considers this necessary). It will be assisted by international experts with a purely advisory role, and may end up a sizeable institution, with dozens of judges carrying out investigative functions, conducting trials and hearing appeals. The tribunal will apply international law, largely drawn from the Statute of the International Criminal Court, supplemented by reference to Iraqi criminal law. Unlike the ICC, the tribunal will probably have the power to impose the death penalty, a feature that will create controversy in the international community. It is far from clear that the Iraqi legal community has the necessary expertise for what will be a complex logistical and legal task. It would be sensible to include in the tribunal international judges with expertise in the fields of international criminal and humanitarian law. While a national tribunal would have the advantage of Iraqis judging Iraqis, it is also important that this is not seen as a domestic version of victors’ justice. A second option would be a purely international tribunal. The ICC would be of limited use, since it can deal only with crimes that have occurred since July 1 last year. Even the crimes allegedly committed during this year’s war in Iraq could only be brought before the ICC if the Security Council referred the situation to the court. This is most unlikely, given the antipathy of the US to the ICC and its power to veto any Security Council resolution along those lines. Another international model is the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals set up by the victorious powers after the second world war to try German and Japanese war criminals. However, the taint of victors’ justice that adheres to them even today suggests that similar tribunals staffed by the occupying powers would lack legitimacy. A further, arguably better, option would be a mixed tribunal of some sort, similar to the court recently established after an agreement between the UN and Sierra Leone. This court, unlike the UN ad hoc tribunals in The Hague, sits in the country where the atrocities occurred, comprises international and national judges and prosecutors, and applies international and local law. This would balance the interests of the community that has borne the brunt of the human rights abuses and those of the international community in ensuring that those who have threatened international peace and security are brought to justice; it is also likely to enjoy both international and national legitimacy. All of these possibilities are focused on the atrocities of the Baathist regime. It is also important that the allegations of war crimes made against coalition forces during the invasion of Iraq are openly and fairly investigated and dealt with, even though they may seem minor when viewed against Saddam’s record. This is not to fall into the trap of moral equivalence, but simply to assert the rule of law. The opportunity to put Saddam on trial for the atrocities committed over the years is profoundly significant. By learning the lessons of past tribunals, we have the opportunity to respond to barbarity with justice, dispensed in accordance with the international rule of law.

40|$|The G 8 meeting {{showed how}} hard heads and soft hearts {{can be a}} potent combination, writes Nicholas Gruen DOING good takes more than good intentions. You need to be tough-minded. That’s the idea {{embodied}} in the economists’ synthesis: ‘hard heads; soft hearts’. It’s such a powerful idea that if it’s forgotten we’re often forced to relearn it - often {{through the agency of}} the painful and uncertain political contest between left and right. At Gleneagles this synthesis worked on foreign aid. Because program failures undermine its support, a left-of-centre ‘cartel of good intentions’ has covered up the many failures of foreign aid. So we’ve been slow to discover and learn from what works and what doesn’t. We’ve even seen aid disappear into the Swiss bank accounts of third-world kleptocrats. It’s taken the political right to impose some hard-headedness. <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> sharply increased foreign aid whilst imposing much stronger conditions - for instance on cleaning up corruption - and Gleneagles extended this approach. That’s hard-headed soft-heartedness in action. But on the environment, Gleneagles gushed greenhouse gobbledygook. Leaders committed to ‘act with resolve and urgency’ - about as firmly as St Augustine prayed for virtue. ‘Lord make me chaste - but not yet’. Lord make me reduce my emissions - but not yet. We’re at a pretty pass. No one’s sure that the world will continue to warm or that our emissions of greenhouse gases are causing it. But scientists who deny it are now a rump consisting increasingly, though not entirely, of cranks. There’s plenty of uncertainty about the costs of global warming too - and that’s not counting the subjective value of unique eco-systems we could lose. But the costs of global warming could vastly outweigh the modest cost of even quite vigorous action. The Kyoto Protocol caps global emissions, but with two huge exceptions. First, the US has refused to ratify. (And thus emboldened, we’ve joined the US in our own exclusive duo - the coalition of the unwilling). Second, Kyoto exempts the developing countries - which produce nearly 40 percent of global emissions now, and will overtake the West within two decades. What are we doing about it? Next to nothing. International greenhouse politics remains mired in a swamp of soft-hearted soft-headedness. Being poorer, the developing countries are supposed to be the good guys. They’re also a majority of the UN and its progeny, the Kyoto Protocol. Thus the bizarre spectacle {{of a small group of}} rich countries taking on difficult commitments within an agreement formally controlled by those doing next to nothing. The majority remain serenely intransigent about taking on serious commitments while berating the minority for the paltriness of their sacrifice. They even call for compensation. Pointing to their own much lower carbon emissions per capita and the West’s relative wealth, they cry: ‘You created the problem, you fix it’. But if we were rationing water in a drought we’d want everyone to save water, though we might choose to compensate the poor. We should do the same with greenhouse. Actually, we already have. When Kyoto was negotiated, Russia was in the midst of a depression produced by its botched transition to capitalism. So the richer countries gave it a very generous entitlement to emit. Indeed Russia was permitted to emit more carbon than it was then emitting - so called ‘hot air’. Why? To reward it for signing up. Whether you call this ‘compensation’ or an ‘incentive’, (I call it a bribe) Russia now sells its excess emission entitlements to the highest bidder. Get it? In addition to compensating Russia, trading emissions permits makes Russia keen to cut its emissions further - so it can sell more permits. So it joins the global effort to reduce emissions. The West should offer developing countries a similarly generous deal. But breaking through their intransigence would also require a credible threat to impose trade sanctions if they kept stalling. But so far a hard headed, soft hearted offer like this isn’t even on the table. Why? Because the Europeans’ soft-heartedness is also soft-headed. They seem incapable of walking away from the table in the face of the developing country intransigence. American hard-headedness could be the antidote. But so far developing country intransigence has just been a fig leaf for the Americans’ refusal to ratify Kyoto. The real motive is hard-heartedness. George Bush wants to protect the American ‘way of life’ from the costs of its existing emissions target. So he’s not about to accept an even smaller target, which he’d be forced to, if the developing countries were brought into Kyoto - like Russia, with a generous emissions entitlement. While I wait for progress out of this mess I’ll think of that puritan saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I 2 ̆ 7 ll be hoping that America’s walking away from Kyoto might just end up doing some good - that here on Earth the road to Heaven might be paved with a few bad intentions. Economists have been unable to sell their ‘hard heads, soft hearts’ recipe ready-made. But the contest between left and right might eventually deliver it. • Nicholas Gruen is Visiting Fellow at ANU and Melbourne University and CEO of Lateral Economics and Peach Discount Mortgage Broking.
