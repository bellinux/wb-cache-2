Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased lung compliance. A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E

40|$|Epidemiological and {{clinical}} {{studies suggest that}} inhalation of cobalt metal dust (Co) mixed with tungsten carbide particles (WC), but not of cobalt dust alone, may cause interstitial pulmonary lesions (hard metal disease). In previous experimental studies in the rat, we have demonstrated the greater acute pulmonary toxicity of a WC-Co mixture compared to Co or WC alone. The present study was undertaken to compare in the same animal model the delayed lung response after intratracheal administration of Co or WC-Co particles (cobalt particle 6. 3 wt%). The responses were also compared with those obtained after treatment with arsenic trioxide and crystalline silica used a reference materials producing an acute toxic insult and a progressive fibrogenic response, respectively. Cellular (total and differential counts) and biochemical parameters (LDH, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, total protein, albumin, fibronectin, and hyaluronic acid) were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following single and repeated <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillations.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} delayed lung response observed after WC-Co is different from that after cobalt metal alone. A single intratracheal dose of WC-Co (1, 5, or 10 mg/ 100 g body wt) induced an acute alveolitis which persisted for at least 1 month. Four months after a single instillation of WC-Co, no clear histological lung fibrosis could however be evidenced, indicating a reversibility of the lesions. The effects of cobalt (0. 06, 0. 3, or 0. 6 mg/ 100 g body wt) or tungsten carbide alone (1, 5, 10 mg/ 100 g body wt) were very modest, if any. Following repeated <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillations</b> (four administrations at 1 -month interval), increased lung hydroxyproline content and histopathological evidence of interstitial fibrosis were observed after WC-Co (4 x 1 mg/ 100 g body wt), but not after administration of each component separately, i. e., Co (4 x 0. 06 mg/ 100 g body wt) or WC (4 x 1 mg/ 100 g body wt). The mechanism of the fibrotic reaction induced by WC-Co seems different from the progressive inflammatory reaction induced by crystalline silica. We suggest that it might result from a scarring reaction elicited by repeated acute insults as observed after repeated administration of arsenic trioxide...|$|R

50|$|Carbon {{black is}} {{considered}} possibly carcinogenic to humans and {{classified as a}} Group 2B carcinogen, because there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals with inadequate evidence in human epidemiological studies. The body of evidence of carcinogenicity in animal studies comes from two chronic inhalation studies and two <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation</b> studies in rats, which showed significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. An inhalation study was tested on mice, but did not show significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. Epidemiologic data comes from three different cohort studies of carbon black production workers. Two studies, from the United Kingdom and Germany, with over 1,000 workers in each study group, showed elevated mortality from lung cancer in the carbon black workers. Another study of over 5,000 workers in the United States did not show elevated mortality from lung cancer in the carbon black workers. Newer findings of increased lung cancer mortality in an update from the UK study may suggest that carbon black could be a late-stage carcinogen. However, a more recent and larger study from Germany did not confirm this hypothesis that carbon black acts as a late-stage carcinogen.|$|E

This study demonstrates the release of elastase from recruited PMNs in cryostat sections of hamster lungs, after being treated once, twice, or thrice with LPS, intratracheally. Elastase activity was visualized using two elastase-specific synthetic substrates, to which a methoxynaphthylamine (MNA) group had been bound covalently. Liberated MNA, when made insoluble by coupling with 5 -nitrosalicylaldehyde, fluoresces strongly. The authors observed that the interval between start of incubation and appearance of fluorescence and the intensity of fluorescence correlated with the number of LPS administrations. Fluorescence was observed to be located in or in close vicinity to alveolar walls. No fluorescence was observed in sections of untreated hamsters. Liberation of MNA from synthetic substrates was delayed strongly by the addition of a recombinant secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor or a substituted cephalosporin neutrophil elastase inhibitor.

During pulmonary toxicity caused by NiO nanoparticles, the induction of oxidative stress is a major factor. Both <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation</b> and inhalation of NiO nanoparticles induced pulmonary oxidative stress.

When the amount of NiO in the lung is similar, the responses against pulmonary oxidative stress of <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation</b> and inhalation are also similar.

Inhalation causes milder oxidative stress than that caused by <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation.</b> On evaluation of the nanoparticle-induced pulmonary oxidative stress in the early phase, we should understand the different states of oxidative stress induced by <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation</b> and inhalation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT KEYWORDS: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of calcium phosphate (CAP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) particles on the systemic delivery of insulin administered by the pulmonary route. Two methods of pulmonary delivery were employed: <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation</b> and spray instillation. Insulin-CAP-PEG particles in suspension (1. 2 U/kg, 110 - 140 µL) were administered to the lungs of fasted rats by <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation</b> (INCAPEG) or spray instillation (SINCAPEG). Control treatments consisted of insulin solution (1. 2 U/kg) by <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation,</b> spray instillation, and subcutaneous administration (SC). Plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose were determined by chemiluminescence and colorimetric methods, respectively. Data wer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Optimization of <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation</b> is neces-sary to {{establish}} an ideal animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) {{in order to further}} reveal the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of ALI. It is possible that instilling air from a prefilled syringe may promote the delivery of reagents into the alveolar spaces, resulting in different pulmonary responses. In the present study, the influence of instilling air by trans-tracheal <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation</b> in a lipopolysac-charide (LPS) -induced mouse model of ALI was investigated. The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid biochemical index, BAL fluid differential cell counts, lung wet/dry weight ratio, lung histology and BAL fluid interleukin‑ 8 (IL‑ 8) levels were assessed 24 h subsequent to <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation.</b> Instilled air promoted LPS-induced ALI, as indicated by the severity of acute pulmonary inflammation and increased IL‑ 8 release. In conclusion, this study indicates that instilled air may be used to improve the <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillation</b> procedure and {{to establish}} a more reliable animal model of ALI...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} developed an animal model {{in order to}} study the pulmonary and systemic reactions following exposure to environmental pollutants. In this model, conscious sheep received repeated <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillations</b> of a suspension of 0 (controls), 2 mg (low dose) or 128 mg (high dose) of chrysotile asbestos fibres over a 12 month period. A significant dose-dependent enhancement in proliferative responses of pulmonary free airway cells (FAC) to four mitogens was observed after a first instillation. A somewhat weaker stimulation was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes (PBML). At 6 months, the high dose animals no longer displayed the dose-dependent enhancement of FAC responses and manifested actual depression of PBML responses. At 12 months, all asbestos exposed animals showed impaired responses of FAC, whereas only the PBML of high dose animals were showing such an impairment. These data suggest that asbestos exposure has a dose-dependent initial enhancement of local pulmonary as well as systemic responses to mitogens while prolonged exposure and higher doses can subsequently lead to a relative depression of local and systemic cellular immune activity. Although responsive early after asbestos exposure, systemic immunity appears to lag behind local immunity in the late depressive effect of asbestos fibres on mitogen responsiveness. In addition to these cell-directed effects serum factors seem to play an inhibitory role in lymphocyte responses to mitogens in animals repeatedly exposed to asbestos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Iron {{nanomaterials}} are {{of considerable}} interest for application to nanotechnology-related fields including environmental catalysis, biomedical imaging, drug delivery and hyperthermia, {{because of their}} superparamagnetic characteristics and high catalytic abilities. However, information about potential risks of iron nanomaterials is limited. The present study assessed pulmonary responses to a single <b>intratracheal</b> spray <b>instillation</b> of triiron tetraoxide nanoparticles (magnetite) in rats. Ten-week-old male and female Fischer 344 rats (n= 5 /group) were exposed to a single <b>intratracheal</b> spray <b>instillation</b> of 0 (vehicle), 5. 0, 15. 0 or 45. 0 mg/kg body weight (BW) of magnetite. After 14 days, the rats were sacrificed, and biological consequences were investigated. The lung weights of the 15. 0 and 45. 0 mg/kg BW male and female groups {{were significantly higher than}} those of the control groups. The lungs of treated rats showed enlargement and black patches originating from the color of magnetite. The typical histopathological changes in the lungs of the treated rats included infiltration of macrophages phagocytosing magnetite, inflammatory cell infiltration, granuloma formation and an increase of goblet cells in the bronchial epithelium. The results clearly show that instilled magnetite causes foreign body inflammatory and granulating lesions in the lung. These pulmonary responses occur in a dose-dependent manner in association with the increase in lung weight. (DOI: 10. 1293 /tox. 25. 233; J Toxicol Pathol 2012; 25 : 233 – 239...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{received}} <b>intratracheal</b> <b>instillations</b> of 50 mg of silica (quartz, 0. 5 mu particles). One, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months later, {{the lungs}} were evaluated histologically and by various biochemical measurements. The lung content of protein, proline, and hydroxyproline (collagen) were quantitated, {{as were the}} synthesis rates of lung collagen and the total lung protein (evaluated with lung minces in vitro. The ratio of newly synthesized and of total lung Type I to Type III collagen was also determined. These experiments were performed in parallel on rats free of chronic respiratory disease and a strain of conventional animals. The authors conclude that 1) the excess collagen deposited in granulomas and/or silicotic nodules {{as part of the}} fibrotic response of the lung is similar to normal lung collagen with respect to relative ratios of Types I and III present, in contrast to the response of the lung to oxidant pneumotoxins; 2) the response of the lung to silica continues for at least 1 year; 3) there are essentially no differences in the response of chronic respiratory disease-free Sprague-Dawley and conventional Wistar rats to intratracheally instilled silica. Both strains of rats develop silica-containing granulomas, mature silicotic nodules, and areas of alveolar lipoproteinosis associated with interstitial pneumonitis. Even 1 year after instillation of silica areas of granulomas, silicotic nodules and alveolar lipoproteinosis may be observed in most of the lungs studied; ie, these responses are not mutually exclusive...|$|R
