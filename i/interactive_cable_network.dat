40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceA {{major issue}} for {{contemporary}} <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> under flat pricing is that heavy users can cause severe network congestion and light users subsidize heavy users. This problem is exaggerated when network participants do not obey the protocols. From {{the perspective of}} control theory, <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> are primarily open-loop systems that assume the participants are non-strategic. The solution proposed in this research is to design a feedback (closed-loop) control system for <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> using dynamic pricing. The goal of the control system {{is to make the}} regulation of <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> automatic. The solution consists of three phases: modeling and analysis of <b>cable</b> <b>networks,</b> observer design of <b>cable</b> <b>networks,</b> and controller synthesis of <b>cable</b> <b>networks.</b> Each phase by itself tackles several challenges in the fields of computer networks, control theory, and mathematics. This research is intended to enhance bandwidth utilization efficiency, fairness, and security strength. The creation of an autonomic <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> involves two objectives: 1. Devise a mechanism (protocol) to ensure that individual benefit is maximized, as well as social efficiency and fairness using a dynamic pricing scheme. 2. Design a feedback (closed-loop) control system for <b>cable</b> <b>networks.</b> The proposed feedback control system for <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> has some desired properties, such as controllability, stability, sub-efficiency, voluntary participation, incentive compatibility, simplicity, and practicability. The solution is validated by not only theoretic studies but simulations...|$|R

40|$|Bridge {{stay cables}} are {{vulnerable}} to dynamic excitations by wind. There are different countermeasures to suppress unfavorable bridge stay cable vibrations {{and one of the}} effective countermeasures is to connect stay cables by cross-ties to form a <b>cable</b> <b>network.</b> However, the dynamic behaviour of a <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> is not clearly understood and most of the current designs are based on physical tests and numerical simulations. In this thesis, an effort has been made to understand the in-plane free vibration of a <b>cable</b> <b>network.</b> Three analytical models have been developed to investigate the in-plane free vibration of a basic <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> with a rigid transverse cross-tie, a general <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> with a single line of rigid transverse cross-ties, and a basic <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> with a flexible transverse cross-tie. The key system parameters of a <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> have been identified, which include the segment ratio, the frequency ratio, the mass-tension ratio, the length ratio, the cross-tie flexibility parameter, and the total number of interconnected cables. Extensive parametric study has been conducted to evaluate the role of each parameter in affecting the performance of a <b>cable</b> <b>network.</b> All the analytical model results are verified by numerical simulations using the Finite Element software ABAQUS 6. 9...|$|R

The entire Cork analogue <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> was encrypted from late 1980s onwards. The Cork network also carried more channels than other <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> in Ireland at that time. When digital cable was launched in Cork, UPC Ireland rapidly swapped analogue set top boxes for digital boxes and then shutdown the analogue service entirely. The network still carries analogue terrestrial channels, RTÉ1, RTÉ2, TV3 and TG4 {{in some parts of}} the network. This means that Cork is the first city in Ireland with an exclusively digital <b>cable</b> <b>network.</b> For analogue <b>cable</b> in Ireland there is no set frequency plan. Most <b>cable</b> <b>networks</b> for analogue use Harmonically related carriers (carrier frequencies of exact 8 MHz multiples).
