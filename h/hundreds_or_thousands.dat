5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E

5|$|Shorter hydroperiods {{of three}} or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other {{microscopic}} organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.|$|E
5|$|His government's {{treatment}} of non-Arab Libyans has also {{came in for}} criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya. Human rights groups also criticized the {{treatment of}} migrants, including asylum seekers, who passed through Gaddafi's Libya {{on their way to}} Europe. According to journalist Annick Cojean and psychologist Seham Sergewa, Gaddafi and senior officials raped and imprisoned <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of young women and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's actions in promoting foreign militant groups, although regarded by him as a justifiable support for national liberation movements, was seen by the United States as interference in the domestic affairs of other nations and active support for international terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E

5|$|Students of Swiss {{educator}} Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, {{a proponent}} of social reform, applied his teachings when founding some singing groups as an instrument for cultural change. One of his students was Carl August Zeller, who helped establish the sängerbund movement throughout Prussia in 1809. Pestalozzi's protégé Hans Georg Nägeli was a composer, music teacher and songbook publisher who made numerous journeys across Germany from 1819 to encourage the formation of male singing groups for social reform. Nägeli established several sängerbunds in Switzerland, which became {{the inspiration for the}} 1824 establishment of the Stuttgarter Liederkranz. Following the 1819 Carlsbad Decrees in Germany, male-only choral celebrations with <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of vocalists were popular with the masses and often part of political events.|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{have worked}} to {{understand}} these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks, which can be simulated using computers. Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than {{the details of how}} they are implemented in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons. No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.|$|E

5|$|It {{is highly}} gregarious on migration, {{travelling}} in large flocks that can contain <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of individuals. Huge dense groups {{form on the}} wintering grounds; one flock in Senegal contained a million birds. A minority winter further east to Burma, south China, New Guinea and scattered parts of southern Australia, or on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe. In Great Britain and parts of coastal western Europe, where the breeding and wintering ranges overlap, birds may be present throughout the year. Non-breeding birds may also remain year round in the tropical wintering quarters. The Ruff is an uncommon visitor to Alaska (where it has occasionally bred), Canada and the contiguous states of the US, and has wandered to Iceland, Middle America, northern South America, Madagascar and New Zealand. It has been recorded as breeding well south of its main range in northern Kazakhstan, a major migration stopover area.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} bedrock or limestone of the Everglades basin {{affects the}} hydroperiod, {{or how long}} an area within the region stays flooded throughout the year. Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater {{for longer periods of}} time, while the geology of Florida was forming. More water is held within the porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level. A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass, whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of periphyton, a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms. There are only two types of soil in the Everglades, peat and marl. Where there are longer hydroperiods, peat builds up over <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Where periphyton grows, the soil develops into marl, which is more calcitic in composition.|$|E
5|$|Although Triceratops are {{commonly}} portrayed as herding animals, {{there is currently}} little evidence that they lived in herds. While several other genera of horned dinosaurs are known from bonebeds preserving bones from two to <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of individuals, to date {{there is only one}} documented bonebed dominated by Triceratops bones: a site in southeastern Montana with the remains of three juveniles. It may be significant that only juveniles were present. Another, more recent find may reveal that Triceratops lived in small family groups. In 2012, a group of three Triceratops in relatively complete condition, each of varying sizes from a full-grown adult to a small juvenile, were found in Wyoming, near Newcastle. The remains are currently under excavation by paleontologist Peter Larson and a team from the Black Hills Institute. It is believed that the animals were traveling as a family unit, but it remains unknown if the group consists of a mated pair and their offspring, or two females and a juvenile they were caring for. The remains also show signs of predation or scavenging from Tyrannosaurus, particularly on the largest specimen, with the bones of the front limbs showing breakage and puncture wounds from Tyrannosaurus teeth.|$|E

5|$|Samarium is a {{rare earth}} metal having a {{hardness}} and density {{similar to those of}} zinc. With the boiling point of 1794°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally assumes a rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to 731°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close-packed (hcp), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Heating to 300°C combined with compression to 40kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (dhcp). Applying higher pressure of the order of <b>hundreds</b> <b>or</b> <b>thousands</b> of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900kbar. In one study, the dhcp phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700°C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions.|$|E
