40|$|To {{determine}} whether eye contact elicits blushing due to anxiety, forehead blood flow was measured during a stressful quiz and self-disclosure. The investigator maintained {{eye contact with}} 19 participants whereas, in another 40 cases, the investigator and/or participant wore sunglasses or the investigator left the room (the control group). Anxiety, embarrassment, and forehead blood flow increased in both groups during the quiz, consistent with anxiety-evoked blushing. However, during self-disclosure, increases in forehead blood flow were greater in the eye contact than control group despite reductions in embarrassment and anxiety. These findings suggest that eye contact augments blushing over and above any influence of anxiety or <b>general</b> <b>scrutiny</b> during self-disclosure...|$|R

25|$|A {{phenomenon}} that reached its pinnacle {{during this time}} was the <b>general</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of textbooks, especially in biology, Earth science, social studies, and literature. In the 1960s, when BSCS, whose textbooks emphasized Darwin's theory of evolution (in contrast to many high school biology texts as the time), submitted its books for state adoption in the lucrative market of Texas, serious trouble surfaced. The Reverend Ruel Lemmons led a protest (that reached the Texas Governor's office) to the get the BSCS textbooks banned claiming the books were pure evolution, completely materialistic and atheistic. The books were not banned, but there were changes made to lighten their evolutionary emphasis.

40|$|Thesis (MTech(Education)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1998 This study {{investigates the}} {{industry}} component of cooperative education programmes in Clothing as {{offered by the}} Clothing Department at the Cape Technikon relevant to the Western Cape. The character and nature of co-operative education came under <b>general</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> The structure of any cooperative educational program consists of two components; the academic and the industry component. Within this structure, a few attendance patterns are used to employ students in industry. This employment of students bridges {{the gap between the}} academic component and practice. The co-ordinator of co-operative education is responsible for the supervision over and application of specific tasks to ensure the successful completion of the industry component. The professional tasks include the identification and recruiting of workstations, the placement of students, the orientation of both the employer and student, the monitoring of the students' progress, as well as the evaluation of the students' work. The important role of the advisory committee cannot be underestimated in order to ensure successful completion of the co-operative educational programs. It should be properly constituted with specific functions with regards to the industry component. A qualitative study was undertaken to describe the course of the current industry experience in Clothing at the Cape Technikon. Discussion forums, personal interviews and a literature study serve as the foundation of this investigation...|$|R

At the 2012 PPD primaries, Cruz led all of the candidates to the House of Representatives in votes, followed by fellow soberanista, Luis Vega Ramos.

During its consideration, González asked to be included a co-author, supporting the initiative, but two other PNP co-authors missed the session.

It also represents our editorial policy and general consensus position on the Yearbook: 1.) Editorial work on yearbook 1993 consisted of SELECTING and COMPILING posted articles on major topics that were presented on Okyeame in 1993. Articles selected for inclusion are ones that convey the spirit, depth and breadth of the range of viewpoints expressed. As much as possible articles are presented in their original style and language. Minor changes in spelling, sentence construction or re-arrangement may have been done to improve the clarity of presentation. Some postings may have been rewritten by the original authors and/or with the editors to circumvent copyright laws. 2.) Editorial comments are clearly marked as such. 3.) Preliminary list of selected articles was posted on Okyeame for <b>general</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> Individual authors had up to MARCH 31, 1994 to withdraw their articles from inclusion or make minor modifications in consultations with the sectional editors. Changes that alter the tenor and character of the original debate, of which that posting was a part, could be rejected. The sectional editor exercised judgement in such matters. His decision, if need be, could be reviewed by the editorial committee. Final authority in such matters rested with the editorial committee.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} Faraday effect as a {{different}} source of B mode polarization. The E mode polarization is Faraday rotated provided a stochastic large-scale magnetic field is present prior to photon decoupling. In {{the first part}} of the paper we discuss the case where the tensor modes of the geometry are absent and we argue that the B mode recently detected by the Bicep 2 collaboration cannot be explained by a large-scale magnetic field rotating, through the Faraday effect, the well established E mode polarization. In this case, the observed temperature autocorrelations would be excessively distorted by the magnetic field. In the second part of the paper the formation of Faraday rotation is treated as a stationary, random and Markovian process with the aim of generalizing a set of scaling laws originally derived in the absence of the tensor modes of the geometry. We show that the scalar, vector and tensor modes of the brightness perturbations can all be Faraday rotated even if the vector and tensor parts of the effect have been neglected, so far, by focussing the attention on the scalar aspects of the problem. The mixing between the power spectra of the E mode and B mode polarizations involves a unitary transformation depending nonlinearly on the Faraday rotation rate. The present approach is suitable for a <b>general</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the polarization observables and of their frequency dependence.

40|$|The dissertation's {{evaluation}} of five mid-Victorian parishes, which were situated twelve {{miles from the}} centre of London, examined many characteristics of the inhabitants who dwelt there. It carried out investigations into population expansion, gender balance, social class profile, occupational composition, household structure and domestic service. By selecting and evaluating a multiplicity of information from a diverse range of local, regional and national sources, the thesis not only elucidated and enhanced the documentary record of the five parishes, but connected localised developments, for instance migration, social zoning and social mobility inclinations to the changes that occurred nationwide between the 1850 s and the 1880 s. The London Borough of Sutton's local studies' search room and The National Archives provided {{much of the information}} needed. A continuous research question posed throughout the thesis was {{the degree to which the}} urban expansion activities in the five parishes, or elsewhere, were in some ways similar. Locally, however, there were large parochial dissimilarities, which are, within the thesis, thoroughly analysed. Here, a <b>general</b> <b>scrutiny</b> revealed that two of the parishes, Sutton and Wallington, were quickly expanding urban areas with growing appeal to the middle-class professionals, whilst the other three, Cheam, Carshalton and, to a lesser extent, Beddington, display much slower economic and social changes. With the arrival of railway links and piped-water the disparity between the parishes became even greater. This appraisal was echoed in all the parishes' class profiles, employment and gender structures. As the 19 th century progressed, Sutton's relative geographical position, in relationship to central London, became of more crucial importance, as far as urban development was concerned. The thesis overall confirms the underlying research view that the higher than national average population rise between censuses, in a number of the five parishes, was closely linked with. the ease of access to railway transportation. The research has thrown some light on the somewhat differing suburbanisation processes within five distinctive parishes, and the effects of employing different types of research methods to reveal this. Urban data can now, perhaps, be more fruitfully considered in the light of this study...|$|R

40|$|Overview and {{scrutiny}} committees {{were intended}} to provide a counterbalance to executive decision-making.

Indeed, research indicates that scrutiny is - in some authorities - making a valuable contribution it? terms of policy review but is still,failing to hold the executive to account effectively. The relationship between scrutiny and performance management remains underdeveloped, whilst external scrutiny constitutes a marginal activity for most authorities.

40|$|The triple-bottom line of {{economic}} efficiency, environmental integrity and social equity {{is meant to}} be used to measure progress towards sustainable development.

The North Carolina Attorney General’s office requested clarification on May 28, 2008, and the Department of Homeland Security responded on July 9, 2008, stating The admissions to public post-secondary educational institutions {{is not one of the}} benefits regulated by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and is not a public benefit under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Therefore, the individual states must decide for themselves whether or not to admit illegal aliens into their public post-secondary institutions. States may bar or admit illegal aliens from enrolling in public post-secondary institutions either as a matter of policy or through legislation. With this in mind, the NCCCS board was still not sure on how they should formulate their next policy. They questioned themselves about whether or not they should bar all undocumented students from entering the post-secondary schools or allow them at the out-of-state tuition rate.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: SiO 2 {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications. Fumed silica, which consists of aggregated/agglomerated primary particles of several nm to tens of nm in diameter, is used in many common consumer products. Silica NPs are being developed for novel medical applications, and silica is also used to coat nanoparticles of other compositions. While no major health concerns have been raised regarding silica, NPs in <b>general</b> are under <b>scrutiny</b> regarding their potential risks for human health and the environment. Safety studies require a reliable method for tracing small concentrations of NPs, and radiolabelling is one method that offers significant advantages thanks to the high sensitivity and accuracy of radioactivity measurements. In this study we present a method of synthesising 56 Co radiolabelled SiO 2 NPs that can be used in such studies. The 56 Co was incorporated within the SiO 2 structure, in contrast to methods that use externally attached radiotracers. Methods: While other isotopes might also be used, 56 Co was selected as a suitable radiotracer as it has a relatively long half life (77 days) and emits well resolved -ray peaks of 847 keV and 1238 keV with high branching ratios (99. 9 % and 68 % respectively). It was produced via the nuclear reaction natFe(p,n) 56 Co, with a proton beam of 23. 5 MeV. Radiochemical separation of 56 Co from the Fe target was carried out by cation exchange columns with Dowex 1 -X 8 (Cl) resin, in order to produce a neutral 56 Co solution with a high recovery yield (93 %). The obtained pure solution was added to the ingredients for synthesis of silica NPs based on Stöber concept [1]. Various methods (see below) were used to characterise the silica NPs. JRC.

5000|$|The mid 1990s saw declining ratings. All soaps {{lost ground}} at this time, one reason being the O.J.

In a 2010 interview, Riche recalls regretting having announced the story ahead of time, saying she thought [...] "we'd made a big mistake by announcing it. We did a big press conference/announcement, and approximately 100,000 viewers tuned out almost immediately. (...) those 100,000 might still be watching today. If we had weaned them into it they might have stayed around to see what happens, and gotten involved in the story and stayed with it. (...) I imagine some tuned out because they thought it would be depressing when ultimately, thanks to Claire and her team, it was uplifting. So had we just let the storytelling play, I think we would have retained the audience." [...] Reception on the social storylines was positive; in April 1995, Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune deemed General Hospital as saving the soap genre. She described head writer Labine's impact: [...] "Labine resuscitated the careers of many veteran ensemble players on this soap, forsaking the hunk and babe ratings game. And simply by being so bold in the 1990s as to give viewers storylines that pack an emotional wallop, Labine did what no one else in daytime is doing right now: returning soap to its core of drama. While the other soaps bend to sponsor pressure or obsess on producers' personal agendas, 'General Hospital' is keeping this ailing genre alive."

" Yang published Selected Poems of W. B. Yeats in Chinese (1997), which immediately became popular and often cited by many. English Poems in Chinese Translation is Yang's latest work of translation, and is more ambitious than his Chinese Yeats, in that the range of poetry chosen covers works as early as Beowulf and "The Seafarer," and as late as Dylan Thomas's "Fern Hill. " While the five poems of Donne in Yang's book are indeed the latest ones {{in terms of the}} date of publication, the quality of Yang's Chinese Donne, compared with other translators' renderings of the English poet, seems to be the most erroneous of all as well. The emphasis of the present essay is on Yang's treatment of "The good-morrow" and the problems which the rendering itself reveals: Yang's understanding / misunderstanding of Early Modern English, the literal meanings of some of the lines of the poem, Chinese etymology, English rhyme scheme and syllabification on the translator's part, and how these may lead to the misunderstanding of Donne's lively and witty language on the reader's. The author believes that a close examination of Yang's rendering of "The good-morrow" serves as a survey of the available English Renaissance poetry in Chinese translation in <b>general,</b> and a <b>scrutiny</b> of all other Chinese translations of Donne in specific. If a complete corpus of Donne's works in Chinese appears in future years, anyone concerned about a future for Donne studies in the Chinese-speaking societies now should pay more attention to even just a small number of the latest Chinese translations of Donne's poems. 詩人楊牧（王靖獻∕葉珊）於《聯合文學》 2004 年 5 月號發表〈文藝復與時代的英詩：以抒情詩?主〉譯詩數首，現已收錄於洪範書店 2007 年之《英詩漢譯集》，其中包含英國詩人鄧約翰(John Donne, 1572 - 1631) 之短詩五首。楊牧之譯葉慈(Yeats) 詩有若干疑點，學界中已有臺大外文系彭鏡禧教授?文評之。此番楊牧再提譯筆，對「英詩中譯」這份"labour of love"雖有推助之功，但若細讀其譯文，則深覺其中仍有可議之處。本文針對楊牧所譯的〈良辰〉(The Good Morrow) 一詩，細說其譯文之缺失（如字面之錯譯、措辭、韻腳等方面），並提供作者自己及其他名家的譯文，以利學界比較參照，提升臺灣「英詩中譯」之水準...|$|R
40|$|The Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology bring {{together}} scientists {{from all over}} the world to present and evaluate new data and ideas in rapidly moving areas of biological research. Each year, a topic is chosen that appears to be at a stage where <b>general</b> and intensive <b>scrutiny</b> and review are needed. Criteria for selection of topics are numerous, but they include the rate of progress in a given field, how recent research is highlighting connections between fundamental biological mechanisms, and the potential applications of the new discoveries to human health and society. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory selected the theme of The Biology of Plants for the historic 77 th Symposium in the series. Plants are integral to human well being, and many species have been domesticated for more than 10, 000 years. Evidence of plant scientific investigation and classification can be found in ancient texts from cultures around the world (Chinese, Indian, Greco-Roman, Muslim, etc.), whereas early modern botany can be traced to the late 15 th and early 16 th centuries in Europe. During the past several decades, plant biology has been revolutionized first by molecular biology and then by the genomic era. The model organism Arabidopsis thaliana has proved to be an invaluable tool for investigation into fundamental processes in plant biology, many of which share commonalities with animal biology. Plant-specific processes from reproduction to immunity and second messengers have also yielded to extensive investigation. With the genomes of more than 30 plant species now available and many more planned in the near future, the impact on our understanding of plant evolution and biology continues to grow. Our increased ability to engineer plant species to a variety of ends may provide novel solutions to ensure adequate and reliable food production and renewable energy even as climate change impacts our environment. The decision to focus the 2012 Symposium on plant science reflected the enormous research progress achieved in recent years andwas intended to provide a broad synthesis of the current state of the field, setting the stage for future discoveries and application. This is the first Symposium in this historic series that focused exclusively on the botanical sciences. The Symposium spanned a broad range of areas of investigation including genetics, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, developmental biology, physiology, and population/ evolution studies at levels ranging from the single cell to the entire organismand from single genes to genomes; plant-specific processes and pathways featured broadly throughout the meeting. Effort was made to balance fundamental biological discoveries with applications relevant to societal well being including improved crops, fuel, and habitat...|$|R
