5|$|The Judge {{was always}} {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, with his sharp jaw and shock of white hair, and people always crowded into his courtroom, knowing there would be something <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>There</b> were few dull moments.|$|E
5|$|In 1670 the Duke of Lauderdale {{commissioned}} Bruce to remodel Thirlestane Castle, his 16th-century tower {{house in}} the Border country. Bruce, working with King's master mason Robert Mylne, extended the building with new corner pavilions and a new entrance, and re-planned the interior. Lauderdale continued to employ Bruce, often working closely with Lord Haltoun, Lauderdale's brother, during the 1670s, on his homes at Brunstane near Edinburgh, and Lethington (later renamed Lennoxlove), as well as commissioning a design for new gates at his English property, Ham House, near London, in 1671. At Ham Bruce may have had further involvement with the remodelling works <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>there,</b> {{under the direction of}} the English architect William Samwell. While engaged at Thirlestane, Bruce also designed the nearby Lauder Kirk, his only complete church. One of very few 17th century cruciform-plan churches in Scotland, it may have been inspired by François Mansart's similar church at Balleroy in France.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{released}} to positive reviews. Mid Day said, [...] "The film appeals to its target audience {{because it has}} everything they expect from Gujjubhai, {{and in spite of}} the crazy <b>goings</b> <b>on,</b> <b>there</b> is no overacting and very little slapstick." [...] DeshGujarat said, [...] "Siddharth Randeria's Gujjubhai the great fully entertains with lots of laugh out loud moments throughout the film." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{a review}} of the Family Guy, Volume Four DVD collection, Mike Drucker of IGN singled out [...] "Peterotica" [...] and [...] "PTV" [...] as [...] "new classics." [...] In {{a review of}} the episode, Bob Sassone of TV Squad commented on the scene where Peter acts as a {{landlord}} over a rat, writing, [...] "to be honest, I'm not even sure what the hell was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>there,</b> it was so disturbing." [...] Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews criticized the episode, writing that [...] "the story is thin and the laughter absent." [...] The episode sparked controversy over a depiction of the Charwoman cleaning character, a character used by Carol Burnett [...] in The Carol Burnett Show that was used in the episode without her consent. Burnett sued, but the case was later dismissed.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was critical of}} the episode's intricacy, writing, [...] "'The Amazing Maleeni' is a convoluted episode that ultimately lacks verve and excitement. Even if one can {{figure out what is}} <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>there</b> remains the question of how much, or even whether, to care." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two stars out of five. The two noted that, had the episode used real magic tricks instead of [...] "resort to CGI, the episode would have been much more than a simple [...] "cheat". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the fact that the explanation behind Maleeni turning his head around 360 degrees was never satisfactorily explained. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris compared the episode's plot to the 1999 movie Arlington Road, noting that while [...] "the scheme is fun to watch while it unfolds, [...] in the end, it's not credible; too much is left open to chance for it really to happen." ...|$|E

500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>there.</b> We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me."

Spitfire had joined the fleet by early August and participated in some of Wynkoop's early patrolling of the lake. Benedict Arnold was originally sent to Skenesborough to expedite the boat construction <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>there,</b> but by August 1776, he was sent to take over command of the fleet.

2500|$|Despite having Kevin Harvick {{filling his}} {{rearview}} mirror, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. {{was able to}} maintain the lead to complete the first Pocono sweep since Denny Hamlin did it in 2006.

[...] "Today we were able to capitalize on it and get a good finish." [...] We had a fast car all day. Steve's strategy was perfect at the end.

Sometime during this visit is the incident where William Randall delivered grape juice for `Abdu'l-Bahá.|$|E
2500|$|Médecins Sans Frontières said no Taliban {{fighters were}} in the compound. Christopher Stokes, general {{director}} of Médecins Sans Frontières, {{said in a statement}} late 4 October 2015: [...] "MSF is disgusted by the recent statements coming from some Afghanistan government authorities justifying the attack on its hospital in Kunduz. These statements imply that Afghan and U.S. forces working together decided to raze to the ground a fully functioning hospital– with more than 180 staff and patients inside– because they claim that members of the Taliban were present. This amounts to an admission of a war crime." [...] Stokes said, [...] "If there was a major military operation <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>there,</b> our staff would have noticed. And that wasn't the case when the strikes occurred." [...] On 5 October, the organization released a statement saying, [...] "Their [...] description of the attack keeps changing -- from collateral damage, to a tragic incident, to now attempting to pass responsibility to the Afghanistan government...There can be no justification for this horrible attack." ...|$|E

The way I've been playing free music, with my constituents, doesn't really follow those guidelines. When we play, it's very well put together, in actuality.

2500|$|General Murray {{also worked}} for a {{division}} of Lockheed Skunk Works. He {{was assigned to the}} project development of [...] "The Black Missile". This was the first missile that was undetectable by radar. It was being built in a large tan-colored hangar located on the north corner of The Burbank Airport, located in Burbank, California. The hangar was owned by Lockheed Skunk Works Division. It was accessed via San Fernando Rd. This hangar was not the typical hangar. It was larger than normal and heavily guarded. There were no signs of what was really <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>there.</b> General Murray worked there daily, entering the door {{on the west side of}} the hangar. He explained, upon entering the hangar there was an enormous black curtain that was drawn across the center of the hangar, splitting the work space. He stayed on his side and the other workers stayed on their side. They never saw each other or looked beyond the curtain. General Murray was advised that the other side of the curtain contained a highly classified development, as his project wasn't classified enough. Years later, General Murray discovered what was going on behind the curtain. He was told the first stealth aircraft was in its early stages of development and testing. Murray declined to speak about which aircraft. The hangar was torn down in the year 2002, closing another door to an amazing piece of history.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Walter Phillips, who {{was present}} at two of the {{meetings}} in Jinzhou, wrote: [...] "It was at Chinchow that I first {{came into contact with}} the Revival. Meetings had been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>there</b> for a week, hence, I was ushered into the heart of things unprepared, and in candour, I must add, with a strong temperamental prejudice against 'revival hysterics' in every form, so that mine is at least an unbiased witness. At once, on entering the church, one was conscious of something unusual. The place was crowded to the door, and tense, reverent attention sat on every face. The very singing was vibrant with new joy and vigour [...] [...] [...] The people knelt for prayer, silent at first, but soon one here and another there began to pray aloud. The voices grew and gathered volume and blended into a great wave of united supplication that swelled till it was almost a roar, and died down again into an undertone of weeping. Now I understood why the floor was so wet - [...] it was wet with pools of tears! The very air seemed electric -- I speak in all seriousness [...] - and strange thrills coursed up and down one's body. Then above the sobbing, in strained, choking tones, a man began to make public confession. Words of mine will fail to describe the awe and terror and pity of these confessions. It was not so much the enormity of the sins disclosed, or the depths of iniquity sounded, that shocked one[...] [...] [...] It was the agony of the penitent, his groans and cries, and voice shaken with sobs; it was the sight of men forced to their feet, and, in spite of their struggles, impelled, as it seemed, to lay bare their hearts that moved one and brought the smarting tears to one's own eyes. Never have I experienced anything more heart breaking, more nerve racking than the spectacle of those souls stripped naked before their fellows. So for hour after hour it went on, till the strain was almost more than the onlooker could bear. Now it was a big, strong farmer groveling on the floor, smiting his head on the bare boards as he wailed unceasingly, 'Lord! Lord!' Now a shrinking woman in a voice scarce above a whisper, now a wee laddie from the school, with the tears streaking his piteous grimy little face, as he sobbed out: 'I cannot love my enemies. Last week I stole a farthing from my teacher. I am always fighting and cursing. I beseech the pastor, elders and deacons to pray for me.' And then again would swell that wonderful deep organ tone of united prayer. And ever as the prayer sank again the ear caught a dull undertone of quiet sobbing, of desperate entreaty from men and women, who, lost to their surroundings, were wrestling for peace." ...|$|E
