5|$|In June 1985, {{three months}} after the miners {{admitted}} defeat and ended their strike, Benn introduced the Miners' Amnesty (General Pardon) Bill into the Commons, which would have extended an amnesty to all miners imprisoned during the strike. This would have included two men convicted of murder (later reduced to manslaughter) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of David Wilkie, a taxi driver driving a non-striking miner to work in South Wales during the strike.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E
5|$|The Mercians, {{who participated}} in Edwin's defeat in 633, seem to have {{presented}} an obstacle to Oswald's authority south of the Humber, {{although it has been}} generally thought that Oswald dominated Mercia to some degree after Heavenfield. It may have been to appease Oswald that Penda had Eadfrith, a captured son of Edwin (and thus a dynastic rival of Oswald), killed, although {{it is also possible that}} Penda had his own motives <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing.</b>|$|E

5|$|Collins {{has said}} that the main {{inspiration}} for The Hunger Games trilogy came from the classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were then put in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided {{to put an end to}} the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the third group of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.|$|E

Munday successfully appealed against his proscription. Midgegooroo, Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley. On 17 May, Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River. After a brief, informal trial, he was executed by firing squad. Yagan remained at large for over two months.|$|E

Before he can, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to preserve Dent's heroic image by holding Batman responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> spree.

5|$|James's father, Darnley, {{was murdered}} on 10 February 1567 at Kirk o' Field, Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Rizzio. James {{inherited}} his father's titles of Duke of Albany and Earl of Ross. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her. In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in Loch Leven Castle; {{she never saw}} her son again. She was forced to abdicate on 24 July 1567 in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother, James Stewart, Earl of Moray, as regent.|$|E

In response to international calls, on 24 October Jibril announced that a commission would investigate Gaddafi's death. On 25 October, the NTC announced that Gaddafi had been buried at an unidentified location in the desert. Seeking vengeance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing,</b> Gaddafist sympathizers fatally wounded one of those who had captured Gaddafi, Omran Shaaban, near Bani Walid in September 2012.|$|E

Only five ever went to trial, two of those being acquitted. Convictions were handed down against Taylor's Secretary of State Caleb Powers, Henry Youtsey, and Jim Howard. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor Taylor, could stay in office. Youtsey was an alleged intermediary, and Howard, who {{was said to have}} been in Frankfort to seek a pardon from Taylor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of a man in a family feud, was accused of being the actual assassin.|$|E

5|$|Under Hitler's {{leadership}} and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime {{was responsible for}} the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (sub-humans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians {{died as a result of}} military action in the European theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare and the casualties constituted the deadliest conflict in human history.|$|E

Humberto had been an activist in the then-illegal Communist Party of Spain and had been arrested and jailed following a student demonstration in 1970. His parents claimed that he had been in Portugal {{at the time of the}} killing and that one of the main witnesses was not allowed to attend the trial.

When Machi Tobaye, Lamiroir's pianist, is accused <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing,</b> Apollo, through an extensive investigation, discovers that Machi {{and one of the}} Gavinners, Detective Daryan Crescend, conspired to smuggle contraband into the country, and that Letouse, in reality an undercover Interpol agent, was murdered to cover it up. The case nearly falls apart {{due to a lack of}} decisive evidence, but Apollo is able to squeeze a confession out of Daryan by threatening to have Machi testify.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{accounts}} of the Irish annals, English and Scandinavian writers appear to see Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray: this is clear from their descriptions of the meeting with Cnut in 1027, before the death of Malcolm mac Máil Brigti. Malcolm was followed as king or earl by his brother Gillecomgan, husband of Gruoch, a granddaughter of King Kenneth III. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Gille Coemgáin in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had a cause for feud {{in the killing of}} his father in 1020, Malcolm too had reason to see Gille Coemgáin dead. Not only had Gillecomgan's ancestors killed many of Malcolm's kin, but Gillecomgan and his son Lulach might be rivals for the throne. Malcolm had no living sons, and the threat to his plans for the succession was obvious. As a result, the following year Gruoch's brother or nephew, who might have eventually become king, was killed by Malcolm.|$|E
5|$|Hindman's assassins {{were never}} caught, and many {{theories}} regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly {{confessed to the}} crime, saying the murder {{was part of a}} larger plot to seek revenge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Lee Morrison, a black person from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not fit with the facts of the murder, and his statements were dismissed from the investigation. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the revolt, the Aćimović administration encouraged 545 or 546 prominent and influential Serbs to sign the Appeal to the Serbian Nation, {{which was published in}} the German-authorised Belgrade daily newspaper Novo vreme on 13 and 14 August. Those that signed included three Serbian Orthodox bishops, four archpriests, and at least 81 professors from the University of Belgrade, although according to the historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch, many of the signatories were placed under pressure to sign, and Professor Jozo Tomasevich notes that many of those who signed it were known for their leftist views. The appeal called upon the Serbian population to help the authorities in every way in their struggle against the communist rebels, and called for loyalty to the Nazis, condemning the Partisan-led resistance as unpatriotic. The Serbian Bar Association unanimously supported the Appeal. The Aćimović administration also appealed for rebels {{to return to their homes}} and announced bounties <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of rebels and their leaders. Aćimović also gave orders that the wives of communists and their sons older than 16 years of age be arrested and held, and the Germans burned their houses and imposed curfews.|$|E
