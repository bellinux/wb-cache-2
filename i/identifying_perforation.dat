40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONNo {{consensus}} exists regarding definitive {{management of}} colonic perforation in Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), with various authors advocating different operative techniques. Spontaneous colonic perforation is a recognised complication of vascular-type EDS (type IV), with many reported {{cases in the}} literature. No such cases have been reported concerning classical-type EDS (type I/II). PRESENTATION OF CASEA 55 -year-old male with {{a family history of}} EDS presented with acute lower abdominal pain and signs of localised peritonitis. Following resuscitation, computerised tomography <b>identified</b> <b>perforation</b> of a sigmoid diverticulum with localised intraperitoneal air. Considering the potential complications associated with laparotomy in a patient with EDS, a trial of conservative management was undertaken including image-guided drainage of a mesenteric abscess. Intensive care monitoring, nutritional support and intravenous antibiotics also facilitated successful non-operative management. Following discharge, molecular studies confirmed COL 5 A 1 mutation, and a diagnosis of classical Ehlers–Danlos syndrome was established. DISCUSSIONThis is the first reported case of successful conservative management of colonic diverticular perforation in a patient with classical Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSIONEDS is highly significant in the surgical context, with the causative genetic factors serving to further complicate the course of surgical intervention. In the absence of consensus regarding best surgical management, due consideration should be given to non-operative management of benign colonic perforation...|$|R

40|$|This Position Paper is an {{official}} {{statement of the}} European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It addresses the diagnosis and management of iatrogenic perforation occurring during diagnostic or therapeutic digestive endoscopic procedures. Main recommendations 1 ESGE recommends that each center implements a written policy regarding the management of iatrogenic perforation, including the definition of procedures that carry {{a high risk of}} this complication. This policy should be shared with the radiologists and surgeons at each center. 2 In the case of an endoscopically <b>identified</b> <b>perforation,</b> ESGE recommends that the endoscopist reports: its size and location with a picture; endoscopic treatment that might have been possible; whether carbon dioxide or air was used for insufflation; and the standard report information. 3 ESGE recommends that symptoms or signs suggestive of iatrogenic perforation after an endoscopic procedure should be carefully evaluated and documented, possibly with a computed tomography (CT) scan, in order to prevent any diagnostic delay. 4 ESGE recommends that endoscopic closure should be considered {{depending on the type of}} perforation, its size, and the endoscopist expertise available at the center. A switch to carbon dioxide insufflation, the diversion of luminal content, and decompression of tension pneumoperitoneum or tension pneumothorax should also be done. 5 After closure of an iatrogenic perforation using an endoscopic method, ESGE recommends that further management should be based on the estimated success of the endoscopic closure and on the general clinical condition of the patient. In the case of no or failed endoscopic closure of the iatrogenic perforation, and in patients whose clinical condition is deteriorating, hospitalization and surgical consultation are recommende...|$|R
30|$|There is {{currently}} a trend to avoid a radical approach to perforated peptic ulcer, especially in emergency cases. The two main goals of the surgical procedure for perforated peptic ulcer are to close the perforation and treat the peritonitis [8].

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although diverticular {{disease of}} the colon is frequent, {{perforated}} diverticulitis causing subcutaneous emphysema is a uncommon entity. We wish to present this extremely rare case of perforated colonic diverticulum in the subcutaneous tissue, {{which is the first}} one that we have encountered in our practice, along with the accompanying diagnostic and therapeutic issues and a review of the literature. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the case of an 83 -year-old man who admitted to the emergency room due to an abdominal subcutaneous emphysema. Physical examination revealed a severe subcutaneous emphysema especially in the left iliac fossa and abdominal pain. An urgent contrast enhanced abdominal CT scan showed multiple diverticula in the sigmoid colon and multiple air bubbles in the subcutaneous tissue. The exploratory laparotomy <b>identified</b> a <b>perforation</b> of diverticular in subcutaneous tissue. Forty centimeters of colon were resected. The subcutaneous emphysema resolved without specific treatment. The postoperative period was uncomplicated. DISCUSSION: Subcutaneous emphysema of anterior abdomen wall is an obvious physical sign but its etiology is complex to determine and may be potentially lethal. The pathophysiological mechanism involved is the emergence of a pressure gradient between the peritoneum and surrounding structures, causing rupture of the anterior abdominal wall, allowing gas from a perforation to diffuse along tissue planes. CONCLUSION: This physical sign may be of especial value in elderly patient groups amongst whom perforation may be less clinically obvious. General surgeons should bear in mind this rare complication of colonic diverticulosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to emphasize the performances of spiral CT (HCT) and multidetector-row CT (MDCT) as very effective imaging modalities for the diagnosis of intestinal perforations caused by calcified alimentary foreign bodies. Eight sites of perforations of the ileum by ingested foreign bodies were found in seven patients-one patient presenting with two separate sites of perforation. The diagnosis was successfully made by HCT in four patients and MDCT in the remaining three. Involuntarily and generally unconsciously ingested chicken and fish bones were the implicated calcified foreign bodies. The acute clinical presentations were nonspecific, mimicking more common acute abdominal conditions. A thickened intestinal segment (7 / 8 sites) with localized pneumoperitoneum (4 / 8 sites), surrounded by fatty infiltration (4 / 8 sites) and associated with already present or developing obstruction or sub-obstruction (5 / 7 patients) were the most common CT signs, but the definite diagnosis was clearly made by {{the identification of the}} calcified foreign bodies (7 / 7 patients). In each patient, this identification was only possible thanks to the scrupulous analysis of very thin overlapping reconstructions obtained not only in the perforation sites (6 / 8 sites), but also through the entire abdomen (2 / 8 sites).

40|$|Abstract Background In the United States, transjugular renal biopsies {{using the}} Quickcore™ side cut needle system have {{previously}} been described primarily for transjugular renal biopsy {{in patients with}} concurrent liver and kidney disease. Methods We describe transjugular renal biopsy with the Quickcore™ system in 9 patients with nephrotic syndrome and contraindications to percutaneous renal biopsy, who underwent biopsy between 23 October 1996 and 12 April 2001. The most common contraindication was oral anticoagulation with coumadin (40 %). Other contraindications included horseshoe kidney, severe renal failure, and spontaneous coagulopathy. A 62 cm straight catheter and 60 cm side-cut Quickcore™ biopsy needle were used to obtain cortical tissue. Packing of the biopsy tract with Gelfoam™ was used for venographically <b>identified</b> capsular <b>perforation.</b> Results Ten procedures were performed on 9 patients with one requiring re-biopsy (5 % of all renal biopsies performed at our institution). There were 9 transjugular renal biopsy and one combined liver-kidney biopsy. A mean of 4 ± 2 passes were made, {{with a mean of}} 3 ± 1 cores obtained per procedure. Histologic diagnosis was made in 90 % of biopsies and in 100 % of patients. Two patients developed transient hydronephrosis associated with gross hematuria; both required transfusion.

40|$|Introduction: In blunt {{abdominal}} trauma, lesions of {{the small}} bowell and mesentery are often underdiagnosed; although unusual, they represent the third most injured organ, with increasing morbidity and mortality. Presentation of case: The authors present {{the case of a}} 68 years old male, admitted to the emergency department after being hit by a bale of straw, weighing around 300  kg, in the abdomen. After successful ressuscitation, a CT scan was performed, suggesting hemoperitoneum because of vascular lesion of the right colon bleeding. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, confirming the presence of blood in the abdominal cavity and <b>identifying</b> jejunal <b>perforation,</b> an apparently innocent hematoma {{of the small}} bowel mesentery (beside the bowel wall) distally to the first lesion and a laceration of the sigmoid serosa; a segmental jejunal resection and suture of the colon serosa were performed. In the early post-operative period, an enteric discharge was noticed, mandating surgical reexploration; a previously unnoticed bowel perforation, in the mesenteric border where the hematoma was identified, justified an additional enterectomy, after what the patients recovery progressed uneventfully. Discussion: In this case, a sudden increase in abdominal pressure could explain that missed rupture of the mesenteric border of the jejunum, also causing the mesenteric hematoma, or, in spite of that, a state of low perfusion could have lead to total wall ischemia of an already irrigation compromised segment. Only noted after surgical exploration, despite prior evaluation with a computed tomography. Small bowell and mesenteric injuries are potentially missed due to decreased exploratory laparotomies for blunt abdominal trauma. Conclusion: Although uncommon, small bowel and mesenteric injuries are associated with high morbidity and mortality. High clinical suspicion is essential for an early diagnosi...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} is to compare primary repair vs intestinal resection in cases of intestinal typhoid perforations. In addition, we hypothesised the usefulness of laparostomy for the early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} complications. Methods: 111 patients with acute peritonitis underwent emergency laparotomy: number of perforations, distance of perforations from the ileocaecal valve, and type of surgery performed were recorded. A laparostomy was then created and explored every 48 to 72 hours. The patients were then divided into two groups according to the surgical technique adopted at the initial laparotomy: primary repair (Group A) or intestinal resection with anastomosis (Group B). Clinical data, intraoperative findings, complications and mortality were evaluated and compared for each group. Results: In 104 / 111 patients we found intestinal perforations, multiple in 47. 1 % of patients. 75 had primary repair (Group A) and 26 had intestinal resection with anastomosis (Group B). Group B patients had more perforations than patients in Group A (p = 0. 0001). At laparostomy revision, the incidence of anastomotic dehiscence was greater than that of primary repair dehiscence (p = 0. 032). The incidence of new perforations was greater in Group B than in Group A (p = 0. 01). Group B correlates with a higher morbility and with a higher number of laparostomy revisions than Group A (p = 0. 005). There was no statistical difference in terms of mortality between Group A and Group B. Presence of pus in the abdominal cavity at initial laparotomy correlates with significantly higher mortality (p = 0. 0001). Conclusions: Resection and anastomosis shows greater morbidity than primary repair. Laparostomy revision makes it possible to rapidly <b>identify</b> new <b>perforations</b> and anastomotic or primary repair dehiscences; although this approach may seem aggressive, the number of operations was greater in patients who had a favourable outcome, and does not correlate with mortality...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{ultimate}} goal of rhinoplasty is to achieve a controllable, reliable and an aesthetically pleasing result. Various approaches and instruments have been introduced for the correction of the bony walls of the nose to improve predictability of the procedure and to minimize the associated trauma. We conducted a cadaveric study comparing the results of osteotomy of the nasal wall using a diamond surgical burr with those using a 2 -mm osteotome. Material and methods Bilateral osteotomy of the nasal wall was performed on 10 cadavers. The 20 lateral nasal osteotomies were carried out on 7 females and 3 males of an age range between 61 - 91  years. A 2 -mm osteotome was used percutaneously to perforate the lateral nasal wall of the right side. On the left side a 2 -mm diamond surgical burr was introduced via an intraoral approach to thin out the lateral nasal wall. The in-fracture of the nasal bone was accomplished by controlled finger pressure. The nasal mucosa was inspected endoscopically and also dissected to <b>identify</b> any <b>perforations</b> or lacerations. The pattern of nasal fracture {{and the presence of}} any fragmentation of the bony segments were assessed clinically. Results The in-fracturing of the nasal bone was accomplished by gentle pressure on the left side, but required more force on the contra lateral side. On the left side the in-fractured lateral nasal wall remained as one piece and no irregularities were seen. On the right side 3 - 5 bony fragments of irregular sizes and shapes were detected. There were 3 - 4 tears of the nasal mucosa, where the osteotome was applied. However, no mucosal tears were detected at the side, where the surgical burr was used.

It is mostly seen in immunocompromised and debilitated patients [1]. A 50 year old male patient was admitted in emergency surgery ward with complaints of abdominal pain and high grade fever for two days. There was no past history of diabetes, tuberculosis, surgery or any drug intake. On general examination patient was febrile with pulse rate 126 /min. and blood pressure 94 / 60 mm Hg.

40|$|Background/Aims: Gastrointestinal {{perforation}} during endoscopy {{is a rare}} but severe complication. Most instances {{occur during}} colonoscopy. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the cases of 23 patients with iatrogenic perforation (13 women, 10 men; mean age = 71 years [range, 49 - 89]). We <b>identified</b> 6 esogastric <b>perforations,</b> 2 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) -related perforations, and 15 colonic perforations. Demographics, type and aim of endoscopy, mechanism of perforation, delay of treatment, operative procedure, postoperative hospital stay, and mortality rate were analyzed. Results: Three perforations occurred during di-agnostic gastroscopy and 3 during therapeutic gastroscopy. ERCP-related perforations occurred during therapeutic procedures. Nine colonic perforations occurred during interventional colonoscopy. ERCP-related perforations always required laparotomy. For esogastric perforations, surgical treatment usually required laparotomy; only two patients (33 %) could be managed by laparoscopy. In contrast, colon perforations could be managed by a laparoscopic approach (suturing and drainage or by laparoscopic resection) in 86. 6 % of cases. Overall mortality was 13 % and occurred exclusively after esogastric perforation. Conclusion: Most gastrointestinal perforations occurred during therapeutic colonoscopy; these perforations could be treated by laparoscopy in most cases. Esogastric perforations and perforations after ERCP are rare and must be treated on a case-by-case basis; in most cases, laparotomy is required. © H. G. E. Update Medical Publishing S. A.

40|$|Introduction: Appendiceal {{mucocele}} is {{a relatively}} rare condition characterized by progressive dilation of the appendix caused by intraluminal accumulation of mucoid substance. Its incidence is 0. 07 - 0, 63 % of all appendectomies performed. Case report: We report {{the case of a}} 70 -year-old man who came to our observation with gravative pain in right lower abdominal region. A computed tomography abdominal scan revealed a cystic/tubular structure like an appendicular mass with wall enhancement but without calcifications suggestive of a mucocele. Into peritoneal cavity we found profuse mucinous material with a 1, 5 cm size parietal nodule. We also <b>identified</b> a free <b>perforation</b> of the cecum with consensual spillage of gelatinous material mimicking a pseudomyxoma peritonei. We decided to perform a right hemicolectomy with excision of peritoneal lesion. Discussion: The controversy in the pathologic terminology can give rise to a clinical dilemma in terms of the management and follow-up plans. For mucosal hyperplasia and cystadenoma simple appendectomy is curative. Only in case of large base of implantation it may be necessary the resection of the ileum and caecum or right hemicolectomy. In case of mucinous cystoadenocarcinoma authors perform a right hemicolectomy. Conclusion: Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms are different pathological entities. The correct surgical management depends on size and location of lesion. A preoperative diagnosis is obviously needed in order to perform the correct treatment. CT abdominal scan is the better diagnostic tool, but different authors show their inability to reach a preoperative diagnosis in the larger majority of cases...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the incidence of free perforation among Korean patients with CD. Methods: The CrOhn&# 39;s disease cliNical NEtwork and CohorT (CONNECT) study was conducted nationwide in Korea, and patients who were diagnosed with CD between 1982 and 2008 were included in this retrospective study. We investigated the incidence of free perforation among these patients and their clinical characteristics. Results: A total of 1346 patients were analyzed and 88 patients (6. 5 %) were <b>identified</b> with free <b>perforation</b> in CD. The mean age of the free perforation group was 31. 8 +/- 13. 0 years, which was significantly higher than that of the non-perforated group (27. 5 +/- 12. 1 years) (p = 0. 004). Free perforation was the presenting sign of CD in 46 patients (52 %). Of the 94 perforations that were present in 88 patients, 81 involved the ileum. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined that free perforation was significantly associated with being aged ?= 30 years at diagnosis (OR 2. 082, p = 0. 002) and bowel strictures (OR 1. 982, p = 0. 004). The mortality rate in the free perforation group was significantly higher (4. 5 %) than that in the non-perforated group (0. 6 %) (p ? 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopy is used {{increasingly}} for {{the management}} of acute abdominal conditions. For many years, previous abdominal surgery and intestinal obstruction have been regarded as contraindications to laparoscopy because there is an increased risk of iatrogenic bowel perforation. The role of laparoscopy in acute small bowel obstruction remains unclear. METHODS: Since 1995, data from patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery have been entered prospectively into a database. Patients who underwent surgery before 1995 were added retrospectively to the same database. The charts of all patients treated surgically for mechanical small bowel obstruction were reviewed. Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with success or failure, especially intraoperative complications, conversion, and postoperative morbidity. Stepwise logistic regression was used to assess for independent variables. RESULTS: This study included 83 patients (56 women and 27 men) {{with a mean age of}} 56 years (range, 17 - 91 years). Conversion was necessary in 36 cases (43 %). Laparoscopy alone was successful in 47 patients (57 %). Intraoperative complications were noted in 16 % and postoperative complications in 31 % of the patients. Eight reoperations (9 %) were necessary. Mortality was 2. 4 %. Duration of surgery (p < 0. 001) and a bowel diameter exceeding 4 cm (p = 0. 02) were predictors of conversion. No risk factor for intraoperative complication was <b>identified.</b> Accidental bowel <b>perforation</b> (p = 0. 008) and the need for conversion (p = 0. 009) were the only independent factors associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic management of small bowel obstruction is possible in roughly 60 % of the patients selected for this approach. Morbidity is lower, resumption of a normal diet is faster, and hospital stay is shorter than with patients requiring conversion. No clear predictor of success or failure was identified, but intraoperative complications must be avoided. If the surgeon is widely experienced in advanced laparoscopic surgery and there is a liberal conversion policy, laparoscopy is a valuable alternative to conventional surgery in the management of acute small bowel obstructio...|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} healthy 22 -year-old gentlemen {{was referred}} to the surgical department following acute onset epigastric pain. The initial onset of pain was followed by an episode of vomiting and wretching lasting an hour. On examina-tion, although the abdomen was tender in the epigastrium {{there was no evidence}} of peritonitis. Crepitus was evident in the neck and anterior chest wall due to extensive sub-cutaneous emphysema. Plain radiographs illustrated linear lucencies tracking in the neck and chest, but no pneumot-horax or free intra-abdominal air. CT illustrated marked subcutaneous emphysema throughout the mediastinum and neck (fi gures 1 and 2). Furthermore free air was identi-fi ed in the spinal canal. Gastroscopy and contrast swallow did not <b>identify</b> any oesophageal <b>perforation.</b> After further careful history taking, the patient admitted cocaine abuse. The patient was treated conservatively and symptoms resolved after 48 h. The mechanism of cocaine-induced subcutaneous emphysema is believed to be secondary to barotrauma; after deep inhalation and Valsalva maneouvre in order to increase uptake and the euphoriant effect, or cough triggered by the sniffed substance. This resulting increased intra-alveolar pressure causes rupture of a dis-tended alveolus into the lung interstitium. Air then dis-sects along the pulmonary vasculature toward the hilum and then extravasates into the posterior mediastinum. It may then travel through the neural formamina into the epidural space. Air thus freely communicates via the neu-ral foramina and collects in the epidural space. 1 – 3 This case illustrates a previously unreported complication of cocaine use and highlights the diffi culty in differentiating between oesophageal perforation which produces similar clinical and radiological appearances. Learning points ▶ Pneumomediastinum as a result of oesophageal perforation carries a signifi cantly poorer prognosis then following drug abuse, with death rates of between 10 % and 60 %. Thus it is crucial to carefully rule out gastrointestinal ▶ perforation as a cause in order to implement appropriate management immediately...|$|R
40|$|The {{desert climate}} is endowed by clear sky conditions, {{providing}} {{an excellent opportunity}} for optimum utilization of natural light in daylighting building indoor spaces. However, the sunny conditions of the desert skies, in countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, result in the admittance of direct solar radiation, which leads to thermal discomfort and the incidence of undesired glare. One type of shading systems {{that is used to}} permit daylight while controlling solar penetration is " Solar Screens" Very little research work addressed different design aspects of external Solar Screens and their influence on daylighting performance, especially in desert conditions, although these screens proved their effectiveness in controlling solar radiation in traditional buildings throughout history. This paper reports on the outcomes of an investigation that studied the influence of perforation percentage of Solar Screens on daylighting performance in a typical residential living room of a building in a desert location. The objective was to <b>identify</b> minimum <b>perforation</b> percentage of screen openings that provides adequate illuminance levels in design-specific cases and all-year-round. Research work was divided into three stages. Stage one focused on the analysis of daylighting illuminance levels in specific dates and times, while the second stage was built on the results of the first stage, and addressed year round performance using Dynamic Daylight Performance Metrics (DDPMs). The third stage addressed the possibility of incidence of glare in specific cases where illuminance levels where found very high in some specific points during the analysis of first stage. The research examined the daylighting performance in an indoor space with a number of assumed fixed experimentation parameters that were chosen to represent the principal features of a typical residential living room located in a desert environment setting. Stage one experiments demonstrated that the screens fulfilled the requirements of the majority of tested cases. Illuminance levels in the examined residential space were satisfactory in 83 % of the near zone cases and 53 % in the mid-length zone, while the far zone suites 40 % of the cases. Screen influence on daylighting was found to be very much dependent on the orientation of the window and time of the day. In stage two, the percentage of annual " Daylight Availability" was very much related to screen perforation percentage. As perforation percentage decreased, the percentage of Daylit and Over lit spaces decreased. At the same time, Partially Daylit areas of the space increased with similar percentages irrespective of the orientation. As a result of the twofold research stages, it is recommended to utilize a minimum of 80 % perforation percentages for spaces similar to the tested case in the South orientation. In stage three, an initial investigation suggests that the use of screens can significantly reduce the occurrence of glare phenomena. Also, it is suggested to study the efficiency of designing Solar Screens that have non-uniform perforation ratios. These could prove useful in improving the illuminance levels in the mid-length and far zones of the unsatisfactory cases. In conclusion, minimum perforation percentages for Solar Screens were presented for specific design cases that encompassed different orientations, seasons and time of the day. In addition, a tool that could be used by architects for based on required annual " Daylit" areas for the design of Solar Screens that effectively achieve functional needs was provided. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Top of page Introduction Patients {{and methods}} Results Discussion References Inadvertent {{tracheal}} perforation during thyroid surgery is extremely rare. Although {{there is an}} extensive body of literature relating to traumatic tracheal perforation, and to the management of tracheal invasion and resection in patients with thyroid cancer 1, there are no published reports describing the management of inadvertent tracheal perforation during thyroid surgery. This paper examined the experience of two endocrine surgical units with inadvertent tracheal perforation. Jump to… Patients and methods Top of page Introduction Patients and methods Results Discussion References The study group comprised all patients who had thyroid surgery at Royal North Shore Hospital and the Liverpool Hospital, Sydney, Australia, from 1957 to 2002 and who were identified as having had inadvertent tracheal perforation. Data were obtained retrospectively from endocrine surgery databases maintained at both hospitals. Excluded were patients undergoing planned tracheal resection because of invasion by locally aggressive thyroid cancer. Patient demographics, indication for operation, operation performed, type of tracheal repair and outcome were evaluated. Jump to… Results Top of page Introduction Patients and methods Results Discussion References There were seven inadvertent tracheal perforations documented among 11 917 thyroid operations, an incidence of 0 · 06 per cent. The patients {{ranged in age from}} 28 to 79 years and all were women. All were primary procedures; there were no reoperations. In six patients the pathology was benign: four patients had a multinodular goitre, one had a benign Hurthle cell adenoma and one had Graves' disease. The final patient had an anaplastic tumour. Five patients had total thyroidectomy and two had unilateral lobectomy. In all patients the tracheal perforation was recognized and repaired at the first operation, under antibiotic cover. All perforations were located at the posterolateral surface of the trachea, close to the junction of the cartilaginous and membranous trachea, adjacent to the cricothyroid and the ligament of Berry. They were noted to be ‘small’ in the operative record. All perforations were repaired primarily using absorbable sutures; in two patients a buttress of strap muscle was included. The patient with an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma received a prophylactic tracheostomy {{at the time of the}} primary repair. Four patients had an uneventful recovery without additional intervention in relation to the tracheal injury. One patient was readmitted with subcutaneous emphysema that subsequently resolved with observation. Another patient developed bilateral tension pneumothorax that necessitated closed-tube thoracostomy and reoperation. In both these patients the perforation was noted to be small. One patient developed permanent hypoparathyroidism. There were no deaths or other long-term complications in this group. Jump to… Discussion Top of page Introduction Patients and methods Results Discussion References Tracheal perforation appears to be exceedingly rare; in the present series it occurred in less than one in every 1000 thyroid operations. For most thyroid surgeons the mean lifetime experience of such a complication is less than one patient, so it is unlikely that any individual will gather sufficient data to report the management of a series. Tracheal perforation is generally not considered a complication as such, but rather a technical occurrence during surgery that requires expeditious attention. Nevertheless, tracheal perforation, if encountered, needs to be managed appropriately. Although most patients recover uneventfully after primary repair, secondary complications such as subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax and wound infection may occur. The strength of this study was the ability to examine a very large series of well documented thyroid operations across two institutions. There were seven inadvertent tracheal perforations in over 11 000 thyroid operations, an incidence of 0 · 06 per cent. The perforation was recognized at the first operation in all patients. Generally these perforations occurred in the posterolateral trachea, either following attempted suture ligation of vessels in the region of the ligament of Berry or with the use of diathermy adjacent to the trachea. Once <b>identified,</b> all <b>perforations</b> were repaired primarily, some with a buttress of adjacent strap muscle. Patients had uniformly increased length of hospital stay but, with the exception of one patient, recovered with expectant management. Most perforations were recognized as they occurred, but smaller inadvertent injuries were identified at the conclusion of the procedure by filling the wound with saline and observing for small air leaks in the trachea. Once identified, the extent of the defect could be determined by careful dissection. The defect was repaired by reapproximating the tracheal edges, either with a single absorbable suture or with a catgut suture (in two early cases). Adjacent muscle was then used to buttress the repair in two cases. There are a number of published techniques for the repair of tracheal perforation 2, 3, generally associated with otolaryngological or cardiothoracic procedures. Although there are no randomized studies to support use of any one repair, muscle flaps, fibrin glue, and thymus, pericardial and prosthetic patches have all been described 4. The use of compressive dressings, drains, antitussives and prolonged ventilation has not been studied formally. Although tracheal perforation occurred in patients with both benign and malignant disease, benign disease was much more common in this study. There were no perforations in patients with well encapsulated lesions or well differentiated cancers. It appears that maintenance of normal dissection planes is more important than the presence of cancer. Multinodular goitre, which is characterized by repeated cycles of hyperplasia, degeneration and fibrosis, often contains dense fibrotic thyroid tissue that is contiguous with surrounding fibrous tissues such as the trachea. In a longstanding goitre it is frequently exceedingly difficult to define the plane between the two structures 5. Importantly, upwards retraction of the thyroid in the region of the ligament of Berry may lead to distortion, and even overlapping, of adjacent tracheal rings, adding to difficulties in determining the plane of dissection (Fig. 1) ...|$|R
