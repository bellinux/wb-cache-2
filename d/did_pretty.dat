Manco would shine the most against Tajikistan, where he <b>did</b> <b>pretty</b> much {{whatever}} he wanted against the Tajikistan defence on the flanks, and scored Peru's only goal, and his first and only goal in the World Cup. The game ended 1–1, with Peru winning 5–4 in the penalty shootout after Peruvian goalkeeper Hermoza saved the first penalty.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} Yo soy Betty, la fea made by Bosnian Federalna Televizija (FTV), Croatian RTL Televizija and Serbian Fox Televizija began airing in October 2007. The {{title of the}} show was Ne daj se, Nina ("Don't give up, Nina"). After a long audition, {{newcomer}} Lana Gojak, who resembles America Ferrera, was cast {{in the role of}} Nina (Betty). Other cast members were established actors such as Robert Kurbaša, Edvin Livarić, Bojana Ordinačev, Petar Ćiritović, Andrija Milošević, Kristina Krepela and Sloboda Mićalović. The first, and only, season consisted of just over 50 episodes. Although the storyline basically followed that of Yo soy Betty, la fea, Lana Gojak's appearance as Nina seemed to be based more on the heroine of Ugly Betty than on that of Yo soy Betty, la fea. The series had a number of other elements that were directly borrowed from Ugly Betty, rather than from Yo soy Betty, la fea. The series <b>did</b> <b>pretty</b> well in the ratings, but was too expensive to produce, so a second season was never ordered.|$|E

He ensured his selection with 6–95 for South Australia against the touring West Indies. He was one of only four non-WSC players picked for the first test against the West Indies (the others were Dymock, Border and Hughes). Hogg said, [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>pretty</b> poorly in India, but that was in India, and this series is in Australia – so they've decided to give me another chance, which I'm very grateful for". He played in a ODI before the test against the West Indies.|$|E

Reports were presented {{on the condition of}} the Yuan provinces were full of complaints about the Lamas who, armed with their golden seals, rode about the province making exaction and treating the people in a shameful way. They put up at private houses, drove out their masters, debauched their wives, and <b>did</b> <b>pretty</b> much as they wished. The fear of offending the Mongols and the Lamas prevented the Khan from doing anything effectual at first. Finally, he forbade the Lamas to enter China. Besides Buddhism, Yesün Temür Khan neglected the ancient worship of the sky of the Mongols.|$|E

2500|$|In 1861, Williamson {{worked for}} the local theatre company of Messrs. Hurd and Perkins as call-boy, general {{assistant}} and scenery and props maker. [...] There he made his official stage debut. [...] He later recalled: [...] "I used to act in amateur theatricals, and when I was sixteen I got an engagement with a company at the Milwaukee theatre. I was full of energy and enthusiasm, and <b>did</b> <b>pretty</b> well everything. My mornings were spent in learning fencing and dancing. In the afternoon I'd look after the box office, and at evening help the stage manager and take my part – sometimes three or four parts." [...] The next year, he joined the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Toronto, Canada and {{then moved on to}} New York where he found work as a dialect comedian and then played for several years at Wallack's Theatre. [...] From his seven-year apprenticeship there, Williamson emerged with a thorough knowledge of acting, play production and stage management. [...] He then played in a musical comedy at the Theatre Comique in New York under the management of W. H. Lingard. [...] Although Williamson was not a good singer, his talent for comedy carried him.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was one {{of three}} MSU players to be invited to the NFL combine, along with QB Brian Hoyer and safety Otis Wiley. Ringer took part in Michigan State's 2009 NFL Pro Day at the Duffy Daugherty indoor facility. Ringer's shuttle time was 3.89, which was faster than the fastest time at the NFL combine. Ringer said of the workout, [...] "I think I <b>did</b> <b>pretty</b> well, {{especially}} coming back from my knee injury. I'm still not 100 percent, probably around 85 or 90. This is basically another big stepping stone from what I did at the combine. Now that I was able to do some training, I felt like my change of direction was superb. I feel like I did really well in the shuttle and in the three-cone drill." [...] He participated in an MSU-sponsored podcast after the event discussing the event. Ringer improved his forty time from a 4.59 at the combine to a 4.42 during Pro Days. When asked about where he wants to get drafted, Ringer responded, [...] "I'll go anywhere. To get picked up somewhere will be a blessing." [...] Ringer's performance at Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. With his draft stock on the rise, Ringer has worked out with several NFL teams, including the Denver Broncos, the Tennessee Titans and the San Diego Chargers. He has also drawn interest from the Seattle Seahawks. He has since received workouts from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Buffalo Bills, and the New York Jets. A website that predicts him as a 3rd to 4th rounder also compares him to Priest Holmes. Ringer stated about his knee right before the draft, [...] "My leg feels fine. Right now, I'll give it between 90-95%." [...] One site calls Ringer a [...] "willing, if undersized, workhorse", but also questions his durability. When talking about draft day, Ringer responded [...] "I'm not nervous at all. I'm just kind of really mellow, calm ... knowing that whatever happens is going to happen, and whatever team I go to, that's the team where I'm meant to be." [...] Mel Kiper said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll probably end up being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." [...] Ringer spent time with his family in Dayton, Ohio, on April 25 watching the draft and celebrating his mother's birthday, waiting to get selected.|$|E
