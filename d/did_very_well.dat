5|$|Delta County has {{historically}} been advanced in education. Around the time that Cooper and the county were founded, there were already nine churches in the county. By 1880, that number had increased to nearly 30. There were a combined 998 students attending those schools, which operated 4½ months a year. In 1889, East Texas Normal College was founded in Cooper. The school <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> while located in Cooper, but the college moved to Commerce after the campus was destroyed in a fire in 1894. The school was later renamed East Texas State University, then Texas A University–Commerce. In 1896, Cooper reported to have one successful school located within the city proper.|$|E
5|$|As a captain, Jardine {{inspired}} great loyalty in his players, even if {{they did}} not approve of his tactics. Christopher Douglas judges that Jardine <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> to keep the team united and loyal on the Bodyline tour. He points out that team spirit was always excellent and the players showed great determination and resolve. Jardine particularly impressed Yorkshiremen who played under him, as they believed he thought about cricket in a similar way to their county colleagues. He became close to Herbert Sutcliffe during the Bodyline tour, even though Sutcliffe was sceptical about Jardine on the previous Australian tour in 1928–29. Hedley Verity was impressed by Jardine's tactical understanding and named his younger son Douglas after the captain. Bill Bowes expressed approval of his leadership after initial misgivings, and went on to call him England's greatest captain. Nevertheless, some players such as Arthur Mitchell who played under Jardine believed he was intolerant and unsupportive of players of lesser talent, expecting everyone to perform at world-class standards.|$|E
5|$|Jurassic Park {{became the}} highest-grossing film {{released}} worldwide {{up to that}} time. Following $3.1 million from midnight screenings on June 10, the film earned $47 million in its first weekend, with the $50.1 million total breaking the opening weekend record set by Batman Returns the year before. By {{the end of its}} first week, Jurassic Park had grossed $81.7 million, and stayed at number one for three weeks. It eventually grossed $357 million in the U.S. and Canada. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 86.2 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run. The film also <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in international markets, breaking opening records in the United Kingdom, Japan, India, South Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan, ultimately earning $914 million worldwide, with Spielberg reportedly making over $250 million from the film. It surpassed Spielberg's own E.T. the Extraterrestrial as the highest-grossing film ever worldwide, and became second to E.T. in North America earnings. Jurassic Parks record was only surpassed in 1998 by Titanic, the first film to gross over $1 billion.|$|E

5|$|The {{next ten}} matches {{prior to the}} Old Trafford Test were played mainly {{in the north of}} England and the Australians <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in this period, through June and into early July. They lost only to the North by an innings at Old Trafford when their batting {{struggled}} against Ted Peate and Ulyett while good scores by A. N. Hornby and Barnes ensured the North's victory. Giffen had a memorable game when the Australians played Lancashire at Old Trafford, taking a hat trick in the Lancashire innings and then scoring 113. That match was drawn but the Australians defeated both Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire by the same three-wicket margin. Spofforth, Palmer, Peate and Tom Emmett dominated the match at Bradford in which only 255 runs were scored in total. At Trent Bridge, the bowling of Giffen and Palmer enabled the Australians to recover from a first innings deficit of 39 and win. In the return match against the Gentlemen at the Oval, the last three English batsmen including Lord Harris were all stumped by Jack Blackham.|$|E

Every county in the state, except for Clarke County in Western Iowa, voted more Democratic than in 2004.|$|E

25|$|The pro-business {{policies}} of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented prosperity—until the Wall Street Crash of 1929 heralded the Great Depression. Although the party <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in large cities and among ethnic Catholics in presidential elections of 1920–1924, it was unable to hold those gains in 1928. By 1932, the cities—for the first time ever—had become Democratic strongholds.|$|E
25|$|Despite an {{impressive}} defense, the team struggled offensively. Quarterback Mark Brunell—an off-season acquisition from the Jacksonville Jaguars—struggled {{in his first}} season, and was replaced midway through the season by backup Patrick Ramsey. On the other hand, some of Gibbs' other new signings, such as cornerback Shawn Springs and linebacker Marcus Washington, <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> The Redskins also picked Sean Taylor from University of Miami during the draft in Gibbs' first season.|$|E

25|$|That Warwickshire's Championship win in 1911 {{was not a}} {{reflection}} of their ability but of the abnormal weather was doubted by nobody at the time, and 1912 – a summer as abnormally wet as 1911 was dry – saw his county fall back to mid-table after winning their first four games. Faults in his batting technique were clearly revealed on slow and treacherous pitches: his average fell from 44 to 19, but Foster again <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in bowling – taking 5 for 16 in one Test against South Africa, 11 for 87 against Middlesex and 12 wickets against Leicestershire.|$|E
25|$|In 1911/1912, Hearne toured Australia {{with one}} of the strongest England sides ever. He played in all the Tests, but was utterly hopeless as a bowler on Australian pitches both then and in 1920/1921 and 1924/1925, and it is not really clear why. He had the spin and the pace from the ground to succeed on rock-hard pitches, but he lacked flight and could rarely persist for long enough to be {{effective}} in a long struggle. As a batsman, he <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in the first two Tests, with 114 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground his only Test hundred - but he declined sharply afterwards.|$|E

25|$|After {{a couple}} of years, his skill began {{attracting}} other musicians. One such musician was Guy Lombardo, who would remain friends with Martin throughout his life. After graduation from high school, Martin accepted {{a job at the}} H.N. White musical instrument company. When Lombardo was playing in Cleveland, Martin tried giving Lombardo some saxophones, which proved unsuccessful. Fortunately, Lombardo did get to hear Martin's band. One night, when Guy could not do a certain date, he suggested that Martin's band could fill in for him. The band <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> and that's how Martin's career really got started. But the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|The war had {{delayed the}} start of Sutcliffe's {{first-class}} career with Yorkshire and he was 24 when his chance finally came. In May 1919, he played for the county's 2nd XI against a full-strength 1st XI and <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> scoring 51 not out. He received a good report in the Yorkshire Post and never played for the 2nd XI again. Yorkshire's first County Championship fixture after the war took place on 26 and 27 May at Bristol against Gloucestershire and Sutcliffe, batting at number 6, made his first-class debut. Yorkshire batted first, after losing the toss, and Sutcliffe made 11 {{in a total of}} 277 (Roy Kilner 112). Despite that seemingly modest score, Yorkshire won by an innings and 63 runs as Gloucestershire were bowled out twice for 125 and 89.|$|E
25|$|Linguists also {{administered}} several brain exams specifically geared towards measuring Genie's language comprehension. On {{one such}} test {{she had no}} difficulty giving the correct meaning of sentences containing familiar homophones, demonstrating that her receptive comprehension was significantly better than her expressive language. Genie also <b>did</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> at identifying rhymes, both tasks that adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients had previously been recorded performing well on. During these tests an EEG consistently picked up more activity from the two electrodes over the right hemisphere of her brain than from those over the normal locations of the Broca's area and Wernicke's area, and found especially high involvement from her right anterior cerebral cortex, lending further support to the researchers' conclusion that Genie was using her right hemisphere to acquire language.|$|E
