In {{order to}} improve the rate of {{finished}} products, failure analysis of 35 CrMoA high speed train shaft {{was carried out by}} means of chemical analysis, gas element analysis, macrostructure check, fracture pattern analysis, metallographical analysis, hardness testing and other analytical methods. The results show that the big <b>forged</b> <b>cracks</b> are caused by serious non-metallic inclusion and improper hot working processes. And the brittle fracture of the shaft is mainly caused by big <b>forged</b> <b>cracks</b> and great residual stress. Meanwhile, it has suggested that the shaft should be detected by supersonic wave along axial and radial direction after forging and heat process...|$|R
40|$|The post {{emulsifiable}} and water-washable fluorescent penetrant testing {{were carried}} out with ZL- 27 A and ZL 67 respectively. Ultrasonic cleaning by detergent were used for 30 minutes before penetrant. The parts were immersed and drained for 60 minutes. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of cracks were researched using the split mirror and scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} outgrowth of high temperature oxidation plugs up the <b>forging</b> <b>cracks.</b> Thus the penetrant testing is not effective in detecting this type of cracks...|$|R
40|$|Industrial production, {{which uses}} the forging tools {{constantly}} increases {{the requirements for}} the consumption of forging tools {{and the need for}} fast and flexible renovations of them. Forging tools made from special tool steels are highly cost-intensive. The main cost component is the price of the material, heat treatment and other chemi-cal-heat treatment surfaces. This is the main reason why it is necessary to think about renovation at the design stage, in case of the need for repairs. Main weaknesses of the renovations is the insufficient ability of identifica-tion of the cracks spreading from the surface towards the core of the basic components. An important factor in the renovation process is the optimal choice of technology to restore the mechanical and physical properties of tools at an acceptable price, of course. The main issue in the choice of the optimal technology is heat treatment to achieve a high hardness and surface of the die, which is nitrided to ensure wear resistance. This article deals with the application of non-destructive potentiometric detection technology when considering the size of die <b>forging</b> <b>cracks</b> that arise in the process of forming...|$|R
40|$|High {{nitrogen}} steels (HNS) {{differ from}} conventional austenitic steels on their higher yield and tensile strength {{as well as}} improved high temperature strength. HNS show also a better corrosion resistance, pitting resistance and stress corrosion cracking resistance. However, these advantages are accompanied with some problems during hot deformation of HNS. Edges and surface cracks as well as <b>forging</b> <b>cracks</b> may appear. Time consuming and expensive finishing operations are required for these cracks which mean a serious drawback to economic processing of forging blocks. The aim of this thesis is the identification of a forging window for an economical production of HNS under consideration of the modeling of precipitation and the experimental simulation of deformation. The experiments were made on three HNS 1. 4452, 1. 4501, and 1. 4882 and a reference steel 1. 4301. On the modeling of precipitation, the phase diagrams were calculated with Thermo-Calc® software {{in order to determine}} precipitation characteristics and phase transformations. The investigation of precipitations helps to draw conclusions from appearing phases and dissolving temperatures. In order to simulate the deformation, the high temperature properties were determined at deformation temperatures between 900 ºC and 1300 ºC via hot tensile tests. The compression test defines also the effect of deformation temperature on the crack sensibility. As a result of experimental simulations, a forging window was determined. The results show the deformation temperature window is restricted for austenitic HNS 1. 4452 and 1. 4882 in compare to reference steel 1. 4301 and super duplex HNS 1. 4501...|$|R

It was revealed that the scalar density of dislocations in ferritic grains and in ferritic perlite layers of <b>forging</b> steel which <b>cracked</b> after manufacturing operations is {{one and a half}} time higher than in conditions material. Metal in this condition has higher content of sulfide of plate-type morphology. It has established that the reason of unwanted structural and phase condition is high carbon content, which lead to overheat of metal both in plastic working and final heat treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{is dedicated}} to studying the forgeability of bimaterial cladded billet. Hot upsetting tests of cylindrical low carbon steel (C 15) billets weld cladded (MIG) by stainless steel (SS 316 L) are experimentally and numerically studied. Upsetting tests with different upsetting ratios are performed in different tribology conditions at 1050 °C which is within the better forgeability temperature range of both substrate and cladding materials[1]. Slab model and finite-element simulation are conducted to parametrically study the potential forgeability of the bimaterial cladded billet. The viscoplastic law is adopted to model the friction at the die/billet interface. The friction condition at the die/billet interface has {{a great impact on}} the final material distribution, <b>forging</b> effort and <b>cracking</b> occurrence. With Latham and Cockcroft Criterion, the possibility and potential position of cracks could be predicted...|$|R

Impersonators, phishers, scammers and spammers crop up all the time in Online Social Networks (OSNs), and are harder to identify. Spammers are the users who send unsolicited messages to a large audience with the intention of advertising some product or to lure victims to click on malicious links or infecting user’s system just for the purpose of making money. A lot of research has been done to detect spam profiles in OSNs. In this paper we have reviewed the existing techniques for detecting spam users in Twitter social network. Features for the detection of spammers could be user based or content based or both. Current study provides an overview of the methods, features used, detection rate and their limitations (if any) for detecting spam profiles mainly i...|$|R
50|$|From 1991 to 1998 the {{connecting}} rods were forged steel with standard type crank pin bearings. SOHC engines, for 1991-1998, used a dished piston design whereas the twin cam engines used a flat top piston with 2 recesses for the intake valves. Twin cam pistons received several re-designs from 1991-2002 {{aimed at reducing}} oil consumption issues. These included reducing the clearance between {{the top of the}} piston and the first compression ring, redesigning the skirts on the pistons and the oiling ports {{on the bottom of the}} pistons. For the 1999 model year all pistons were totally redesigned. Both engines used the flat top pistons with 2 valve recesses and featured a new hypereutectic design with coated skirts. Also for 1999 all connecting rods switched to a powder <b>forged</b> design and <b>cracked</b> bearing caps. The piston pins floated in {{the connecting}} rod bushings. The pistons were cast aluminum alloy with the piston pins being retained with snap rings.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} a {{technique}} for predicting surface cracks in hot free <b>forging.</b> These surface <b>cracks</b> occur at the side on which strains concentrate when a round bar is compressed by hot free forging. A final product has hardly any surface cracks because they are removed by gas scarfing. These conventional manufacturing processes have an industrial problem of low productivity with a waste of time. The suppression of the surface cracks is required. The mechanism and criteria for the surface cracks are not clear. In this paper, the mechanism of surface cracking was estimated, compared with the actual forging process. The mechanical property was evaluated by a high temperature tensile test. Various numerical simulations which changed the damage parameter (C value) were carried out. The critical value (C 1) is calculated by shape comparison between the tensile test and the numerical simulation. It is possible to predict the surface cracking in the hot forging process by using this parameter...|$|R
40|$|Key words: Crack {{length of}} crack, degree of {{deflection}} of the crack, speed of progressing of the crack, heat treatment. In the designing of many mechanical parts {{especially in the}} aerospace, naval, automotive industry, military, etc., {{one of the most}} important designing stages which needs special attention is investigating the Fatigue Damage, because the reasons for most of the fractures which happen during the service is the phenomenon of Fatigue. However, there is no visible evident change in the structure of the parts; it seems that the fracture happens quite suddenly and without any prior alerts. The stages of fatigue are the nucleation of crack on surface (for most metals) and propagation towards the inside of the part until the fracture. It is important to investigate the progress of the cracks in different materials and different heat treatment and end finishing under various loadings and in different environmental and service conditions of the parts in order to estimate the life of the parts according to the phenomenon of Fatigue. The aim of this article is to calculate the crack growth rate in aluminum sheets with different treatment such as extrusion and <b>forging</b> that are <b>cracked</b> with different degrees of deflection.

40|$|Characteristics of {{open die}} forging in an AZ 31 Mg alloy and a {{relation}} between microstructure and mechanical properties of the forged alloy have been investigated for an as-received specimen and an extruded specimen, where the as-received specimen consisted of both elongated coarse grains and equiaxed small grains, and the extruded specimen consisted of only equiaxed small grains. Each specimen was forged at 323 to 673 K. In addition, tensile tests of the forged specimens were carried out at room temperature and the microstructure was observed using an optical microscope. In the forging tests, the specimens could be forged from 18 mm to 2. 5 mm in thickness at forging temperatures of more than 423 K. In particular, the specimen could be <b>forged</b> without surface <b>cracks</b> when the grains were refined by extrusion prior to forging. However, for the as-received specimen, some cracks were observed {{at the edge of}} the specimens forged at less than 573 K. Therefore, it is suggested that the microstructure of the pre-forged specimens needs to be homogeneous, in order to attain a good surface quality, when forging is carried out at temperatures less than 573 K. The grain size of the forged specimens decreased with decreasing forging temperature. It should be noted that a very small grain size of about 3 &# 0181;m was attained by forging at 473 K. The tensile strength and the 0. 2 % proof stress of the forged specimens increased with decreasing forging temperature due to grain refinement by forging...|$|R
