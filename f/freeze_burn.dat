5|$|In the game, players fight various monsters as they {{explore the}} pyramid's halls and catacombs. Players may pick up weapons and {{ammunition}} {{left behind by}} others to supplement their arsenal. As additional levels are unlocked, new weapons become available, including machine guns and grenade launchers. Players can absorb {{a certain amount of}} damage, but once their health reaches zero, they must resume their progress at the last saved checkpoint. Resting in place replenishes health but saps game time and leaves the player open to attack. Scattered throughout the levels are other items players may use. Potions have different effects: rare blue potions, for example, rid the player character of poison and damage. Otherwise items provide points or cash; every four points increases the player character's maximum health by two units. Crystals can be used against enemies to <b>freeze,</b> <b>burn,</b> or otherwise harm them.|$|E

In comparison with freshwater solid ice, the main advantages are the following: homogeneity, higher cooling rates of food and fish. Pumpable ice flows like water and eliminates <b>freeze</b> <b>burns</b> and physical damage to the cooled object; it increases food quality enabling a longer shelf life. Pumpable ice technology meets Food Safety and Public health regulations (HACCP and ISO). Pumpable ice has a lower specific energy expenditure compared with existing technologies using conventional freshwater solid ice.|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} with {{temperature of}} the Raman activity in the (1 −x) Pb(Fe 2 ∕ 3 W 1 ∕ 3) O 3 -xPbTiO 3 solid solution with various compositions x∊(0,  1) was investigated. By increasing x, a general evolution of the system from disordered relaxor to ordered ferroelectric state with typical lines also observed in other Pb-based relaxors were found. The Raman activity present at few hundred degrees above the Curie region confirms the thermal stability of the nanopolar ordered regions in a nonordered average cubic state. For all the examined samples, the position, intensity, or damping of a few Raman lines exhibit anomalies {{in a range of}} temperatures which was considered related to the Curie region. The range of Curie regions corresponding to each composition is in very good agreement with the shift of Curie temperature as a function of x found by previous dielectric investigations. Two sharp peaks in the Pb(Fe 2 ∕ 3 W 1 ∕ 3) O 3 spectra showed a maximum of their intensity at ≈ 500  K. This behavior is interpreted as due to critical changes in the dynamics of the nanopolar clusters at the <b>freezing</b> <b>Burns</b> temperatures in the present relaxor system...|$|R
5000|$|Tyroc's superpower was his reality warping screams, {{which he}} could use to create {{dimensional}} portals and force fields, transmute objects, <b>freeze</b> objects, <b>burn</b> objects or simply destroy them. He could also teleport himself {{and at least one}} other person, although the exact limits of this ability were unknown. The effects and range of his powers were consistent when he first appeared, but later seemed to vary with the writer. Later writers often treated his power as simply being a [...] "sonic scream" [...] similar to that of Black Canary.|$|R

It is a colourless gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperature, but under pressure readily changes into a liquid. Anhydrous ammonia has a high affinity for water. Anhydrous ammonia is a hygroscopic compound, this means it will seek moisture source {{that may be the}} body of the operator, which is composed of 90 percent water. When a human body is exposed to anhydrous ammonia the chemical <b>freeze</b> <b>burns</b> its way into the skin, eyes or lungs. This attraction places the eyes, lungs, and skin at greatest risk because of their high moisture content. Caustic burns result when the anhydrous ammonia dissolves into body tissue. Most deaths from anhydrous ammonia are caused by severe damage to the throat and lungs from a direct blast to the face. An additional concern is the low boiling point of anhydrous ammonia. The chemical freezes on contact at room temperature. It will cause burns similar to, but more severe than, those caused by dry ice. If exposed to severe cold flesh will become frozen. At first, the skin will become red (but turn subsequently white); the affected area is painless, but hard to touch, if left untreated the flesh will die and may become gangrenous.|$|R

2500|$|Rand {{held that}} {{existence}} is the perceptually self-evident fact {{at the base}} of all other knowledge, i.e., that [...] "existence exists." [...] She further held that to be is to be something, that [...] "existence is identity." [...] That is, to be is to be [...] "an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes." [...] That which has no nature or attributes does not and cannot exist. The axiom of existence is grasped in differentiating something from nothing, while the law of identity is grasped in differentiating one thing from another, i.e., one's first awareness of the law of non-contradiction, another crucial base for the rest of knowledge. As Rand wrote, [...] "A leaf ... cannot be all red and green at the same time, it cannot <b>freeze</b> and <b>burn</b> at the same time... A is A." [...] Objectivism rejects belief in anything alleged to transcend existence.|$|R
40|$|Circular, {{full-thickness}} dermal burn- and freeze-produced wounds {{were produced}} in rats {{to compare the}} difference in healing between {{the two types of}} thermal injuries. Contraction did not occur in wounds (n = 30) caused by <b>freezing,</b> while <b>burn</b> wounds (n = 30) contracted to less than one-third of original size by 21 days after injury. If the centers of the freeze-produced wounds (n = 12) were excised, contraction would then occur and proceed {{at the same rate as}} an open wound. Histologically, the degree of initial tissue destruction by the two types of injuries was similar. The burn wound contained only half the amount of collagen found in the freeze-produced wound. There was a greater and more rapid replacement of collagen in the burn wounds. With both injuries, the highest concentration of collagen was found on the fifteenth day and returned to normal by the twenty-eighth day. The burn wound contained three times the amount of collagen in normal skin, while the freeze-produced wound contained only 1 3 / 4 times the amount in normal skin. Contraction does not seem to occur in the healing of the freeze-injured skin because the slow removal and replacement of the residual matrix prevents contraction...|$|R
50|$|On September 24, 1950, Alexander was {{the lone}} {{survivor}} of a plane crash {{in which he was}} severely burned over 70% of his body. After 17 operations, one of which was to permanently <b>freeze</b> his badly <b>burned</b> fingers around the grip of a golf club instead of removing them, he returned to help the United States win the 1951 Ryder Cup. Sam Snead, the Ryder Cup captain that year, paired Alexander against the British champion, John Panton, in the singles portion of the competition. Although the thought was that it might well be a throwaway match, it would at least save their other players from playing Panton, who was beating everyone at that time. Alexander, with both hands bleeding, won the match by the largest margin in Ryder Cup history to that point, 8 & 7.|$|R
