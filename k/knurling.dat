5|$|Mary Phagan {{was born}} on June 1, 1899, into an {{established}} Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took {{a job with the}} National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a <b>knurling</b> machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked {{on the second floor of}} the factory in the metal room in a section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.|$|E
25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to <b>knurling.</b> These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|E
5000|$|Cut <b>knurling</b> often employs {{automatic}} feed, the tooling for cut <b>knurling</b> {{resembles that}} for form <b>knurling</b> {{with the exception}} that the knurls have sharp edges and are presented to the work at an angle allowing the sharp edges to cut the work, angled, diamond and straight <b>knurling</b> are all supported by cut <b>knurling</b> [...] It is impossible to cut <b>knurling</b> [...] "Like extremely coarse pitch threads" [...] both because lathe gear trains will not support such longitudinal speeds and because reasonable cutting speeds {{would be impossible to}} achieve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Knurl</b> point screws are {{generally}} used to secure one object within another. The serrated ridge on the <b>knurl</b> cup set screw helps reduce loosening due to vibration. The <b>knurled</b> point combines digging {{action of the}} cup point with counter-clockwise locking <b>knurls</b> that have a ratchet-locking action which helps resist loosening, even under the most severe vibrations.|$|R
50|$|A popular myth is that rolled <b>knurls</b> are {{somewhat}} more complicated to design than cut <b>knurls</b> because the outer {{diameter of the}} work piece must be chosen to allow the roller to roll an integral number of patterns around the workpiece, in practice if the <b>knurl</b> is applied positively, it will engage with its own impression and create a proper <b>knurl</b> on any diameter of work. The integer number of <b>knurls</b> for any given diameter typically varies by three repetitions from the bottom {{to the top of}} the pattern. By comparison, for cut <b>knurls,</b> the spacing of the cuts is not preset and can be adjusted to allow an integral number of patterns around the workpiece no matter what the diameter of the workpiece.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knurl</b> {{point set}} screws {{should not be}} reused because the cutting edges of the <b>knurls</b> are {{deflected}} when tightened. During removal, the cutting edges are torn and no longer have full strength to resist unscrewing. ISO standard for <b>Knurled</b> cup point set screw is ISO 4029 ...|$|R

50|$|Hand <b>knurling</b> {{tools are}} available. These {{resemble}} pipecutters but contain <b>knurling</b> wheels rather than cutting wheels. Usually, three wheels are {{carried by the}} tool: two left-handed wheels and one right-handed wheel or vice versa.|$|E

40|$|Electromagnetic pulse {{crimping}} of {{form fit}} joints was investigated using tubes with {{a diameter of}} 50 mm and a wall thickness of 1, 5 mm, in the aluminium alloy EN AW- 6060. The tubes were crimped onto steel internal parts, which were designed to bear torsional loads. Grooved, <b>knurl</b> rolled and <b>knurl</b> cut internal workpieces were used. To assess the torque strength of the connections, a torque test set-up was designed and built. In a first test series, grooved internal parts were used. The influence of the internal workpiece design and the energy level on the torque resistance was investigated. Related to the geometry of the internal workpiece, the following parameters were varied: the groove depth, the groove width, the edge radius {{and the number of}} grooves. In a second test series, <b>knurl</b> rolled and <b>knurl</b> cut internal workpieces were used. For the joints with a <b>knurl</b> rolled internal part, the influence of the <b>knurl</b> pattern, defined by the pitch, was investigated. For the connections with a <b>knurl</b> cut internal part, the influence of the energy level was studied. The different joint failure mechanisms were determined...|$|R
5000|$|More {{common than}} <b>knurl</b> cutting, <b>knurl</b> rolling is usually {{accomplished}} using {{one or more}} very hard rollers that contain the reverse of the pattern to be imposed.

A criss-cross pattern can be accomplished using any of: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Knurling</b> {{may also}} be used as a repair method: because a rolled-in knurled surface has raised-up areas {{surrounding}} the depressed areas, these raised areas can make up for wear on the part. In the days when labor was cheap and parts expensive, this repair method was feasible on pistons of internal combustion engines, where the skirt of a worn piston was expanded back to the nominal size using a <b>knurling</b> process. As auto parts have become less expensive, <b>knurling</b> has become less prevalent than it once was, and is specifically discouraged by performance engine builders.|$|E

50|$|A men's Olympic barbell weighs 20 kg (44 lbs) with a shaft {{diameter}} of 28 mm and {{a length of}} 2200 mm, whereas a women's Olympic barbell weighs 15 kg (33 lbs) and has a {{shaft diameter}} of 25 mm with a length of 2010 mm. The distance between the sleeves, however, {{is the same for}} the men's and the women's bars at 1310 mm. The grip texture of the bar is called the <b>knurling,</b> and is distributed differently between the men's and women's bars: the men's has <b>knurling</b> in the centre but the women's does not. The Olympic barbells used in competition are certified by the IWF.|$|E
50|$|<b>Knurling</b> is {{also used}} on the grips of darts and the footpegs of BMX bicycles. Aside from adding {{functionality}} to an object (valve repairs and hand grips being {{some of the most}} common), <b>knurling</b> also adds a decorative pattern to the material. The knurled nut is one such application, which uses a knurled finish instead of hexagonal or square edges which helps in tightening or loosening the nut without the use of a tool. The knurled surfaces provide enough grip to hold the nut between the thumb and forefinger. Hence it is also called a thumb nut. It is mainly used on small diameter bolts.Knurled nuts are typically used in electrical components, musical instruments and in automobiles.|$|E
