40|$|The {{historical}} {{trends in}} structure, extent, {{and intensity of}} agricultural mechanization are analyzed in this study. The numbers of tractors, grain combines, corn pickers and picker shellers, pickup balers, and <b>field</b> <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> peaked during the early 1960 s. The decline in their numbers after the 2 ̆ 760 s is brought about mainly by the qualitative changes in those machines. The total tractor horsepower on farms also increased over the period 1963 - 79. Analysis of measures such as acres per horsepower, number of tractors and combines per farm, and acres per tractor and combine indicates that the intensity of machinery-use has increased {{over the last four}} decades. The productivity of machinery input in agricultural production has also increased;Based on the various investment theories, the alternative models of stock adjustment, expectations, and derived demand type are estimated for tractor and other machinery investments at the national and regional levels using 1950 - 77 annual data. Investment demand functions for harvesting machinery are estimated at the national level. Statistical tests for structural change in the machinery investments are performed. The demand elasticities with respect to prices, income and other economic variables are calculated. In general, the other machinery demand is the most elastic and the harvesting machinery demand is the least elastic with respect to their own prices. Harvesting machinery may have a higher priority in the annual machinery purchases of farmers and hence a lower elasticity of demand. In general, the tractor demand elasticity with respect to its own price as well as aggregate crop price is increasing from west to east;Dynamic multipliers expressing the long-lasting effects of the interest rates, price of fuel and oil, and net farm income are calculated for selected machinery investments. The impact and long-term multipliers are also presented;Finally, a block recursive simulation model of the regional farm machinery investments is developed. The relevant variables are selected from agriculture, industry, and economy in general to complete the linkages specified in the model. The regional tractor and other machinery investments and national tractor, harvesting machinery, other machinery, and all machinery investments are predicted up to 1990. The potential effects of six alternative policies of energy prices, support prices and agricultural exports on future farm machinery investments are also analyzed...|$|R

Producers prefer forage made with these {{machines}} because {{they are able to}} deliver a feed value that enables improved productivity of their animals in terms of milk production for dairy animals and weight gain for beef animals. Self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> are able to make a variety of feed from different crops, including whole-plant corn silage, earlage, and haylage, among others. The self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> is a complex and expensive piece of machinery for a producer to own. The self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> market in the United States is a growing market, but small when compared to other equipment such as combines. In today’s environment, productivity is crucial {{to the success of the}} agricultural producer. Self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> are no exception. Growth of the self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> market is reflected in increased unit sales, total horsepower sold, and average horsepower of the selfpropelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> sold in the United States. This study looks at changes in the number and size of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> being purchased and what factors might be driving those changes. This study found that the amount of milk produced, the type of customer purchasing the equipment, and the average price of milk a producer received explained 81. 2 % of the variation in the number of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> sold from 2000 - 2014. Study results also show that the size of dairy operation, the type of customer purchasing the equipment, and the average price of milk explained 88 % of the variability in total horsepower of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> sold from 2000 - 2014. Finally, the size of dairy operation that a typical cow comes from, the type of customer purchasing the equipment, and the average price of corn were able to explain 98 % of the variation of average horsepower of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> over that same time period.

40|$|The energy {{requirements}} of <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> {{can be quite}} high and can sometimes determine the size of tractor needed on a farm. Therefore, improving the energy efficiency of the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> could allow a farm to reduce costs by using a smaller tractor that is less expensive and more efficient. The objective {{of this research was}} to increase the throwing distance of a <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> by modeling the flow of forage in the spout and the air flow in the blower and spout. These models can then be used to compare the efficiencies of prototype designs. The air flow in the blower and spout was modeled using the commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT. The simulation results of air velocities and flow patterns were compared to experimental values and it was found that both were of the same order of magnitude with the model predicting slightly higher air velocities than those measured. The flow of forage in the spout was modeled analytically by taking into account the friction between the forage and the spout surface and the aerodynamic resistance after the forage leaves the spout. From this model, two improved prototype spouts that should theoretically result in longer throwing distances were designed. However, field testing of the two prototypes did not reveal any significant improvements over the current design. It was also found that the model under-predicted the throwing distance of one prototype by 2 % and over estimated the other by 12 %...|$|R

50|$|A <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (also {{known as}} a silage harvester, forager or chopper) is a farm {{implement}} that harvests forage plants to make silage. Silage is grass, corn or other plant that has been chopped into small pieces, and compacted together in a storage silo, silage bunker, or in silage bags. The silage is then fermented to provide feed for livestock. Haylage is a similar process to silage but using grass which has dried.|$|R
40|$|Many field {{experiments}} {{require the}} collection of forage yields in addition to grain yield (small grains). ln smal! plot research, mechanized grain harvest is common. However, forage harvest is often accomplished by hand which is time consuming and labor intensive. Sample heterogeneity increases when forage harvest is obtained by hand. The objectives {{of this study were}} to construct a mechanized <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> that would simplify the harvesting process while providing a homogenous sample and to determine forage yield reduction associated with using the harvester compared to hand clipping at the soil surface. A John Deere GT 262 self propelled rotary mower was modified to be used for small plot wheat <b>forage</b> harvesting. <b>Field</b> trials were established at two locations to determine the yield reduction associated with using the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> versus hand clipping at the soil surface. Significant differences in yield were found at both locations. The mean dry matter yield averaged over two years and two Iocations obtained using the harvester was 63. 1 % of that obtained by hand clipping at the soil surface during growth stages Feekes 6 and Feekes 10. Total N in wheat forage collected was significantly different using the harvester versus hand clipping. This is partially explained by decreased N in the lower stems at later stages of reproductive growth. The design of the harvester makes it possible to harvest several plots in {{a short amount of time}} while also allowing a larger area to be harvested which increases experimental accuracy and sample homogeneity. When the efficiency of the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (0. 631) is used as a correction factor, the difference between the estimated and actual amounts of forage present is S 4 o/" of the total forage present (Feekes 6 through Feekes 10) ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals of precision farming is preparing yield map. Recently in Iran, planting of corn has received special attention. Therefore, among the different methods of yield measurement such as using impact sensor at the outlet port of <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (chopper), displacement sensors at feed rollers of <b>forage</b> <b>harvester,</b> continuous measurement of discharged material to trailing wagon and using the torque meter, the present study made use of the torque meter method. This method consisted of a torque transmitting shaft equipped with laser-based encoders to monitor twist in a real time mode. The unit output could be exported to a computer via a microcontroller installed into the interface device. For calibration of the torque meter output with material feed rate in lab conditions, a conveyor was used to feed homogenous amount of material at a specific rate to the chopper. The experiment was conducted at 3 feed rates of silage corn and at 3 feed roll speeds of the chopper with 3 replications. Correlation between the feed rate and recorded power at different gears of the chopper was established. Relationships between feed rate and recorded power of the chopper at gears 1, 2 and 3 were linear with calculated R 2 of 0. 95, 0, 98 and 0. 98, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of vehicles is increasingly based on computer simulations. CAE simulations {{can be used}} to validate and optimize vibration behaviour, acoustics, handling and durability properties even in early design stages when prototypes are not yet available. To do that, two essential types of input data are needed: Model data: construction parameters like the geometry, masses, mass inertias, characteristic curves for springs, dampers and tyre models; Dynamical load data: system loads caused by the road profile. To perform simulations for new vehicles in absence of prototype measurements a realistic system input is essential. A possibility to obtain an invariant system input is to identify a synthetic road profile by appropriate mathematical algorithms like iterative learning schemes. In this work methods originally developed for passenger car engineering are adopted to agricultural machinery. For a John Deere <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (reference vehicle) wheel forces and accelerations have been measured on a test track. Using multi body simulation a 'digital road excitation' is identified which is then applied as load input for the new harvester version. The results are verified by measurements. For <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> the tyre dynamics is of special importance. Thus it has been analysed which kind of tyre model and which accuracy for the tyre parameters is sufficient for this type of analysis. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
