25|$|Nevertheless, we {{are forced}} to testify that Bourguiba's Tunisia could no more be called secular than Ben Ali's or the rest of the Arab Muslim states, for more than a {{neutrality}} of orientation and the religious freedom of the state, secularism implies the autonomy of public and religious institutions. The reality is that the institutional presence of Islam in Tunisia, although strictly circumscribed, is truly a constant reference, implicit or explicit, legitimizing the regime's direction. Certainly, Tunisian public services are accessible to all without distinction of creed and the constitution guarantees religious freedom, so long as it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>threaten</b> public order, but Islam remains the state religion, {{to the extent that it}} is said it is obligatory for the president of the republic to be able to assert it.|$|E
25|$|Although Qur'anic verses {{had been}} {{received}} from God commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it {{due to the}} enmity of the Quraysh. In the month of Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and to make preparations for a pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision where he was shaving his head {{after the completion of}} the Hajj. According to Lewis, Muhammad felt strong enough to attempt an attack on Mecca, but on the way {{it became clear that the}} attempt was premature and the expedition was converted into a peaceful pilgrimage. Andrae disagrees, writing that the Muslim state of ihram (which restricted their freedom of action) and the paucity of arms carried indicated that the pilgrimage was always intended to be pacific. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh sent out a force of 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, thereby reaching al-Hudaybiyya, just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was at the same time demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>threaten</b> the prestige of their sanctuary, and that Islam was an Arabian religion.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, the {{management}} advisory {{committee for the}} Western Australian shark fishery recommended that the whiskery shark stock be rebuilt to 40% of pre-exploitation levels by the 2010/11 season, {{through a series of}} fishing effort reductions. Although this target was not met because the effort reductions were not completed until 2000/01, preliminary catch per unit effort [...] data indicate that the population is increasing. In 2004/05, this species made up 12% (153 tons) of the fishery by weight. The whiskery shark is also a minor catch of the Southern Shark Fishery, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>threaten</b> the species overall. Since its population is stable and regularly monitored, and the fisheries that affect it are well-managed, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Least Concern.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955 he {{left for}} the Netherlands and first lived in Amsterdam and later in The Hague, where he became a zealous activist for the {{preservation}} of Indo culture. Initially he wrote columns reflecting on repatriation in Dutch newspaper 'Het Parool', where he became a direct colleague of Simon Carmiggelt, and simultaneously kept catering for the Indos still in Indonesia by writing for Surabaya based 'De Vrije Pers' (The Free Press). He originally attempted to find connection with the cultural and literary establishment of the Netherlands, but unwilling to assimilate he wanted to establish his own cultural network of Indo authors and artists. To groom the 62-year-old Indo author Maria Dermoût who successfully debuted in 1955 he wrote her: [...] "I am Mrs Dermoût, a barefoot child of the free seas and free mountains.

2500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{is now in}} doubt, and the debate and struggle may have initially begun in the provinces {{rather than in the}} imperial court. Letters survive written by the Patriarch Germanos in the 720s and 730s concerning Constantine, the bishop of Nakoleia, and Thomas of Klaudioupolis. In both sets of letters (the earlier ones concerning Constantine, the later ones Thomas), Germanos reiterates a pro-image position while lamenting the behaviour of his subordinates in the church, who apparently had both expressed reservations about image worship. Germanos complains [...] "now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter". [...] In both cases, efforts to persuade these men of the propriety of image veneration had failed and some steps had been taken to remove images from their churches. Significantly, in these letters Germanos <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>threaten</b> his subordinates if they fail to change their behaviour, he does not seem to refer to a factional split in the church, but rather to an ongoing issue of concern, and Germanos refers to the Emperor Leo III, often presented as the original Iconoclast, as a friend of images. Germanos' concerns are mainly that the actions of Constantine and Thomas should not confuse the laity.|$|E

60|$|The deer {{were acting}} queerly,--now {{plunging}} {{away with the}} high, awkward jumps that caribou use when startled; now swinging off on their swift, tireless rack, and before they had settled to their stride halting suddenly {{to look back and}} wag their ears at the trail.

One lay down and rolled over and over in the soft snow; another chased and capered after his own brush, whirling round and round like a little whirlwind, and the shrill ki-yi of a cub wolf playing came faintly across the barren.|$|E

60|$|The {{making a}} fact {{the subject of}} thought raises it. All that mass of mental and moral {{phenomena}} which we do not make objects of voluntary thought, come within the power of fortune; they constitute the circumstance of daily life; {{they are subject to}} change, to fear, and hope. Every man beholds his human condition with a degree of melancholy. As a ship aground is battered by the waves, so man, imprisoned in mortal life, lies open to the mercy of coming events. But a truth, separated by the intellect, is no longer a subject of destiny. We behold it as a god upraised above care and fear. And so any fact in our life, or any record of our fancies or reflections, disentangled from the web of our unconsciousness, becomes an object impersonal and immortal. It is the past restored, but embalmed. A better art than that of Egypt has taken fear and corruption out of it. It is eviscerated of care. It is offered for science. What is addressed to us for contemplation <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>threaten</b> us but makes us intellectual beings.|$|E
60|$|This conveys {{in general}} terms, at least, my {{interpretation}} of the present time, {{and it is in}} accordance with this view that the world is moving forward as a whole and with much dispersed and discrepant rightness, that I do not want to go apart from {{the world as a whole}} into any smaller community, with all the implication of an exclusive possession of right which such a going apart involves. Put to the test by my own Samurai for example by a particularly urgent and enthusiastic discipline, I found I did not in the least want to be one of that organization, that it only expressed one side of a much more complex self than its disciplines permitted. And still less do I want to hamper the play of my thoughts and motives by going apart into the particularism of a new religion. Such refuges are well enough when the times threaten to overwhelm one. The point about the present age, so far as I am able to judge the world, is that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>threaten</b> to overwhelm; that at the worst, by my standards, it maintains its way of thinking instead of assimilating mine.|$|E
