40|$|International audienceThe long pentraxin 3 (PTX 3) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in host defence and its over-expression may contribute to airway injury. The aim of the present study was therefore to characterize in more detail PTX 3 and its expression in the horses' airway. Six healthy horses and six horses affected by recurrent airway obstruction (R. A. O.) were submitted to a dusty environment challenge. PTX 3 DNA and cDNA were cloned and sequenced. PTX 3 expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR, Western blotting and immuno-histochemistry in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells, BALF supernatant and bronchial epithelial cells. An alternative splicing of the second exon of PTX 3 occurred, resulting in two forms of the protein: "spliced" (32  kDa) and "full length" (42  kDa). PTX 3 was detected in BALF macrophages, neutrophils and bronchial epithelial cells. It was over-expressed in the BALF supernatant from R. A. O. -affected horses in crisis. However, dust was unable to induce PTX 3 in BALF cells ex vivo, indicating that dust is an <b>indirect</b> <b>inducer</b> of PTX 3. Dust exposure in-vivo induced PTX 3 in BALF macrophages but there was no significant difference between healthy and R. A. O. -affected horses. Conversely, PTX 3 was over-expressed in the bronchial epithelial cells from R. A. O. -affected horses in crisis. These data indicate a differential regulatory mechanism in inflammatory and bronchial epithelial cells and offer therapeutically interesting perspectives...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} binary mixtures of bioluminescence inducers (toluene, xylene isomers, m-toluate) and of metals (Cu, Cd, As(III), As(V), and Cr) on bioluminescence activity of recombinant (Pm-lux) strain KG 1206. Different responses and sensitivities were observed depending on the types and concentrations of mixtures of inducers or metals. In the case of inducer mixtures, antagonistic and synergistic modes of action were observed, whereas metal mixtures showed all three modes of action. Antagonistic mode of action was most common for mixtures of <b>indirect</b> <b>inducers,</b> which showed bioluminescence ranging from 29 % to 62 % of theoretically expected effects (P(E)). On the other hand, synergistic mode of action was observed for mixtures of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>inducers,</b> which showed bioluminescence between 141 % and 243 % of P(E). In the case of binary metal mixtures, bioluminescence activities were ranged from 62 % to 75 % and 113 % to 164 % of P(E) for antagonistic and synergistic modes of action, respectively (p-values 0. 0001 – 0. 038). Therefore, mixture effects could not be generalized since they were dependent on both the types and concentrations of chemicals, suggesting that biomonitoring may constitute a better strategy by investigating types and concentrations of mixture pollutants at contaminated sites...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} metallothionein (MT) induction by bacterial endotoxin during acute phase alteration, I investigated direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>inducers</b> of MT by measuring the induced uptake of [(35) S] cysteine into cultured cells. Although zinc or dexamethasone induce MT directly when added to the culture medium of human hepatic (Chang) cells, endotoxin added to the culture medium {{was found to be}} ineffective in inducing MT synthesis. Since MT was induced during acute phase alteration, I focussed on the role of macrophages. I found that the conditional medium from endotoxin-activated macrophages ("MΦ+LPS") induced MT synthesis in Chang cells, while the incubation medium of nonactivated macrophages did not. Primary induction by zinc, copper or cadmium in "MΦ+LPS" was denied, because the concentrations of these metals in "MΦ+LPS" were almost the same as in the control medium. To clarify the details of the process of MT induction, the kinetics of MT synthesis by "MΦ+LPS" in Chang cells were studied and compared with the kinetics of MT synthesis by zinc and dexamethasone in Chang cells. "MΦ+LPS" induces MT synthesis, proportionally to the concentration of "MΦ+LPS", whereas zinc and dexamethasone induce MT sigmoidally and biphasically, respectively. On the other hand, the time course of MT induction by "MΦ+LPS" is similar to that by zinc, but different from that by dexamethasone. I conclude that: 1. Macrophages activated by endotoxin release a new factor which induces MT synthesis in human hepatic cells. 2. The new factor is different from dexamethasone and zinc...|$|R
40|$|Almost any {{growth of}} tumors is {{to some extent}} {{associated}} with an inflammatory reaction which may be anti-tumorigenic by acting directly on tumor cells or protumorigenic cells presumably by inducing tumor-associated angiogenesis. In this study, we have analyzed the angiogenesis-inducing capacity of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), a key regulatory molecule of monocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation. MCP- 1 {{was found to be}} potently angiogenic when implanted into rabbit cornea, exerting potency similar to the specific angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -A(121). MCP- 1 -induced angiogenesis in the cornea is associated with prominent recruitment of macrophages, whereas VEGF-A(121) -induced corneal angiogenesis is devoid of inflammatory cell recruitment. Based on these findings, we studied MCP- 1 expression and macrophage recruitment in human invasive ductal mammary carcinomas in comparison with the physiological angiogenic processes in bovine ovarian corpus luteum. Macrophage recruitment was always associated with MCP- 1 expression. High macrophage counts in mammary tumors corresponded with poor prognosis. In contrast, physiological ovarian angiogenesis was associated with only minimal inflammatory recruitment of macrophages. Our data show that MCP- 1 is an <b>indirect</b> inflammation-associated <b>inducer</b> of angiogenesis and demonstrate distinct qualitative differences between tumor angiogenesis in human mammary tumors and physiological angiogenesis in the ovary...|$|R
40|$|The {{localization}} of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) was {{studied in}} relation to the induction of hexose phosphate uptake in Escherichia coli. The uptake system is induced only by extracellular glucose- 6 -phosphate (G 6 P); there is no induction by intracellular G 6 P. Fructose- 6 -phosphate (F 6 P) is an <b>indirect</b> <b>inducer,</b> and isomerization of F 6 P to G 6 P must occur before induction. PGI has been considered to be an internal enzyme; therefore, uptake of F 6 P by noninduced cells and leakage of the G 6 P formed would be required for induction. In this study, it was concluded that part of the PGI activity is located in the cell surface because: (i) uninduced, intact cells are able to convert F 6 P to G 6 P, whereas the activity of G 6 P dehydrogenase is not detectable; (ii) when cells are subjected to osmotic shock, about 10 % of the PGI activity is found in the shock fluid; and (iii) sorbitol- 6 -phosphate (S 6 P) inhibits both PGI activity of whole cells and the induction of hexose phosphate transport system by F 6 P. S 6 P was not taken by intact cells. The data indicate that the isomerization of F 6 P to G 6 P can take place on the cell surface, and this explains the indirect induction of hexose phosphate transport by F 6 P...|$|E
