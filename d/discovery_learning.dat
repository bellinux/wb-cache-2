2500|$|The Silent Way is a <b>discovery</b> <b>learning</b> approach, {{invented by}} Caleb Gattegno {{in the late}} 1950s. The teacher is largely silent, giving more space for the {{students}} to explore the language. [...] Students are responsible for their own learning and are encouraged to express themselves; beginners talk about what they see, more advanced students talk about their lives and what they think. [...] The role of the teacher is not to model the language but to correct mistakes by giving sensitive feedback. With respect to teaching pronunciation, the Silent Way {{is a good example of}} the Articulatory Approach.|$|E
2500|$|Jerome Bruner {{is notable}} for {{integrating}} Piaget's cognitive approaches into educational psychology. He advocated for <b>discovery</b> <b>learning</b> where teachers create a problem solving environment {{that allows the}} student to question, explore and experiment. In his book The Process of Education Bruner stated that {{the structure of the}} material and the cognitive abilities of the person are important in learning. He emphasized the importance of the subject matter. He also believed that how the subject was structured was important for the student's understanding of the subject and it is the goal of the teacher to structure the subject {{in a way that was}} easy for the student to understand. [...] In the early 1960s Bruner went to Africa to teach math and science to school children, which influenced his view as schooling as a cultural institution. [...] Bruner was also influential in the development of MACOS, Man a Course of Study, which was an educational program that combined anthropology and science. The program explored human evolution and social behavior. [...] He also helped with the development of the head start program. He was interested in the influence of culture on education and looked at the impact of poverty on educational development.|$|E

50|$|The {{label of}} <b>discovery</b> <b>learning</b> can cover {{a variety of}} {{instructional}} techniques. According to a meta-analytic review conducted by Alfieri, Brooks, Aldrich, and Tenenbaum (2011), a <b>discovery</b> <b>learning</b> task can range from implicit pattern detection, to the elicitation of explanations and working through manuals to conducting simulations. <b>Discovery</b> <b>learning</b> can occur whenever the student is not provided with an exact answer but rather the materials {{in order to find}} the answer themselves.|$|E
50|$|In {{support of}} the {{fundamental}} concept of <b>discovery</b> <b>learning,</b> Bruner (1961) suggested that {{students are more likely}} to remember concepts if they discover them on their own as opposed to those that are taught directly.

40|$|Predictive state {{representations}} (PSRs) are {{a method}} of modeling dynamical systems using only observable data, such as actions and observations, to describe their model. PSRs use predictions about the outcome of future tests to summarize the system state. The best existing techniques for <b>discovery</b> and <b>learning</b> of PSRs use a Monte Carlo approach to explicitly estimate these outcome probabilities. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for <b>discovery</b> and <b>learning</b> of PSRs that uses a gradient descent approach to compute the predictions for the current state. The algorithm {{takes advantage of the}} large amount of structure inherent in a valid prediction matrix to constrain its predictions. Furthermore, the algorithm can be used online by an agent to constantly improve its prediction quality; something that current state of the art <b>discovery</b> and <b>learning</b> algorithms are unable to do. We give empirical results to show that our constrained gradient algorithm is able to discover core tests using very small amounts of data, and with larger amounts of data can compute accurate predictions of the system dynamics. ...|$|R

50|$|Fostering Community of Learners (FCL) was {{a program}} {{launched}} by Brown {{along with her}} husband Joseph Campione at the University of California, Berkeley. The project was noted to be similar to earlier reform methods such as progressive education, and <b>discovery</b> <b>learning.</b> Critics questioned how Brown and Campione's project of FCL would differ from Dewey and perhaps succeed where Dewey did not. Brown and Campione assure that while the approaches to the FCL project are similar to Dewey's early works, there are also differences. The approach to the project was to create a program that met between the theories of <b>discovery</b> <b>learning</b> and didactic learning. According to Brown and Campione, <b>discovery</b> <b>learning</b> that was unguided could potentially be dangerous, while didactic study led to passive learners. Therefore, Brown and Campione's approach of “guided discovery” was the middle ground between the two.|$|E

This philosophy later became the <b>discovery</b> <b>learning</b> movement of the 1960s. The mantra of this philosophical movement suggests that we should 'learn by doing'.|$|E
