5000|$|In this context, <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> {{conclusions}} is a {{theme of}} urban legends. It serves as a twist in which [...] "someone <b>jumps</b> <b>to</b> an incorrect conclusion, thus setting himself or herself up {{for some kind of}} uncomfortable, often hilarious downfall".|$|R

Two days before the mission was to begin, Covenant forces attack Reach and destroy the colony. A starship, the Pillar of Autumn, survives the onslaught with the SPARTAN-II Master Chief on board. The ship initiates a <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> slipspace (similar to hyperspace), hoping to lead the enemy away from Earth. The game starts with the Pillar of Autumn encountering Halo.|$|E
5|$|After the 1913 season, Evers {{was offered}} $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) to <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> the Federal League, but he opted to take less money {{to remain with}} the Cubs. In February 1914, after Evers signed his players to contracts, Murphy fired Evers as manager and traded him to the Boston Braves for Bill Sweeney and Hub Perdue. Murphy insisted that Evers had {{resigned}} as manager, which Evers denied. Evers insisted he was a free agent, but the league assigned him to the Braves. He signed a four-year contract at $10,000 per season ($ in current dollar terms), with a $20,000 signing bonus.|$|E
5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed and <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Consider {{a variant}} of the simple random walk on the inte-gers, with the {{following}} transition mechanism. At each site x, the proba-bility of <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> the right is ω(x) ∈ [1 2, 1), until the first time the pro-cess <b>jumps</b> <b>to</b> the left from site x, from which time onward the probabil-ity of <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> the right is 1 2. We investigate the transience/recurrence properties of this process in both deterministic and stationary, ergodic environments {ω(x) }x∈Z. In deterministic environments, we also study the speed of the process. 1...|$|R
5|$|Lesbians in the U.S. are {{estimated}} to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of sexually active adults who had had same-sex experiences within the past year, completed in 2000. A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.|$|E

At the 2004 Nordic Cup, she scored two goals and served one assist while starting in every match. The following year at the 2005 Nordic Cup, she scored three times including one goal during the championship match against Norway.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the regular}} season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also {{dangerous}} at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the Federal League, had begun play, and the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, restored that city to the major leagues {{for the first time}} since 1902. Few fans visited Oriole Park, where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.|$|E

In April 2005, Russia hosted the Big Prize Tournament in St. Petersburg, where Shirokov recorded an assist in two games as Russia posted the best record.|$|E
5|$|The final Delrina-branded {{version of}} WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the {{subsequent}} version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on {{keeping up with}} the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set it apart from its competition at the time.|$|E
5|$|The move 4.a3 allows White {{to avoid}} the {{annoying}} bishop check on b4, the also annoying knight <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> b4, and prepares Qc2 to undermine Black's knight. Both Lalic and de Firmian consider it to be White's best move, with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White. Lalic considers 4...b6!? {{to be the best}} answer, one point being that Qd1–c2, so effective in most of the other lines, can be met by Bc8–b7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be excellently placed on the b7- and c5-squares. Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead, while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White.|$|E

5|$|Tragic Kingdom {{was first}} {{released}} by Trauma and Interscope on October 10, 1995. The album {{did not appear}} on the Billboard 200 chart until {{the first week of}} January 1996. To promote the album, Trauma launched a street campaign that targeted high school students and the skateboarding community. No Doubt performed on the Warped Tour, which was sponsored by several skateboarding companies, and at several skateboarding festivals. The album remained low on the Billboard 200 and did not enter the top 100 until February 1996, when it jumped 27 positions to number 89. Palmer attributed the <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> a Channel One News program that Stefani hosted in January 1996, which was broadcast in 12,000 classrooms, and the band's subsequent performance at a Blockbuster store in Fresno, California.|$|E
5|$|With manga anthologies having {{met with}} little success in North America, Viz desired Shonen <b>Jump</b> <b>to</b> have a {{circulation}} of 1 million within its first three years.

To help fund the lengthy, expensive marketing campaign developed around Shonen Jump, Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz in August 2002.|$|E
5|$|After that season, coach Alex Hannum {{wanted to}} be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association. Chamberlain then asked for a trade, and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers. The {{motivation}} for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal, but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who was the Sixers general manager then, Chamberlain also threatened to <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> the ABA after Hannum left, and forced the trade himself. Cherry finally adds several personal reasons: the center felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities (which were plenty in L.A.) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a black man in L.A. but hard to imagine elsewhere back then.|$|E
