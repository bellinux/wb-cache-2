25|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that inanimate brute matter should, without the {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E

500|$|Most modern {{authorities}} have assessed McClellan {{as a poor}} battlefield general. [...] Some historians view him as a highly capable commander whose reputation suffered unfairly {{at the hands of}} pro-Lincoln partisans who made him a scapegoat for the Union's military setbacks.

He saw no contradiction between belief in God and the knowledge that evolution is [...] "a fact" [...] and believed [...] evolution should be taught in schools: [...] "I don't see that I'm any less religious that I can {{appreciate the fact that}} science just records that we change with evolution and time, and that's a fact. It doesn't mean it's less wondrous and it doesn't mean that there can't be some power greater than any of us that has been behind and is behind whatever is going on." ...|$|E

In episode 13 of the Dutch TV series Of Beauty and Consolation Gould remarked, [...] "In {{a couple of years}} I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals—very different from my popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation to me because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life." ...|$|E
500|$|By the 1930s it was {{recognized}} by government officials that the residential school system was financially unsustainable and failing to meet the intended goal of training and assimilating Indigenous children into European-Canadian society. Robert Hoey, superintendent of welfare and training at Indian Affairs, opposed the expansion of new schools, noting in 1936 that [...] "to build educational institutions, particularly residential schools, while the money at our disposal is insufficient to keep the schools already erected in a proper state of repair, <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> very unsound and a practice difficult to justify". He proposed the expansion of day schools, an approach to educating Indigenous children that {{he would continue to}} pursue after being promoted to director of the welfare and training branch in 1945. The proposal was resisted by the United [...] Church, the Anglican Church, and the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, who believed that the solution to the system's failure was not restructuring but intensification.|$|E
500|$|Kruger {{presented}} the treaty to the volksraad on the triumvirate's behalf at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881.

I consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and the whole world, that our respect for Her Majesty the Queen of England, for the government of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been greater than at this time, when we are enabled {{to show you a}} proof of England's noble and magnanimous love for right and justice." [...] This statement was to be ignored by many writers, but Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger's biographers, stresses it as one of his [...] "most notable utterances". Kruger reaffirmed his faith in the royal commission of Wood, Sir Hercules Robinson and the Cape's Chief Justice Sir Henry de Villiers, who convened {{for the first time in}} Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as an adviser. The commissioners held numerous sessions in Pretoria over the following months with little input from Kruger, who was bedridden with pneumonia.|$|E

500|$|Goldsmith was {{influenced}} by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. [...] "When you stop and think about it, space is a very romantic thought. It <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> like the Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of Star Trek," [...] he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using [...] "Ilia's Theme" [...] (later re-recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as [...] "A Star Beyond Time" [...] with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the [...] "Director's Edition" [...] DVD release. Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark).|$|E
500|$|Series writer Brian Peterson {{discusses}} how {{the writing}} staff chose {{to develop the}} character: [...] "In the Smallville pilot, Al and Miles established Lex and Clark as best friends, which <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{one of the best}} aspects of the show. So when you're introducing his future love interest, why not introduce her, not as an enemy, but as the one who is constantly going to butt heads with him, where they're not gonna like each other at all at first? I think that because we chose such a different take on her, it wasn't that intimidating. She could grow into the person that everybody sees on-screen later." [...] For season six, the writers chose to start Lois down the path of investigative journalism, only in this version of the character she gets her start working for a tabloid newspaper. Writer Kelly Souders felt that if tabloid beginnings were good enough for Perry White—an additional character established in season three's [...] "Perry"—then they are good enough for Lois Lane. It adds depth to the character by showing how she struggled before becoming [...] "the reporter we all know and love". As Lois steps closer to her ultimate destiny at the Daily Planet, the writers have continued to evolve the character by having her grow out of the [...] "black and white" [...] mindset and have her begin seeing shades of gray. The writers wanted the character to realize that there is sometimes a middle road that has to be taken. In season eight, Durance sees Clark taking a job at the Daily Planet as a chance for her character to [...] "step it up and be more involved". In this case, Lois is acting more mature, taking charge in being a mentor to Clark as he transitions into his new job. Durance describes the eighth season as a lesson in duality, with Clark realizing that he has to be two different people if he wants to have a life and save the day; Durance believes that the same applies to Lois. As Durance explains, [...] " [...] got her confidence as a journalist and on the inside, she's going oh my god I'm truly in love with , more in love than I've ever been with anyone." ...|$|E
