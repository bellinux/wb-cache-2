40|$|This {{research}} is about lease incentives, concessions and inducements provided by landlords to tenants {{in the commercial}} property industry in Johannesburg, South Africa. Landlords must provide lease incentives to prospective tenants {{in order to remain}} competitive or they run the risk of losing these tenants to their competitors. This research seeks to study the subject of lease incentives, and determine their effectiveness in securing tenants. In order to achieve this, the researcher investigates a number of factors:  The drivers behind a tenant signing a lease on a vacant space  The methods that landlords use to find tenants  The different incentives in the market  The methods of establishing the lease incentive values  The factors that affect which incentives a landlord can offer  The importance and effectiveness of providing lease incentives A qualitative research approach is used and focuses on meaning, experience and understanding to analyse the data that has been acquired {{through the use of a}} survey questionnaire. The sample population in the survey is made up of property specialists that deal in the subject under study as part of their daily work responsibilities. The {{research is}} conducted in the city of Johannesburg. The research concludes that the top two tenant drivers for office space are location and rental. Landlords need to effectively market their vacant space to attract tenants to their properties and the best method of doing this is through the use of vacancy schedules sent out to property brokerages and agencies. The top two lease incentives provided in the market are the rent-free period and the tenant <b>installation</b> <b>allowance.</b> These two incentives need to be provided by landlords to effectively compete with their competitors. The most important factors to consider in deciding which incentives to provide in the marketplace are the current economic conditions and the state of the space markets. Landlords understanding all these key variables will effectively reduce vacancies by securing more tenants and increase their overall competitiveness in the marketplace...|$|E
40|$|Several issues require careful {{consideration}} for the successful installation of membrane liners and/or floating covers to existing open water storage basins. For example: Membrane material type and colour; subgrade treatment for puncture protection and underdrainage; modification of existing inlet, outlet and overflow pipes/structures; maintenance of supplies to consumers during the <b>installation</b> and <b>allowances</b> for future operations and maintenance. This paper discusses the key issues which require consideration {{in the implementation of}} water quality improvement projects using membrane liners and floating covers via the design and construct project delivery mode. Alternative means of addressing the key issues are given by reference to several recent projects...|$|R
50|$|Regardless {{of copper}} cable type (Cat5e/Cat6/Cat6A) the maximum {{distance}} is 90m for the permanent link <b>installation</b> and an <b>allowance</b> for 10m of patch cords {{at the ends}} combined. Cat5e and Cat6 can both effectively run PoE applications up to 90m. However, due to power dissipation there is better performance and power efficiently with Cat6A cabling running POE devices if being incorporated into a new design.|$|R
50|$|Under the 'cap and trade' principle, {{a maximum}} (cap) {{is set on}} {{the total amount of}} {{greenhouse}} gases that can be emitted by all participating installations. 'Allowances' for emissions are then auctioned off or allocated for free, and can subsequently be traded. Installations must monitor and report their CO2 emissions, ensuring they hand in enough allowances to the authorities to cover their emissions. If emission exceeds what is permitted by its <b>allowances,</b> an <b>installation</b> must purchase <b>allowances</b> from others. Conversely, if an installation has performed well at reducing its emissions, it can sell its leftover credits. This allows the system to find the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions without significant government intervention.|$|R
40|$|European {{industrial}} installations surrendered over 1 billion Kyoto credits (675 million CERs and 383 million ERUs) in Phase II (2008 - 2012) of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Kyoto credits {{have always}} been less expensive than EUAs, initially {{as a result of}} asymmetric information, and then {{due to the fact that}} credit surrender was capped at around 1, 650 MtCO 2 e at the European level. Lower credit prices enabled installations to reduce their compliance costs. The savings achieved by installations subject to the EU ETS are estimated between € 4 billion and € 20 billion over the period between 2008 and 2012. The use of CERs and ERUs within the EU ETS grew exponentially. It was also effective from an economic standpoint in several ways: 1. a vast majority of the installations – 70 %, which represent 90 % of the emissions covered – made use of the option to return credits; 2. the use of credits was primarily limited by the supply: once delivered, credits made their way from the producer's account to the end-customer's account very quickly, on average in seven months; 3. the use of the credits did not depend on whether the <b>installation</b> had an <b>allowance</b> deficit or surplus: even installations that had a surplus, which did not “need” credits for compliance, surrendered them to minimise their compliance costs; 4. the development of market infrastructure played an important role in matching credit buyers and sellers by ensuring that a price emerged, and improving the transparency of information. Demand from the EU ETS dried up as companies had already contracted all the credits allowed by their maximum surrender limit since mid- 2012. This limit was set in 2004 and was only marginally increased in 2009 via the review of the EU ETS Directive for Phase III: the limit rose from around 1, 400 MtCO 2 e over the period 2008 - 2012 to an authorised amount of 1, 650 MtCO 2 e for the period 2008 to 2020, i. e. an additional amount of only 250 million over the eight years between 2013 and 2020. The bubble burst in the second half of 2012 after the market became convinced that European demand had dried up; this conviction was reinforced by the flooding of Russian and Ukrainian ERUs as both States boosted issuance of ERUs before the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The thousands of industrial companies buying CERs and ERUs were therefore replaced by just a few States, which made the international credit market much less liquid. In fact, the qualitative restrictions introduced in phase 3 of the EU ETS, which were supposed to rebalance the market, became obsolete before they even entered into effect on the 1 st of May 2013. On this point, we note that the European Union is currently the only region in the world that does not obligate its operators to use a minimum amount of domestic offsets...|$|R
