5|$|In {{selecting}} the on-disc songs, FreeStyleGames recognized that engaging guitar tracks are not strictly limited to rock music, and included other genres into the mix. According to designer Jim Norris, their selection process began with identifying songs {{that would be}} expected by players {{to be on a}} Guitar Hero title, and then determining which of those songs which they could license. Once they had obtained the license, FreeStyleGames would mark up the song for the note highways and determined <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> these songs would be to play. Finally, they balanced the song selection in the game to give players a combination of songs they know and those they may not recognize but would be enjoyable.|$|E

While hiking toward a research station for help, they notice a group of penguins; Lisa is fascinated by {{the chance to see}} them up close, but Bart thinks that their lives are boring and says that the ice slide they are riding down is just one isolated moment of fun. Lisa tells him that capturing and enjoying the best moments in life can make it fun, and Bart realizes she is right after Homer pushes him down the ice slide, with the whole family joining in. The final scene is a flash-forward to an elderly Bart in a retirement home, commenting on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> his life has been.|$|E
50|$|He is {{well aware}} of Tomomi's convincing {{manipulative}} nature and devilish personality but is resigned to dealing with her pranks because she knows so much about him as a child that she is effectively blackmailing him into keeping quiet about her. On the brighter side, she tells him that she will help him through to graduation, perhaps because she subconsciously cares for him or, more likely, simply because she enjoys <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more <b>fun</b> she can have at school with him around.|$|R

5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big thing {{for me at the}} time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

Lisa: We started gently, but soon built up a heady tower of abstraction, freely wielding the force of functoriality. Harry: For a newcomer to category theory, I can’t believe <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I learnt. And we were having so <b>much</b> <b>fun,</b> we even continued on into the weekend! Teacher: Yes, to finish off our week we looked at how we might describe the printf function in terms of monoidal functors. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Shunka is the {{granddaughter of}} the founder of Chiko's school. She uses this to her {{advantage}} amongst her peers, so her initial reaction to Chiko's cleverness is hostility. She changes her tune, however, after finding out <b>how</b> <b>much</b> [...] "fun" [...] {{it is to be}} around Chiko and her Nijū-Mensō-related adventures. Her goal is to have as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> as possible until she turns 16 and is of age for her arranged marriage. She often doesn't seem to care about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> trouble she causes, so long as she has fun. This means she has a habit of adding oil to the fire in dangerous situations because it would be more entertaining that way. In the eleventh episode of the anime it is revealed that Shunka had a twin sister who drowned at age 5. Because she was unable to do anything to help, Shunka blames herself for her sister's death.|$|R

June Bellamy is a tribute to voice actress June Foray. In the episode, Bellamy claims that she {{provided}} the [...] "Beep, beep" [...] sound effect in the Wile E.

500|$|Hankinson, {{despite his}} {{criticism}} of the episode, liked [...] "Love Shack" [...] so much it was his favorite song of the episode, and Futterman called it a [...] "well-executed note" [...] on which to end the show. Both Lynch and Slezak said that Blaine failed to project the campiness the song required, {{and that they were}} glad Kurt took over from him. Their grades were quite different: Slezak gave a [...] "C−", while Lynch, who complimented Mercedes as well as Kurt, bestowed a [...] "B+". Chaney was more enthusiastic than both and gave the [...] "rousing" [...] cover an [...] "A": she was enthusiastic about Criss [...] "bebopping all over the place", and also noted that [...] "the most entertaining all-company performances on Glee are the ones where it's clear <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> everyone had during filming".|$|E

500|$|When {{the parks}} {{department}} casts {{votes for the}} best mural, they each vote for their own artwork. As a compromise, Leslie creates a mural using pieces of everybody's artwork, but {{the result is an}} ugly and confusing mess. Leslie enlists the help of Mark (Paul Schneider), who draws a bland but skillful sketch of an old man feeding pigeons in the park. Mark himself admits the sketch is dull, but claims it will win because it has mass appeal. Nobody in the parks department likes it except [...] Ron (Nick Offerman), but Leslie insists on entering it so they will win, much to everybody's disappointment. While waiting to present the sketch, Leslie sees <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> other departments had in making their mural, and she decides to enter the parks department's original mural after all. The town council committee are confused by the proposal, but the parks department have fun presenting it and break into laughter. In the end, the town decides not to spend any money on a new mural and simply renames the old one [...] "The Diversity Express". The parks department is nevertheless proud of their work, which they hang in their conference room; Ron also hangs Mark's sketch in his office.|$|E
500|$|Yankovic was {{inspired}} to write the song after he heard The Kinks' song [...] "Lola" [...] while driving in his car one day. He noted, [...] "I was driving a rent-a-car through Florida when the song 'Lola' came on the radio, and it got me thinking about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> I had doing 'Yoda' [...] where I took a then-current topic and combined it with a classic rock tune." [...] He soon {{turned his attention to}} the film Jurassic Park—about a park on a fictional island, where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs. The film is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton—which had just come out and was already a blockbuster success. Yankovic decided to write a parody about the movie, and considered various songs that he could spoof. Eventually, he decided to parody the 1968 hit single [...] "MacArthur Park", which was performed by Richard Harris. Yankovic approached the original song's writer, Jimmy Webb, who agreed to the idea. In fact, Webb was so amused by the parody that he later penned a letter to Yankovic that read, [...] "Well, [...] oughta [...] bury that song once and for all!" [...] In addition, Yankovic received permission from Crichton and director Steven Spielberg to produce the track.|$|E

The comic strip Squeak the Mouse is also considered as an apparent inspiration for the characters. The show is also based on Herman and Katnip, a show that, according to director David Silverman, [...] "is hilarious because it's just bad." [...] As a child, Groening really liked the 1961 Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians, {{and it was one of}} the reasons to why he got into cartooning. In the film, the puppies watch television, and the idea that it is possible to have a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening.
