5|$|Although {{they were}} renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans {{were known to}} {{dominate}} the conversation amongst elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked {{too much or too}} loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for <b>everyone</b> <b>by</b> rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} motivate and inspire <b>everyone</b> <b>by</b> taking {{them on a}} field trip to Gettysburg. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his {{leadership}} and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him the way he is.|$|E
5|$|Quimby {{accepted}} each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons {{were also}} released with Quimby {{listed as the}} sole producer, following the same practice {{for which he had}} condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off <b>everyone</b> <b>by</b> a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Chadwick {{carried out}} {{research}} {{as part of}} the Tube Alloys project to build an atomic bomb, while his Liverpool lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised <b>everyone</b> <b>by</b> earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, Chadwick became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In September, Murray {{played his}} debut singles {{match for the}} Davis Cup in the World Group Play-off against Switzerland in Geneva on clay with Greg Rusedski, Alan Mackin and David Sherwood. Captain Jeremy Bates {{surprised}} <b>everyone</b> <b>by</b> naming Murray as the British No 1 and Alan Mackin as British No 2. Under the Davis Cup rules, this meant that for Friday's singles, Murray played the Swiss No 2, Stan Wawrinka while Mackin played the Swiss No 1, Roger Federer. Both of them lost their rubbers, giving Switzerland a 2–0 lead. Under the rules, for Sunday's reverse singles, Bates {{would have been able}} to substitute Mackin with Greg Rusedski, so that Rusedski would play Wawrinka, while Murray played Federer. However, Bates believed that Federer was virtually unbeatable because he was on a winning streak and hadn’t lost since June, and consequently Britain gambled on beating Wawrinka twice, with Murray playing Wawrinka when he was freshest. In the doubles, Murray/Rusedski played Federer and Yves Allegro, leaving Rusedski to play only once. The British tactics came to nought as Switzerland won the doubles rubber as well, gaining an unassailable 3–0 lead after two days. Alan Mackin and David Sherwood were consequently nominated for the dead singles rubbers losing both of them, resulting in a clean sweep for Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Eusebius's account {{deals with}} Maximinus. Maximinus {{took up the}} office of emperor in Nicomedia on May 1, 305, and {{immediately}} thereafter left the city for Caesarea, hurrying, Lactantius alleges, so as to oppress and trample the diocese of Oriens. Initially, Maximinus governed only Egypt and the Levant. He issued his own persecutory edict {{in the spring of}} 306, ordering general sacrifice. The edict of 304 had been difficult to enforce, since the Imperial government had no record of city-dwelling subjects who held no agricultural land. Galerius solved this problem in 306 by running another census. This contained the names of all urban heads of household and the number of their dependents (past censuses had only listed persons paying tax on land, such as landowners and tenants). Using lists drawn up by the civil service, Maximinus ordered his heralds to call all men, women, and children down to the temples. There, after tribunes called <b>everyone</b> <b>by</b> name, everyone sacrificed.|$|E
