40|$|Primary {{structures}} of caseins from 20 species, including two monotremes and two marsupials, have been compared. Sequences of the mature proteins are very divergent, whereas variation in amino acid composition is mostly restricted {{to a range}} of disorder-promoting residues. The number and size of clusters of phosphorylation sites in the caseins is variable, blurring the boundaries between them. Casein polar tract sequences were found in all caseins, though of variable lengths, and are chiefly responsible for weak and dynamic interactions among the tangled web of peptide chains in the matrix of casein micelles. The interactions take the predominant form of backbone-to-backbone contacts rather than the sequence-specific side chain interactions of the hydrophobic effect.

40|$|While {{biological}} processes underlying gene expression {{are still under}} experimental research, computational gene prediction techniques have reached high level of sophistication with the employment of efficient intrinsic and extrinsic methods that identify proteincoding regions within query genomic sequences. Their ability though to delineate the exact exon boundaries {{is characterized by a}} trade off between sensitivity and specificity and still is prone to alternations in gene regulation during transcription and splicing and to inherent complexities introduced by the implemented methodology. Evaluation studies have shown that combinatorial approaches exhibit improved accuracy levels through the integration of evidence data from multiple resources that are further assessed in order to end up with the most probable gene assembly. In this work, we present an integration and information handling architecture that exploits evidence derived from multiple gene finding resources, in order to generate machinereadable representations of optimal/suboptimal gene structure predictions, signal features identification and high scoring similarity matches. Unlike most combinatorial techniques, which end up with the most probable gene assembly, the objective of this architecture is to support advanced information handling mechanisms that may give more in depth insights on the underlying gene expression machinery and the alternations that may occur. Technically, XML was adopted to build and <b>interchange</b> <b>structured</b> data among the architecture’s components together with relevant technologies offering graphical representations and queries formulation/execution over single/multiple information sources. ...|$|R

This thesis documents an operational analysis of ographics. advanced actuated traffic control at signalized diamond interchanges. The study attempts to determine the benefits a "flexible'' phasing strategy provides to the interchange. Flexible phasing is implemented by changing the diamond <b>interchange</b> ring <b>structure</b> within the traffic signal controller. Modeling the performance of the signal strategies is conducted using hardware-in-the-loop simulation. This procedure requires that a traffic signal controller is used in conjunction with a computer simulation package to model traffic flow and the interactions with the traffic signal. For this research, the microscopic traffic simulation model TexSIM was used. The collected data was analyzed to compare the different strategies for signal control. Based upon the results of this analysis, it was concluded that no one controller strategy and phase pattern performs best over 21 of the scenarios tested. The basic S 3 -phase lag-lag phasing sequence outperforms many of the other strategies because of the flexibility this strategy provides. Specifically, the one controller strategy outperformed the 2 -controller strategy because of the reduction of cycle length during periods of low traffic intensity at the interchange. It was also concluded that flexible strategies could lead to reduced delay for special circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. While a {{foundational}} ontology {{can solve}} interoperability issues among the domain ontologies aligned to it, multiple foundational ontologies have been developed. Thus, {{there are still}} interoperability is-sues among domain ontologies aligned to different foundational ontolo-gies. Questions arise about the feasibility of linking one’s ontology to multiple foundational ontologies to increase its potential for uptake. To answer this, we have developed the tool SUGOI, Software Used to Gain Ontology Interchangeability, which allows a user to interchange auto-matically a domain ontology among the DOLCE, BFO and GFO foun-dational ontologies. The success of swapping based on equivalence varies by source ontology, ranging from 2 to 82 % and averaging at 36 % for the ontologies included in the evaluation. This is {{due to differences in}} cover-age, notably DOLCE’s qualities and BFO and GFO’s roles, and amount of mappings. SUGOI therefore also uses subsumption mappings so that every domain ontology can be <b>interchanged,</b> preserves the <b>structure</b> of the ontology, and increases its potential for usability. ...|$|R
40|$|Today, XML is used {{in three}} {{different}} ways.

The third aspect is to use XML to represent text, where a document consists of words which can be stemmed and phrases and the like. Obviously, a single XML document may represent more than one of these aspects, so for querying XML we need a query language which takes into account all these aspects.
