5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1896, <b>Edison</b> had {{turned his attention to}} promoting a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with <b>Edison</b> to present himself as its creator. With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and <b>Edison</b> suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, <b>Edison</b> commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the <b>Edison</b> operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the <b>Edison</b> company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Edison's British headquarters, <b>Edison</b> House, was {{situated}} on the road. Several prominent personalities of the late 19th century had their voices recorded there by phonograph, including Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and poet Robert Browning. Mary Helen Ferguson, the first English female audio typist, worked at <b>Edison</b> House and supervised all musical recordings. In 1890, retired military trumpeter Martin Lanfried recorded at <b>Edison</b> House using a bugle he {{believed to have been}} sounded at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854.|$|E
5|$|While <b>Edison</b> {{seems to}} have {{conceived}} the idea and initiated the experiments, Dickson apparently performed {{the bulk of the}} experimentation, leading most modern scholars to assign Dickson with the major credit for turning the concept into a practical reality. The <b>Edison</b> laboratory, though, worked as a collaborative organization. Laboratory assistants were assigned to work on many projects while <b>Edison</b> supervised and involved himself and participated to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|William Joseph Hammer {{started to}} collect {{incandescent}} light bulbs from 1879 {{while they were}} being developed in the <b>Edison</b> laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He was an associate of Thomas <b>Edison</b> and in his engineering career {{he was able to}} collect early filament electric light bulbs from <b>Edison</b> and others because of his association in the field. The Hammer collection is the most comprehensive collection of incandescent electric light bulbs known in the world. It shows the technology development of the filament electric light bulb during Thomas Edison's lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan {{was with}} trumpeter Harry <b>Edison</b> in 1959–60, and tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins in 1961–62, {{including}} a UK tour. In this period, Flanagan recorded albums for several leaders {{from an earlier}} era, including Lionel Hampton, Jo Jones, and Pee Wee Russell, {{as well as one}} with <b>Edison</b> and around 10 with Hawkins. Flanagan then played with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Percy Heath as a trio in New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla {{another job}} in Paris with the Continental <b>Edison</b> Company. Tesla began working {{in what was}} then a brand new industry, {{installing}} indoor incandescent lighting citywide {{in the form of an}} electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique <b>Edison,</b> the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other <b>Edison</b> utilities being built around France and in Germany.|$|E

5|$|In Vienna {{during the}} first week in August, Kalākaua had made the {{acquaintance}} of The New York Times co-founder George Jones, who noticed the King had an interest in Thomas Edison's work with electric lighting. Returning to New York, Jones arranged for Kalākaua and Armstrong to visit <b>Edison</b> on September 25. The King expressed an urgent need for Honolulu to upgrade its street lighting, which at that time was provided by kerosene lamps. <b>Edison</b> demonstrated some electric light bulbs, and Kalākaua showed interest in the technical details. The Sun newspaper reported that Armstrong joked with <b>Edison</b> about generating electric power from Hawaiian volcanoes. They left the city by train on the following day for Philadelphia, staying there for a brief rest, and then heading south to Washington, D. C.|$|E
5|$|Nor is {{this theme}} of {{cutthroat}} competition limited to prestidigitation: the script incorporates the popular notion that Nikola Tesla and Thomas <b>Edison</b> were directly {{engaged in the}} War of Currents, a rivalry over electrical standards, which appears in the film in parallel to Angier and Borden's competition for magical supremacy. In the book, Tesla and <b>Edison</b> serve as foils for Angier and Borden, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after leaving}} the <b>Edison</b> company, Tesla was working on {{patenting}} an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at <b>Edison.</b> In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by <b>Edison,</b> to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. Tesla worked {{for the rest of}} the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of Kansas Saloon Smashers was Edwin S. Porter, a projectionist {{who came to}} work for <b>Edison</b> as a cameraman in 1900. Eventually, Porter became the director responsible for all of <b>Edison</b> Studios' output. Porter based the set off of {{a photograph of a}} wrecked saloon which appeared in the Journal, while the characters and plot were based on editorial cartoons published in the paper. Porter frequently read the publication when he wanted inspiration on topics that filmgoers would be interested in.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{subsequent}} claims by Tesla biographers that <b>Edison</b> and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither {{was given the}} award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy <b>Edison</b> refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.|$|E
5|$|Under {{continuing}} {{pressure from}} Raff, <b>Edison</b> eventually conceded {{to investigate the}} possibility of developing a projection system. He seconded one of his lab's technicians to the Kinetoscope Company to initiate the work, without informing Dickson. Dickson's ultimate discovery of this move {{appears to have been}} one of the central factors leading to his break with <b>Edison</b> that occurred in spring 1895.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} Iowa-class battleships, New Jersey was named by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to repay a {{political}} debt, to then-New Jersey Governor Charles <b>Edison.</b> During {{his time in}} the Navy department, <b>Edison</b> pushed to build the Iowas, and to build one at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which secured votes for Roosevelt in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the 1940 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, <b>Edison</b> introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which <b>Edison</b> initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E
5|$|As {{far back}} as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had {{screened}} films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; {{in the style of the}} Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While <b>Edison</b> oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other <b>Edison</b> Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. <b>Edison</b> patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, <b>Edison</b> finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|At {{the peak}} of the fire, nearly 2,000 firefighters were {{assigned}} to the incident. Approximately 19 residents lost power as Southern California <b>Edison</b> was forced to shut down transmission lines that passed through the fire ground.|$|E

5|$|GCC reorganized {{independently}} in 1992, {{with the}} first {{chairman of the board}} of directors being the director of government relations for the Phillips Petroleum Company. Exxon was a founding member, and a founding member of the GCC's board of directors. Exxon, and later ExxonMobil, had a leadership role in coalition. The American Petroleum Institute (API) was a leading member of the coalition. API's executive vice president was a chairman of the coalition's board of directors. Other GCC founding members included the National Coal Association, United States Chamber of Commerce, American Forest & Paper Association, and <b>Edison</b> Electric Institute. GCC's executive director John Shleas was previously the director of government relations at the <b>Edison</b> Electric Institute. GCC was run by Ruder Finn, a public relations firm.|$|E
5|$|Hammer {{pointed out}} that <b>Edison</b> {{was not the first}} to make an {{electric}} light bulb. He claims instead that <b>Edison</b> made the first commercial electric light bulb that was successful. The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and burned out quickly, making them not practical for use to the general public. <b>Edison</b> first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed bamboo fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp internal wire was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected {{at the same time to}} a circuit. Others used filaments of low resistance ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This low resistance not only overloaded the electrical power system, but the wire filaments burned out quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive – not conducive to a commercial market.|$|E
5|$|Homer becomes {{depressed}} {{after learning}} {{he has lived}} past the halfway point of the average life expectancy for men without accomplishing anything worthwhile. His family tries to cheer him up by showing him a film of his accomplishments and a special appearance by the character KITT from the Knight Rider television series that Homer is a fan of. When the film projector stops working, Lisa mentions that Thomas <b>Edison</b> invented the projector and many other inventions. Homer decides {{to learn more about}} <b>Edison</b> and eventually idolizes him. In an attempt to follow his footsteps, he quits his job at the power plant to become an inventor.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{writings}} {{have often}} suggested that How Brown Saw the Baseball Game was produced as Lubin Manufacturing Company's {{alternative to the}} Edwin S. Porter-directed comedy How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game, a film released by <b>Edison</b> Studios in 1906 about an office employee sneaking out of his workplace to watch a baseball game only to discover his employer in a nearby seat. Lubin Manufacturing Company was known for creating films similar to competing motion pictures made by other studios. Lubin had previously created films resembling <b>Edison</b> Studios' releases Uncle Tom's Cabin and The Great Train Robbery.|$|E
5|$|Ohio-native Thomas <b>Edison</b> helped {{contribute}} to the modern communications world through many of his inventions, including his stock ticker, Kinetoscope, phonograph, and his contributions to the telegraph.

5|$|A Trip to the Moon was {{met with}} {{especially}} large enthusiasm in the United States, where (to Méliès's chagrin) its piracy by Lubin, Selig, <b>Edison</b> and others gave it wide distribution. Exhibitors in New York City, Washington D.C., Cleveland, Detroit, New Orleans, and Kansas City reported on the film's great success in their theaters. The film also did well in other countries, including Germany, Canada, and Italy, where it was featured as a headline attraction through 1904.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental <b>Edison</b> in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the <b>Edison</b> Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E

5|$|Eventually Shaw {{was driven}} to {{applying}} for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing. His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished, as was his first try at a novel. His first completed novel, Immaturity (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s. He was employed briefly by the newly formed <b>Edison</b> Telephone Company in 1879–80, and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the <b>Edison</b> firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek {{a place in the}} new organisation. Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.|$|E
