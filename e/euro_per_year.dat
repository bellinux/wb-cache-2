25|$|Taking {{into account}} {{differences}} in subsidies and service quality, {{the cost of}} supplying water at an equalised service level would be 84 euros in Germany, 106 euro in both France and England/Wales, and 74 euro in Italy. Concerning sanitation, unequalised tariffs are the highest in Germany at 111 <b>euro</b> <b>per</b> <b>year,</b> 93 euro in England and Wales, €90 in France and only €40 in Italy. Equalised costs net of subsidies are, however, highest in England and Wales with €138, followed by France (€122), Germany (119 euro) and Italy (85 euro).|$|E
25|$|However, {{according}} to a study commissioned by the German industry association BGW in 2006, the average household water bill was only 82 <b>euro</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> in Germany, lower than in France or in England and Wales, but higher than in Italy. The study shows that subsidies are more prevalent in the three comparator countries and service levels are lower. Taking into account these differences, the cost of supplying water at an equalized service level would be 84 euros in Germany, 106 euro in both France and England/Wales, and 74 euro in Italy. The apparent discrepancy between higher unit tariffs and lower bills is due to the lower water consumption in Germany. Water tariffs have remained stable in real terms over the past ten years.|$|E

25|$|Tariff level. Water and {{sanitation}} tariffs in England and Wales have increased by 44% {{in real terms}} between 1989 and 2008–09 and are {{among the highest in}} the world. The average household water and sewage bill in England and Wales was £330 in 2008-09. According to a 2006 survey by NUS Consulting Group the average water tariff (price) without sewerage in the U.K. for large consumers was the equivalent of US$1.90 per cubic metre. This was the third-highest tariff among the 14 mostly OECD countries covered by the report. A study commissioned by the German industry association BGW in 2006, compared the average household water {{and sanitation}} bill (as opposed to the tariff per cubic metre that the NUS study used as a comparator) in four EU countries. This study showed that water bills in England and Wales were the highest among the four countries. Average water bills (excluding sanitation) were 295 <b>euro</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> in England and Wales, higher than in Germany, France (85 euro) or Italy (59 euro).|$|E
