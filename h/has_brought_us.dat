500|$|Teoctist, Patriarch of All Romania, canonized Stephen {{along with}} 12 other saints at Saint Spyridon the New Church in Bucharest on 21 June 1992. On this occasion, the patriarch {{emphasized}} that Stephen {{had been a}} defender of Christianity and protector of his people. He also underlined that Stephen had built churches during his reign. Stephen's feast day is July 2 (the day of his death) in the calendar of the Romanian Orthodox Church. On his first feast after his canonization, a new ceremony was held to celebrate Stephen the Great and Saint in Putna. 15,000 people (including the President of Romania at the time, Ion Iliescu, and two ministers) attended the event. Patriarch Teoctist noted that [...] "God <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>us</b> together under the same skies, just as Stephen rallied us under the same flag in the past." ...|$|E

I will judge it fairly, and if he is, he shall pay the penalties; but I will not take it on rumor. I will not take it on hearsay.
