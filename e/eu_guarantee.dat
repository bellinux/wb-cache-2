Banks can {{play a major role}} in the process of absorbing EU funding, through the supply of capital complementing investor’s own contribution, providing bridge credit, offering consulting service as well as a comprehensive service for the beneficiaries of EU funding. The purpose of this paper is to present the fundamental forms of banks’ participation in the finance of investment projects implemented with the participation of EU funds. The present analysis covers products offered by selected banks, products that are targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises, distinguishing between basic product groups, including investment credits, bridge credits, additional services (contract account, consulting, guarantees instruments safeguarding against market risk). Attention was brought to the role played by the guarantees offered by the <b>EU</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Fund. It discusses various forms of banks’ participation in the financing of investment projects with EU funds and turns your attention to the role of guarantees offered by the <b>EU</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Fund. Bank experience resulting from the co-funding of projects implemented by employing the EU funds as well as data available for 2004 - 2006 allowed us to estimate the costs and advantages for beneficiaries, resulting from the role of banks as trusted public institutions, which have at their disposal appropriately trained and educated staff of economists, elaborate network of branches, the operation of financial leverage effect. Substantial EU funds offered to Poland under the New EU Perspective for 2007 - 2013 confirm that the role of specific products offered by banks in the financing and implementing of projects with the support of EU funds will continue to grow, which is not escaping the notice of decision-makers shaping the framework of Polish regional policy...|$|E

It is a urgent need for quantitative methodology able to assess the relative performance of different policy scenarios taking into account their long-term economic, social and environmental impacts. The methodology based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) provides a promising comparison framework. The objective of this part of research is not solely to discuss and comment on different scenario and policy outcomes provided by WP 205, but to extract useful information from the phase where proposed and simulated policy scenarios are compared. In particular, we are interested in incorporating the economic, environmental and social dimensions of the positive and negative impacts of each policy scenario. As shown in the paper by Boseth-Buchner (2009) this methodology allows "to bridge the gap between the simulation phase, in which long-run efects of policies are mimicked, and the valuation phase, in which usually a coherent cost benefit analysis framework is adopted" (p. 1342). In difference to the standard application of DEA for the ex-post performance assessment in the proposed approach DEA can be used for ex-ante assessment of different policy scenarios. DEA models combined with MCA, in particular with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) incorporating human judgements provides an useful instrument to analyse the impact of different policy preferences and strategies that appear to be crucial for the increasing well-being of the population. As a consequence, the proposed approach can provide a very beneficial contribution to the project as a whole and in particular to one of the central questions: "How can the <b>EU</b> <b>guarantee</b> a maximum well-being of its population?"...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{equality}} {{between men and}} women has, for a long time, {{played a significant role in}} the societies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The ideal was particularly important during the period of “real” or “really existing” socialism in CEE. For the CEE socialist regimes, the ideal of equality was an ideological banner that supposedly demonstrated their moral superiority to the “West”. The ideal has gained new importance in recent years, when the CEE post-socialist states had to commit to the protection of the notion of equality between sexes as a condition of their membership in the European Union (EU). This thesis will analyze the position of <b>EU</b> sex equality <b>guarantees</b> in the CEE post-socialist legal systems. More precisely, it will identify and explain key obstacles to enforcing the recently transposed EU sex equality law in the CEE post-socialist legal systems. In addition, it will provide a critical account of the model of harmonization of the CEE legal orders with the EU sex equality acquis that has been used during the process of accession negotiations between the EU and CEE states. This thesis will demonstrate that the negotiation model of the pre-accession harmonization of the CEE post-socialist legal orders with the requirements of the EU sex equality acquis did not succeed in identifying the most important barriers to the legal enforcement of <b>EU</b> sex equality <b>guarantees</b> in the post-socialist legal orders. Consequently, we can find profound and disturbing differences in the enforcement of <b>EU</b> sex equality <b>guarantees</b> between the <b>EU</b> and CEE legal orders...|$|R

A hybrid, three-area Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) with three groups of households defined by income level is constructed to describe inter-linkages between three rural-urban localities, namely the rural area of Archanes, the less-developed, agriculturally dependent, neighbouring rural area of N. Kazantzakis, and the adjacent urban centre of Heraklion. Results are reported on the diffusion patterns of economic impacts generated by three types of CAP measure: farm income support; aids to increased agricultural productivity; aids to economic diversification. These show that the diffusion of policy-induced economic impacts from Archanes is lower than might be expected for a small open local economy, and that benefits leak primarily to Heraklion and marginally to rural N. Kazantzakis. Finally, generated income benefits seem to accrue mostly in favour of high-income households, {{especially in the case}} of Guarantee subsidies.

The citizens of the EU Member States {{have the right to}} move freely without barriers within the EU borders and this result in an integration of the peoples in Europe. The integration result in several international family relationships. It is not unusual in the present situation that families have international relations. For example, spouses in a married couple may have different nationality. The international family law in Europe is applicable in case of a cross-border family dispute. The international family law consists of specific common rules on jurisdiction and rules on recognition and enforcement of judgments. There is no substantive family law or conflict-of-law rules in the international family law in the present situation. National law regulates the substantive law and the conflict-of-law rules. Since all Member States applies its own substantive family law, and the fact that national family law rules may differ in many cases, the absence of a common substantive family law in the EU cause issues in international family law. The differences in the substantive family laws affect citizens negatively in case of one Member State imposes less favorable legal effects compared to the internal law of another Member State. The national conflict-of-law rules apply since the international family law does not include any conflict-of-law rules. The conflict-of-law rules identifies the applicable national substantive law which gives rise to the problems in cross-border disputes. The international family law has no substantive solution to the cross-border disputes. The issues in international family law are that EU citizens are not necessarily treated the same way in all Member States even if the circumstances in a family law situation are identical. Legal uncertainty, risk of discrimination on grounds of nationality and possible obstacles to the {{free movement of}} people in the EU are examples of how citizens are affected by the divergences in international family law in the EU. A harmonisation of substantive family law is required to meet the citizens' rights under similar conditions in all Member States. However, the EU should not strive for common conflict-of-law rules since these rules only specify the substantive law. Differences in judicial practice arise in the substantive family law. A harmonised substantive law in the EU is required to avoid such differences. A harmonisation of these rules is complex due to the differences in national law. For example, the differences in the substantive law give rise to difficulties to harmonise the substantive rules by means of regulations. An appropriate solution for the harmonisation of substantive law is to let the Court of Justice of the European Union and the literature achieve a harmonised international family in Europe in due time...|$|R

A large number of legislative projects dealing with codifying and modernizing private international law, both on the national and the supranational level, have been launched in the past few years.
