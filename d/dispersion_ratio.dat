The absence of large bulk phases leads to a high surface-to-volume ratio, which is advantageous in any catalyst application as this maximizes the reaction rate per unit amount of catalyst material, which also minimizes cost. Although surface metal sites in heterogeneous catalysts are coordinatively unsaturated, most synthetic clusters are not. In general, {{as the number of}} atoms in a metal particle decrease, their coordination number decreases, and significantly so in particles having less than 100 atoms.

The feasibility of this intuition would be explored by scientists only in the 90's, half a century later. He called his project right after his name [...] "Gussalli System 1946". The spacecraft looked very much like an airplane fuselage, with a large disc attached to the forward end with vents which could be opened and closed to modulate thrust. As an alternative, Gussalli proposed a large metallic sail, corresponding to the modern concept of a solar sail. But actually in Gussalli's spacecraft, the thrust was not supplied by direct solar pressure 'blowing' the spaceship through space, as is envisaged in contemporary studies on a 'solar sail'. In Gussalli idea, thrust was to be obtained by means of microscopic particles (he called them 'nebular strings') shot into space by another rocket; those particles, boosted by the sun's radiations, would create a 'solar wind' strong enough to propel the spacecraft by striking its sail. The project was rejected as unfeasible by the British Interplanetary Society due to the impossibility of providing the required thrust, {{as well as by}} the USA NACA, that pointed out the difficulty of calculating (a) the right size of an efficient sail, (b) the exact amount of the 'dust' to be shot into space, and (c) the <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio</b> of the particles.In the same work, Gussalli suggested another innovative method to slow down spaceships on their way back to Earth: the aero-braking, widely used later on in aeronautics and astronautics, well after his time. Such ideas, even allowing for inevitable mistakes and imprecision in a still computer-less age, show beyond any doubt that he had a 360 degree vision of the matter, anticipating in many ways future discoveries and applications.|$|E

METHODS [...] Prospective study recording electrocardiograms at 50 mm/s in patients admitted with typical cardiac chest pain. Subsequent confirmation of acute myocardial infarction according to standard criteria. Single blind analysis for QT dispersion and QT components using a digitiser and simple computer program. Results are expressed as native QT dispersion, QTc dispersion, and the QT <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio</b> defined as QT dispersion divided by cycle length and expressed as a percentage. RESULTS [...] QT dispersion, QTc dispersion, and QT <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio</b> were all higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction than in those with unstable angina (mean (SD) 66 (18) ms, 75 (26) ms 1 / 2, and 8. 1 (2. 4) % compared with 38 (13) ms, 39 (13) ms 1 / 2, and 4. 5 (1. 7) % respectively). Dynamic changes in QTc dispersion were seen after acute infarction with significant differences in the QT components occurring between the different patient groups. Levels of QT dispersion (87 (15) ms), QTc dispersion (105 (17) ms 1 / 2), and QT <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio</b> (11. 7 (0. 8) %) in the four patients with ventricular fibrillation were significantly higher. Use of QT <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio</b> gave a narrower confidence interval. CONCLUSION [...] QT dispersion is increased after myocardial infarction and levels are higher in patients with ventricular fibrillation. The changes in QT dispersion are dynamic and may reflect the changing pattern of underlying ventricular recovery of ventricular excitability, which is profoundly disturbed in the earliest phase of acute infarction. Expressing QT dispersion as a percentage of cycle length (QT <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio)</b> rather than using standard rate correction may be superior in identifying patients who develop ventricular fibrillation...|$|E

In cases where the third integral of motion does not describe the system exactly, the derived kinematics would describe the galaxy only approximately.

However, the severity of this soil erosion can vary significantly with {{the ease with which}} soil is detached and transported by erosion agents. That is why a study was carried out in the Foumbot area in order to evaluate the soil erosion risk variation with some soil types. Thirty one soil samples were collected at 0 – 20 cm depth from three main soil types encountered in the area (Andosols, Acrisols and Ferralsols). Soil samples were analyzed for particle size distribution (Total clay, Total silt, Water dispersible clay, Water dispersible silt), Soil organic matter, Soil reaction, CEC, Exchangeable bases, clay <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio,</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio,</b> clay aggregation and Mean weight diameter). Soil erodibility indicators were determined and used to estimate soil erosion risk for the three soil types. The results showed high dispersive potential of the three soil types. Soil characteristics and the deriving soil erodibility vary from one soil type to another. The most vulnerable soils are the Acrisols and the less erodible are the Andosols. Soil mineralogy seems to be the key factor regulating soil erodibility variation in the area. The Water-Dispersible Silt (WDS) correlates positively with the Soil organic matter (r=+ 0. 67, p= 0. 000).

40|$|Abstract Background Silent {{aspiration}} or the inhalation of foodstuffs without overt physiological signs {{presents a}} serious health issue {{for children with}} dysphagia. To date, there are no reliable means of detecting aspiration in the home or community. An assistive technology that performs in these environments could inform caregivers of adverse events and potentially reduce the morbidity and anxiety of the feeding experience for the child and caregiver, respectively. This paper proposes a classifier for automatic classification of aspiration and swallow vibration signals non-invasively recorded on the neck of children with dysphagia. Methods Vibration signals associated with safe swallows and aspirations, both identified via videofluoroscopy, were collected from over 100 children with neurologically-based dysphagia using a single-axis accelerometer. Five potentially discriminatory mathematical features were extracted from the accelerometry signals. All possible combinations of the five features were investigated {{in the design of}} radial basis function classifiers. Performance of different classifiers was compared and the best feature sets were identified. Results Optimal feature combinations for two, three and four features resulted in statistically comparable adjusted accuracies with a radial basis classifier. In particular, the feature pairing of <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio</b> and normality achieved an adjusted accuracy of 79. 8 ± 7. 3 %, a sensitivity of 79. 4 ± 11. 7 % and specificity of 80. 3 ± 12. 8 % for aspiration detection. Addition of a third feature, namely energy, increased adjusted accuracy to 81. 3 ± 8. 5 % but the change was not statistically significant. A closer look at normality and <b>dispersion</b> <b>ratio</b> features suggest leptokurticity and the frequency and magnitude of atypical values as distinguishing characteristics between swallows and aspirations. The achieved accuracies are 30 % higher than those reported for bedside cervical auscultation. Conclusion The proposed aspiration classification algorithm provides promising accuracy for aspiration detection in children. The classifier is conducive to hardware implementation as a non-invasive, portable "aspirometer". Future research should focus on further enhancement of accuracy rates by considering other signal features, classifier methods, or an augmented variety of training samples. The present study is an important first step towards the eventual development of wearable intelligent intervention systems for the diagnosis and management of aspiration. </p...|$|E

With the aid of numerical simulations, we argue that different mechanisms might influence the shape of the SVE in the same manner and that the same process (e. g. mergers) does not have the same impact in all the galaxies. The complexity of the observational picture is confirmed by these simulations, which suggest that the vertical-to-radial axis ratio of the SVE is not a good indicator of the main source of disc heating. Our analysis of those simulations also indicates that the observed shape of the disc SVE may be affected by several processes simultaneously and that the signatures of some of them (e. g. mergers) fade over time.

By using as a metric the energy transfer ratio, {{we find the}} optimal transmitted pulse shape that allows minimizing the impact of dispersion. We show that these optimized pulses perform significantly better than standard nonreturn-to-zero/on-off keying (NRZ-OOK) modulation.
