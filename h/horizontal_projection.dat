50|$|The basic {{architectural}} design {{was drafted by}} Santini-Aichel. The details and participation in the building process {{can be attributed to}} Kaňka. The manor's design reveals one of the most noteworthy manor dispositions created in the Czech lands. The central high cylindrical body of the building is occupied by a three storied main hall to which 3 wings are connected. Due to this the manor does not need passages and its external appearance changes as the observer walks around it.The architecture of the chateau reflects the charisma and unique craft of Santini-Aichel and Kaňka. This is best demonstrated on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>projection</b> - three cubes are projecting from surmounting central cylinder. All views of the chateau are similar - opening wings extend from high central mass. The whole building is decorated by a light bossage, a simple string course, a weathering and a cornice. There are also soprafenstras. Three layered gables (one on each side) are above the cornice. Due to this combination of dynamical design and modest decoration is Karlova Koruna chateau considered {{to be one of the}} best Santini-Aichl's structure.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Human face {{detection}} and eye localization problems have received significant attention {{during the past}} several years because of wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications. In this thesis, wavelet domain based human face detection and eye localization algorithms are developed. After determining all possible face candidate regions using color information in a given still image or video frame, each region is filtered by a high-pass filter of a wavelet transform. In this way, edge-highlighted caricature-like representations of candidate regions are obtained. Horizontal, vertical and filter-like edge projections of the candidate regions are used as feature signals for classification with dynamic programming (DP) and support vector machines (SVMs). It turns out that the proposed feature extraction method provides good detection rates with SVM based classifiers. Furthermore, the positions of eyes can be localized successfully using <b>horizontal</b> <b>projections</b> and profiles of horizontal- and vertical-crop edge image regions. After an approximate horizontal level detection, each eye is first localized horizontally using <b>horizontal</b> <b>projections</b> of associated edge regions. Horizontal edge profiles are then calculated on the estimated horizontal levels. After determining eye candidate points by pairing up the local maximum point locations in the horizontal profiles with the associated horizontal levels, the verification is also carried out by an SVM based classifier. The localization results show that the proposed algorithm is not affected by both illumination and scale changes. Türkan, MehmetM. S...|$|R
