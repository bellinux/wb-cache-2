500|$|In an {{interview}} with Bollywood Hungama, Chopra was quoted saying [...] "when people play multiple characters, they have structures, they are {{from different parts of}} the world, sometimes they are a twenty-year-old and then become a forty-year-old in the same film, some with eyes small, etc. I have no clutches [...] All the girls I play in the film are in the age group of eighteen and twenty-four." [...] Additionally, she found playing the Capricorn girl, a teenager, very tough, saying: [...] "To play a 15-year-old girl without make-up or special effects to make me look younger was the most challenging role for me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> fifteen years old just through my body language. I didn't want any of the twelve girls to be caricatures." [...] Chopra also read Linda Goodman's Sun Signs and Love Signs to prepare for the parts. Initially, it was planned to film one character at a time, however, that did not happen.|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E

500|$|Helen Baxendale {{was nearing}} the end of her pregnancy, so could not join the rest of the cast abroad, thus all of her scenes were filmed in Manchester and Salford. The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford and {{exterior}} scenes of the hotel were filmed at the GMEX Centre. The taxi that takes Rachel and Adam to the hospital was a Holden car imported to Britain from Australia and altered to look like a taxi. The Loaf bar at Deansgate Locks provided a filming location for some scenes. The final scene of the episode was filmed on an aeroplane set constructed in a studio. Robert Bathurst said, [...] "We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. So we had to get sections of a plane's interior and stick them all together. The bits were flapping all over the place whenever anyone moved. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out the porthole and have a weep. As I was doing that, I looked out and there through the window, standing where the wing should be, was the show's carpenter trying to hold the set together." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I read all of the stuff he had to do, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at it from the}} point of view of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every single child in the world! If you would fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} season's use of 1940s terminology, Fazekas stated that terms like [...] "broad" [...] and [...] "dame" [...] were preferably avoided, while {{research}} {{was done to}} ensure terms {{that were used in}} the series were actually in use during that time, with Fazekas giving the example, [...] "you know what didn't exist in 1946? Smart ass. I looked up the etymology on that, didn't exist in 1946. Turns out it was a term that came around in the 60s. But for instance, I wrote a line that said, [...] "Oh I think someone's yanking your chain." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> it up, did that exist in 1946? And actually it did; it's a mining term that exists from a long time ago. That's our research that we do." [...] Research was also done on radio shows of the time to ensure realism when creating the fictional Captain America Adventure Program, with details discovered and replicated on the series including the use of lobsters and ham to create sound effects for the radio show. The Griffith Hotel, the all-women boarding house where Carter lives, is based on the real-life Barbizon Hotel for Women. Butters felt that while working in the time period, it became an issue to not sound [...] "too period". Additionally, it was difficult to write British people from the time in order to avoid stereotypes such as the [...] "typical British butler". However, D'Arcy, who is British, felt the writing staff wrote the British characters better than anyone else he had worked with, despite there not being any British writers on the staff.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1927, a 26 {{years old}} Bourguiba {{returned}} to Tunisia, {{not only with}} a girlfriend and his son Habib Jr. but also a deep knowledge of French politics during the Third Republic. While in France, he had been influenced by liberal values of the social-radical secular country, shared earlier by his brother Mohamed. Following his come back in Tunisia, he married Mathilde, while Mahmoud Laribi was his best man and settled in the Capital City. At the time, he {{was not interested in}} politics but in his professional career, every debuting lawyer having to do a three-year traineeship under the supervision of another experienced lawyer. For a whole year, from October 1927 to October 1928, Bourguiba concatenated traineeship: First he was hired by a certain Mr. Cirier, who dismissed him after six weeks. Bourguiba testified in these words: [...] "It was hard to understand. I had not yet started my political action. He may sensed risks. He offered to compensate me. But I preferred to leave without further ado. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for another patronage. We were late November. Everything was settled; trainees were all installed.

The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't.

Colchester manager Geraint Williams said: [...] "It's great news for the club. Chris is a defender with experience and leadership qualities." [...] However, Coyne was unable to help prevent Colchester from being relegated {{at the end of}} the season. Coyne was named Colchester United club captain for the 2008–09 season, but selection for the Australia national team, injuries and a change of management meant that he struggled to hold on to a place in the first team, and {{at the end of the}} season, he met with the club management to resolve his future. He left the club by mutual consent in July 2009, saying, [...] "Unfortunately, after 18 months here, it's time to move on. It was made clear that I wasn't going to play week in, week out and I felt that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at that and address it. Also, there isn't much of a chance for the Australian manager to watch League One football but in Australia, I'm guaranteed to play 27 games in front of him." [...] Coyne scored once for the club, his goal coming in a 4–3 defeat against West Bromwich Albion on 29 March 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Les Murray {{was born}} in Nabiac on the North Coast of New South Wales {{and grew up in}} the {{neighbouring}} district of Bunyah where he currently resides. He attended primary and early high school in Nabiac and then attended Taree High School. In 1957 he began study at the University of Sydney in the Faculty of Arts and joined the Royal Australian Navy Reserve to obtain a small income. Speaking about this time to Clive James he has said: [...] "I was as soft-headed as you could imagine. I was actually hanging on to childhood because I hadn't had much teenage. My Mum died and my father collapsed. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after him. So I was off the chain at last, I was in Sydney and I didn't quite know how to do adulthood or teenage. I was being coltish and foolish and childlike. I received the least distinguished degree Sydney ever issued. I don't think anyone's ever matched it." [...] He developed an interest in ancient and modern languages, which qualified him to become a professional translator at the Australian National University (where he was employed from 1963 to 1967). During his studies he met other poets and writers such as Geoffrey Lehmann, Bob Ellis, Clive James and Lex Banning as well as future political journalists Laurie Oakes and Mungo McCallum Jr. Between times, he hitch-hiked around Australia and lived briefly at a Sydney Push household at Milson's Point. He returned to undergraduate studies in the 1960s and became a Roman Catholic when he married Budapest-born fellow-student Valerie Morelli in 1962. They lived in Wales and Scotland and travelled in Europe for over a year in the late 1960s. They have five children.|$|E
