The frame {{data from the}} ANIM file is used to modify the hidden frame to the next frame to be shown. When using the XOR mode, the usual run-length-decoding routine can be easily modified to do the exclusive-or operation required. Note that runs of zero bytes, which will be very common, can be ignored, as an exclusive or of any byte value to a byte of zero will not alter the original byte value. The general procedure, for all compression techniques, is to first decode the initial ILBM picture into the <b>hidden</b> <b>buffer</b> and double buffer it into view. Then this picture is copied to the other (now <b>hidden)</b> <b>buffer.</b> At this point each frame is displayed with the same procedure. The next frame is formed in the <b>hidden</b> <b>buffer</b> by applying the DLTA data (or the XOR data from the BODY chunk) and the new frame is double-buffered into view. This process continues {{to the end of}} the file.|$|E

Coreference resolution (CR) and entity relation detection (ERD) aim at finding predefined relations between pairs of entities in text. CR focuses on resolving identity relations while ERD focuses on detecting non-identity relations. Both CR and ERD are important {{as they can}} potentially improve other natural language processing (NLP) related tasks such information retrieval and extraction, web-searching, and question answering and also enhance non-NLP tasks such as computer vision, database constructions or ontologies. In this thesis, I propose models to handle both coreference resolution (CR) and entity relation detection (ERD). Both systems are built onmachine learningmodels. The CR system is based on Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs). The ERD is based on Maximum Entropy Discriminant Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MEDLDA). The work on CR only resolves pronouns. It is a supervised system trained on annotated corpus. The basic {{idea is that the}} hidden states of FHMMs are an explicit short-term memory with an antecedent buffer containing recently described referents. Thus an observed pronoun can find its antecedent from the <b>hidden</b> <b>buffer,</b> or in terms of a generative model, the entries in the <b>hidden</b> <b>buffer</b> generate the corresponding pronouns. In the <b>hidden</b> <b>buffer,</b> all references are expressed as diverse features. In this work, besides the common gender, number, person and animacy, I convertedGivennessHierarchy and Centering Theories to probabilistic features, thus greatly improving the accuracy. A system implementing this model is evaluated on the ACE corpus and I 2 B 2 medical corpus with promising performance. For ERD, a novel application of topic models is proposed to do this task. In order {{to make use of the}} latent semantics of text, the task of relation detection is reformulated as a topic modeling problem. Themotivation is to find underlying topics which are indicative of relations between named entities. The approach considers pairs of named entities and features associated with them as mini documents. The system, called ERD-MEDLDA, adapts Maximum Entropy Discriminant Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MedLDA) with mixed membership for relation detection. By using supervision, ERD-MedLDA is able to learn topic distributions indicative of relation types. Further, ERD-MEDLDA is a topicmodel that combines the benefits of both Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum Margin Estimation (MME), and themixed membership formulation enables the system to incorporate heterogeneous features. We incorporate diverse features into the system and perform experiments on the ACE 2005 corpus. Our approach achieves better overall performance for precision, recall and Fmeasuremetrics as compared to SVM-based and LDA-basedmodels. ERD-MedLDA also shows better overall performance than state-of-the-art kernels used previously for relation detection...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{starting}} point {{of this paper is}} an algebraic Petri net framework allowing one to express net compositions, such as iteration and parallel composition, as well as transition synchronisation and restriction. We enrich the original model by introducing new constructs supporting asynchronous interprocess communication. Such a communication is made possible thanks to special _buffer_ places where different transitions (processes) may deposit and remove tokens. We also provide an abstraction mechanism, which <b>hides</b> <b>buffer</b> places, effectively making them private to the processes communicating through them. We then provide an algebra of process expressions, whose constants and operators directly correspond to those used in the Petri net framework. Such a correspondence is used to associate nets to process expressions in a compositional way. That the resulting algebra of expressions is consistent with the net algebra is demonstrated by showing that an expression and the corresponding net generate isomorphic transition systems. This results in the Asynchronous Box Calculus (or ABC), which is a coherent dual model, based on Petri nets and process expressions, suitable for modelling and analysing distributed systems whose components can interact using both synchronous and asynchronous communication...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDevelopmental {{processes}} are robust, or canalised: dynamic patterns of gene expression across {{space and time}} are regulated reliably and precisely {{in the presence of}} genetic and environmental perturbations. It remains unclear whether canalisation relies on specific regulatory factors (such as heat-shock proteins), or whether it is based on more general redundancy and distributed robustness at the network level. The latter explanation implies that mutations in many regulatory factors should exhibit loss of canalisation. Here, we present a quantitative characterisation of segmentation gene expression patterns in mutants of the terminal gap gene tailless (tll) in Drosophila melanogaster. Our analysis provides new insights into the dynamic mechanisms underlying gap gene regulation, and reveals significantly increased variability of gene expression in the mutant compared to the wild-type background. We show that both position and timing of posterior segmentation gene expression domains vary strongly from embryo-to-embryo in tll mutants. This variability must be caused by a vulnerability in the regulatory system which is <b>hidden</b> or <b>buffered</b> in the wild-type, but becomes uncovered by the deletion of tll. Our analysis provides evidence that loss of canalisation in mutants could be more widespread than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. ZIMPOL (Zurich Imaging Polarimeter) {{has been}} {{developed}} since the early 1990 s, and various versions at increasing levels of sophistication have been used with great success at different telescopes (IRSOL, McMath-Pierce, DST, SST, VTT). The main idea behind ZIMPOL is to overcome the problem of making fast polarization modulation com-patible with the slow read-out of large-scale CCD sensors. This is done by creating fast, <b>hidden</b> <b>buffer</b> storage areas within the CCD, and by shifting the photo charges at kHz rates between the illuminated and the buffer storage areas in synchrony with the modulation. ZIMPOL is not dependent {{on the type of}} modulator used. Although most observations have been done with piezo-elastic modulators, FLCs and Pockels cells have also been used. A version of the ZIMPOL sensor with an array of cylindrical microlenses to optimize the ef-ficiency has recently been implemented. An overview is given of the present status and the future plans with the ZIMPOL systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|Toyota?s chief {{engineer}} Taiichi Ohno urged organizations to ?lower {{the river to}} reveal the rocks? {{as a way to}} identify buffers of time, capacity, inventory, and money. The concept is to temporarily stress a system so that sources of variation <b>hidden</b> by <b>buffers</b> can be made apparent and addressed. The question this research asked was: How might one more effectively communicate Ohno?s principle? The purpose of the paper was to develop and test a 50 -minute simulation that uses modest and inexpensive materials to help lean construction educators and facilitators clearly convey the Ohno principle as a means for continuous improvement. For research method employed, a simulation was developed and tested as a first run study, and preliminary results and participant experiences analyzed to hone the simulation toward its final form. The simulation was tested on construction science students, and data from results of the simulation analyzed. It was found that the stress levels experienced decreased, and the perceived efficiency increased once the rocks were identified and removed. The simulation was also found to be effective in demonstrating the process of ?lowering the river to reveal the rocks?. One limitation of this research is that its scope is confined to reduction of time buffers - i. e. it does not consider other critical buffers as well. However the intent is to offer a launching point from which discussions with participants about applicability to their delivery processes can emerge. The simulation also offers the potential to serve as a base onto which additional stressors can be subsequently added and tested. Despite the pursuit of continuous improvement by lean construction practitioners, there is still a lack of awareness of how reduction of buffers can highlight opportunities for improvement. The intended implication and value of this work is that the developed simulation can be used to teach the Ohno philosophy to construction management students in academic settings, as well as to lean construction practitioners and stakeholders who may benefit from the inclusion of lean thinking in their practices...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} “buffer effect,” an important but understudied feature of computer-mediated communication (CMC). Research on the buffer effect posits that CMC venues provide a buffering “screen” that users can {{literally and figuratively}} <b>hide</b> behind. The <b>buffer</b> can make people feel more comfortable during interactions, and is theorized to be especially relevant in contexts where self-presentation is threatened. This study employs transgressions as ideal sites for examining the buffer effect {{because of the high}} level of threatened self-presentation involved therein. The current project tests whether people perceive different levels of a buffer in different channels of communication, and how the buffer effect is related to other widely studied features of CMC, such as interactivity, synchronicity, and social presence. It also tests outcomes of the buffer effect for both senders and receivers of transgressive messages. Specifically, it posits that the buffer effect is beneficial to senders of transgressive messages, and is detrimental to receivers of those messages. Furthermore, in the context of transgressions, the amount of responsibility that a person takes for the transgression is a factor that influences how others perceive the situation. Therefore, the current study also considers receivers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the level of responsibility the sender accepts, and specifically posits that senders 2 ̆ 7 higher levels of responsibility are associated with positive outcomes for receivers. The dissertation is comprised of two studies. In Study One, participants responded to a survey to test their perceptions of the buffer effect and of other features of CMC in various channels. Participants also responded to a hypothetical situation to indicate how the buffer effect influences outcomes when sending a transgressive message. Study Two employed an experimental procedure to test how senders and receivers perceive the buffer effect in actual interactions, as well as how senders 2 ̆ 7 acceptance of responsibility affects outcomes for receivers. Half of the participants were assigned the role of sender and were trained to provide a transgressive message to the receiver. Specifically, senders were trained to say that they had to leave the experiment early without completing the study, rendering the receiver ineligible for course credit. Both the channel (i. e., face-to-face, instant messaging, text messaging) and the senders 2 ̆ 7 level of responsibility (i. e., low/high) were manipulated. Results suggested that the buffer effect manifests in different levels for various channels of communication, such that face-to-face environments provide the lowest buffer, followed by video chat, social networking sites, instant messaging, and email. Text messaging provides the highest buffer. The buffer effect is negatively related to other features of CMC (i. e., synchronicity, interactivity, and social presence) for low-buffer channels, and is either positively or not significantly related to these features in high-buffer channels. Results also suggest that the buffer effect is associated with benefits for senders in both hypothetical and actual interactions, but does not affect receivers 2 ̆ 7 outcomes. Receivers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the level of responsibility that senders accept affects receivers 2 ̆ 7 outcomes, but only within environments with a low and moderate buffer. These results extend research on CMC and on transgressive communication. Results also offer practical implications for how people might elect to use channels and modify the content of their message when communicating a transgression to a friend...|$|R
