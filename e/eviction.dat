In November 2014 a ballot measure was put forward which would put a tax on real estate speculation. Proposition G led to a virtual halt of Ellis Act <b>evictions</b> {{in the months leading}} up to the election.

The order was given not only as an attempt to restore law and order, but also out of concern about the hazardous living conditions in the city. <b>Eviction</b> efforts escalated three days later, when door-to-door searches were conducted to advise remaining residents to leave the city. Despite this, a number of residents defied the <b>eviction</b> order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.|$|E

50|$|Another area of activisim in Magliana {{concerned}} <b>evictions.</b> Many of Magliana’s {{residents were}} unprivileged during the 1970s. Landlords would demand unmanageable rents from residents, even though apartments were sometimes {{not connected to}} water and telephone lines. Residents organized to halt <b>evictions</b> by developing strong networks, informing each other of pending <b>evictions,</b> and {{on the day of}} the intended <b>evictions,</b> they would telephone each other when the police entered the neighborhoods and residents would gather in the streets and physically prevent police from entering the neighborhood. As a result of this activism, fewer <b>evictions</b> occurred in Magliana over time.|$|R

5|$|Big Brother 11 was {{broadcast}} on CBS from July 9, 2009 to September 15, 2009. This season lasted {{a total of}} 73 days, making it the third shortest season of the series to date. This season featured no changes to the schedule {{that was used in}} the previous edition, with episodes airing on Tuesdays, Thursday, and Sunday each week. The Thursday episode, which aired at 9 PM Eastern time, featured the live <b>eviction</b> and subsequent Head of Household competition taking place. During the live <b>eviction,</b> the show was hosted by Julie Chen. The Sunday episode, which aired at 8 PM Eastern time, featured the food competition and nomination ceremony, as well as some highlights from the previous days. The Tuesday episode featured the Power of Veto competition and the Power of Veto ceremony, along with more highlights of recent events in the game. Some changes to the scheduling format were made. Chima's expulsion from the game, for example, led to various changes in the formatting of the television broadcasts, and led to the cancellation of the upcoming Double <b>Eviction</b> week. The series {{was broadcast}} on Global Television Network in Canada. For {{the first time in the}} history of the show, Big Brother had a two-hour live season finale, which aired on September 15, an increase from the usual hour.|$|E

50|$|Rent strikes {{often led}} to <b>evictions.</b> Land League members {{resisted}} the <b>evictions</b> en masse during the Land War, resulting in enforcement of <b>evictions</b> by court judgements for possession that {{were carried out}} by the quasi-military Royal Irish Constabulary. Murders of some landlords, their agents and policemen, as well as attacks on supportive witnesses and on their property and animals, all occurred as reprisals for <b>evictions.</b> In response, the British army were often deployed to back up the police, restore law and order, and enforce <b>evictions</b> after the Coercion Acts were passed. For protesting tenants, these Acts were a form of martial law; their opponents saw it as the only way to guarantee their legal rights.|$|R

5|$|The main {{television}} coverage of Big Brother 10 was screened using daily highlights programmes, narrated by Marcus Bentley.

On Fridays, a live <b>eviction</b> programme was hosted by Davina McCall in which the evicted contestant left the house and received an interview from McCall and two guests. For 2009, BBLB returned with George Lamb presenting five weekday evening programmes and one Sunday edition per week.

In each of three challenges he had to ensure, while still keeping the secret, that his chosen champion defeated the appropriate Greek god.

40|$|This {{research}} {{entails a}} case study on the investigation of illegal farm <b>evictions</b> in the Great Kei Local Municipality of the Eastern Cape. The study was propelled by the plight of people living and working on farms in South Africa who are always victims of illegal farm <b>evictions.</b> Such <b>evictions</b> in many an instance violate their basic human rights protected by South Africa’s constitution and many other international conventions. It is hoped that the findings and recommendations of the research will have {{a profound impact on}} how illegal farm <b>evictions</b> in future will be handled by those championing the rights of people living and working on farms. Similarly, there is hope that this study will create an interest in others to new broader issues of human rights protection. A closer look at concepts like constructive <b>evictions</b> is necessary because of their traumatic nature to their victims. The study is divided into five chapters. 1. Introduction This chapter provides a background, the purpose of the study, specific objectives or research questions, hypotheses or assumptions of the study, the significance of the study, justification or rationale of the study, delimitation of the study, literature review, methodology, ethical considerations, and the limitations of the study. 2.
