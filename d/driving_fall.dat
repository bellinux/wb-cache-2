5000|$|Because of a {{reluctance}} by juries to convict when {{the charge was}} manslaughter, a statutory offence of [...] "causing death by dangerous driving" [...] was introduced. Following the Road Traffic Law Review Committee (1988), the Road Traffic Act 1991 abandoned recklessness in favour of the pre-statutory objective test of [...] "dangerousness", i.e. did the <b>driving</b> <b>fall</b> far below the standard of the competent and careful driver. The Committee also recommended that manslaughter should be an optional charge for the more serious driving cases. There {{is the possibility of}} charging an aggravated taking without consent for less seriously dangerous driving where death results. An equivalent, in many American states, to motor manslaughter, is vehicular homicide. An equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving in Canada under the Criminal Code is Causing death by criminal negligence.|$|E
40|$|The hammer throw {{is perhaps}} the most misunder-stood {{and one of the most}} {{difficult}} events to learn in track and field. It is in itself an enigma or paradox to even experienced coaches and athletes. I have long felt that two very important technical aspects of the hammer throw, namely relaxed extension of the arms to create maximum effective radius, and the notion of countering the hammer by sitting back against the ball, are quite paradoxical in nature. Think of the absurdity of trying to maintain a relatively relaxed, passive upper body with arms fully extended while driving furiously with your lower body and moving the hammer at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. Likewise, to counter the weight of the hammer by sitting back (<b>driving,</b> <b>fall</b> backward with your back, head, buttocks and displacing your mass against the hammer) as the hammer head moves from 180 degrees to zero de-grees—which is a linear component of a mainly rotational event. It is at this point when the athlete should be sitting back against the ball that he has a tremendous urge to race ahead of the hammer into the next turn (known as drag-ging), thus slowing down the hammer’s speed and de-creasing effective radius. When sitting back against the hammer is successfully applied, it has the effect of dra-matically increasing the speed of the hammer and gives the athlete a tremendous sense of control, albeit paradoxi-cally, by falling, sitting back against the hammer. TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT: COACH PARADOXICALLY How do you effectively teach these two difficult-to-learn concepts that are required for successful hammer throwing? The usual method, of course, is through drills...|$|E

40|$|When a city {{requires}} on-site parking for all new housing, {{housing costs}} rise while {{the price of}} <b>driving</b> <b>falls.</b> This results in less housing and more driving. Minimum parking requirements are particularly troublesome for old, dense inner city neighborhoods. Many buildings constructed before World War II don’t have parking attached to them, and in dense center cities—where land is expensive, and lot sizes are small and irregular—parking can be extraordinarily expensive, if not impossible, to provide on-site. Thus many older in-city buildings sit unused, simply because they can’t provide enough parking to satisfy the zoning code. Measuring how parking requirements affect housing construction is difficult for a simple reason: parking requirements are everywhere. There is good theoretical {{reason to believe that}} relaxed parking requirements would result in more housing, and developers regularly say that left to their own devices, they would supply less parking. But because developers are almost never left to their own devices, the theory is hard to test...|$|R

50|$|The {{en masse}} model was {{proposed}} by volcanologist Stephen Sparks in 1976. Sparks attributed the poor sorting in ignimbrites to laminar flows {{of very high}} particle concentration. Pyroclastic flows were envisioned as being similar to debris flows, with a body undergoing laminar flow and then stopping en masse. The flow would travel as a plug flow, with an essentially non-deforming mass travelling on a thin shear zone, and the en masse freezing occurs when the <b>driving</b> stress <b>falls</b> below a certain level.

40|$|The Downs–Thomson paradox (D–T paradox) {{occurs when}} {{expansion}} of a congested and untolled highway undermines scale economies of a competing transit service, leaving users of both modes worse off. The standard {{analysis of the}} D–T paradox is based on several stringent assumptions: fixed total travel demand, perfect substitutability between automobile and transit trips, and no transit crowding. This paper re-examines the paradox when these assumptions are relaxed while retaining the usual assumption {{that there is no}} congestion interaction between the modes. It also broadens consideration to alternative transit administration regimes. In the standard treatment the transit operator is obliged to cover its costs. In this paper we also study two other regimes: transit profit maximization, and system-wide welfare maximization with no financing constraint. We examine how the transit system operator responds to highway capacity expansion in each regime, and how this affects welfare for drivers and transit users. We show that in all regimes the full price of transit declines only if the full price of <b>driving</b> <b>falls</b> as well. Thus, drivers are more likely to benefit from highway expansion than transit riders. The D–T paradox cannot occur in the profit maximization or unconstrained welfare maximization regimes. In the traditional self-financing regime transit service deteriorates, but the D–T paradox is not inevitable. Numerical analysis suggests that it can occur only when automobile and transit trips are nearly perfect substitutes...|$|R

50|$|Any {{escapement}} with {{sliding friction}} will need lubrication, but as this deteriorates the friction will increase, and, perhaps, insufficient power will {{be transferred to}} the timing device. If the timing device is a pendulum, the increased frictional forces will decrease the Q factor, increasing the resonance band, and decreasing its precision. For spring driven clocks, the impulse force applied by the spring changes as the spring is unwound, following Hooke's law. For gravity driven clocks, the impulse force also increases as the <b>driving</b> weight <b>falls</b> and more chain suspends the weight from the gear train; in practice, however, this effect is only seen in large public clocks, and it can be avoided by a closed-loop chain.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{employ a}} unique data set of {{approximately}} 2, 500 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises in China {{for the years}} 1997 - 1999 to identify the factors <b>driving</b> the <b>fall</b> in total energy use and energy intensity. Using an econometric approach that identifies sources of variation in energy intensity, we find that changing energy prices and research and development expenditures are significant drivers of declining energy intensity. Changes in ownership, region, and industry composition are less important. By identifying the contribution {{of each of these}} five factors, we reduce the size of the contribution of sectoral shift and identify specific sources of productivity gain. The association between differences in relative energy prices and measured energy intensities indicates that Chinese firms are responding to prices— something not largely observed in the past. In addition, the impact of R&D spending on energy intensity suggests that firms are using resources for energy saving innovations...|$|R
40|$|Using a meta-analytical {{research}} design, {{we analyzed}} subnational case studies (n = 132) on {{the causes of}} dryland degradation, {{also referred to as}} desertification, to determine whether the proximate causes and underlying <b>driving</b> forces <b>fall</b> into any pattern and to identify mediating factors, feedback mechanisms, cross-scalar dynamics, and typical pathways of dryland ecosystem change. Our results show that desertification is driven by a limited suite of recurrent core variables, of which the most prominent at the underlying level are climatic factors, economic factors, institutions, national policies, population growth, and remote influences. At the proximate level, these factors drive cropland expansion, overgrazing, and infrastructure extension. Identifiable regional patterns of synergies among causal factors, in combination with feedback mechanisms and regional land-use and environmental histories, make up specific pathways of land change for each region and time period. Understanding these pathways is crucial for appropriate policy interventions, which have to be fine-tuned to the region-specific dynamic patterns associated with desertification...|$|R
