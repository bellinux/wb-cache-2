40|$|Chemical {{defenses}} are common among organisms and represent {{some of the}} most complex adaptations for avoiding predation, yet our understanding of the ecological nature of these systems remains incomplete. <b>Poison</b> <b>frogs</b> are a group of chemically defended organisms that are dependent entirely on diet for chemical defense. In this study, I identified the dietary arthropods responsible for chemical defense in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs,</b> described spatial and temporal patterns in alkaloid composition of <b>poison</b> <b>frogs,</b> and established links between patterns of variation in alkaloid defense and arthropod diet in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> Identifying dietary sources and studying patterns of variation in alkaloid composition is fundamental to understanding the ecology and evolution of chemical defense in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> ^ The dendrobatid <b>poison</b> <b>frog</b> Oophaga pumilio shares many alkaloids in common with other <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> and is known to vary in alkaloid composition throughout its geographic range. I designed my dissertation to take advantage of these characteristics and use O. pumilio as a model species for the study of chemical defense in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> Here, I identified siphonotid millipedes as a source for spiropyrrolizidine alkaloids, formicine ants as a source for pumiliotoxin alkaloids, and oribatid mites as dietary sources for the majority of alkaloids found in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> I found that alkaloid composition varied spatially and temporally, on both small and large scales, within and among populations of O. pumilio. Alkaloid variation between populations was related to geographic distance, and closer populations tended to have alkaloid compositions more similar to each other than to distant populations. ^ The findings of my study suggest that oribatid mites are the most important dietary source of alkaloids in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> However, overall alkaloid defense in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> is based on a combination of dietary arthropods, including mites, ants, millipedes, and beetles. Variation in chemical defenses of <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> is due to (1) spatial and temporal differences in the presence of alkaloids in certain arthropods and (2) differences in the availability of certain alkaloid-containing arthropods, which are likely the result of differences as well as successional changes in forest structure among locations and through time. ...|$|R
50|$|The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart <b>frog,</b> {{while not}} the most toxic <b>poison</b> dart <b>frog,</b> is still a highly toxic animal. The very small amount of <b>poison</b> the <b>frog</b> {{possesses}} {{is enough to make}} a human heart stop beating. However, like most <b>poison</b> dart <b>frogs,</b> the green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart <b>frog</b> only releases its poison if it feels threatened, and wild specimens can be handled provided the human holding it is calm and relaxed. The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart <b>frog,</b> as with all <b>poison</b> dart <b>frogs,</b> loses its toxicity in captivity due to a change in diet. This has led some scientists to believe that the green-and-black <b>poison</b> <b>frog</b> actually takes its poison from the mites and other insects on which it feeds.|$|R

40|$|Alkaloids in {{the skin}} glands of <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> serve as a {{chemical}} defense against predation, {{and almost all of}} these alkaloids appear to be sequestered from dietary arthropods. Certain alkaloid-containing ants have been considered the primary dietary source, but dietary sources for the majority of alkaloids remain unknown. Herein we report the presence of ≈ 80 alkaloids from extracts of oribatid mites collected throughout Costa Rica and Panama, which represent 11 of the ≈ 24 structural classes of alkaloids known in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> Forty-one of these alkaloids also occur in the dendrobatid <b>poison</b> <b>frog,</b> Oophaga pumilio, which co-occurs with the collected mites. These shared alkaloids include twenty-five 5, 8 -disubstituted or 5, 6, 8 -trisubstituted indolizidines; one 1, 4 -disubstituted quinolizidine; three pumiliotoxins; and one homopumiliotoxin. All but the last of these alkaloid classes occur widely in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> In addition, nearly 40 alkaloids of unknown structure were detected in mites; none of these alkaloids have been identified in frog extracts. Two of these alkaloids are homopumiliotoxins, five appear to be izidines, four appear to be tricyclics, and six are related in structure to <b>poison</b> <b>frog</b> alkaloids that are currently unclassified as to structure. Mites are common in the diet of O. pumilio, {{as well as in the}} diets of other <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> The results of this study indicate that mites are a significant arthropod repository of a variety of alkaloids and represent a major dietary source of alkaloids in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs...</b>|$|R

50|$|Since easily {{purchased}} {{foods are}} not {{rich in the}} alkaloids required to produce batrachotoxins, captive frogs do not produce toxins and they eventually lose their toxicity in captivity. In fact, many hobbyists and herpetologists have reported that most dart frogs will not consume ants at all in captivity, though ants constitute the larger portion of their diets in the wild, likely due to the unavailability of the natural prey species of ants to captive frog keepers. Though all <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> lose their toxicity when deprived of certain foods, and captive-bred golden <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> are born harmless, a wild-caught <b>poison</b> <b>frog</b> can retain alkaloids for years.

50|$|Like {{all members}} of the genus Phyllobates, Golfodulcean <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> have highly potent {{neurotoxic}} alkaloid poisons in their skin.
