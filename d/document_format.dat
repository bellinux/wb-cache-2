25|$|The Open <b>Document</b> <b>Format</b> for Office Applications (ODF), {{also known}} as OpenDocument, is an XML-based file format for spreadsheets, charts, presentations and word {{processing}} documents.

25|$|Initially, Microsoft {{promised to}} support {{exporting}} to Portable <b>Document</b> <b>Format</b> (PDF) in Office 2007. However, due to legal objections from Adobe Systems, Office 2007 originally {{did not offer}} PDF support out of the box, {{but rather as a}} separate free download. However, starting with Service Pack 2, Office allows users to natively export PDF files.|$|E
25|$|A {{key feature}} of two-sided markets is the novel pricing {{strategies}} and business models they employ. In order to attract {{one group of}} users, the network sponsor may subsidize the other group of users. Historically, for example, Adobe's portable <b>document</b> <b>format</b> (PDF) did not succeed until Adobe priced the PDF reader at zero, substantially increasing sales of PDF writers.|$|E

25|$|A {{key part}} of the Cocoa {{architecture}} is its comprehensive views model. This is organized along conventional lines for an application framework, but is based on the Portable <b>Document</b> <b>Format</b> (PDF) drawing model provided by Quartz. This allows creating custom drawing content using PostScript-like drawing commands, which also allows automatic printer support and so forth. Since the Cocoa framework manages all the clipping, scrolling, scaling and other chores of drawing graphics, the programmer is freed from implementing basic infrastructure and can concentrate on the unique aspects of an application's content.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the work}} that went into {{developing}} OpenStep was applied to developing Mac OS X, Cocoa being the most visible part. However, differences exist. For example, NeXTSTEP and OpenStep used Display PostScript for on-screen display of text and graphics, while Cocoa depends on Apple's Quartz (which uses the Portable <b>Document</b> <b>Format</b> (PDF) imaging model, but not its underlying technology). Cocoa also has a level of Internet support, including the NSURL and WebKit HTML classes, and others, while OpenStep had only rudimentary support for managed network connections via NSFileHandle classes and Berkeley sockets.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} automation of {{the crystal}} structure determination process has resulted in ever higher publishing rates of new crystal structures and, consequentially, new publishing models. Minimalistic articles contain only crystal structure tables, structure images, and, possibly, abstract-like structure description. They tend {{to be published in}} author-financed or subsidized open-access journals. Acta Crystallographica Section E and Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Kristallographie belong in this category. More elaborate contributions may go to traditional subscriber-financed journals. Hybrid journals, on the other hand, embed individual author-financed open-access articles among subscriber-financed ones. Publishers may also make scientific articles available online, as Portable <b>Document</b> <b>Format</b> (PDF) files.|$|E
