500|$|Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank: Chosen {{out of six}} {{unwanted}} pregnancies and {{the first}} child to be legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in the insurance business and a lovely wife, but he eventually notices that his environment {{is not what it}} seems to be. Robin Williams was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in [...] because Carrey's performance reminded him of Charlie Chaplin. Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being typecast in comedic roles. Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do The Truman Show for $12 million. Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's improvisational skills, and the two became more interactive. The scene in which Truman declares [...] "this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy" [...] to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.|$|E

Derek Sanderson, considered the best at faceoffs in the late 60s and 70s, related how his father had him watch Kennedy on the TV to learn the skill. In a 1987 interview Kennedy told a reporter, [...] "I went all-out at face-offs. Your centre is your quarterback and our other guys knew exactly what I was trying to do." [...] In the 1970s, GM of the Leafs, Jim Gregory asked Kennedy if he would help the team to improve their face-off performance. Kennedy agreed but with one stipulation.

500|$|The film's title, Road to Perdition, is both Michael Sullivan and his son's {{destination}} {{town and}} {{a euphemism for}} Hell, a road that Sullivan desires to prevent his son from traveling. Sullivan, who chooses his violent path early on in life, considers himself irredeemable and seeks to save his son from a similar fate. Said Mendes, [...] " [...] is in a battle {{for the soul of}} his son. Can a man who has led a bad life achieve redemption through his child?" [...] Hanks described Sullivan as a man who achieved a comfortable status through violent means, whose likely repercussions he ignored. Sullivan is a good father and husband, but also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> that requires him to be a violent killer. The film explores this paradoxical dichotomy. When Sullivan is faced with the consequences, Hanks says, [...] "At the moment we're dropped into the story, it is literally the last day of that false perspective." [...] To keep Sullivan from justifying his violent actions in the film, Mendes omitted scenes in the final cut that had Sullivan explaining his background to his son.|$|E
