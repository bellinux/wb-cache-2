30|$|The {{binocular}} {{camera is}} {{converted into a}} digital signal through a special decoder chip processor for receiving and processing, and the processing results sent via the SPI bus to the Zigbee module; the Zigbee module can also be through the SPI bus to the main processor which sends control signals to control the FPGA worker process. The acceleration sensor, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and video decoder chip exchange information with the main controller via I 2 C bus. The temperature and humidity sensors are read through the 8 -bit ADC interface. The heat release external sensor monitors the human body by triggering the external interrupt of the main control module.|$|E
25|$|Like any {{magnetic}} device, compasses {{are affected}} by nearby ferrous materials, {{as well as by}} strong local <b>electromagnetic</b> forces. <b>Compasses</b> used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields (car electrical systems, automobile engines, steel pitons, etc.) as that can affect their accuracy. Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the vehicle's ignition and charging systems generally result in significant compass errors.|$|R

We will investigate hybrid meson production via pion-photon Primakoff and pion-Pomeron diffractive interactions. We will determine new properties of quark-antiquark-gluon hybrid mesons, using unique production methods, to improve our understanding of these exotic mesons.

40|$|The COMPASS {{experiment}} at the CERN SPS {{is dedicated}} to hadron physics with a broad research programme, including {{the study of the}} nucleon spin structure using muons as a probe and a variety of issues in meson spectroscopy using hadron beams. The two stage fixed target spectrometer with electromagnetic (em) and hadronic calorimetry in both stages provides photon detection in a wide angular range. As discussed in this paper, the COMPASS em calorimetry plays a crucial rôle for the Hadron programme started in 2008 {{as well as for the}} planned COMPASS future programme of measuring GPDs via exclusive DVCS photons. We present the photon detection coverage foreseen, and first, preliminary results characterising the present performances of both existing <b>COMPASS</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> calorimeters, based on test beam data taken at CERN T 9 facility end of 2007...|$|R
40|$|SLAC {{performs}} large-scale simulations for the next-generation accelerator design using higher-order finite elements. This method requires using valid curved meshes {{and adaptive}} mesh refinement in complex 3 D curved domains {{to achieve its}} fast rate of convergence. ITAPS has developed a procedure to address those mesh requirements to enable petascale electromagnetic accelerator simulations by SLAC. The results demonstrate that those correct valid curvilinear meshes can not only make the simulation more reliable but also improve computational efficiency up to 30 %. This paper presents a procedure to track moving adaptive mesh refinement in curved domains. The procedure is capable of generating suitable curvilinear meshes to enable large-scale accelerator simulations. The procedure can generate valid curved meshes with substantially fewer elements to improve the computational efficiency and reliability of the <b>COMPASS</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> analyses. Future work {{will focus on the}} scalable parallelization of all steps for petascale simulations...|$|R

The COMPASS experiment is currently under construction, and scheduled to begin data runs in 2001. We carry out simulation studies to optimize the beam, detector, trigger, and hardware/software for achieving high statistics data with low systematic uncertainties in the hybrid meson component of this program. We will improve previous Primakoff Hybrid studies by three orders of magnitude. We implement special detectors and triggers for hybrid meson production reactions. We propose to prepare for these COMPASS pion beam hybrid studies by setting up with muon beam tests.
