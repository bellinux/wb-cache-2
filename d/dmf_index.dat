40|$|Introduction: Sense of {{coherence}} (SOC) is {{hypothesized to}} be an important psychological factor that enables people to cope with stressors and successfully maintain and improve health. Very few publications report on the relationship between “salutogenesis,” as measured by the concept of SOC and oral health status. However, {{little is known about the}} relationship between the mother's SOC and dental caries of their children. Aims and Objectives: The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of mother's SOC level on dental caries status of their children. Materials and Methods: A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted with the children aged 4 – 8 years attending public school (n = 200). Questionnaires were applied to mothers to obtain level of SOC. Dental caries status in children was assessed using decayed, missing, filled tooth surfaces (DMFS) and/or <b>dmfs</b> <b>index.</b> One-way analysis of variance F-test and post hoc Tukey test were used to assess the effect of mother's SOC level on their children's caries <b>dmfs</b> <b>index.</b> Results: Mean of dmfs and/or DMFS in children showed statistically significant relation with their mother's SOC level (P < 0. 01). On intergroup comparison, significant (P < 0. 01) difference was found when mean of dmfs and/or DMFS with mothers having low SOC and high SOC was compared. However, there was no significant relation when mean was compared to mothers with medium and low SOC. Conclusion: Dental caries of children gets influenced by mother's SOC level.

Caries was recorded according to WHO criteria. 5, 538 subjects were examined. Information on the children's and their parents' social, behavioral, ethnic and demographic status was obtained {{through a series of}} closed questions. Bivariate analysis was performed to investigate the association between caries and background characteristics. The probability of being an extra zero for the <b>dmfs</b> <b>index</b> was estimated via the zero-inflated negative binomial regression model (ZINB). 78. 4 % (95 % CI = 77. 2 - 79. 6) of the children were caries-free. The national mean <b>dmfs</b> <b>index</b> was 1. 36 (95 % CI = 1. 15 - 1. 57), ranging from 1. 22 (95 % CI = 1. 03 - 1. 42) in the Italian North-East to 1. 73 (95 % CI = 0. 83 - 2. 63) in the South section. Significant bivariate associations between caries experience and risk factors were observed for parents' nationality (not Italian vs. Italian: p 13 months: p = 0. 038) and early tooth eruption (< 6 months as reference: p = 0. 004). Multivariable analysis (ZINB) showed that children with a low caries risk level had a higher probability of being an extra zero; in particular, children from fathers with a high educational level showed a probability of being an extra zero of 0. 22.

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of dental caries among an urban population. Methods This study was conducted among 2000 people 15 - 40 years of age living in Kurdistan, Iran in 2015. Using a questionnaire, data were collected by 4 trained dental students. The dependent variable was the decayed, missing, and filled teeth (<b>DMF)</b> <b>index.</b> Using principal component analysis, the socioeconomic status (SES) of families was determined based on their household assets. Inequality was measured using the concentration index; in addition, the Oaxaca analytical method was used to determine the contribution of various determinants to the observed inequality. Results The concentration index for poor scores on the <b>DMF</b> <b>index</b> was - 0. 32 (95 % confidence interval [CI], - 0. 40 to - 0. 36); thus, poor DMF indices had a greater concentration in groups with a low SES (p< 0. 001). Decomposition analysis showed that the mean prevalence of a poor <b>DMF</b> <b>index</b> was 43. 7 % (95 % CI, 40. 4 to 46. 9 %) in the least privileged group and 14. 4 % (95 % CI, 9. 5 to 9. 2 %) in the most privileged group. It was found that 85. 8 % of the gap observed between these groups was due to differences in sex, parents’ education, and the district of residence. A poor <b>DMF</b> <b>index</b> was less prevalent among people with higher SES than among those with lower SES (odds ratio, 0. 31; 95 % CI, 0. 19 to 0. 52).

40|$|Background/Aim. It is {{considered}} that over 450 million people worldwide suffer from {{some form of}} mental disorder. Previous studies in other countries have shown that schizophrenia {{is among the most}} frequent. Oral health is significant for general health and should not be separated from mental health. Studies in other countries have shown an increased incidence of carious and extracted teeth, and less incidence of filled teeth in this group of psychiatric patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish condition of the existing teeth, to determine the prevalence of caries and to consider possible risk factors that contribute to the current oral health status of hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Methods. The study comprised 190 patients with schizophrenia, hospitalized at the Clinic for Psychiatric Disorders “Dr. Laza Lazarević” in Belgrade, and 190 mentally healthy patients at the Clinic for Periodontology and Oral Medicine, Faculty of Dental Medicine in Belgrade. The decayed, missing, filled (<b>DMF)</b> <b>index,</b> sociodemographic and economic characteristics were registered in both groups, as well as characteristics of the primary disease of hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Results. The value of <b>DMF</b> <b>index</b> (representing the sum of carious, extracted and filled teeth), in the hospitalized patients with schizophrenia was 18. 57 ± 7. 07 and 12. 47 ± 5. 64 in the healthy group (p = 0. 000).

Presence of plaque was recorded in 142 subjects (34. 0 %) and it was related to caries experience (20. 1 % without caries and 13. 9 % with caries) but not statistically significant. In logistic analysis, the socioeconomic status families were positively associated with caries experience OR= 1. 4 (95 % CI: 1. 2 - 1. 9). Subjects with high sweet foods consumption showed a higher risk (60 %) of caries experience than those not OR= 1. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 1 - 2. 3). Children who cared for themselves regarding oral hygiene habits showed a lower risk for caries (OR= 0. 4 95 % CI: 0. 2 - 0. 7). Conclusion This study documented widespread neglect of dental health of preschool children in Sardinia. Untreated decayed teeth dominated the dmfs score among examined population, indicating {{a high rate of}} treatment needs...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies on}} the {{prevalence}} of caries {{have been carried out}} predominantly in western industrial nations. Because of the scanty data, the interesting climate and the geographical situation of Egypt this study was made there. The surprising results of this work should be added as an example for a developing country. The aim {{of the present study was}} to record the prevalence of caries, the degree of sanitation of teeth the condition of oral hygiene and the indication of fluorosis in an examination of a cross-section of 11 - 12 -year-old schoolchildren in urban and rural regions of Egypt. After making an initial study in 1996 the main epidemiological study was carried out oriented on the general guidelines laid down by the WHO. 200 schoolchildren were examined in four different regions of Egypt. In order to obtain different levels of civilization two locations in rural (Marsa Matruh and El Tur/Sinai) and urban (Cairo and Assuan) areas of Egypt were chosen. The analysis of the data collected was made using the <b>DMF</b> <b>indices</b> (DMF/T and DMF/S) and the grading of oral hygiene was in accordance with the approximal plaque index (API). Water analyses were taken in each city and the natural level of fluoride was determined. Possible correlations with the DMF-index or oral hygiene were also verified...|$|R

Objective. To assess {{whether or not there}} was any change in the dental caries and rate of salivary flow of patients with Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) and the contribution of salivary flow to caries risk in IDDM. Setting. Department of Endocrinology, MS Ramaiah Hospital, Bangalore, India. Design. A comparative cross-sectional descriptive type. Materials and Methods. The sample consisted of two groups: 140 diabetic group (mean age 14. 8 yr) and 140 nondiabetic group (mean age 13. 7 yr). Dental caries by dmf(t) and <b>dmf(s)</b> <b>indices</b> for primary dentition andDMF(T) andDMF(S) indices was used in permanent dentition to assess the dental caries experience. Both stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow rate were assessed after collection of saliva. Results. In diabetic group 76 % had carious lesion and in nondiabetic group 85. 3 % had carious lesion. Diabetics have lower mean DMFT, DMFS, dmft, and dmfs compared to the nondiabetic group. Diminished unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rate in diabetic than nondiabetic group. Conclusions. The findings obtained conclude that even though there was reduced salivary flow rate in diabetic group the caries prevalence was low. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and aims}}   The {{fluoride}} of water {{can increase the}} resistance of enamel of teeth against dental caries. In places with low fluoride level in potable water, dental caries is very high before puberty. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the fluoride level of potable water of Ilam- Iran and it's relation to DMF criteria in workers of industrial city of Ilam.   Methods   This study was done in fall of 1999 on the 320 workers which their age was between 20 - 34 (x ± SD: 28. 1 ± 1) years old by descriptive analytical method. The factories were selected by  cluster sampling and workers were selected by random sampling from different socio-economic  status.   Results   The mean concentration of fluoride in potable water was 0. 28 mg/l which is lower the standard limit. The average value for <b>DMF</b> <b>Index</b> was 4. 3 in workers. There was a significant negative correlation between fluoride control of potable water and number of DMF teeth (r= 0. 1, p= 0. 01). The lowest value of <b>DMF</b> <b>index</b> was in range of 20 - 23 years old. When the fluoride content of water was higher, the dental caries was lower.   Conclusion   The addition of fluoride to potable water to about 1 mg/l, health educational  programs and fortification of foods in Industrial regions and factories is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{study had}} the {{objective}} {{to check the}} dental caries prevalence in the children attend by the communitarian agents of health of the Program Health of the Family of the District of Mosqueiro, City of Belém, State of Pará, Brazil, {{with the purpose of}} subsidizing the projection of the actions of promotion, prevention and treatment of the staff of oral health. Method: 887 children were examined in the age groups from 18 to 36 months, 5 years and 12 years of age in accordance with the standards recommended by the WHO, checking the events of the caries in the studied population. Results: The caries prevalence in the population of the district of Mosqueiro to 18 - 36 months of age was 31. 68 %, progressing in spite of passing the ages, brought near attacking 63. 69 % of the 12 -year-old children. The decayed, to be extracted, filled index (DEF index) to five years found in Mosqueiro went of 3. 57 and the decayed, missing, filled index (<b>DMF</b> <b>index)</b> to 12 years went of 1, 80. Regarding the marks proposed by the World Health Organization for the year of 2000, the reached only one was in the age of 12 -year-old children, in which the <b>DMF</b> <b>index</b> of 1, 80 was less than three.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{cross-sectional}} study of the prevalence of caries {{in a sample of}} 3, 237 children aged 5 to 21 are described in relation to some objectives of the WHO program. The prevalence of caries is high in the sample: 1. 31. 5 % of the children aged 5 to 6 are free of caries (according to the WHO objectives, 50 % of the children aged 5 to 6 should have no caries), 2. the mean number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMF/T index) in children aged 11 to 12 is 6. 6 (The DMF/T should be {{less than or equal to}} 3). The frequency of toothbrushing is distributed as follows: 23 % of the children brush their teeth once a week or less, 46 % brush their teeth once a day, and 31 % brush their teeth twice a day or more. The purpose and the frequency of the consultations at the dentist's office have been examined: 15 % of the children never consult the dentist, 44 % consult the dentist in case of toothache, and 41 % go to the dentist's office for screening or control. Only 3. 2 % of the children use regularly and appropriately fluoride tablets. Since the variance of the results is large, it is difficult to distinguish explaining variables or determinants. However, the data indicate that social groups show differences in <b>DMF</b> <b>indices</b> as well as in the behaviors associated with dental hygiene and prevention...|$|R
40|$|Background : Increasing {{numbers of}} {{preschool}} {{children are being}} referred for specialist dental management in a paediatric hospital. Most cases have severe early childhood caries and require comprehensive management under general anaesthesia. The present study investigated risk factors for disease presence at initial consultation. Methods : A convenience sample of 125 children under four years of age from the north Brisbane region were examined and caries experience recorded using dmft and <b>dmfs</b> <b>indices.</b> A self-administered questionnaire obtained information regarding social, demographic, birth, neonatal, infant feeding and dental health behaviour variables. The data were analysed using the chi-square and {{one-way analysis of variance}} procedures. Results : Ninety-four per cent of referred children had severe ECC with mean dmft of 10. 5 ± 3. 8 and mean dmfs of 27. 1 ± 15. 1. Prevalence of severe ECC was significantly higher in children allowed a sweetened liquid in the infant feeding bottle (99 per cent) and allowed to sip from an infant feeding bottle during the day (100 per cent). Mean dmfs was significantly higher in children allowed to sleep with a bottle (28. 7) and sip from a bottle during the day (29. 9), children from a non-Caucasian background (31. 8), those children that commenced regular toothbrushing between 6 to 12 months of age (28. 1), had no current parental supervision of daily tooth-brushing (34. 2) and had not taken daily fluoride supplements (27. 8), vitamin supplements (27. 8) or prescription medicine previously (27. 6). Conclusions : The behavioural determinants for severe early childhood caries presence in hospital-referred children were similar to those identified in the regional preschool population...|$|R
40|$|To {{verify the}} {{relationship}} between lead concentration in the enamel of deciduous teeth {{and the presence of}} enamel defects and, consequently, with dental caries among preschool children. The sample consisted of 329 preschool children in Piracicaba, State of São Paulo: 132 attending municipal kindergartens close to industrial plants and 197 attending kindergartens in non-industrial areas. This sample belonged to an initial study made between 2000 and 2001, in which the lead concentration was obtained by means of enamel biopsy. Oral clinical examination of the children from both regions was performed to verify the prevalence of enamel defects, using the Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) Index of the World Dental Federation (FDI), and of dental caries, using the decayed, missing and filled surfaces (<b>dmfs)</b> <b>index</b> of the World Health Organization. The chi-squared test and relative risk calculation were utilized in relation to a significance level of 5 %, considering each region separately. Among the children from the non-industrial area, there was a higher proportion with dental caries among those with higher lead concentrations in deciduous teeth (p= 0. 02). This was not, however, observed among the children from the industrial area (p= 0. 89). There was an increased relative risk (RR) of caries among the children from the non-industrial area, but this was not seen among the children from the industrial area. No relationship was observed between the presence of lead and enamel defects. No data was found that would give evidence of a relationship between lead concentration and enamel defects in either of the areas studied. No relationship was found between lead and dental caries in the industrial area, thus emphasizing that more studies of such relationships are needed...|$|R
