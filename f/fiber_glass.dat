5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon <b>fiber,</b> <b>glass</b> can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E

25|$|Jeff Kleiser and {{a special}} effects team working on Stargate (1994) the film, used around 40 people and used self-written image-creation and {{composition}} software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by Ra and the Horus guards. The pharaoh mask in the opening credits was made out of <b>fiber</b> <b>glass</b> and was modeled in the workshop. The sequence was filmed with a motion-control camera to give a better depth of field. The film was originally planned to play out in a chronological order, but when Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich edited the film to tighten the narrative, they decided to change the first scene of the film into a flashback to show who the human host of Ra was before the aliens took him. The Jaffa (from Stargate SG-1) look in the series was copied from the Egyptian look of Ra from the film. The look of the Goa'uld, such as Apophis, was initially based on Ra in the feature film.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this research, {{friction}} {{coefficients of}} composite {{materials such as}} gear fiber reinforced plastic (gear <b>fiber)</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced plastic (<b>glass</b> <b>fiber)</b> are investigated and compared. In the experiments, gear <b>fiber</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> slide against different austenitic stainless steels such as stainless steel 201 (SS 201) and stainless steel 301 (SS 301). Experiments are carried out at low loads 2, 4 and 6 N, low sliding velocities 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 m/s and relative humidity 70 %. The obtained results reveal that in general, friction coefficient of gear <b>fiber</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> increases {{with the increase in}} normal load and sliding velocity. Results show that friction coefficient of glass fiber-SS 201 pair is the highest and gear fiber-SS 301 pair is the lowest within the observed range of normal load and sliding velocity. On the other hand, it is found that friction coefficient of glass fiber-SS 301 pair is slightly higher than that of gear fiber-SS 201 pair. During the running-in process, friction coefficient of gear <b>fiber</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> steadily increases with the increase in rubbing time and after certain duration of rubbing, it remains constant regardless of the counterface material. The obtained results reveal that for the observed range, the influence of normal load on the frictional properties of gear fibe and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> is greater than that of sliding velocity. At identical operating conditions, the magnitudes of friction coefficient of gear <b>fiber</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> are different depending on normal load, sliding velocity and counterface material...|$|R
500|$|Bushings are {{the major}} expense in <b>fiber</b> <b>glass</b> production. [...] The nozzle design is also critical. [...] The number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in {{multiples}} of 200. [...] The {{important part of the}} nozzle in continuous filament manufacture is the thickness of its walls in the exit region. [...] It was found that inserting a counterbore here reduced wetting. [...] Today, the nozzles are designed to have a minimum thickness at the exit. [...] As glass flows through the nozzle, it forms a drop which is suspended from the end. [...] As it falls, it leaves a thread attached by the meniscus to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation. [...] The smaller the annular ring of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit, the faster the drop will form and fall away, and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle. [...] The surface tension of the glass is what influences the formation of the meniscus. [...] For E-glass it should be around 400mN/m.|$|E
