40|$|An issue confronting U. S. policymakers {{is whether}} {{restrictions}} on securities activities of U. S. commercial banks {{ought to be}} abolished within a broader program of banking and financial market deregulation. The <b>Euro-bond</b> market offers an opportunity to examine {{the performance of a}} largely unregulated securities market and the behavior of U. S. commercial bank affiliates within that market. In this paper, we present evidence on the development and performance of the <b>Euro-bond</b> market over the last 20 years and then infer the likely consequences if a similar level of deregulation and competition were permitted in the United States. Data on the level of competition is presented along with an analysis of underwriting strategies and innovations that have been pursued in the market. The most serious criticisms concerning <b>Euro-bond</b> market operations [...] e. g. excessive spreads, conflicts of interest, and the Grey market [...] are reviewed. Overall, the evidence suggests that the <b>Euro-bond</b> market has experienced dynamic and vigorous growth, resulting in net benefits to both borrowers and lenders without exposing the financial instituitons to significant risks. Large U. S. companies regularly tap the <b>Euro-bond</b> market and capture some of these benefits. Allowing U. S. commercial bank affiliates to compete in the U. S. securities markets could make these benefits more certain and expand their availability toall firms with a minimal increase in risk to the safety and soundness of the banking system. ...|$|E
40|$|The euro zone crisis {{illustrates}} the insufficiency of adjustment mechanisms in a monetary union {{characterized by a}} large heterogeneity. Firstly, the paper gives an evaluation of exchange rate misalignments inside the euro zone, using a FEER approach (Jeong, Mazier and Saadaoui, 2010). Using panel econometric techniques over the period 1994 - 2010, we confirm that the exchange rate misalignments in the euro zone have diverged, reflecting unsustainable evolutions. Secondly, we use a “stock-flow consistent” model of a monetary union with two countries {{along the lines of}} Godley and Lavoie (2007) and Duwicquet and Mazier (2010). A federal budget is introduced with federal expenditures and social transfers financed by federal taxes and <b>euro-bonds</b> issuing. The stabilizing role of such a federal budget is confirmed facing asymmetric shock or the negative impact of exchange rate misalignments inside the monetary union. Similarly, the stabilizing role of <b>euro-bonds</b> used to finance European investment projects is illustrated. ...|$|R
40|$|Description: This paper aims {{to provide}} a brief {{analysis}} of the Ruiz Zambrano judgment (Case C- 34 / 09). Traditionally, the EU citizenship has been mainly construed as a status of integration into the Member States of the Union: a status of transnational integration. The basic claim developed in these pages is that, with Zambrano, the EUCJ moved away from a concept of transnational integration to one of genuine European integration, thus fostering a new vision, based {{on the existence of}} <b>Euro-bonds.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{opportunity}} to create a Central Agency of European Debt (CAED) to improve the coordination between the issuances of sovereign debt in the EMU, by allowing the Agency to issue euro – bonds and determine the optimal proportion of foreign currency denominated debt and the corresponding maturity at the EMU level. We argue that this Agency could decrease both the overall cost of sovereign debt at the EMU level {{and the cost of}} sovereign debt of the individual EMU countries, including the strongest members (Germany, the Netherlands). Such a mechanism requires four economic conditions: a collective guarantee by members for the <b>euro-bonds,</b> a marking-to-market process for each individual member, a seniority of existing sovereign debt, and an internal sovereign swap market between the members of this Agency...|$|R
40|$|The Greek and Irish crises have {{highlighted}} {{one of the}} shortcomings of Economic and Monetary Union, namely {{that there is no}} mechanism for preventing and dealing with public debt crises in the euro area (ea). In this context, we analyse the possibility of joint issuance of debt securities by euro area governments managed by a European Debt Agency (eda). The eda could fulfil three main objectives : 1)  enhancement of the budgetary coordination within the ea ; 2) reinforcement of the ea financial stability ; and 3) financing of ea member states at optimal costs, the traditional mandate of a national debt agency. Our proposal favours the first objective by implementing effective means of supervising and coordinating fiscal policies. Moreover, this eda, being de facto a crisis support mechanism, improves also the ea financial stability. Furthermore, it would increase the liquidity of the securities issued pushing down participating countries financial costs. From a practical perspective, we analyse the model for an agency that would issue <b>euro-bonds</b> and re-lend to participating countries. It would have a decision making body, or Board, that would set the quantities to be issued and/or the prices to be paid {{as a function of the}} fundamentals of the participating countries. The agency would be independently governed, thus making it possible to raise prices, reduce amounts and even deny access to financing for the least virtuous countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Luxembourg {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} financial centers in the world. Initially associated with international syndicated loans, <b>euro-bonds</b> and euro-currency markets, Luxembourg has developed as a center for private banking and is currently the second largest center for the domiciliation of investment funds in the world after the US - with a portfolio equivalent to about sixty times the country’s GDP -, and the first captive reinsurance market in the European Union. As in many other financial centers, the interbank market plays an important role. This partly reflects intra-group operations of foreign banks using their Luxembourg branches and subsidiaries to adjust their liquidity position. More generally, Luxembourg has attracted foreign banks seeking to benefit from its favorable regulatory framework, political stability, language skills of the local workforce and the agglomeration of specialized skills in accounting and legal services. The importance of the financial sector in Luxembourg implies that a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with explicit modeling of the financial sector is indispensable in order to properly take into account the interaction between the financial and the real sector in the economy and the interconnectedness between different financial institutional sectors (e. g. commercial banks and investment funds). Explicit modeling of the financial sector also allows for an analysis of how the economy might respond to financial shocks. This dissertation contributes to the literature by developing two analytical tools: 1. en Sciences économiques et de gestioninfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the legal and}} institutional aspects relating to risk-sharing mechanisms at EU level. For this purpose, an attempt will first be made to define a “risk-sharing mechanism” and the relevant legal framework, most notably the no bail-out clause included in Article 125 TFEU. Following this, the paper will discuss the core legal and institutional considerations relating to the European Stability Mechanism, prospects for <b>euro-bonds</b> and some variations of fiscal stabilisation mechanisms that have been presented in the discussion. In addition, the brief considers the June 2015 Five Presidents’ Report on Completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union and the plans it presents for further risk-sharing among the Member States {{and some of the}} earlier proposals that have been discussed in this context, even if they have not been included in the Five Presidents’ Report. The brief places these proposals in a broader framework of legitimacy, accountability and “fairness”, which {{in the context of the}} recent EMU Reports have usually been approached as separate or additional considerations. The argument made here is, however, that a more stable EMU needs to be broadly experienced as legitimate and fair. Consequently, these questions should be addressed together, as key considerations relating to the broader framework of how decisions are made in the EMU.
