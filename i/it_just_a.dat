Rowling found the book easy to write, finishing <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> year after she had begun writing it. The book sold 68,000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom and since has sold over three million in the country. The book won the 1999 Whitbread Children's Book Award, the Bram Stoker Award, the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, and was short-listed for other awards, including the Hugo.|$|E
5|$|Theophilus, {{through his}} father, {{applied to the}} Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking {{to have a new}} license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and {{received}} a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the Daily Post dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever heard over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.|$|E

Both entities are related and they can be calculated from each other.|$|E
25|$|By 1820, Kotahena {{had become}} the {{headquarters}} of the Oratorian Fathers. The church on the site naturally became the principal Catholic church of Colombo, and of a newly unified British Ceylon. With the installation of Reverend Vincent Rozairo Dias as the first Vicar Apostolic of Colombo at St. Lucia’s on 14 January 1838, the little church was elevated to a Cathedral status. Sixteen years later in 1836, the church saw its one of its most notable events, with the remains of Fr. Monteiro c’e Setuvel, one of the first missionaries in Ceylon, being brought in a procession and interred within <b>it.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> year later, the Most Rev. Vincente de Rozario, an Oratorian from Goa was formally installed as the first Vicar Apostolic of Ceylon.|$|E

At age 16, he began working six-day weeks on a commercial boat captained by his father, catching sardines. The job was [...] "extremely hard" [...] for Rivera, who {{was more interested in}} becoming a mechanic. He decided to give up fishing as a career after abandoning a capsizing [...] commercial boat as a 19-year-old, and after his uncle died from injuries suffered on a fishing boat. Rivera continued to play sports during his teenage years but eventually quit soccer after a series of ankle and knee injuries around age 17. Consequently, he shifted his attention to baseball but considered <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> hobby rather than a possible profession.|$|E
500|$|... "Meat" [...] {{was made}} {{alongside}} [...] "Sleeper", the second {{episode of the}} series which was also directed by Teague, as part of block two of production which ran from 3 June to 5 July 2007. It originally had the working title [...] "Another Working Day". In discussing {{the origins of the}} central alien writer Catherine Tregenna states that [...] "we were just throwing ideas around and true to form Russell [...] said [...] "why isn't <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> great big whale in a warehouse?"" [...] Davies states the alien was designed to be [...] "one of Torchwood and Doctor Whos biggest monsters" [...] not in terms of concept but its [...] "literal size". He felt this provided insight into [...] "the strangeness of life". Producer Richard Stokes states that the concept design team created an idea of what they envisaged the whale to look like. Tregenna felt that the original design for the creature was [...] "a little fanciful" [...] in that it was a bit too [...] "beautiful and exotic" [...] before deciding [...] "if it looked like that they [...] would exhibit it, it would be a freak show." [...] She characterises the final design as resembling [...] "a giant kebab". Contrary to observations from commentators, Tregenna did not intend the story to promote vegetarianism as she is not a vegetarian— she simply wanted to write an episode that was more action based than her series one episodes ("Out of Time" [...] and [...] "Captain Jack Harkness"). The hypothetical size of the space whale resulted in Teague having to find this [...] "huge great warehouse" [...] and hire a fifty-foot crane for camera angles. Whilst {{the main body of the}} alien was created using computer-generated imagery a prosthetic version of the cut wound in the side of the alien was available for the actors to interact with on set. Actor Eve Myles describes it as being like filming within a [...] "blood soaked, soppy big sponge". The opening of the creature's eye was created using green screen. Owen felt having to react to this to be the most unusual acting experience he'd had whilst filming Torchwood.|$|E

[...] When the steamer began moving up the slough, it took two hours to clear out the obstructions. [...] While the crew of the steamer was doing this, the people who had cut down the smaller trees, cut nearly through a large tree, and waited with lanterns for the steamer to approach.

2500|$|Eno is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} one of popular music's most influential artists. Critic Jason Ankeny at AllMusic argues that Eno [...] "forever altered {{the ways in which}} music is approached, composed, performed, and perceived, and everything from punk to techno to new age bears his unmistakable influence." [...] Eno has spread his techniques and theories primarily through his production; his distinctive style affected a number of projects in which he has been involved, including Bowie's [...] "Berlin Trilogy" [...] (helping to popularise minimalism) and the albums he produced for Talking Heads (incorporating, on Eno's advice, African music and polyrhythms), Devo, and other groups. Eno's first collaboration with David Byrne, 1981's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, pioneered sampling techniques that would prove to be influential in hip-hop, and broke ground by incorporating world music into popular Western music forms. Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies have been used by many bands, and Eno's production style has proven influential in several general respects: [...] "his recording techniques have helped change the way that modern musicians– particularly electronic musicians– view the studio. No longer is <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> passive medium through which they communicate their ideas but itself a new instrument with seemingly endless possibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|For the reboot film, Guillermo del Toro {{said his}} Frankenstein {{would be a}} {{faithful}} [...] "Miltonian tragedy", citing Frank Darabont's [...] "near perfect" [...] script, which evolved into Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein. Del Toro said of his vision, [...] "What I'm {{trying to do is}} take the myth and do something with it, but combining elements of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein without making <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> classical myth of the monster. The best moments in my mind of Frankenstein, of the novel, are yet to be filmed ... The only guy that has ever nailed for me the emptiness, not the tragic, not the Miltonian dimension of the monster, but the emptiness is Christopher Lee in the Hammer films, where he really looks like something obscenely alive. Boris Karloff has the tragedy element nailed down {{but there are so many}} versions, including that great screenplay by Frank Darabont that was ultimately not really filmed." [...] He has also cited Bernie Wrightson's illustrations as inspiration, and said the film will not focus on the monster's creation, but be an adventure film featuring the character. Del Toro said he would like Wrightson to design his version of the creature. The film will also focus on the religious aspects of Shelley's tale. In June 2009, del Toro stated that production on Frankenstein was not likely to begin for at least four years. [...] Despite this, he has already cast frequent collaborator Doug Jones in the role of Frankenstein's monster. [...] In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Jones stated that he learned of the news the same day as everybody else; that [...] "Guillermo did say to the press that he’s already cast me as his monster, but we’ve yet to talk about it. But in his mind, if that’s what he’s decided, then it's done ... It would be a dream come true." [...] The film will be a period piece. It is unclear what stage of development this film is in.|$|E
