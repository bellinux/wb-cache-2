5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> advanced.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles in}} this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan {{widespread}} adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers, and according to author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India. He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar. Khan became a romantic leading man without <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> kissing any of his co-stars, although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} Marcellinus's act of traditio, if it <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> happened, is unclear. There {{appears to}} have been a break in the episcopal succession, however. Marcellinus seems to have died on October 25, 304, and (if he had apostatized) was probably expelled from the church in early 303, but his successor, Marcellus, was not consecrated until either November or December 306. In the meantime, two factions diverged in the Roman church, separating the lapsed, Christians who had complied with the edicts to ensure their own safety, and the rigorists, those who would brook no compromise with secular authority. These two groups clashed in street fights and riots, eventually leading to murders. It is said that Marcellus, a rigorist, purged all mention of Marcellinus from church records, and removed his name from the official list of bishops. Marcellus himself was banished from the city, and died in exile on January 16, 309.|$|E

5|$|The moat was {{situated}} {{at a distance}} of about 20m from the outer wall. The moat itself was over 20m wide and as much as 10m deep, featuring a 1.5m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top {{so as not to be}} used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that the moat was <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople.|$|E

5000|$|Accounts vary as {{to whether}} <b>Evers</b> <b>actually</b> {{retrieved}} the game ball or not. Some versions of the story have him running to the outfield to retrieve the correct ball. Other versions have it that he shouted for the ball, which was relayed {{to him from the}} Cubs' dugout. And still other versions have it that Giants pitcher Joe McGinnity saw what was transpiring, and threw the game ball into the stands; thus, the ball that was picked up by or relayed to Evers was a different ball entirely. The New York Times account of the play recalls that Cubs manager and first baseman Frank Chance was the one who [...] "grasped the situation" [...] and directed that the ball be thrown to him covering second base.|$|R
25|$|The ius primae noctis ("law of {{the first}} night") is a term now popularly used to {{describe}} an alleged legal right allowing the lord of an estate to take the virginity of his serfs' maiden daughters.

25|$|Despite its strict and {{widespread}} enforcement, {{none of the}} ban's supporting measures were <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> codified into law.

From that point on the ban had no legal basis, {{but it was still}} strictly enforced.|$|E

25|$|Prototype. The USAAF {{accepted}} the first XP-82 in August 1945 {{and a second}} one in September. Both were equipped with Packard Merlin V-1650-23 and −25 engines. The third experimental aircraft, designated XP-82A, had two Allison V-1710-119 engines. It was accepted in October 1945. There {{is no evidence that}} the XP-82A was <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> flown, due to problems with the Allison engines. The fourth XP-82A prototype (44-83889) was canceled.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to rising concerns about privacy and smart technology, in 2007 the British Government stated it would follow formal Privacy by Design principles when implementing their smart metering program. The program {{would lead to}} replacement of traditional power meters with smart power meters, which could track and manage energy usage more accurately. However the British Computer Society is doubtful these principles were <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> implemented. In 2009 the Dutch Parliament rejected a similar smart metering program, basing their decision on privacy concerns. The Dutch program later revised and passed in 2011.|$|E
25|$|MS Stockholm was {{the name}} of two {{near-identical}} ocean liners built by Cantieri Riuniti dell' Adriatico, Monfalcone, Italy between 1936 and 1941 for the Swedish American Line. Neither of the ships entered service for the company that had ordered them—the first ship was entirely destroyed by fire during construction in 1938, while the second was completed in 1941 but immediately sold to the Italian government as a troopship. The second ship served for three years in the Regia Marina and Kriegsmarine under the name MS Saubadia, until sunk by British bombers outside Trieste in 1944. It is unknown if she was <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> used as a troopship.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1920s, Morse met pianist Bob Downey.

They subsequently lived together as a couple, although {{whether or not they were}} <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> married remains questionable. She and Downey eventually opened a small club in Texas, which they operated until it burned down in 1939. Later they resettled in Rochester, New York. Downey eventually left Morse for a striptease dancer. This end to their relationship left Morse devastated and ever more dependent upon alcohol, which by the 1930s had become a constant companion.|$|E
25|$|Swales {{was also}} very keen on sport generally, and enjoyed rugby. He played for both {{civilian}} (pre-war) and various military teams.

He played for Griquas when he had been posted to Kimberley for training. He was also a reserve for the Natal rugby team, without <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> playing for the province. He received his wings at Kimberley on 26 June 1943. On 22 August 1943, he was seconded to the Royal Air Force (RAF) whilst retaining his South African Air Force uniform and rank.|$|E
25|$|Amnesty {{also reports}} {{allegations}} of abuse of suspects during these interrogations. There {{are reports of}} physical abuse, sleep deprivation and denial of food, water and use of a toilet. One of its biggest criticisms is that inmates usually remain for years (and sometimes decades) on death row without <b>ever</b> <b>actually</b> being informed of the date of their execution prior to the date itself, so inmates suffer due to the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not any given day will be their last. According to Amnesty International, the intense and prolonged stress means many inmates on death row have poor mental health, suffering from the so-called death row phenomenon. The failure to give advanced notice of executions has been stated by the United Nations Human Rights Committee to be incompatible with articles 2, 7 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.|$|E
