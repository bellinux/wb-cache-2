I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, knew that I hit it. But thankfully he gave me not out. I went into lunch {{the next day at}} 99 not out and I was so happy to get a century with my parents and friends watching.|$|E
500|$|One thing I {{remember}} having <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> depressing {{effect on me}} was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E

If we were ever going to come {{together}} on any kind of record, this is definitely the right one, and really the coolest thing {{to me is that}} after all of the drama and everybody making it like we had a rivalry, she was just really cool and we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good time in the studio. We had fun. And so, if nothing else, it was a good experience... and diva-ism, whatever." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon after {{completing}} Backspacer in 2009, Pearl Jam and producer Brendan O'Brien intended to soon repeat the experience given {{that according to}} O'Brien [...] "we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good time doing it.". In 2011, amidst preparations for the documentary Pearl Jam Twenty and its accompanying tour, the band recorded some tracks with O'Brien at Los Angeles' Henson Recording Studios, with the song [...] "Olé" [...] being issued as a free download. O'Brien considered that the studio helped the band get to a [...] "submarine mentality, and everybody going into the ship together", and bassist Jeff Ament added that working outside the band's hometown Seattle led the musicians to work more efficiently.|$|E
500|$|For his stylistic {{influences}} {{for playing}} drums, Mark references Stewart Copeland of The Police who he [...] "always thought ... <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good style", Neil Peart of Rush, John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, and Keith Moon of The Who. Following {{the release of}} The Fiction We Live, then screaming vocalist Perri explained that the lyrics he was writing for the forthcoming album (Abandon Your Friends) would feature lyrics that were inspired by Billy Joel, stating that they were [...] "billyjoelesque" [...] because [...] "they’re more straightforward, not what I’m thinking, what I’m feeling, instead of poetry and shit". However, {{it is unclear whether}} the lyrics were used on the album, as was revealed by Mark in 2007, that Perri had not contributed to Abandon Your Friends and it was Mark who had ghostwritten the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, it was {{reported}} that [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] would be released as the third single from Sweet 7 on 8 February 2010. The song was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 21 February 2010 as a digital download, and as a CD single the following day. During an interview with David Balls of Digital Spy, group member Heidi Range explained the reason for the song's release as the album's third single, saying: [...] "It's <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good response from radio and our fans on the website. It's also quite appropriate as it comes out around Valentine's Day – there's a lot of kissing going on then!" [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] was remixed by the British music production team 7th Heaven.|$|E

500|$|In April 2009, {{the house}} was {{purchased}} by Robert Stansel, who had lived {{next door to the}} house for several years, at a foreclosure auction for $280,000. Demolition began in May 2009; {{the house was}} considered [...] "structurally unsound" [...] by the local government, a determination that permitted demolition despite the house's listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Lynne said of the house and its demolition: [...] "It's totally like a death and completely unnecessary. It's a magical property that invokes hope and imagination in people. We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> great time with it." [...] Residents shared mixed feelings about the demolition. Stansel was able to salvage 21 tiles with neo-Aztec designs. In 2009, The Oregonian reported that Stansel would wait until the economy and housing market improved before deciding whether to sell the land or build a new structure.|$|E
500|$|Ruck {{says that}} with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him [...] "the best part I {{ever had in}} a movie, and any success that I've had since 1985 is because he took a big chance on me. I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While we were making the movie, I just knew I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend {{to dwell on the}} ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Party" [...] was {{directed}} by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson. As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. We just <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff that we used to do as kids. We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But we just had a good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E

500|$|Drummer Dave Lombardo, on {{the other}} hand, asserts the album was professionally done {{compared}} to Show No Mercy: [...] "I didn't have to overdub the cymbals, and we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good engineer." [...] Lombardo's favorite song is [...] "At Dawn They Sleep", [...] "because {{it was kind of}} slow and grungy, but then it had that double-bass part at the end." [...] While recording the track, neither guitarists King or Jeff Hanneman who wrote the lyrics were in the studio—only Araya and Slagel. On reading the lyrics, which featured a misspelled word, Araya sang it as it was spelled, although it's not a real word. The song [...] "Hardening of the Arteries" [...] on the album ends with the a very similar section that makes up the beginning of the song [...] "Hell Awaits" [...] and {{is also one of the}} only Slayer songs to fade out on a continuous riff.|$|E
500|$|After Jade {{challenged}} Mark {{to a game}} of pool, [...] "sparks of {{a different}} kind" [...] began to fly between them. McGregor explained the situation: [...] "Mark has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> bad day at work, so he's out for a fun night. To his surprise, he enjoys Jade's company. Lucas goes home early - and Mark and Jade end up sharing a kiss." [...] The next morning it was made clear that Mark and Jade {{had spent the night}} together and Mark was full of regret. Mark was [...] "terrified" [...] that Kate would find out and even though Jade agreed to keep quiet, he does not feel any less guilty. Mark's problems at work continued and he became a victim of harassment when his car tyres were let down. Despite talking to his superior officer, nothing happens and Mark felt like he had no support from the people at his work place.|$|E
500|$|In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon {{wearing a}} Pink Floyd T-shirt {{with the words}} I Hate {{handwritten}} above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon {{to come to a}} nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, [...] "He came in with green hair. I thought he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart." [...] When the pub closed, the group moved on to SEX, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon. Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: ...|$|E

500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed to Syco Music. Recording for their debut studio album, Up All Night, began in January 2011. In February 2011, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. Carl Falk and Rami Yacoub produced three songs on the album: [...] "What Makes You Beautiful," [...] "One Thing" [...] and [...] "I Wish," [...] {{all of which were}} co-written by Falk, Yacoub and Savan Kotecha. Initially, [...] "One Thing" [...] was written as two different songs: [...] "One <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really,</b> really good verse" [...] and the other track [...] "had a really, really good chorus", as noted by Falk in a 2012 interview with Examiner.com. Falk quipped that when they merged the two songs, [...] "everything fell into place". Additionally, Falk deemed it the perfect accompaniment to [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and selected it as his favourite [...] "out of the three tracks [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Mendes {{spent more}} time recutting the first 10 minutes {{than the rest of}} the film taken together. He trialled several {{versions}} of the opening; the first edit included bookend scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester's murder, but Mendes excised these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery, and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production. Mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film [...] "into an episode of NYPD Blue". Instead, he wanted the ending to be [...] "a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution". When Ball first saw a completed edit, it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes. He felt that they were so short that they [...] "didn't really register". [...] Mendes and he argued, but Ball was more accepting after Mendes cut the sequences completely; Ball felt that without the scenes, the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that [...] "for all its darkness <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> romantic heart".|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E

500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it {{put her in the}} position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in [...] "". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, you wonder if that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It's an interesting thing. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good time with that episode." [...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the other room going at it. It just <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E
500|$|Continuing the band's {{policy of}} using names that would repulse {{potential}} listeners, the band named the album by using {{part of the}} phrase [...] "queer as a three dollar bill" [...] and adding the word [...] "Y'all" [...] for Florida flavor, naming the album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall. The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music. After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and Helmet in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating [...] "The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's rap/thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile." [...] That same year, they also notably served as an opening act for Faith No More, a band often credited as {{paving the way for}} Limp Bizkit and the nu metal genre. The group's keyboardist Roddy Bottum later recalled [...] "That guy Fred Durst <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> bad attitude. He was kind of a jerk. I remembered he called the audience faggots at one show when they booed him. Not a good scene." ...|$|E
