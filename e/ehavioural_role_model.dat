40|$|<b>Role</b> <b>models</b> {{are often}} {{suggested}} {{as a means}} of motivating people to set and reach ambitious goals, especially for members of stigmatised groups in achievement settings. Yet, findings in relation to the effectiveness of <b>role</b> <b>model</b> are mixed and the literature on <b>role</b> <b>models</b> suffers from a number of limitations: (1) it lacks a clear definitional consensus of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> (2) {{there is a lack of}} an integrated theoretical framework around <b>role</b> <b>modelling,</b> (3) very little of our current understanding of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> draws on the motivational literature to explain how <b>role</b> <b>models</b> can influence motivation and goals, and (4) the focus of the extant <b>role</b> <b>model</b> literature has been mainly on the attributes that make <b>role</b> <b>models</b> effective at the expense of understanding how this occurs. In this thesis, we first review the literature on <b>role</b> <b>models</b> (Chapter 1) and present two studies highlighting the limitations of the extant understanding of <b>role</b> <b>modelling</b> (Chapter 2). We then address these limitations by developing a theoretical framework of <b>role</b> <b>modelling</b> where we integrate different definitions of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> into a new conceptualisation in which we propose that <b>role</b> <b>models</b> influence goals and motivation in three distinct ways: by acting as behavioural models, by representing the possible, and by being inspirational. We then draw on expectancy-value theories of motivation to build a theoretical framework for understanding not only when but also how <b>role</b> <b>models</b> can effectively influence motivation and goals in these three functions (Chapter 3). This new theoretical framework, the Motivational Theory of <b>Role</b> <b>Modelling,</b> highlights how the power of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> can be harnessed to increase role aspirants’ motivation, reinforce their existing goals, and facilitate their adoption of new goals. We present four empirical studies supporting the ideas put forward in this theoretical framework, namely that <b>role</b> <b>models</b> in their three functions increase expectancy and value and, in turn, motivation and goals (Chapters 4, 5, and 6). Finally, we integrate and summarise our findings and discuss theoretical and practical implications (Chapter 7) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Role</b> <b>models</b> often {{play a role}} when {{implementing}} {{guidelines in}} healthcare.

The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to investigate how <b>role</b> <b>models</b> perform there <b>role</b> as a part of a multifaceted implementation strategy on the prevention of hand eczema, and to identify barriers and facilitators for the performing of their role. Methods: The <b>role</b> <b>models</b> were selected to become a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> and received a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> training. All <b>role</b> <b>models</b> worked at a hospital. In total, 19 <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> were interviewed. A topic list was used focussing on how the <b>role</b> <b>models</b> performed their <b>role</b> and what they experienced to be facilitators and barriers for their role. After coding the interviews, the codes were divided into themes. Results: This study shows that the main tasks perceived by the <b>role</b> <b>models</b> were to raise awareness, to transfer information, to interact with colleagues about hand eczema, to provide material, and to perform coordinating tasks. Barriers and facilitators were whether the role suited the participant, affinity with the topic, and risk perception. Conclusions: Most <b>role</b> <b>models</b> performed only the tasks they learned during their training. They mentioned a wide range of barriers and facilitators for the performing of their role. To enhance the functioning of the <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> a suggestion would be to select <b>role</b> <b>models</b> by taking into account prior coaching experience.

40|$|As {{shortfalls}} {{in funding}} result in pressures {{to increase efficiency}} in Universities, there is increasing pressure on departments and faculties to attract sufficient students to maintain their academic programs. One way in which this is can be done is by making available <b>role</b> <b>models</b> from the various fields of study. <b>Role</b> <b>models</b> are considered important in career development (Hackett and Betz 1981). The range of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> adopted in making academic and vocational decisions is not well researched (Nauta and Kokaly 2001), although {{there is some evidence}} of the impact of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> such as in changes in attitudes to non-traditional careers (Evans and Whigham 1995).

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the concept of role models.  Its concern is to provide an account of what <b>role</b> <b>models</b> are, how the <b>role</b> <b>model</b> {{relationship}} functions, and of the special responsibilities relating to <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> The original account of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> belonging to Robert Merton, held that being a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> was {{simply a matter of}} <b>modelling</b> a <b>role.</b> I argue against this. On my account, a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> is simply a person who has some quality of theirs emulated; the issue of role is only occasionally relevant. To be a <b>role</b> <b>model,</b> I argue, simply involves being emulated. There must be someone for whom you are a <b>role</b> <b>model,</b> as well as something that you model, and that is all. My account is strongly influenced by Aristotelian ethics, {{as well as by the}} work of Iris Murdoch, Andrew Michael Flescher, and Albert Bandura. There is clear evidence from social psychology that people commonly emulate <b>role</b> <b>models</b> unconsciously, or passively, without their having chosen to do so. My contention is that the prevalence of this passive emulation creates a specific type of responsibility for <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> since their behaviour is able to cause similar behaviour in others. However, this does not mean that those who emulate <b>role</b> <b>models</b> lack responsibility for their behaviour. On the contrary, I argue that they too have specific responsibilities regarding their <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> Moreover, I argue that both parties are able to be simultaneously responsible. A <b>role</b> <b>model</b> can be responsible for his influence without this making those who emulate him any less responsible for their own actions...|$|R

40|$|Women remain {{underrepresented}} in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, perhaps {{in part because}} STEM is seen as incompatible with femininity. Interventions that change perceptions of academic fields (e. g., counterstereotypic <b>role</b> <b>models)</b> can boost motivation, but feminine STEM <b>role</b> <b>models</b> remain untested. It may seem daunting to combine the incompatible qualities of femininity and success in “unfeminine” fields, making feminine STEM <b>role</b> <b>models</b> less effective motivators than more everyday, gender-neutral women in STEM. Studies 1 a and 1 b test this possibility by asking middle school girls to read interviews with college women who were feminine or gender-neutral in terms of appearance and hobbies, and who were succeeding in STEM fields or in school generally. Study 1 a suggests that feminine STEM <b>role</b> <b>models</b> dampen girls’ self-rated ability and future plans in math. Study 1 b corroborates past evidence that <b>role</b> <b>models</b> are more threatening than inspiring when their success feels unattainable: girls disinterested in STEM (who were most harmed by reading about feminine STEM <b>role</b> <b>models</b> in Study 1 a) saw feminine STEM success as least attainable. Study 2 aimed to replicate these effects with a female college sample, with “humanities” replacing “school” as the comparison <b>role</b> <b>model</b> condition. STEM <b>role</b> <b>models</b> generally improved English self-ratings and harmed math self-ratings. Perceiving STEM <b>role</b> <b>models</b> as less attainable than humanities <b>role</b> <b>models</b> mediated their negative effect on math self-concept. Study 3 used improved stimuli and found that gender-neutral female STEM <b>role</b> <b>models</b> were more motivating than feminine STEM <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> Study 3 also assessed three individual differences.

40|$|Introduction: The {{choice of}} a {{specialty}} by medical students is affected by many different factors. Personal characteristics and experiences in different specialties play a part as well as various <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> The lack of female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> may explain the under-representation of female specialists and full professors in medicine. Special features of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> the effects and the possible use of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> were investigated.

Method: A literature search of the national and international literature was performed using Medline and other search tools. Results: The search yielded 10 relevant articles about the influence of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> on medical students’ choice of specialty.

40|$|PublishedThe lack {{of senior}} female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> {{continues}} to be cited as a key barrier to women's career success. Yet there is little academic research into the gendered aspects of <b>role</b> <b>modelling</b> in organizations, or the utility of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> at a senior level. The paper starts with a review of papers examining the construction of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> in organizational settings. This leads to the inclusion of two related areas – organizational demographics as the contextual factor affecting the availability of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> {{and how they are}} perceived, and work identity formation as a possible key explanatory factor behind the link between the lack of senior female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and the lack of career progression to top organizational levels. The literature looking at social theories of identity formation is then considered from a gender perspective. The key gaps identified are that while the behavioural value of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> has been well documented, a better understanding is needed of how gender and organizational demography influence the <b>role</b> <b>modelling</b> process. Importantly, the symbolic value and possibly other values of female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> in the identity construction of senior women require further in-depth investigation. Finally, this review calls for a more integrated approach to the study of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and work identity formation, pulling together literatures on organizational demography, the cognitive construal of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and their importance for successful work identity formation in senior women...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 30 - 31). Social comparison {{research shows}} that when people compare themselves with successful and unattainable others (i. e., engage in an upward comparison), they feel worse about themselves. However, very little social comparison research has looked specifically at how {{people who are already}} threatened (e. g., those who are negatively stereotyped) may feel after exposure to unattainable and successful others. Accordingly, the current study directly explores how attainability affects performance under stereotype threat and non-threat conditions. Stereotype threat is the phenomenon by which members of a stereotyped group underperform on certain tasks due to concerns about confirming a group-relevant stereotype. Prior research has found that in stereotype threat situations, threatened individuals perform better following upward comparisons with an ingroup <b>role</b> <b>model</b> [...] a successful other who shares an important identity (such as gender or race) with the threatened individual. Because of their counter-stereotypical nature, <b>role</b> <b>models</b> are thought to buffer the performance of those experiencing stereotype threat. Although researchers have begun to establish some of the necessary qualities that enable <b>role</b> <b>models</b> to effectively neutralize the effects of stereotype threat, researchers have yet to test whether a <b>role</b> <b>model's</b> accomplishments must be considered attainable. The current study investigated the effects of <b>role</b> <b>model</b> attainability on performance within a novel stereotype threat paradigm. Participants were 99 SDSU undergraduates. To manipulate stereotype threat, participants were reminded of the negative academic reputation associated with students at their school compared to students at a nearby school (i. e., UCSD). The current study used a 2 (Test Description: threat, no threat) x 3 (<b>Role</b> <b>Model</b> Exposure: no exposure, attainable <b>role</b> <b>model,</b> unattainable <b>role</b> <b>model)</b> betweenparticipants design. It was hypothesized that when individuals were not exposed to a <b>role</b> <b>model,</b> performance would be better in the no threat condition compared to the stereotype threat condition. This hypothesis was supported, suggesting that stereotype threat can be triggered based on school affiliation. In the stereotype threat conditions, it was hypothesized that exposure to either of the <b>role</b> <b>models</b> would increase performance compared to the no <b>role</b> <b>model,</b> threat condition. Moreover, it was expected that the unattainable <b>role</b> <b>model</b> would boost performance even more than the attainable <b>role</b> <b>model.</b> It was found that average performance of the two <b>role</b> <b>model</b> conditions was significantly higher than that of the threat, no <b>role</b> <b>model</b> condition; however, performance did not differ between the two <b>role</b> <b>model</b> conditions. It was hypothesized that in the no threat conditions, exposure to the attainable <b>role</b> <b>model</b> would increase performance relative to the no threat, no <b>role</b> <b>model</b> control condition, whereas exposure to the unattainable <b>role</b> <b>model</b> would decrease performance. Contrary to the hypothesis regarding the performance of those in the attainable condition, it was found that in the no threat conditions, exposure to both the attainable and the unattainable <b>role</b> <b>models</b> decreased performance. As a whole the results demonstrate that <b>role</b> <b>models</b> are most effective when they are attainable, and that the potential benefits of <b>role</b> <b>model</b> exposure depend on whether the situation at hand is one that is "stereotyped" or not...|$|R

Psychologists Steele and Aronson (1995) originally developed this social-psychological theory to help explain the achievement gap between White and Black students. Stereotype threat is the preoccupation felt by members of marginalized groups who feel at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their group {{that can lead to}} underperformance (Steele, 1997). With this effect in mind, could <b>role</b> <b>models</b> provide marginalized groups with the motivation to withstand potential threats to their identity and maintain the confidence to achieve? To answer this question, a quasi-experiment was completed to determine whether the race of female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> impacts the academic performance and self-esteem of Black female college students. Spelman College students were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three female <b>role</b> <b>model</b> conditions: a black female <b>role</b> <b>model,</b> white female <b>role</b> <b>model</b> or no <b>role</b> <b>model.</b> To explore performance, participants completed a difficult intelligence task called the Advanced Progressive Matrices Task (Raven et al., 1998) and to assess self-esteem, the State Self-Esteem Scale was administered (Heatherton 2 ̆ 6 Polivy, 1991). With a goal sample size of 60 participants, it is expected that students assigned to the black female <b>role</b> <b>model</b> condition will perform better and have higher self-esteem than students assigned to the white female <b>role</b> <b>model</b> condition and the no <b>role</b> <b>model</b> condition. This study attempts to further document that stereotype threat inhibits performance and confirm the impact of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> for the achievement of minority students...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which – and how – female expatriate <b>role</b> <b>models</b> support women to take up expatriate assignments in the male-dominated oil and gas industry. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses data from a census survey of female expatriates supported by semi-structured interviews with a stratified sample of the survey respondents, triangulated with interviews with HR professionals and analysis of organizational policy relevant to expatriation. Findings: Potential assignees value the information that women <b>role</b> <b>models</b> can provide on living in challenging, masculine locations. <b>Role</b> <b>models</b> are particularly important to women undertaking unaccompanied assignments and also when assignment periods exceed traditional lengths. Current female expatriates do not view themselves as <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> despite HR professionals recognizing their value in inspiring women’s expatriation. Research limitations/implications: This research was set in a sector with very few female expatriate <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> Further research is needed to understand the influence of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> on women’s expatriation in different sectors and organizations with greater female <b>role</b> <b>model</b> representation. Practical implications: Training for current assignees, time to be set aside within work duties, and communications links to enable current and returned female expatriates to connect with potential assignees are needed to widen expatriate gender diversity. Originality/value: This research contributes to theory by linking the importance of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> to women’s career stages. It proposes a new theoretical contribution by linking <b>role</b> <b>model</b> importance to the types of assignments women undertake. Practical suggestions for organizations are given to widen expatriate gender diversity via support for <b>role</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{practitioner}} surveys across {{a range of}} industries have cited the lack of senior female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> as a barrier to career progression. There is very little academic literature to explain this at a senior organizational level. An initial review of the extant <b>role</b> <b>model</b> literature led to the inclusion of two further related areas – organizational demographics, as a contextual factor affecting the availability of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> and work identity development as a link between the lack of senior female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and the lack of career progression. In seeking to answer the question of why and then how female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> are important for senior women, this study fills an identified gap in the comprehension of the concept of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and their importance in the workplace. It addresses a need to understand both the key elements of the concept and the mechanism by which they come into play. The research uses qualitative methods, specifically in-depth semi-structured interviews. These were conducted with a senior group of 33 female directors from six global investment banks, in order to elicit their experiences of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> in demographically imbalanced work contexts. Analysis of interview data considered all three areas of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> demographic context and work identity development. As the women forged their identities in the male-dominated context of global investment banks, what became clear was that who they are and have become was informed by the critical relationships they have had. Whilst clearly some of the women had found male <b>role</b> <b>models</b> with whom to develop these critical relationships, there were some identity issues, particular salient to women, which could not be addressed by men. Thus the findings demonstrated the utility of female <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> This thesis has a number of contributions to make on varying levels: On a conceptual level, this study adds {{to our understanding of the}} value of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> particularly detailing the affective or symbolic value. It has added to the conceptualization of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> detailing what were the core attributes of individuals chosen to be <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> who they were in relation to the women, how the women used them and why they were important. It has combined the three literature areas of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> organizational demographics and work identity development in a way not previously done, and has shown empirically that they are related and explain each other. Organizational demographics affect the availability of <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> And it is suggested that the relatively new theory of relational identification is the mechanism that explicates how the presence of positive female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> is a key influence on women’s work identity development. It has clarified the value of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> in extreme gender demographic contexts, and how and why they are important to senior women’s professional development, thereby adding to the theory of <b>role</b> <b>modelling.</b> Practically, the study explains why women in surveys may have been citing the lack of female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> as such a prominent issue, and suggests what some of the issues are that organizations should pay heed to in trying to address this.

40|$|Women {{are less}} likely than men to be {{associated}} with leadership, and the awareness of this stereotype may undermine women's performance in leadership tasks. One way to circumvent this stereotype threat is to expose women to highly successful female <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> Although such exposures are known to decrease women's leadership aspirations and self-evaluations, it is currently unknown what the effects of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> are on actual behavior during a challenging leadership task. We investigated whether highly successful female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> empower women's behavior in a leadership task. In a virtual reality environment, 149 male and female students gave a public speech, while being subtly exposed to either a picture of Hillary Clinton, Angela Merkel, Bill Clinton, or no picture. We recorded the length of speeches as an objective measure of empowered behavior in a stressful leadership task. Perceived speech quality was also coded by independent raters. Women spoke less than men when a Bill Clinton picture or no picture was presented. This gender difference disappeared when a picture of Hillary Clinton or Angela Merkel was presented, with women showing a significant increase when exposed to a female <b>role</b> <b>model</b> compared to a male <b>role</b> <b>model</b> or no <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> Longer speaking times also translated into higher perceived speech quality for female participants. Empowered behavior also mediated the effects of female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> on women's self-evaluated performance. In sum, subtle exposures to highly successful female leaders inspired women's behavior and self-evaluations in stressful leadership tasks. Highlights ► We examined the effect of successful <b>role</b> <b>models</b> on behavior in a leadership task. ► Exposures to female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> empowered women's behavior and self-evaluations. ► Exposure to female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> eliminated the gender performance gap. ► <b>Role</b> <b>models</b> did not affect men's leadership behavior.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{examined}} (a) {{how social}} group prototypicality influences {{the degree to}} which a role aspirant identifies a role occupant as a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> and (b) how <b>role</b> <b>models</b> subsequently affect aspirants’ level of self-efficacy and goal elaboration. I expected that (a) the role occupant would be identified as more of a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> when she was more (versus) less prototypical of the aspirants’ social group, (b) this effect would be weakened when the aspirant perceived themselves as less (versus more) prototypical of their social group and (c) aspirants would be higher in self-efficacy and goal elaboration when the occupant was more (versus less) prototypical of the group, and these effects would be mediated by increased <b>role</b> <b>model</b> identification. A total of 130 first-year female undergraduates from the University of Queensland (UQ) listened to Kate, a high achieving fourth year student, discuss first-year studies. Participants were randomly assigned to a condition where Kate was either prototypical or aprototypical of UQ students. After listening to Kate speak, they completed measures of <b>role</b> <b>model</b> identification, self-efficacy and goal elaboration. As expected, participants identified Kate as more of a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> when she was more rather than less prototypical. However, contrary to hypotheses, participants’ own prototypicality did not moderate this effect. Participants reported higher self-efficacy in the prototypical condition and this effect was fully mediated by increased <b>role</b> <b>model</b> identification. However, this effect dissipated under incentivised behavioural conditions. Furthermore, participants did not demonstrate increased <b>role</b> <b>model</b> identification in either condition, nor when they identified Kate as a <b>role</b> <b>model.</b> These findings demonstrate that role occupant prototypicality influences people’s choice of <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> However, they raise questions over the ability of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> to increase self-efficacy and goal elaboration in aspirants. I explain these findings further and discuss theoretical and practical implications, as well as future research directions...|$|R

"May 2013 "This study was an initial attempt at precisely conceptualizing and measuring <b>role</b> <b>modeling,</b> and exploring the correlates, direct benefits, and career outcomes of <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> for professionals. As such these results begin to address the question of whether more successful people engage in <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> differently than less successful people. I developed two key dimensions of <b>role</b> <b>modeling,</b> motivational and imitative <b>role</b> <b>modeling,</b> and presented a conceptual framework that demonstrates the relationship between these dimensions and the direct benefits and career outcomes of <b>role</b> <b>modeling.</b> Although other categorizations of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> have been studied, these two dimensions captured the essential processes involved in one's cognitions about social interactions with, or observations of, <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> A sample of 301 professionals was surveyed at two points in time. As to answering the question, “Do successful people use <b>role</b> <b>models</b> differently than less successful people?” the data suggests that they do when it comes to immediate benefits and subjective career outcomes. This study found that <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> was more strongly related to subjective career outcomes such as perceived career success and career satisfaction than to objective career success, as well as the proximal benefits of <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> such as work-related learning, personal skill development, and career motivation...|$|R

In fathers’descrip-tions of their parental <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> three themes emerged: types of models that fathers identified as <b>role</b> <b>models</b> for them as parents, affective evaluations the fathers ascribed to the models, and content that the fathers perceived learning from the models.

50|$|A person's chosen <b>role</b> <b>models</b> {{may have}} a {{considerable}} impact {{on his or her}} career opportunities and choices. The suitability of a <b>role</b> <b>model</b> depends, in part, on the admirer’s perceived commonality with the model, who should provide an image of an ambitious yet realistic goal. For example, Benjamin Franklin served as the <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for countless nineteenth-century white businessmen, including such notables as Thomas Mellon, B.F. Goodrich, and Frederick Weyerhäuser. Later, the lack of commonalities between potential <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and would-be admirers helped perpetuate barriers to American minorities and women as they tried to advance in a business world dominated by white men, thus spurring late twentieth-century efforts to develop suitable <b>role</b> <b>models</b> for these groups.|$|R
