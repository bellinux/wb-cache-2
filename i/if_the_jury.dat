5|$|A {{new trial}} is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim, in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> rules in its favor, while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} between his {{election}} and his taking office, Crittenden was the lead defense counsel in the murder trial of Matt F. Ward, the son of one of Crittenden's lifelong friends. Ward's younger brother had been disciplined by the principal at Louisville Male High School the preceding November, and the elder Ward went to argue with the principal {{on behalf of his}} brother. In the ensuing encounter, Ward shot and killed the principal with a pistol. Public sentiment was heavily against Ward, and the trial was moved to Hardin County. During the week-long trial, which began in April 1854, Crittenden emphasized inconsistencies in the accounts of eyewitnesses and called prominent character witnesses such as Louisville mayor James Stephens Speed, Congressman William Preston, and Courier-Journal editor George D. Prentice. He presented a case that Ward had acted in self-defense. Because the prosecution sought the death penalty, Crittenden asserted that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> rendered an erroneous conviction, they would have no peace of mind knowing they had sentenced an innocent man to hang.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> was not {{satisfied}} {{on both of}} these, they were to return an open verdict.|$|E
50|$|During the play, the {{audience}} was addressed as <b>if</b> it were <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|R
25|$|For those {{accused of}} a felony, their case is sent to a court part where felony cases await the action of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> finds that there is enough {{evidence}} that the accused has committed a crime, it may file an indictment. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> accused waives their right to a grand <b>jury,</b> <b>the</b> prosecutor will file a Superior Court Information (SCI). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> votes an indictment, the case {{will be transferred from}} Criminal Court to the Supreme Court for another arraignment. This arraignment is similar to the arraignment in Criminal Court, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> accused does not submit a guilty plea, the case will be adjourned to a calendar part.|$|R
50|$|In {{case of a}} hung <b>jury</b> during <b>the</b> penalty {{phase of}} the trial, a retrial happens before another <b>jury.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> second <b>jury</b> is also deadlocked, a life {{sentence}} is issued.|$|R
25|$|In Alabama, the {{sentence}} is {{decided by the}} jury and at least 10 jurors must concur. A retrial happens <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> deadlock.|$|E
25|$|The jury began {{deliberations}} on July4. On July5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, {{they were}} about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so. One legal analyst stated that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had found Anthony guilty before receiving the exculpatory evidence, the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial.|$|E
25|$|In medieval England, {{the penalty}} for {{a vast number of}} serious crimes, {{including}} murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had crept into the legal system. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> has only two options—convicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty is death, or acquitting the defendant outright—it has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant should be punished somehow, but not executed. Faced with this dilemma, some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. Of course, this meant that an obviously guilty person would go free.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> right attaches, {{every element}} of the charged crime must be {{submitted}} to <b>the</b> grand <b>jury.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning to a grand <b>jury.</b> But, <b>the</b> government may narrow the indictment without so returning.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Criminal Appeal {{dismissed}} the case finding that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> original <b>jury</b> 'came to <b>the</b> {{conclusion that the}} accused was {{the person who had}} brought about the death of the woman, no matter by what means, it was justified in finding a verdict of guilty'.|$|R
50|$|There {{was intense}} {{interest}} focused on <b>the</b> grand <b>jury.</b> Robert P. McCulloch, the elected prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County, {{was in charge}} of the prosecution but did not participate in the direct handling of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> hearing. It was handled by two Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys of McCulloch's office: Kathi Alizadeh and Sheila Whirley. McCulloch announced an unusual process: <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> would hear all the evidence, the proceedings would be transcribed, and the materials would be made public <b>if</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> did not indict.|$|R
25|$|This, of course, is {{not always}} true. Patients do {{sometimes}} lie to their doctors (to get painkillers {{to which they are}} not entitled, for example). Hearsay exceptions do not mandate that a trier of fact (the jury or, in non-jury trials, the judge) accept the hearsay statement as being true. Hearsay exceptions mean only that the trier of fact will be informed of the hearsay statement and will be allowed to consider it when deciding on a verdict in the case. The jury is free to disregard a hearsay statement <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> does not believe it. The hearsay rule controls only what out-of-court statements a trier of fact gets to consider in deciding a case, not how they consider the out-of-court statements.|$|E
25|$|Provisions from Dodd–Frank {{found in}} section 922 also address whistle blower protection. Under new {{regulations}} any whistle blowers who voluntarily expose inappropriate behavior in public corporations can {{be rewarded with}} substantial compensation and will have their jobs protected. Regulations entitle whistle blowers to between ten and thirty percent of any monetary sanctions put on the corporation above one million dollars. These provisions also enact anti-retaliation rules that entitle whistle blowers {{the right to have}} a jury trial if they feel they have been wrongfully terminated as a result of whistle blowing. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> finds that whistle blowers have been wrongfully terminated, then they must be reinstated to their positions and receive compensation for any back-pay and legal fees. This rule also applies to any private subsidiaries of public corporations. The SEC put these regulations in place in May 2011.|$|E
25|$|Unanimous jury {{verdicts}} {{have been}} standard in US American law. This requirement was {{upheld by the}} Supreme Court in 1897, but the standard was relaxed in 1972 in two criminal cases. As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases, but Oregon and Louisiana are the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases. When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict (a situation {{sometimes referred to as}} a hung jury), a mistrial is declared, and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury. The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of fact and guilt; setting the penalty was reserved for the judge. This practice was confirmed by rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court such as in Ring v. Arizona, which found Arizona's practice of having the judge decide whether aggravating factors exist to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty, to be unconstitutional, and reserving the determination of whether the aggravating factors exist to be decided by the jury. However, in some states (such as Alabama and Florida), the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge, and the jury gives only a non-binding recommendation. The judge can impose the death penalty even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> recommends life without parole.|$|E
5000|$|Occasionally, {{grand juries}} go aggressively {{beyond the control}} of the prosecuting attorney. When <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> does so <b>the</b> {{situation}} is called a [...] "runaway" [...] grand jury. Runaway grand juries sometimes happen in government corruption or organized crime cases <b>if</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> comes to believe that the prosecutor himself has been improperly influenced. Such cases were common in the 19th century but have become infrequent since the 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|Largely, <b>the</b> {{earliest}} <b>juries</b> returned verdicts {{in accordance}} with the judge or the Crown. This was achieved either by [...] "packing the jury" [...] or by [...] "writ of attaint". Juries were packed by hand-selecting or by bribing <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> so as to return the desired verdict. This was a common tactic in cases involving treason or sedition. In addition, the writ of attaint allowed a judge to retry the case in front of a second <b>jury</b> when <b>the</b> judge believed <b>the</b> first <b>jury</b> returned a [...] "false verdict". <b>If</b> <b>the</b> second <b>jury</b> returned a different verdict, that verdict was imposed and <b>the</b> first <b>jury</b> was imprisoned or fined.|$|R
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, {{such as the}} UK, Canada, {{and some}} Australian states, [...] "adequate provocation" [...] is a partial defense to a charge of murder, which, <b>if</b> {{accepted}} by <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> would convert what {{would otherwise have been}} murder into manslaughter.|$|R
500|$|The {{government}} is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury, a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or an [...] "implied acquittal" [...] via conviction of a lesser included offense. In addition, the {{government is}} barred by collateral estoppel from re-litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> hung on other counts.|$|E
500|$|The Eighth Amendment forbids the {{imposition}} of excessive bails or fines, though it leaves the term [...] "excessive" [...] open to interpretation. The most frequently litigated clause of the amendment is the last, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment. This clause was only occasionally applied by the Supreme Court prior to the 1970s, generally in cases dealing with means of execution. In Furman v. Georgia (1972), {{some members of the}} Court found capital punishment itself in violation of the amendment, arguing that the clause could reflect [...] "evolving standards of decency" [...] as public opinion changed; others found certain practices in capital trials to be unacceptably arbitrary, resulting in a majority decision that effectively halted executions in the United States for several years. Executions resumed following Gregg v. Georgia (1976), which found capital punishment to be constitutional <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> was directed by concrete sentencing guidelines. The Court has also found that some poor prison conditions constitute cruel and unusual punishment, as in Estelle v. Gamble (1976) and Brown v. Plata (2011).|$|E
2500|$|Attorney General Knight {{delivered}} his rebuttal, roaring that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> found Haywood not guilty, {{they ought to}} [...] "put a garland of roses around his neck, give him a supper, and send him to New York City." [...] Considering the evidence, he continued, [...] "there can be but one verdict—death in the electric chair for raping Victoria Price." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not necessarily. I fancy {{a man can}} {{be tried}} upon the finding of a coroner's jury as well as upon that of a magistrate. Perhaps, however, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> coroner's <b>jury</b> finds against him he may be {{formally}} brought up before the magistrates, and {{a portion of the}} evidence heard, sufficient to justify them in committing him for trial. See, people are going into the house again. Probably they have thrown the door open, and <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> are going to give their finding. I don't think we need go in." ...|$|R
25|$|On either argument, the {{defendant}} {{would have been}} entitled to an acquittal; however, the court considered it doubtful whether Bailey had laid sufficient basis for his defence to be considered by <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> at all. <b>If</b> so, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> would have been entitled to reject it. On {{the facts of the}} case, particularly Bailey's setting out armed with an iron bar, his apparent normality shortly after the incident, and the doctor's evidence as to the unlikelihood of such an episode of automatism in the circumstances, the court considered that there had been no miscarriage of justice. Bailey's appeal was dismissed.|$|R
5000|$|During the [...] "Liquid Eurovision" [...] {{show that}} was {{broadcast}} on BBC One after the contest ended, {{it was revealed}} that Ireland had received the most votes in every region of the country, apart from in the South of England where Turkey were top. It was also revealed that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> backup <b>jury</b> had to be used, Turkey would also have received top marks from the United Kingdom.|$|R
2500|$|In 1903, the {{punishment}} for {{murder in the}} first degree was changed from death, to [...] "death or imprisonment for life as the jury may determine... <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> shall find the respondent guilty of {{murder in the first}} degree, {{the punishment}} shall be life imprisonment unless the jury shall add to their verdict the words, with capital punishment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Second, the jury's {{role was}} only advisory; the judge could {{disregard}} the jury's sentencing recommendation, {{but had to}} explain his reasoning if he did. Under Florida law, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> recommended life but the judge imposed a death sentence, [...] "the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ." [...] The trial judge must independently reweigh the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Finale" [...] — Jackie {{represents}} George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer {{when they}} violate the Good Samaritan law. Despite losing the case, he gets some satisfaction in sleeping with Sidra (from [...] "The Implant"), {{which would have}} been more satisfying <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had not reached a decision so quickly. His last line in the series is the same as Sidra's line about her breasts from the aforementioned episode: [...] "And by the way: they're real, and they're spectacular!" ...|$|E
50|$|A judge, usually {{upon the}} request of a {{district}} attorney, may assemble a grand jury to investigate suspected criminal activity. A grand jury consists of 17 people selected for <b>jury</b> service. <b>The</b> grand <b>jury</b> may request that the prosecutor subpoena and examine witnesses. Upon completing an investigation, a grand <b>jury</b> may by <b>the</b> vote of at least 14 members return an indictment, which is a written accusation that a person committed a crime. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> returns an indictment, the court issues a summons or warrant for the defendant.|$|R
5000|$|<b>If</b> {{they find}} <b>the</b> {{accusation}} true, {{which is usually}} drawn up in form by the prosecutor or {{an officer of the}} court, they write upon the indictment the words [...] "a true bill" [...] which is signed by the foreman of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> and presented to the court publicly in the presence of all <b>the</b> jurors. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> indictment is not proven to the satisfaction of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury,</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "ignoramus" [...] or [...] "not a true bill" [...] is written upon it by <b>the</b> grand <b>jury,</b> or by their foreman and then said to be ignored, and the accusation is dismissed as unfounded. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> returns an indictment as a true bill ("billa vera"), the indictment is said to be founded and party stand indicted, and required to be put upon trial.|$|R
5000|$|... (4) Where {{an accused}} alleges {{that he or}} she {{believed}} that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, <b>if</b> believed by <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> <b>the</b> evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused’s belief, to consider {{the presence or absence of}} reasonable grounds for that belief.|$|R
2500|$|The {{government}} is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury, a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or an [...] "implied acquittal" [...] via conviction of a lesser included offense. In addition, the {{government is}} barred by collateral estoppel from re-litigating against the same defense, a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> hung on other counts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Morris became {{interested}} in Dr. James Grigson, a psychiatrist in Dallas. Under Texas law, the death penalty can only be issued <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> {{is convinced that the}} defendant is not only guilty, but will commit further violent crimes in the future if he is not put to death. Grigson had spent 15 years testifying for such cases, and he almost invariably gave the same damning testimony, often saying that it is [...] "one hundred per cent certain" [...] that the defendant would kill again. This led to Grigson being nicknamed [...] "Dr. Death". Through Grigson, Morris would meet the subject of his next film, 36-year-old Randall Dale Adams.|$|E
2500|$|The killing being indisputable, Carnegie {{would have}} been {{condemned}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> had merely given a verdict {{on the point of}} fact. In these circumstances, his counsel, Robert Dundas of Arniston, told the jury that they were entitled to judge on [...] "the point of law" [...] as well as the [...] "point of fact". He asserted that they should only decide whether in their conscience Carnegie had committed murder, or whether his guilt was not diminished or annihilated by the circumstances of the case. Quite unexpectedly the jury did not give a verdict of either [...] "proven" [...] or [...] "not proven" [...] but instead gave a verdict of [...] "not guilty", thus establishing a great constitutional principle of a Scottish Jury's right to jury nullification and endowing Scots with the verdicts: [...] "proven", [...] "not proven" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] which remain contentious to this day.|$|E
5000|$|Hansen {{contended that}} {{consistency}} with {{the presumption of}} innocence would be achieved if section 6(6) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 was construed to impose an evidential burden on him which, <b>if</b> accepted by <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> might create a reasonable doubt of his possession being for supply. This would impose the legal onus on the Crown to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of drugs for supply.|$|R
40|$|The Court {{determined}} that (1) a district court 2 ̆ 7 s failure to instruct <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> to restart deliberations when an alternate juror replaces an original juror is an error of constitutional dimension; (2) unpreserved errors are reviewed for plain error {{regardless of whether}} they are of constitutional dimension; (3) A prejudicial error can result <b>if</b> most of <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> deliberation time takes place before the error related to the replacement of an original juror occurs...|$|R
50|$|On August 15, 2006, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White ordered Fainaru-Wada and Williams {{to comply}} with their subpoenas and testify, saying that, if they do not, they {{will be held in}} {{contempt}} and incarcerated until such time as they decide to talk or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> expires and has to be thrown out. They may also be freed from this obligation if a higher court reverses the ruling. The reporters have previously stated that they would rather go to jail than testify.|$|R
