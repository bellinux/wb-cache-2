30|$|A {{video is}} {{composed}} {{of a series of}} <b>frames,</b> which when played back at a certain <b>frame</b> rate provide a visually fluid motion. <b>Frames</b> in a video typically have common data between one or more <b>frames.</b> To eliminate the need to store this content for individual <b>frames,</b> special <b>frames</b> called prediction <b>frames</b> are used [25]. These prediction <b>frames</b> (P-frames) reference other <b>frames</b> or MB within a <b>frame</b> which can be found before or after the predicted <b>frame.</b> <b>Frames</b> that do not reference other <b>frames</b> are referred to as intra-coded <b>frames</b> (I-frames). <b>Frame</b> references are calculated during a phase of the encoding process called motion estimation. The result of the motion estimation step is a model called the motion vector that describes the offset of coordinates shared between prediction and reference <b>frames</b> [26].|$|R

30|$|The {{adaptive}} reference <b>frame</b> ordering algorithm, reported previously [24], {{is integrated}} with the proposed prediction architecture. The algorithm is independent of reference <b>frame</b> selection and it offers an efficient mechanism for reordering <b>frame</b> indices which is vital when coding multi-view videos which contain multiple scenes. Coding a <b>frame</b> which belongs to a new scene would change the reference <b>frame</b> ordering, where the most significant reference <b>frame</b> becomes the nearest spatial <b>frame</b> instead of the recent temporal <b>frame.</b> Therefore, the algorithm first detects scene changes by analyzing the amount of intra-prediction for <b>frames</b> which belong to dependent views, then it alters reference <b>frame</b> ordering accordingly so that the spatial <b>frames</b> are indexed prior to temporal <b>frames</b> [24]. The new reference <b>frame</b> ordering is applied for the following <b>frames</b> which belong to neighbouring views.|$|R

The analysis reveals that both groups engage in all three core <b>framing</b> tasks: diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational <b>framing,</b> however, the bottled water industry was found to prioritize prognostic <b>framing</b> to undermine the <b>frames</b> of the ABWM. Both the ABWM and the bottled water industry utilize <b>frame</b> bridging, <b>frame</b> amplification, and <b>frame</b> extension to support their core <b>framing</b> tasks, however, the bottled water industry was the only group observed to engage in <b>frame</b> transformation.

The BD/iTunes version presents the film in a variable aspect ratio, with the IMAX sequences <b>framed</b> in 1.78:1, while scenes filmed in 35mm are <b>framed</b> in 2.40:1. The DVD versions feature the entire film <b>framed</b> in a uniform 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Disc 2 of the two-disc Special Edition DVD features the six main IMAX sequences in the original 1.44:1 aspect ratio. Additional IMAX shots throughout the film that are presented in 1.78:1 on the Blu-ray release are not, however, included in the DVD's special features. In addition to the standard DVD releases, some stores released their own exclusive editions of the film.|$|E
