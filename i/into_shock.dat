5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Jack and Liz are at a jewelry store, as Jack is searching for an engagement ring for Elisa. They shot that scene in a Cartier store in New York's Fifth Avenue, which was filmed on February 22, 2009. A scene featuring Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway) as the Grim Reaper, in which Jenna is led to believe Kenneth has gone <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> because of the strawberries, was cut from the airing. According to Jane Krakowski, in the DVD commentary for this episode, there were alternate scenes with Jenna letting Kenneth know about the tampering she did to Kenneth's items, his chickpea, water bottle, and harmonica.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} also {{occasionally}} feeds on livestock or deer. It {{is the only}} species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which are giving birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures to approach it. The vultures swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the nose or the tongue. The calf then goes <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> and is killed by the vultures. Black vultures have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting capybaras.|$|E
5|$|DayZ {{attempts}} to portray a realistic scenario within the gameplay, {{with the environment}} having different effects on the player. A character may receive bone fractures from damage to their legs, go <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> from bullet wounds or zombie bites, receive infections from zombies or diseased players, or faint due to low blood pressure. Thirst and hunger must be kept under control by finding sustenance in either cities or the wilderness, with body temperature playing a key part in the character's survival. The game focuses on surviving and the human elements of a zombie apocalypse by forcing the player to acknowledge basic human needs like thirst, hunger and shelter. These mechanics require the player to focus on immediate goals before they can consider long-term strategies.|$|E

25|$|Historical harvest methods {{involved}} cutting with a scythe or sickle, and threshing {{under the}} feet of cattle. Late 19th- and early 20th-century harvesting was performed using a binder. Oats were gathered <b>into</b> <b>shocks,</b> and then collected and run through a stationary threshing machine.|$|R
40|$|Magnetosonic waves {{traveling}} in a MHD equilibrium may evolve <b>into</b> <b>shocks.</b> We develop a criterion {{for the creation}} of fast shocks in the equatorial plane of axisymmetric equilibria and analyze the influence of the most important parameters. The results are applied to Grad-Shafranov equilibria and accretion disks...|$|R
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
5|$|When local {{fishermen}} catch a large tiger shark, {{the mayor}} proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes it being the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable great white shark's tooth {{embedded in the}} submerged hull. He drops it after finding a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists fill the beaches. Following a juvenile prank, the real shark enters a nearby estuary, killing a boater and causing Brody's son, Michael, to go <b>into</b> <b>shock.</b> Brody finally convinces a devastated Vaughn to hire Quint.|$|E
25|$|Propagation through {{division}} {{only has}} a limited rate of success, as many plants that are divided go <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> and eventually die. Germination of Heliamphora seed is achieved by scattering it on milled sphagnum moss and keeping in bright light, humid and warm conditions. Seed germination begins after many weeks.|$|E

40|$|We present first {{results of}} {{three-dimensional}} numerical simulations ofthe non-magnetic solar chromosphere, computed with the radiationhydrodynamics code CO 5 BOLD. Acoustic waves which are excitedat {{the top of}} the convection zone propagate upwards into thechromosphere where the waves steepen <b>into</b> <b>shocks.</b> The interaction of thewaves leads to the formation of complex structures which evolve on shorttime scales. Consequently, the model chromosphere is highly dynamical,inhomogeneous, and thermally bifurcated...|$|R
25|$|Around {{the first}} of September 1843, Greenleaf fell ill. His health did not decline too much, however, and the illness seemed minor. Greenleaf's sister, Nancy Cranch, died on September 16, 1843. After {{learning}} of her death late in the evening, Greenleaf went <b>into</b> <b>shock.</b> Greenleaf's health deteriorated rapidly {{over the next few}} hours, and he died {{in the early morning hours}} of September 17.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (GDV), {{also known}} as bloat, is the greatest killer of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. GDV occurs in deep-chested breeds and requires immediate veterinary care. It {{can be caused by}} wolfing down too much water, too much food too fast, exercise after eating, stress or unknown conditions. Symptoms are distended abdomen, excessive salivating, depression and lethargy. When GDV occurs it cuts off the esophagus, and blood supply to the heart is lessened causing low blood pressure as well as other cardiac problems; the dog can go <b>into</b> <b>shock.</b> Organ damage can occur as well and the stomach may rupture causing peritonitis to set in. If not treated, the dog may die.|$|E
25|$|The wave heating theory, {{proposed}} in 1949 by Evry Schatzman, proposes that waves carry {{energy from the}} solar interior to the solar chromosphere and corona. The Sun is made of plasma rather than ordinary gas, so it supports several types of waves analogous to sound waves in air. The most important types of wave are magneto-acoustic waves and Alfvén waves. Magneto-acoustic waves are sound waves that have been modified {{by the presence of}} a magnetic field, and Alfvén waves are similar to ultra low frequency radio waves that have been modified by interaction with matter in the plasma. Both types of waves can be launched by the turbulence of granulation and super granulation at the solar photosphere, and both types of waves can carry energy for some distance through the solar atmosphere before turning <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> waves that dissipate their energy as heat.|$|E

30|$|Overall, this is {{very similar}} to the {{well-known}} evolution of under-expanded supersonic jets studied in laboratories. Normally, their compressive transverse waves steepen <b>into</b> <b>shocks.</b> In our model A with κ= 1 we also detect shocks, but they become progressively weaker, suggesting that they may disappear further out along the jet. For κ= 0.5, shocks do not form at all. The exact reason for this in not yet clear.|$|R
40|$|By {{employing}} {{the method of}} multiple time scales, we derive here the transport equations for the primary amplitudes of resonantly interacting high-frequency waves propagating into a non-equilibrium gas flow. Evolutionary behavior of nonresonant wave modes culminating <b>into</b> <b>shocks</b> or no shocks, together with their asymptotic decay behavior, is studied. Effects of non-linearity, which are noticeable over times of order O(epsilon(- 1)), are examined, and the model evolution equations for resonantly interacting multi-wave modes are derived.

25|$|In June 1985, tragedy strikes for the Osmans when Sue awakes to {{discover}} baby Hassan laying motionless in his cot. Sue and Ali rush his lifeless body to local nurse, Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), but Hassan is already dead. A postmortem reveals no definitive cause of death, {{so it is}} concluded that he died during his sleep from cot death. After discovering Hassan's body, Sue goes <b>into</b> <b>shock.</b> She remains in a trance like state for weeks, refusing to eat, sleep, cry or acknowledge her own grief. She later begins blaming herself unfairly for her son's sudden and unexplainable death. Her mental health continues to deteriorate and she becomes despondent towards Ali; their marriage disintegrates in a welter of depression. Sue eventually manages {{to come to terms}} with Hassan's death with the help of Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton), who takes the desperate measure of placing Mary's baby, Annie, in her lap, allowing her, finally, to acknowledge her pent-up sadness.|$|E
25|$|Ellis is imprisoned {{with other}} accused collaborators, and humiliated and {{tortured}} by the violently anti-Nazi volunteer jailers, but is rescued by Akkermans, now a {{colonel in the}} Dutch Army. Akkermans brings her to his medical office, and tells her that he killed Franken when the Nazi tried to escape. He shows her the cash and jewels stolen from Franken's Jewish victims. When informed about Müntze's fate, Ellis goes <b>into</b> <b>shock,</b> and Akkermans administers a tranquilizer which is in fact an overdose of insulin. Ellis, feeling dizzy, sees the bottle of insulin and survives by quickly eating a bar of chocolate. She realizes then that Akkermans was a traitor who had collaborated with Franken and had killed the Smaals. While Akkermans is distracted, waving to a crowd that cheers him, she jumps from his balcony into the crowd below and runs away. He tries to follow her, but is blocked by the very same people cheering him as a hero of the Resistance.|$|E
25|$|On 2 April 1930, {{two days}} after Ras Gugsa Welle was killed in battle, Empress Zewditu died. It is known today that Zewditu {{suffered}} from diabetes, and was seriously ill with typhoid, {{but it is not}} universally agreed that this was the cause of her death. According to some popular histories, Zewditu died of shock and grief at hearing of her husband's death, but other accounts contradict this, claiming that Zewditu was not informed of the battle's outcome before her sudden death. Some diplomatic sources in Addis Ababa reported {{at the time that the}} fever-stricken Empress was immersed in a large container of frigidly cold holy water to cure her of her illness, but that her body went <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> and she died shortly thereafter. The timing of her death immediately after news of the outcome of the battle reached Addis Ababa has caused considerable speculation as to her cause of death. Some, particularly conservative critics of her successor, Emperor Haile Selassie, allege that once the rebellion had been decisively defeated, he or his supporters felt safe in poisoning Zewditu. Speculation as to the cause of Zewditu's death continues today.|$|E

50|$|In Boston Marriage (1999), David Mamet chronicles {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is {{the target of a}} seduction scheme). Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class. Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts <b>into</b> <b>shocking</b> crudity.|$|R
25|$|She {{was persuaded}} {{to return to}} work in 1914 for her company (Victor Film Company), which had been {{acquired}} by Universal Studios. During the filming of Pawns of Destiny in 1915, a staged fire got out of control. Lawrence was burned, her hair was singed, and she suffered a serious fall which fractured her spine. She went <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> for months. She returned to work, but collapsed after the film was completed. Blaming Solter for making her do the stunt in which she was injured, the two divorced. To add to her problems, Universal refused to pay her medical expenses, leaving Lawrence feeling betrayed. In mid-1916, she returned to work for Universal and completed another feature film, Elusive Isabel. However, the strain of working took its toll on her and she suffered a serious relapse. She was completely paralyzed for four months. In 1921, she traveled to Hollywood to attempt a comeback, but had little success. She received a leading role in a minor melodrama (The Unfoldment), and then two supporting roles. All her film work after 1924 would be in uncredited bit parts.|$|E
25|$|Extraordinary {{sporting}} successes {{did something}} to alleviate the spirits of Australians during the economic downturn. In a Sheffield Shield cricket match at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1930, Don Bradman, a young New South Welshman of just 21 years of age wrote his name into the record books by smashing the previous highest batting score in first-class cricket with 452 runs not out in just 415 minutes. The rising star's world beating cricketing exploits were to provide Australians with much needed joy through the emerging Great Depression in Australia and post-World War II recovery. Between 1929 and 1931 the racehorse Phar Lap dominated Australia's racing industry, at one stage winning fourteen races in a row. Famous victories included the 1930 Melbourne Cup, following an assassination attempt and carrying 9 stone 12 pounds weight. Phar Lap sailed for the United States in 1931, going on to win North America's richest race, the Agua Caliente Handicap in 1932. Soon after, {{on the cusp of}} US success, Phar Lap developed suspicious symptoms and died. Theories swirled that the champion race horse had been poisoned and a devoted Australian public went <b>into</b> <b>shock.</b> The 1938 British Empire Games were held in Sydney from 5–12 February, timed to coincide with Sydney's sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia).|$|E
500|$|Back at the prison, {{she went}} <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> upon {{receiving}} official notice of her son's death {{and did not}} speak for three days. On July 13, 1954, the four nationalists were taken to New York, where they {{pleaded not guilty to}} the charges of [...] "trying to overthrow the government of the United States". One of the witnesses for the prosecution was Gonzalo Lebrón Jr., who testified against his sister. On October 26, 1954, judge Lawrence E.

[...] Later that month, the King was unhorsed in a tournament and was badly injured and it seemed for a time that his life was in danger. When news of this accident reached the queen, she was sent <b>into</b> <b>shock</b> and miscarried a male child that was about 15 weeks old, on the day of Catherine's funeral, 29 January 1536.
