One mean to {{recognize}} the colonial Ceres stamps was the cancellation with a three letter code for each colony.|$|R

5000|$|Around 1860 Peru {{acquired}} a French-made device (the so-called [...] "Lecoq" [...] press) {{that was used}} to print, emboss and cut <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> from paper strips. The commemorative stamp illustrated to the right {{was one of the last}} Peru produced on this rare machine.|$|R
50|$|Belgium {{began using}} {{national}} postage stamps on July 8, 1849, when two <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps,</b> a 10c. brown and 20c. blue, collectively known as Epaulettes, were introduced. A {{few months later}} a 40c. red stamp with a new design was issued, for postage to foreign destinations. In 1850 two new stamps of 10c. and 20c. were issued.|$|R
50|$|The first {{stamp of}} St Helena was issued on 1 January 1856. It was a 6d blue <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamp</b> portraying Queen Victoria. From 1863 to 1880, this stamp was issued in various colours, {{perforated}} and overprinted for each value from 1d to 5s. This design {{continued to be}} used until 1884, when {{a new set of}} Victorian key types was issued for the colony.|$|R
5000|$|... 1893 and 1894 {{brought the}} stamps for which Obock is most famous among philatelists: {{a series of}} <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> with {{simulated}} perforations, a scalloped line resembling {{the outline of a}} perforated stamps, printed all around the design. In addition, the 2-franc and higher denomination stamps are {{in the shape of a}} large equilateral triangle. While the low values are relatively common, the triangular stamps are more scarce.|$|R
50|$|The {{first series}} {{consisted}} of seven values from 4 Annas to 100 Rupees and were printed by Waterlow & Sons Ltd in Great Britain. A number of varieties exist including perforate and <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps,</b> colour trials and bisects. These are very rare genuinely used and most copies that exist are specimens. In about 1950, the 1R value was surcharged 2 RUPEES, {{and this is}} the rarest stamp of this series.|$|R
25|$|Postage stamps {{issued in}} sheets with no {{perforations}} between the rows and columns of individual stamps {{are referred to}} as imperforate. The Washington-Franklin issue contains several series of <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> that occur on a small range of denominations from 1 through 5-cents. These stamps were issued in imperforate form to accommodate several major vending machine companies of that period who used this stock for coil stamps in their machines which were in wide use about the country. Many of these companies applied their own form of perforations, such as the , Mail-O-Meter, and Brinkerhoff vending machine companies. There were at least seven such firms, each having its own patented machines. <b>Imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> were issued in full uncut sheets of 400 subjects or in coil rolls of 500 or 1000 <b>stamps.</b> The <b>imperforate</b> issues were printed from a flat plate with 400 subjects until 1918 when they were produced on the rotary press from continuous rolls of paper. Imperforate coils from this stock are much rarer than examples cut from full sheets.|$|R
5000|$|In philately, label or coupon or tab {{is a part}} of {{sheet of}} stamps {{separated}} from them with perforation (or narrow white margin in <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps).</b> It cannot be used for postage because it does not have face value and any indication of a postal administration that issued such stamps with labels. The notion of label should not be messed up with the term [...] "gutter" [...] or with a margin of a stamp sheet.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1847, Bryce {{decided to}} {{introduce}} stamps that were sold individually for 5 cents, or for 4 cents if {{bought by the}} hundred. The Lady McLeod only transported letters bearing stamps, or pre-paid mail of the subscribers. The <b>imperforated</b> <b>stamp's</b> illustration was a white ship on a blue background, with the initials [...] "LMc L" [...] printed underneath. Lithographically printed, the stamp was cancelled by a cross drawn by hand or by ripping up a corner.|$|R
2500|$|Thomas Jefferson {{was honored}} with a “breakaway" [...] 5-cent stamp in the 1851-1861 Issue, the first U.S. stamp not {{depicting}} Benjamin Franklin or George Washington. The image {{was inspired by}} a portrait by Gilbert Stuart, engraved by Toppan, Carpenter, Casilear & Co. It was the last <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamp</b> issued by the company, issued in 1856. It was used primarily for foreign destinations, especially France. Beginning in mid 1857, perforated versions of this stamp were produced in at least six color-variants with two types of frames.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} years, from 1840 until 1850, all <b>stamps</b> were issued <b>imperforate,</b> {{and had to}} be cut from the sheet with {{scissors}} or knife. This was time-consuming and error-prone (as mangled stamps of the era attest).Once reliable separation equipment became available, nations switched rapidly. <b>Imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> have been issued occasionally since then, either because separation equipment was temporarily unavailable (in newborn nations for instance), to makers of automatic stamp vending equipment (the United States did this in the 1900s and 1910s), as novelties for stamp collectors (particularly when stamps are issued in souvenir sheets), or as errors.|$|R
5000|$|The London {{government}} {{established an}} inland postal system on 1 July 1850, but postage stamps {{had not yet}} been produced. The postmaster in Georgetown went to the local newspaper, the Royal Gazette, where he had them print <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> {{in the form of an}} outline circle, with [...] "BRITISH GUIANA" [...] inside the rim, and a denomination, from 2c to 12c, in the middle. The printing was in black, on different colors of paper depending on the denomination. These became known as the [...] "Cottonreels" [...] because of their circular shape, like the labels on spools of cotton, and are quite rare.|$|R

50|$|Treherne {{at first}} {{produced}} only fake overprints and surcharges, or <b>imperforate</b> whole <b>stamps</b> as he lacked perforating or rouletting {{equipment and the}} overprints and surcharges only required simple printing in black ink. Later {{he moved on to}} more sophisticated forgeries.|$|R
5000|$|The exception, the 4¢ {{imperforate}} value, is {{a particularly}} notable rarity, because no copies of the stamp in its originally-issued imperforate form survive. All of these 4¢ issues were incised with private [...] "hyphen-hole" [...] perforations by the Schermack company, and examples of them can fetch upwards of $50,000. Perhaps because the stamp no longer exists as released, Scott did not assign it a separate number, but listed it as #314A (#314 belongs to the 1¢ imperforate version). [...] The 1¢, 2¢ and 5¢ <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> exist {{with a variety of}} private perforations produced by five companies: Schermack, U. S. Automatic Vending, Brinkerhoff (1¢ and 2¢ only), Mail-O-Meter (2¢ only) and International Vending Machine (2¢ only).|$|R
25|$|On 21 September 1964, {{the island}} was granted {{independence}} as the State of Malta, a member in the Commonwealth of Nations and a Commonwealth realm. A set of 6 values was issued for this event, also designed by Emvin Cremona, who designed virtually every set up to 1971. These sets are all very cheap but highly collectible. Christmas stamps started in 1964 and have focused mostly on Nativity scenes. The 1965 definitives showed various episodes from the History of Malta and are considered {{some of the finest}} ever issued. Many varieties exist on this issue, from misplaced or omitted colours to <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps.</b> The Malta Philatelic Society has been established on 7 March 1966. Malta joined CEPT in 1971 and has issued Europa stamps annually since then.|$|R
50|$|The first {{stamp of}} the Russian Empire was {{a postage stamp}} issued in 1857 and {{introduced}} within {{the territory of the}} Russian Empire in 1858. It was an <b>imperforate</b> 10-kopeck <b>stamp</b> depicting the coat of arms of Russia, and printed using typography in brown and blue.|$|R
50|$|In the 1860s Pemberton {{advocated}} {{the study of}} all aspects of stamp production including paper, watermark, printing and perforation. This {{was known as the}} scientific or French school. By contrast the English school advocated that only the actual printed design mattered and that every other aspect of a stamp should be ignored. Some English collectors even advocated cutting the perforations from stamps before mounting so that {{there was no difference between}} a perforated and <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamp</b> in the album. At the time, the matter of how exactly to collect stamps had not been settled and the triumph of scientific philately over the simpler English methods lead directly to the sophisticated philatelic methods used today. Pemberton's 1867 Catalogue of the Very Fine and Very Complete Collection of Postage Stamps Selected with Great Care by E.L. Pemberton, Esq. Of Birmingham exemplified this approach.|$|R
5000|$|In Peruvian philately, Lamy (infrequently Lamy and Rinck) {{refers to}} a {{catalogue}} of cancellations found on classic Peruvian stamps, from the first issue in 1857 {{to the end of}} the use of <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> in 1873. Georges Lamy published his initial study in 1955 and was joined by co-author Jacques-André Rinck in the 1960 trilingual edition entitled, [...] Only 330 copies of the book were printed, and there is at least one pirated edition. For collectors, the utility of the catalogue is in its illustration of 147 cancellation types, the cities and towns where they were struck, together with an estimate of how rare is each particular cancellation on a scale from 0 (very common) to 100 (exceedingly rare). Thus, a seller or collector describing a Peruvian stamp as Lamy 24 coef. 20 means that the type of cancellation is the catalogue's number 24 and the rarity coefficient of such a mark from a particular town is 20.|$|R
25|$|In 1917, the New York Post office {{returned}} {{a batch of}} <b>imperforate</b> 2-cent <b>stamps</b> from the 1908-09 issue (double line watermark, two spelled out) to Washington for credit. Rather than remitting cash, however, the Federal Post Office in effect transformed these stamps into a new issue by perforating them with the then-current gauge—perforated 11—and returned them to New York. A relative rarity, this issue is catalogued as Scott 519.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to sheet stamps, two values, 10 cents and 15 cents, were produced as coil stamps {{for use in}} vending machines in several locations throughout Malaysia. The designs were similar to the state values, but produced with 'Malaysia' {{in place of a}} state name as they were for use in any state. These coils were printed by Harrison & Sons in photogravure. From the start, the coil stamp machines proved to be inefficient at dispensing the correct values for the money tendered, possibly due to humidity affecting the stamps. Due to these problems, the machines were dispensed with quite soon after they commenced their duty. As a result, commercially used examples of both values are scarce. During 2006 a variant of the gum was identified. It is brown, with a clear 'ribbing' effect. This may have been a trial to overcome some of the problems with the machines, the ribbing possibly helping to prevent curling of the individual stamps. Harrison Proof Cards exist for both values with an <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamp</b> in full colour on each.|$|R
50|$|The sheets contain 25 <b>imperforate</b> 100-ruble orange <b>stamps</b> {{depicting}} the Red Army soldier {{that appeared in}} the RSFSR 1922 Workers and Soldiers definitive issue. The twelfth stamp in the sheet has the denomination of 70 rubles, unlike all the others that have the face value of 100 rubles.|$|R
50|$|The first {{postage stamp}} {{issue of the}} Empire of Austria {{was a series of}} <b>imperforate</b> typographed <b>stamps</b> {{featuring}} the coat of arms. At first they were printed on a rough handmade paper, but after 1854 a smooth machine-made paper was used instead. Issues between 1858 and 1861 used a profile of Emperor Franz Josef, then switched back to the coat of arms, in an oval frame. Four clichés of the 1850 issue had St. Andrew's crosses printed per pane so that an even multiple of gulden were paid per pane sold.|$|R
5000|$|On March 1, 1843, Zürich issued {{their first}} stamps: Zurich 4 and Zurich 6.The Zurich 4 and 6, {{making it the}} second type of stamp in the world, after the UK's Penny Black three years earlier. The issue {{consisted}} of two <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> printed separately, each in five types, in sheets of 100, one with a large numeral [...] "4" [...] and the other with a [...] "6", both inscribed [...] "Zürich" [...] at the top. The 4-rappen stamp was also inscribed [...] "LOCAL-TAXE" [...] at the bottom, since it was intended to pay for letters mailed within a city, while the 6-rappen, inscribed [...] "CANTONAL-TAXE", was for use with letters going anywhere in the canton. The design was lithographed in black by Orell, Fuessli, and Company, with a pattern of fine red lines underneath, to discourage counterfeiting. Initially the red line were vertical, but starting in 1846 they were printed horizontal. These stamps were popular from the start, but were not printed in large numbers and are quite scarce today, with values ranging from US$1,500 to $20,000 depending on type. With the exception of one 6-rappen block of 9 (3x3) later split into a block of 6 (3x2) and a strip of three, all sheets were cut horizontally, so that no vertical pairs or larger are known to exist today.|$|R
5000|$|Mt. Rainier {{appears on}} four {{distinct}} United States postage stamp issues. In 1934, {{it was the}} 3-cent issue {{in a series of}} National Park stamps, and was also shown on a souvenir sheet issued for a philatelic convention. The following year, in 1935, both of these were reprinted by Postmaster General James A. Farley as special issues given to officials and friends. Because of complaints by the public, [...] "Farley's Follies" [...] were reproduced in large numbers. The second stamp issue is easy to tell from the original because it is <b>imperforate.</b> Both <b>stamps</b> and souvenir sheets are widely available.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 November 1861, five {{definitive}} stamps with {{values of}} ½, 1, 1½, 3, and 4 Schillings were issued in Bergedorf. These five values could satisfy the postal tariffs for all distance and weight {{needs of the}} time. At that time, only about 12,000 people lived in the whole postal region. The <b>imperforated</b> definitive <b>stamps</b> were printed when required and were valid until 31 December 1867. The stamps are square in shape. Besides the value, the country's name and the term [...] "Postmarke", the centre of each stamp depicted {{one half of the}} coat of arms of each of Hamburg and Lübeck.|$|R
50|$|In 1917 the Provisional Government reprinted the old Tsarist designs, but {{sold them}} <b>imperforate.</b> The first <b>stamps</b> of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic {{appeared}} in 1918, as two values depicting a sword cutting a chain. While great quantities of these stamps survive, they saw little use, and used copies are {{worth more than}} mint.|$|R
25|$|The first {{postage stamp}} {{issued by the}} Confederate States (1861) was a 5¢ green {{depicting}} Jefferson Davis. It was printed by the lithograph process by Hoyer and Ludwig of Richmond, Virginia. Like almost all Confederate issues, these <b>stamps</b> were <b>imperforate,</b> and single <b>stamps</b> had to be cut from the sheet with razors or scissors. This stamp was reprinted in blue in 1862.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 October 1857, Alexander II {{approved}} three two-colour samples {{printed in}} denominations of 10, 20, and 30 kopecks. On 9 November, the Emperor ordered {{to call them}} [...] "postage stamps" [...] instead of [...] "stempel" [...] stamps. Manufacturing of the 10-kopeck stamps began in November. The first Russian postage stamp was printed on a white hand-made paper with a watermark {{in the form of}} a figure [...] "1", 15 mm heigh. Since a punching machine ordered from the [...] in Vienna was received only on 19 November and in a state of disrepair, it was decided to hand over a part of the printed <b>imperforate</b> 10-kopeck <b>stamps</b> to the Postal Department for their further distribution to the provinces.|$|R
50|$|The {{modern era}} of postal service in Iran started in 1851 with a postal reform {{that had no}} {{immediate}} effects. The success of the Anglo-Indian postal operations combined with the positive reports about postal reforms in Europe and throughout the British Empire generated a renewed interest about postal communications and telegraphy in Naser al-Din, the Shah who reigned from 1848 to 1896. In 1865 he sent a delegation to Paris to liaise with the French Ministry of Posts & Telecommunications. The news of the Iranian mission got around and a private businessman {{by the name of}} A.M. Riester submitted essays for Iranian stamps featuring a lion and a rising sun behind it, set in an oval inner frame, part of an ornamentally rich frame. Months went by and Riester decided to contact Teheran, but he was chided for taking the liberty of using national symbols for unsolicited stamps. Meanwhile, the Iranian mission had opted for essays featuring a similar design prepared by Albert Barre. These essays caught the attention of top bureaucrats and eventually that of the Shah; as a result, in 1868 <b>imperforate</b> <b>stamps</b> with basically the same design of the Barre essays were printed in Teheran in quantities varying from 3,000 to 8,000 and issued for postal use in four denominations: 1 shahi violet; 2 shais green. 4 shais blue; and 8 shais red. They have been nicknamed the Bagheri stamps, possibly in reference to the person who printed or designed them. There was no hand-stamp or date-stamp in use to cancel these stamps and their circulation and use was relatively modest. In fact, not many letters are recorded, and {{because of the lack of}} any cancelling device, it is rather problematic to determine their genuine postal use simply because it is easy to exponentially increase the value of an un-cancelled letter by just adding an adhesive or two on to it.|$|R
