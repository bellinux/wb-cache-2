50|$|The group's main {{activity}} is {{the sale of}} petroleum products, implementation of liquefied gas and public procurement. According to Yuri Sirotyuk, the deputy of Svoboda party, Gaz Ukraine monopolized the Ukrainian liquefied gas market and smuggled gasoline with <b>interrupted</b> <b>transit</b> and fake exports schemes in 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} the Erie Canal in New York and of the Cumberland and Oxford Canal in {{southern}} Maine stimulated further interest in the 1820s and 1830s, {{but it was not}} until 1846 that the state approved a new plan. Originally authorized to operate as far upstream as Saint George Lake in Liberty, the canal opened in 1847 with service to Quantabacook Lake in Searsmont. Maintenance costs on the canal were high, due to its wooden locks, and the turbulent nature of the river, which necessitated frequent repairs and <b>interrupted</b> <b>transit.</b> The canal ended operations in 1850. In 1865 the dam and lock at Upper Falls were rebuilt in stone, to provide water power for the local mills. It was again rebuilt in 1902, this time to provide hydroelectric power, but was washed out by flooding in 1936.|$|E
50|$|Construction of MOSE at the inlets necessitates complex {{logistical}} organisation. These {{are located}} in a highly delicate environmental context {{so as to avoid}} interfering with the surrounding area as far as possible. The sites have been set up on temporary areas of water in order to limit occupation of the land adjacent to the inlets and reduce as far as possible the effect on activities taking place there. Materials (for example, site supplies) and machines are also moved via sea to avoid overloading the road system along the coast. Since the sites opened, all work has been carried out without <b>interrupting</b> <b>transit</b> through the inlet channels.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which 2 '-deoxyguanosine is toxic for lymphoid cells is relevant both to the severe cellular immune defect of inherited purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency and to attempts to exploit PNP inhibitors therapeutically. We have studied the cell cycle and biochemical effects of 2 '-deoxyguanosine in human lymphoblasts using the PNP inhibitor 8 -aminoguanosine. We show that cytostatic 2 '-deoxyguanosine concentrations cause G 1 -phase arrest in PNP-inhibited T lymphoblasts, regardless of their hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase status. This effect is identical to that produced by 2 '-deoxyadenosine in adenosine deaminase-inhibited T cells. 2 '-Deoxyguanosine elevates both the 2 '-deoxyguanosine- 5 '-triphosphate (dGTP) and 2 '-deoxyadenosine- 5 '-triphosphate (dATP) pools; subsequently pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide pools are depleted. The time course of these biochemical changes indicates that the onset of G 1 -phase arrest is related to increase of the dATP rather than the dGTP pool. When dGTP elevation is dissociated from dATP elevation by coincubation with 2 '-deoxycytidine, dGTP does not by itself <b>interrupt</b> <b>transit</b> from the G 1 to the S phase. It is proposed that dATP can mediate both 2 '-deoxyguanosine and 2 '-deoxyadenosine toxicity in T lymphoblasts...|$|R
30|$|Emergent {{events of}} urban rail transit (URT) {{belong to the}} {{category}} of public emergencies. It mainly refers to train emergency situation that happens {{in the process of}} operation, such as fire, explosion, gas attack, earthquake, bad weather, train derailment, disruption of rail line, sudden large passenger flow, and so on. This paper studies on event of disruption of rail line, this event means that section of URT route is <b>interrupted,</b> which rail <b>transit</b> train cannot run on the section. Emergent events will cause a large number of passengers stranded, which shall be evacuated by ground public transportation. Traffic management measures around the URT station should be taken, which can ensure passengers safely evacuated and promote emergency vehicles to carry out the evacuation and rescue work. The stand or fall of traffic management measures has a direct influence on treatment effect of emergent events, so we shall evaluate and analyze the measures in advance.|$|R
40|$|Hypervelocity {{impacts on}} {{satellites}} or ring particles replenish circumplanetary dusty rings with grains of all sizes. Due to {{interactions with the}} plasma environment and sunlight, these grains become electrically charged. We study the motion of charged dust grains launched at the Kepler orbital speed, under the combined effects of gravity and the electromagnetic force. We conduct numerical simulations of dust grain trajectories, covering {{a broad range of}} launch distances from the planetary surface to beyond synchronous orbit, and the full range of charge-to-mass ratios from ions to rocks, with both positive and negative electric potentials. Initially, we assume that dust grains have a constant electric potential, and, treating the spinning planetary magnetic field as an aligned and centered dipole, we map regions of radial instability (positive grains only), where dust grains are driven to escape or collide with the planet at high speed, and vertical instability (both positive and negative charges) whereby grains launched near the equatorial plane and are forced up magnetic field lines to high latitudes, where they may collide with the planet. We derive analytical criteria for local stability in the equatorial plane, and solve for the boundaries between all unstable and stable outcomes. Comparing our analytical solutions to our numerical simulations, we develop an extensive model for the radial, vertical and azimuthal motions of dust grains of arbitrary size and launch location. We test these solutions at Jupiter and Saturn, both of whose magnetic fields are reasonably well represented by aligned dipoles, {{as well as at the}} Earth, whose magnetic field is close to an anti-aligned dipole. We then evaluate the robustness of our stability boundaries to more general conditions. Firstly, we examine the effects of non-zero launch speeds, of up to 0. 5 km s$^{- 1 }$, in the frame of the parent body. Although these only weakly affect stability boundaries, we find that the influence of a launch impulse on stability boundaries strongly depends on its direction. Secondly, we focus on the effects of higher-order magnetic field components on orbital stability. We find that vertical stability boundaries are particularly sensitive to a moderate vertical offset in an aligned dipolar magnetic field. This configuration suffices as a model for Saturn's full magnetic field. The vertical instability also expands to cover a wider range of launch distances in slightly tilted magnetic dipoles, like the magnetic field configurations for Earth and Jupiter. By contrast, our radial stability criteria remain largely unaffected by both dipolar tilts and vertical offsets. Nevertheless, a tilted dipole magnetic field model introduces non-axisymmetric forces on orbiting dust grains, which are exacerbated by the inclusion of other higher-order magnetic field components, including the quadrupolar and octupolar terms. Dust grains whose orbital periods are commensurate with the spatial periodicities of a rotating non-axisymmetric magnetic field experience destabilizing Lorentz resonances. These have been studied by other authors for the largest dust grains moving on perturbed Keplerian ellipses. With Jupiter's full magnetic field as our model, we extend the concept of Lorentz resonances to smaller dust grains and find that these can destabilize trajectories on surprisingly short timescales, and even cause negatively-charged dust grains to escape within weeks. We provide detailed numerically-derived stability maps highlighting the destabilizing effects of specific higher-order terms in Jupiter's magnetic field, and we develop analytical solutions for the radial locations of these resonances for all charge-to-mass ratios. We include stability maps for the full magnetic field configurations of Jupiter, Saturn, and Earth, to compare with our analytics. We further provide numerically-derived stability maps for the tortured magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Relaxing the assumption of constant electric charges on dust, we test the effects of time-variable grain charging on dust grain motion in two distinct environments. Firstly, we examine orbital stability in the tenuous plasma of Jupiter's main ring and gossamer ring where sunlight, the dominant source of grain charging, is periodically <b>interrupted</b> by <b>transit</b> through the planetary shadow. This dramatically expands dynamical instabilities to cover a large range of grain sizes. Secondly, we study the motion of dust grain orbits in the dense plasma environment of the Io torus. Here dust grain charges deviate little from equilibrium, and our stability map conforms closely to that of constant, negatively-charged dust grains. Finally, we focus on the poorly understood spokes in Saturn's B ring, highlighting the observational constraints on spokes, and present our hypothesis for spoke formation...|$|R
