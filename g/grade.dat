Arguably the most significant is Crow Hall, a <b>Grade</b> II* listed building, is an early 18th-century sandstone and ashlar, one-room deep building at Crowhall Lane. The adjacent Crow Hall Cottage and gate piers are <b>Grade</b> II listed buildings. At Victoria Terrace stands Felling post office; a two-story course sandstone building with quoins and a Welsh slate roof. Close by is the Imperial Bingo Club, built as a dance hall in 1927 and converted to a bingo hall in 1930, at Victoria Square. Both are <b>Grade</b> II listed buildings. Also a <b>Grade</b> II listed building is Ardallan; the first house built at Holly-Hill field in Felling constructed of sandstone and with three sash windows.

40|$|When one {{studies the}} {{structure}} (e. g. <b>graded</b> ideals, <b>graded</b> subspaces, radicals, [...] .) or <b>graded</b> polynomial identities of <b>graded</b> algebras, the <b>grading</b> group {{itself does not}} play an important role, but can be replaced by any other group that realizes the same <b>grading.</b> Here {{we come to the}} notion of weak equivalence of gradings: two gradings are weakly equivalent if there exists an isomorphism between the <b>graded</b> algebras that maps each <b>graded</b> component onto a <b>graded</b> component. The following question arises naturally: when a group <b>grading</b> on a finite dimensional algebra is weakly equivalent to a <b>grading</b> by a finite group? It turns out that this question can be reformulated purely group theoretically in terms of the universal group of the <b>grading.</b> Namely, a <b>grading</b> is weakly equivalent to a <b>grading</b> by a finite group if and only if the universal group of the <b>grading</b> is residually finite with respect to a special subset of the <b>grading</b> group. The same is true for all the coarsenings of the <b>grading</b> if and only if the universal group of the <b>grading</b> is hereditarilly residually finite with respect to the same subset. We show that if n≥ 353, then on the full matrix algebra M_n(F) there exists an elementary group <b>grading</b> that is not weakly equivalent to any <b>grading</b> by a finite (semi) group, and if n≤ 3, then any elementary <b>grading</b> on M_n(F) is weakly equivalent to an elementary <b>grading</b> by a finite group. In addition, we study categories and functors related to the notion of weak equivalence of gradings. In particular, we introduce an oplax 2 -functor that assigns to each <b>grading</b> its support and show that the universal <b>grading</b> group functor has neither left nor right adjoint.
