5|$|In {{the century}} {{following}} its adoption, the <b>guidon</b> gained significant popularity, being flown {{not only by}} the state but frequently also by its residents and businesses. In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the best design among the 72 official flags of the U.S. states and territories and Canadian provinces. Ohio's ranked 15th.|$|E
25|$|Second Order Colours-Regimental/Wing <b>Guidons</b> and Banners:In the Spanish Armed Forces, <b>Guidons</b> and Banners {{are second}} order colours, but are more smaller (<b>Guidons</b> are medium square shaped while Banners are small square shaped). <b>Guidons</b> {{are used by}} battalions, squadrons and groups (even vessels) in the Armed Forces while the banners are used by companies, troops, flights and batteries. All have {{different}} and unique designs {{with some of these}} having the old Burgundy cross on them. These have also the unit insignia at the centre. Like the Regimental Colour the finials of these colours have the attached unit battle honours and decorations.|$|R
25|$|Exceptions {{to the use}} of branch {{colors for}} <b>guidons</b> are found in the {{infantry}} and cavalry. The infantry branch colors are light blue and white, but infantry <b>guidons</b> have a field of Old Glory blue (the same shade of blue as used for the canton of the US national flag). The cavalry branch colors are yellow and dark blue. Cavalry <b>guidons,</b> however, are horizontally divided, scarlet over white, with troop letters and squadron/regimental numbers in white and scarlet, but no branch insignia.|$|R
50|$|In 1927 the New Zealand mounted rifles regiments {{received}} {{permission from}} King George V to carry <b>Guidons.</b> Although some mounted rifles regiments were later presented with <b>Guidons,</b> {{there is no}} record of WMR ever having received this honour, and that position continues to this day.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the action, Rotheram left Royal Sovereign to take command of HMS Bellerophon, whose captain, John Cooke had been killed by a French sniper. Cooke had been targeted due to the dress uniform he had worn during the battle. Bellerophon escorted Victory carrying Nelson's body back to Britain, and Rotheram carried the <b>guidon</b> behind the coffin at Nelson's funeral in London. Rotheram was presented with a gold medal and sword of honour in recognition of his services in the action, and continued in command of Bellerophon.|$|E
5|$|On 6 February 1956, {{the then}} Governor General, Field Marshal Sir William Slim, {{presented}} the regiment with its <b>Guidon</b> at a Regimental Parade held in Puckapunyal. Also in 1956 the regiment {{was equipped with}} the Centurion armoured recovery vehicle, allowing the retirement of the Churchill recovery vehicle. Following {{the expansion of the}} Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) in 1960, A Squadron was disbanded, reducing the regiment to two squadrons, and the majority of its personnel formed regular squadrons in the 4th/19th Prince of Wales' Light Horse and the 2nd/14th Light Horse (Queensland Mounted Infantry), which were predominantly CMF formations. These squadrons subsequently became part of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, which was later redesignated the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and in turn provided the nucleus for the newly raised 3rd Cavalry Regiment.|$|E
25|$|The <b>guidon</b> is a {{great source}} of pride for the unit, and several {{military}} traditions have developed around it, stemming back from ancient times. Any sort of disgrace toward the <b>guidon</b> is considered a dishonor of the unit as a whole, and punishment is typical. For example, should the <b>guidon</b> bearer drop the <b>guidon,</b> they must fall with it and perform punishment, often in the form of push-ups. Other units may attempt to steal the <b>guidon</b> to demoralize or antagonize the unit. Veteran soldiers know not to give up the <b>guidon</b> to anyone outside their unit, but new recruits may be tempted into relinquishing it by a superior, especially during a unit run.|$|E

25|$|Guidons {{are also}} used in recruit {{training}} to identify individual platoons. First and second phase platoons have a gold background with their four-digit platoon number in scarlet, while third phase platoons have a scarlet background with gold lettering and trim. The <b>guidon</b> is used {{as an aid to}} instilling unit identity and pride, representing the platoon. Some drill instructors will test that pride by attempting to dishonor the <b>guidon</b> and expecting the recruits to intervene. Also, the recruit assigned to carry it, the guide, is treated as the most senior recruit of the platoon, and uses the <b>guidon</b> to marks the line of advance in close-quarters drill.|$|E

25|$|Separate {{numbered}} TO {{companies have}} guidons with their numerical designation under the branch insignia, e.g. the <b>guidon</b> of the 380th Quartermaster Company is buff with the insignia of the Quartermaster Corps over the numerals “380” in ultramarine blue, these being the named {{colors of the}} branch. Headquarters companies of groups, brigades, divisions and corps have guidons of a design corresponding to that of their Organizational Flag, e.g. the <b>guidon</b> of a headquarters battery of a Field Artillery Brigade or Fires Brigade would be vertically divided, scarlet and yellow, with the brigade's shoulder sleeve insignia centered.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{standard}} and the <b>guidon</b> are usually of crimson trimmed {{in gold and}} with the regiment's insignia in the centre. The regiment's battle honours are emblazoned on both the obverse and reverse, up {{to a maximum of}} 22 on each side.|$|E

25|$|Lettered {{companies}} (troops and {{batteries in}} the cavalry and field artillery respectively) of battalions (squadrons in the cavalry) have guidons displaying the branch insignia, the company letter, and the battalion and regimental numbers. The base {{color of the}} <b>guidon</b> is the first named color of the applicable branch, e.g. scarlet for field artillery, with the letters, numerals and insignia applied in the second named color of the branch, e.g. yellow for field artillery. For companies of separate battalions, the branch insignia is centered on the <b>guidon</b> between the battalion number above and the company letter below. For companies of battalions of regiments, the number above the insignia {{is that of the}} regiment; the number of the battalion is vertically centered between the insignia and the hoist. Groups use diagonal stripes of the branch's secondary color.|$|E

25|$|Philippine {{military}} colours are the Flag of the Philippines as the National Colour, the Organizational Colours, and the Unit Regimental Colour. The Flag of the Philippines is the National Colour of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, {{but unlike}} the US colour has no markings on the flag. The Organizational Colours are the flags of the AFP's four Major Service Commands while the Unit Regimental Colour differs per service arm and unit. Like the US, it also has 2nd order <b>guidons</b> for companies and troops, but these are also based on the Spanish military <b>guidons</b> and banners, not on the American ones, reflecting {{the long history of}} the military establishment here. These <b>guidons</b> are therefore not swallow tailed save for the PMA, the Philippine Army's Escort and Security Btn and some other units under the Philippine Army.|$|R
