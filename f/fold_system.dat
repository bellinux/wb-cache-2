5000|$|Weddin Mountains is a {{national}} park in New South Wales, Australia, 291 km west of Sydney. It is a small crescent shaped range, with a high point some 750 m above sea level, running roughly north south with steep cliffs {{on the eastern side}} sloping more gradually down to the plane in the west. Weddin mountains is a small patch of remnant vegetation which escaped clearing due to its ruggedness.

Its image-recognition system and robotic arms currently take three to 10 minutes to pick and fold each item, or overnight for a load of laundry. It will go on sale in Japan first, and subsequently, in a limited number, in the United States. Release date is set to 2017, with pre-orders starting on March.

50|$|The {{region is}} part of the Cathaysian <b>fold</b> <b>system</b> and has {{experienced}} high volcanic activity and the formation of large fault structures, which were subsequently subject to erosion by water and weathering. The landscape is characterized by beautiful winding river valleys flanked by columnar or dome-shaped cliffs as well as cave systems. Peaks in the western portion of the Wuyi Mountains typically consist of volcanic or plutonic rocks, whereas peaks and hills in the eastern area are made up of red sandstone (particularly in the east) with very steep slopes but flat tops (Danxia landform). The Nine-bend River (Jiuqu Xi), about 60 kilometers in length, meanders in a deep gorge among these hills. Bedrock lithology at Wuyi Shan is dominated by tuff, rhyolite, and granite in the western part. Red sandstone is common farther east.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} is {{developed for the}} design and analysis of single-viewpoint catadioptric cameras that use two or more mirrors. The use of multiple mirrors permits folding of the optics which leads to more compact camera designs than ones that use a single mirror. A dictionary of camera designs that use two conic mirrors is presented. We show that any <b>folded</b> <b>system</b> that uses conic mirrors has a geometrically equivalent system that uses a single conic mirror. This result {{makes it easy to}} determine the scene-toimage mapping of a conic <b>folded</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, we discuss the optical benefits of using <b>folded</b> <b>systems.</b> As an example, we choose a camera design from our dictionary and optimize its parameters via optical simulations. This design is used to construct a compact video camera that provides a hemispherical field of view. ...|$|R
5000|$|Bastak Nature Reserve (Бастак заповедник) (also Bastack) is a Russian 'zapovednik' (strict nature reserve) {{located in}} the Amur River basin in the Russian Far East. The reserve's {{territory}} covers the south-eastern spurs Bureinsky Ridge and the northern outskirts of the Sredneamurskaya lowlands. The reserve is situated in about 10 km {{north of the city}} of Birobidzhan in the Birobidzhansky District, and is the only national reserve in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. ==Topography== The reserve can be pictured as divided into two halves, mountainous to the northwest, lowlands to the southeast. The highlands of the northwest are south-eastern spurs Khingan-Bureya mountain system, an ancient crystalline massif. The southeast lowlands of the reserve are part of the Sikhote-Alin Mountain <b>fold</b> <b>system.</b> The mountain ridges run north-south, which is typical for the Far East. In the north of the reserve, the mountains range up to 1,207 meters in altitude (Mt. Byrdyr), with an average altitude of 800 meters; the slopes are steep and the river valleys deep. To the south, the altitudes average 400-500 meters, and the terrain is hilly with more rounded and flat tops than steep valleys. The lowest areas at 200 meters are alluvial floodplains.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the first}} {{battle with the}} Zentradi, the SDF-1 {{attempted}} to draw the enemy away from the island, and its civilian population, by using its space-fold capability {{to travel to the}} far side of the Moon. There they could rendezvous with U.N. Space orbital fleet. However, the space-folding not only transported the ship but also the entire Macross Island and its surrounding sea to the orbit of Pluto. As with the anti-gravity system, the space-fold system was lost after initial use. After rescuing the civilians from the island, the ship underwent a refit from February to March 2009. It was at this point that a civilian and business sector was built into the aft section hull. The CVS-101 Prometheus and the SLV-111 Daedalus submersible sea carriers which were in the surrounding sea, also docked with SDF-1 Macross. Due to the loss of the <b>Fold</b> <b>system,</b> the crew was forced to implement a modular transformation to the ship each time the main gun was to be used. The resulting transformation changes the external appearance of the ship to that of the [...] "Storm Attacker" [...] mode, a giant robot. According to series creator Shoji Kawamori, the entire transformation process would take approximately 15 minutes to complete.|$|E

This takes longer than a <b>folding</b> <b>system</b> but is typically lighter and less costly, and can also be used for craft with too much beam for a <b>folding</b> <b>system.</b> For example, the small modern Weta Trimaran uses tubes to connect the floats to the main hull, which are lashed in from a canvas trampoline and further held in place by the sidestays. Similarly, the original Dragonfly Trimarans (Dragonfly 600) and the home built W22 use this design.|$|R

40|$|The Late Cretaceous {{reconstruction}} {{shows that}} the inner zones of the West, East, and South Carpathians were adjacent to the Dinarides and Hellenides at that time, forming together with them a linear <b>fold</b> <b>system</b> with bilateral vergence. This <b>fold</b> <b>system</b> had a northwest strike. In Paleogene-early Miocene times the general deformation of the given part of the Alpine belt took place. It was caused by rotation of its Asia Minor-Balkan part relative to the more {{northern part of the}} belt. This rotation (30 °- 40 ” counter-clockwise) was accompanied by a shortening of the considered segment of the Alpine belt by 30 %. Hence exfoliation of the Carpathian-Pontide and Dinaric-Tauride branches of the Alpine belt from each other, and their disharmonious plastic deformation, resulted {{in the formation of the}} Aegean and Tauride structural arcs and the Carpathian structural loop.

40|$|We {{study the}} thermal and {{compositional}} structure of south China by jointly inverting Rayleigh wave dispersion data, geoid height, topography, and surface heat flow with a probabilistic (Bayesian) Monte Carlo method. We {{find that the}} lithosphere is thin (85 - 150 km) beneath the South China <b>Fold</b> <b>system</b> and thickens over the Yangtze Craton to maximum thicknesses of up to 250 km beneath the Sichuan Basin. Our inversion predicts that the lithospheric mantle beneath the South China <b>Fold</b> <b>system</b> and Yangtze Craton is highly fertile (Mg# ~ 88 - 90), in agreement with independent geochemical signatures from East China mantle xenoliths. Such fertile compositions, together with the relatively thin lithospheric thickness in the area, point toward a widespread metasomatism/refertilization event. We suggest, as others have, that a flat-subduction episode and subsequent slab removal may have triggered both the delamination of the lowermost part of the subcontinental lithosphere and the generation of asthenospheric melts that metasomatized (refertilized) the remaining lithospheric mantle. Inconsistencies among geophysical observations and anomalously fertile compositions for the Sichuan Basin indicate that this region may be currently affected by small-scale convection or delamination processes. Alternatively, the anomalous observations {{may be associated with}} an eastward push of Tibetan lithosphere beneath the Yangtze Craton. 25 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] In {{order to}} {{understand}} interactions between motion along thrusts and the associated style of deformation and strain distribution in their hangingwalts, geologic mapping and strain measurements were conducted in an excellently exposed thrust-related <b>fold</b> <b>system</b> in the Lewis thrust plate, northwestern Montana. This system consists of: (1) an E-directed basal thrust (the Gunsight thrust) that has a fiat-ramp geometry and a slip of about 3. 6 km; (2) an E-verging asymmetric anticline with its nearly vertical forelimb truncated by the basal thrust from below; (3) a 4 -km wide fold belt, the frontal fold complex, that lies {{directly in front of}} the E-verging anticline; (4) a W-directed bedding-parallel fault (the Mount Thompson fault) that bounds the top of the frontal fold belt and separates it from the undeformed tobroadly folded strata bove; and (5) regionally developed, W-dipping spaced cleavage. Although the overall geometry of the thrust-related <b>fold</b> <b>system</b> differs from any previously documented fault-related folds, the E-verging anticline itself resembles geometrically a Rich-type fault-bend fold. The observed initial cut-off and fold interlimb angles of this anticline, however, cannot be explained by cross-section balancing models for the development of either a fault-bend fold or a fault-propagation fold. Possible origins for the E-verging anticline include (1) the fold initiated as an open fault-bend fold and tightened only later during its emplacement along the basal thrust and (2) the fold started as either a fault-bend or a fault-propagation fold, but simultaneous or subsequent volume change incompatible with an...|$|E
