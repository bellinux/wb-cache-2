40|$|Abstract Background Brucella ovis causes an {{infectious}} disease responsible for infertility and subsequent economic losses in sheep production. The standard serological test to detect B. ovis infection in rams is the {{complement fixation test}} (CFT), which has imperfect sensitivity and specificity in addition to technical drawbacks. Other available tests include the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (<b>I-ELISA)</b> but no <b>I-ELISA</b> kit has been fully evaluated. The study aimed to compare an <b>I-ELISA</b> kit and the standard CFT. Our study was carried out on serum samples from 4599 rams from the South of France where the disease is enzootic. A Bayesian approach was used to estimate tests characteristics (diagnostic sensitivity, Se and diagnostic specificity, Sp). The tests were then studied together in order to optimise testing strategies to detect B. ovis. Results After optimising the cut-off values {{in order to avoid}} doubtful results without deteriorating the concordance between the results of the two tests, the <b>I-ELISA</b> appeared to be slightly more sensitive than CFT (Se <b>I-ELISA</b> [*]=[*] 0. 917 [0. 822; 0. 992], 95 % Credibility Interval (CrI) compared to Se CFT [*]=[*] 0. 860 [0. 740; 0. 967], 95 % CrI). However, CFT was slightly more specific than <b>I-ELISA</b> (Sp CFT [*]=[*] 0. 988 [0. 947; 1. 0], 95 % CrI) compared to Sp <b>I-ELISA</b> = 0. 952 [0. 901; 1. 0], 95 % CrI). The tests were then associated with two different interpretation schemes. The series association increased the specificity of screening and could be used for pre-movement testing in rams from uninfected flocks. The parallel association increased sequence sensitivity, thus appearing more suitable for eradicating the disease in infected flocks. Conclusions The high sensitivity and acceptable specificity of this <b>I-ELISA</b> kit support its potential interest to avoid the limitations of CFT. The two tests could also be used together or combined with other diagnostic methods such as semen culture to improve the testing strategy. The choice of test sequence and interpretation criteria depends on the epidemiological context, screening objectives and the financial and practical constraints. </p...|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} indirect {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (<b>I-ELISA)</b> for the serological {{diagnosis of}} bovine brucellosis was developed and validated in-house. A total of 4803 cattle sera from South Africa (n= 3 643), Canada (n= 652), Germany (n= 240), France (n= 73) and the USA (n= 195) was used. The South African panel of sera represented 834 sera known to be positive by the Rose Bengal test (RBT), serum agglutination test (SAT) and complement fixation test (CFT), 2709 sera that were negative by CFT and 100 sera from animals vaccinated with a standard dose of Brucella abortus strain 19. Overseas sera were obtained from reference non-vaccinated brucella-free cattle (n= 834), naturally infected (n= 72), experimentally infected (n= 71) and vaccinated animals (n= 83). Also 100 sera collected from cattle in Canada and known to be positive by competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) were used. The intermediate ranges ("borderline" range for the interpretation of test results) were derived from two-graph receiver operating characteristics analysis. The lowest values of the misclassification cost-term analysis obtained from testing overseas panels covered lower <b>I-ELISA</b> cut-off PP values (0. 02 - 3. 0) than those from local panels (1. 5 - 5. 0). The relatively low cut-off PP values selected for <b>I-ELISA</b> were {{due to the fact that}} the positive control used represents a very strong standard compared to other reference positive sera. The greater overlap found between negative and positive cattle sera from South Africa than that between reference overseas panels was probably due to the different criteria used in classifying these panels as negative (sera from true non-diseased/non-infected animals) or positive (sera from true diseased/infected animals). The diagnostic sensitivity of the <b>I-ELISA</b> (at the optimum cutoff value) was 100 % and of the CFT 83. 3 %. The diagnostic specificity of <b>I-ELISA</b> was 99. 8 % and of the CFT 100 %. Estimate of Youden's index was higher for the <b>I-ELISA</b> (0. 998) than that for the CFT (0. 833). Analysis of distribution of PP values in sera from vaccinated and naturally infected cattle shows that in vaccinated animals all readings were below 31 PP where in infected ones these values represented 43 %. Therefore, it appears that <b>I-ELISA</b> could be of use in identifying some naturally infected animals (with values > 31 PP) but more sera from reference vaccinated and infected animals need to be tested to further substantiate this statistically. Of 834 sera positive by RBT, SAT and CFT, 825 (98. 9 %) were positive in the <b>I-ELISA.</b> Compared to C-ELISA the relative diagnostic sensitivity of the <b>I-ELISA</b> was 94 % and of the CFT 88 % when testing 100 Canadian cattle sera. Of 258 South African cattle sera, of which 183 (70. 9 %) were positive by the <b>I-ELISA</b> and 148 (57. 4 %) by the CFT, 197 (76. 4 %) were positive by C-ELISA when re-tested in Canada. One has to stress, however, that Canadian C-ELISA has not been optimised locally. Thus, the C-ELISA was probably not used at the best diagnostic threshold for testing South African cattle sera. This study shows that the <b>I-ELISA</b> performed on an automated ELISA workstation provides a rapid, simple, highly sensitive and specific diagnostic system for large-scale detection of antibodies against B. abortus. Based on the diagnostic accuracy of this assay reported here, the authors suggest that it could replace not only the currently used confirmatory CFT test, but also the two in-use screening tests, namely the RBT and SAT.

40|$|ObjectiveTo explore immunochemical {{characterization}} of antigens of Brucella canis (B. canis), {{and the use}} in seroprevalence study of canine brucellosis. MethodsExternal hot phosphate buffer saline extract (HPBSE) and internal sonicated (SA) antigens were prepared from B. canis strain MEX 51 and immunochemically characterized. These antigens were used to test 527 serum samples of dogs by 2 -mercaptoethanol-tube agglutination test (2 ME-TAT), {{agar gel immunodiffusion test}} (AGID), dot-ELISA and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<b>I-ELISA)</b> to assess the seroprevalence of canine brucellosis. ResultsThe protein content of HPBSE and SA antigens was 0. 387 mg/mL and 0. 195 mg/mL, respectively, whereas carbohydrate content was 0. 174 mg/mL and 0. 150 mg/mL, respectively. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12. 5 %) of HPBSE and SA, revealed 6 and 8 visible peptide bands ranging from 18 - 80 kDa and 12 - 45 kDa, respectively. Western blot analysis showed immunodominant bands of MW 12, 28, 39 and 45 kDa for HPBSE and 20 - 24 kDa for SA. The AGID revealed HPBSE as more specific antigen than SA but both <b>I-ELISA</b> and dot-ELISA indicated SA antigen to be more specific and reliable than HPBSE.

40|$|A {{combination}} of far-field electrospinning (FFES) and free-radical polymerization {{has been used}} to fabricate coated electrospun polymer fiber mats as a new type of biosensor platform. Poly (3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) electrospun fibers were dip-coated with different compositions of poly methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid (poly(MMA-co-MAA)). This synergistic approach utilizes large specific surface area of PHBV fibers and co-polymer coatings that feature an optimum concentration of surface carboxyl (–COOH) groups. The platform surface morphology, porosity and tunable hydrophobicity enhance biomolecular interactions via plurality of molecular forces.

It was concluded that LPB-ELISA showed better sensitivity than <b>I-ELISA</b> and S-ELISA, also after 46 days challenge with the heterologous serotype. However, these two last techniques demonstrated similar specificity when the titers were compared with those obtained in SNT, even though after the heterologous serotype challenge the SNT produced better results. This study demonstrated the close relationship between LPB-ELISA and SNT assays. No presente estudo, foram vacinados 150 frangos de corte de um dia de idade com sorotipo H 120, e, após 28 dias desafiados à vacinação com o sorotipo M 41 do vírus da bronquite infecciosa das aves. Da mesma forma, foram obtidos 150 soros de aves não vacinadas para a análise. Os respectivos soros foram analisados 28, 34 e 46 dias após o desafio, examinados através das técnicas de ELISA indireto (ELISA-I), Sandwich ELISA (S-ELISA) e ELISA com bloqueio de fase líquida (ELISA-BFL) e comparados com a técnica padrão de soroneutralização (SN) para efeito de cálculo da especificidade e sensibilidade relativas, bem como os valores predictivos positivos e negativos. O cálculo do coeficiente de correlação também foi empregado para a análise de concordância. Assim, os valores da correlação encontrados foram r = 0. 98 entre ELISA-BFL x SNT, r = 0. 79 entre S-ELISA x SNT e r = 0. 74 ELISA-I x SNT. No entanto, quando comparamos as técnicas de ELISA entre si, ELISA-BFL x S-ELISA, ELISA-BFL x ELISA-I e S-ELISA x ELISA-I os valores encontrados foram r = 0. 75, r = 0. 69 e r = 0. 79. A técnica de ELISA-BFL demonstrou melhor sensibilidade relativa que as técnicas de S-ELISA e ELISA-I, mesmo 46 dias após o desafio com a estirpe heteróloga. Entretanto, apesar das técnicas de S-ELISA e ELISA-I apresentarem especificidade realtiva superiores, a melhor correlação observada foi entre as técnicas de ELISA-BFL e a SN...|$|E

In the present study we evaluated antibody responses of infected and B. melitensis Rev. 1 -vaccinated sheep to the BP 26 protein using purified recombinant BP 26 protein produced in Escherichia coli in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<b>I-ELISA).</b> The specificity of the <b>I-ELISA</b> determined with sera from healthy sheep (n = 106) was 93 %. The sensitivity of the <b>I-ELISA</b> assessed with sera from naturally infected and suspected sheep found positive in the current conventional diagnostic tests was as follows: 100 % for bacteriologically and serologically positive sheep (n = 50), 88 % for bacteriologically negative but serologically and delayed-type hypersensitivity-positive sheep (n = 50), and 84 % for bacteriologically and serologically negative but delayed-type hypersensitivity-positive sheep (n = 19). However, the absorbance values observed did not reach those observed in an <b>I-ELISA</b> using purified O-polysaccharide (O-PS) as an antigen. In sheep experimentally infected with B. melitensis H 38 the antibody response to BP 26 was delayed and much weaker than that to O-PS. Nevertheless, the BP 26 protein appears to be a good diagnostic antigen to be used in confirmatory tests and for serological differentiation between infected and B. melitensis Rev. 1 -vaccinated sheep. Weak antibody responses to BP 26 in some of the latter sheep suggest that a B. melitensis Rev. 1 bp 26 gene deletion mutant should be constructed to ensure this differentiation...|$|E

A class of epizootiology {{students at the university}} was involved in the investigation. Comprehensive information about the nature and causation of the disease was provided. Four diagnostic techniques were used for confirmatory diagnosis, including Indirect Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (<b>I-ELISA),</b> immunoblotting, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and virus isolation. Only immunoblotting assay was used at the University of Ibadan, while samples were sent to the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) in Vom, Nigeria for <b>I-ELISA</b> and to two reference laboratories for African swine fever in South Africa and Madrid, Spain for PCR and virus isolation respectively. The results obtained from these laboratories using the other three diagnostic techniques were compared with that of the immunoblotting assay. Immunoblotting assay confirmed all samples that tested positive on PCR and virus isolation. It was also relatively easier to use, highly sensitive and specific for confirmatory diagnosis.

Common method to detect infection of BCMV involves serological assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The aims of this research is to assess the sensitivity of three methods, i. e. Indirect Enzym-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (<b>I-ELISA),</b> Dot Immunobinding Assay (DIBA), and reverse transcription (RT) -PCR as detection method for BCMV infection in yard long bean. Sensitivity level of the methods was evaluated by diluting plant extract and antisera for <b>I-ELISA</b> and DIBA, and cDNA as template in RT-PCR. Virus isolate from Cirebon was maintained in yard long bean in screenhouse and used for the assessment. Absorbance value of ELISA showed that dilution end point for <b>I-ELISA</b> was reached at 10 - 3 and 10 - 2 of plant extract and antisera dilution, respectively. Positive infection was still detected using DIBA when the plant extract was diluted up to 10 - 5 based on development of color intensity on nitrocellulose membrane.

An anti-Brucella-LPS monoclonal antibody (MAb 4 B 5 A) (c-ELISA and DELFIA) and an anti-swine IgG monoclonal antibody (MAb 10 C 2 G 5) (<b>i-ELISA)</b> {{were used for the}} three assays. The specificity (Sp) and sensitivity (Se) of the assays gave the following results: Se and Sp = 100 % at a cut-off value of 61. 0 % (B/B 0 %) for c-ELISA; Sp = 99. 1 % and Se = 100 % at a cut-off value of 21. 7 % (percentage positivity: PP%) for i-ELISA; Sp = 91. 0 % and Se = 75 % at a cut-off value of 37. 0 % (B/B 0 %) for DELFIA. In addition, the performance of a commercial fluorescence polarisation assay (FPA), standardised for bovine sera, was evaluated in swine sera. The specificity and sensitivity obtained were both 100 % at a cut-off value of 99. 5 (millipolarisation unit values).

The aims of this research is to produce antiserum of the Pepper yellow leaf curl virus by rabbit immunization using purified gcminivirus of Segunung isolate. Identification of the virus was done by using modified <b>I-ELISA</b> and DIBA methods and also by using western blott. <b>I-ELISA</b> and DIBA methods were able to detect the geminivirus in the infected samples. The reactivity of antiserum was found to be similar amontI pepper isolates from different location (Segunung, Yogyakarta, Cugenang, and Lembang) ana those from different hosts (pepper, tobacco, tomato and Ageratum conyzoides) The antiserum could also be used for detection and identification of the Pepper yellow leaf curl virus in its vector. A single insect vector is sufficient for the detection of virus properly. The detection of geminivirus in its vector is very useful because {{it can be used to}} study the epidemic of the disease in the field. The <b>I-ELISA</b> and DIBA methods are very useful as tools for detecting the geminivirus. The methods are very easy to be carried out, fastly, and need only a minimum cost on operation.

40|$|Control and {{eradication}} of bovine brucellosis is usually {{based on the}} serological detection of antibodies. In Argentina, the Rose Bengal test (RB) and the Buffered Plate antigen test (BPA) are the two screening test officially recognized, while the 2 -mercaptoethanol test (2 ME) and the Tube Agglutination test (SAT) are the confirmatory assays currently in use. In order to improve the serological diagnosis of bovine brucellosis in Patagonia, Argentina, an indirect ELISA kit produced by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division was evaluated. Sera from negative non-vaccinated, negative but vaccinated and positive animals were tested by all the above techniques. The specificity of the <b>I-ELISA</b> (99. 6 % and 99. 7 %) {{was similar to that}} of the BPA, RB, 2 ME and Complement Fixation test (CF) when used to test sera from non-vaccinated, negative and vaccinated, negative animals, respectively.

40|$|Mucin 1 (MUC 1), a tumor-associated antigen, is a transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} {{expressed by}} normal epithelial cells and overexpressed by carcinomas of epithelial origin. Autoantibodies against MUC 1 are {{often found in}} circulation, either free or bound to immune complexes, which might contribute to limit tumor outgrowth and dissemination by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and were found favorably predictive of survival in early breast cancer patients. There is no commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for detecting the anti-MUC 1 antibodies in human serum thus far. To detect circulating anti-MUC 1 antibodies, we established an indirect ELISA (<b>I-ELISA)</b> using a recombinant MUC 1 protein containing six tandem repeat sequences of MUC 1 after the antigenicity and specificity of the protein were confirmed. The <b>I-ELISA</b> had a sensitivity of 91. 3 % and a specificity of 94. 1 % when a competitive <b>I-ELISA</b> {{was used as a}} reference test. The results showed that more patients with benign breast tumors (P = 0. 001) and breast cancer patients before primary treatment (P = 0. 010) were found to have anti-MUC 1 IgG than healthy women; anti-MUC 1 IgG before primary treatment was found more than after primary treatment (P = 0. 016) in breast cancer patients. Interestingly, the anti-MUC 1 IgG serum level was reversely correlated to that of CA 15 - 3 antigen in advanced-stage patients (r = − 0. 4294, P = 0. 046). Our study has demonstrated the suitability of the established <b>I-ELISA</b> for detecting circulating anti-MUC 1 antibodies in human serum. Furthermore, we found that circulating anti-MUC 1 antibodies may still bind MUC 1 shed into blood in stage IV breast cancer, which can support the use of MUC 1 -target immune therapy strategies...|$|E
40|$|Rift Valley {{fever and}} {{lumpy skin disease}} are transboundary viral {{diseases}} endemic in Africa and {{some parts of the}} Middle East, but with increasing potential for global emergence. Wild ruminants, such as the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), are thought {{to play a role in}} the epidemiology of these diseases. This study sought to expand the understanding of the role of buffalo in the maintenance of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) by determining seroprevalence to these viruses during an inter-epidemic period. Buffaloes from the Kruger National Park (n = 138) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (n = 110) in South Africa were sampled and tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralising antibodies against LSDV and RVFV using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<b>I-ELISA)</b> and the serum neutralisation test (SNT). The <b>I-ELISA</b> for LSDV and RVFV detected IgG antibodies in 70 of 248 (28. 2 %) and 15 of 248 (6. 1 %) buffaloes, respectively. Using the SNT, LSDV and RVFV neutralising antibodies were found in 5 of 66 (7. 6 %) and 12 of 57 (21. 1 %), respectively, of samples tested. The RVFV <b>I-ELISA</b> and SNT results correlated well with previously reported results. Of the 12 SNT RVFV-positive sera, three (25. 0 %) had very high SNT titres of 1 : 640. Neutralising antibody titres of more than 1 : 80 were found in 80. 0 % of the positive sera tested. The LSDV SNT results did not correlate with results obtained by the <b>I-ELISA</b> and neutralising antibody titres detected were low, with the highest (1 : 20) recorded in only two buffaloes, whilst 11 buffaloes (4. 4 %) had evidence of co-infection with both viruses.

Sixty percent of epizootic outbreaks of brucellosis identified in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) originated from Kazakhstan in recent years. Definitive diagnosis of brucellosis remains a difficult task. Precisely for this reason, we evaluated a purified recombinant out membrane protein 28 (rOMP 28) of Brucella species (Brucella spp.) produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a diagnostic antigen in an Indirect ELISA (<b>I-ELISA)</b> for bovine brucellosis. The gene encoding OMP 28 was synthesized using a two-round PCR procedure. In order to produce the rOMP 28, the de novo synthesized DNA was cloned into the expression vector pET- 22 b(+). Then, the rOMP 28 was expressed in E. coli system and characterized in the present study. We further estimated the diagnostic potential of purified rOMP 28 of Brucella spp. for screening bovine sera. To determine if rOMP 28 has a valuable benefit for use in the serodiagnosis of bovine brucellosis, rOMP 28 -based <b>I-ELISA</b> was performed. Brucella spp. positive (n= 62) and Brucella spp. negative (n= 28) samples from tube agglutination test (TAT) were positive (n= 59) and negative (n= 27) by <b>I-ELISA,</b> respectively.

For this reason, two methods, the indirect chemiluminescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<b>i-ELISA</b> CL) and the competitive chemiluminescence ELISA (c-ELISA CL) that use a chemiluminescent substrate to determine anti-Brucella antibodies in bovine and ovine serum were validated. The methods are based on the detection of anti-Brucella antibodies in serum by catalysis of a chemiluminescent enzyme substrate (luminol/ H 2 O 2 /enhancer system) by peroxidase conjugated to secondary anti IgG antibodies in <b>i-ELISA</b> CL and to monoclonal anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antibodies in c-ELISA CL. From the results obtained, a cut-off of 60 % for bovine serum and 37. 5 % for ovine serum, expressed as positivity rate (PR), were established Using these cut-off values, for the <b>i-ELISA</b> CL, 100 % sensitivity and specificity was obtained for bovine serum and 100 % sensitivity and 99. 8 % specificity for ovine serum.
