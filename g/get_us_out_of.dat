500|$|The {{next month}} Biden {{was not able}} to {{participate}} in two debates, the August 4 debate sponsored by the DailyKos and the August 9 LGBT Debate featured on the gay network Logo. He participated in the August 7 AFL-CIO Debate and the August 19 Iowa debate featured on ABC. On August 20 Biden aired his first campaign advertisement in the first caucus state of Iowa. In the 30-second ad a voiceover states that Biden has a plan to end the Iraq War, and that [...] "We (America) must end this war in a way that doesn't require us to send their (soldiers) grandchild back." [...] It continues by declaring, [...] "Joe Biden is the only candidate with a plan to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Iraq and keep us out." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Pearl Jam {{went for}} a two-week session at Henson. It {{was the first time}} the band spent a {{considerable}} amount of time recording outside of Seattle since 1996's No Code. McCready said, [...] " [...] we got together with Ed and it really started getting more cohesive, we took that momentum down to Los Angeles with Brendan... It was a great idea to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Seattle. You've gotta get out [...] your comfort zone, and we've talked about doing that for the past ten years and kind of haven't, so we trusted Brendan's judgment." [...] In April 2009, the band {{went for a}} two-week session to finish the album with O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album took a total of thirty days in the studio to get finished, and O'Brien stated [...] "we had 90% of the record cut in the first nine days".|$|E
500|$|Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up, is [...] "largely a {{selection}} of his best blog postings {{over the past few}} years related to climate change issues". TreeHugger describes the book as [...] "a whirlwind tour through the state of climate change, the media that so badly neglects it, the politicians who attempt to address it (and those who obstruct their efforts and ignore [...] science), and the clean energy solutions that could help <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mess." [...] In 2011, Romm sat on the panel of the Green Car Summit of the Washington Auto Show. His 2012 book, Language Intelligence, concerns persuasion and the effective use of rhetoric. [...] Ed Markey commented on the book, [...] "Joe masterfully ... scripts ways to master the metaphor, and incorporate irony. Solutions the reader can use for speeches, social media, or just winning the debate around the kitchen table." [...] Romm wrote an article for Time magazine in August 2012 using the research from Language Intelligence to analyze whether Mitt Romney or Barack Obama is the more effective communicator. In speeches and lectures since then, Romm has advocated that scientists use the principles of effective communication outlined in the book (instead of their usual, technical, neutral style) to better explain the dangers of, and solutions to, climate change to lay people and the media.|$|E

500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters {{as part of a}} pattern of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever figure out how to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{what you}} have said and Senator Kerry has said {{that you are going to}} do in order to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{problems}} in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of naïve? ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of,</b> and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E

40|$|New {{directions}} in management accounting studies should aim at <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ontological trap which {{is provided by}} the decision making conception of management. The Scandinavian tradition of fieldwork in the area might offer a basis for ontological renewal, which may open up for methodological innovation when we embark on epistemological adventures.

6000|$|... "No {{one will}} retain as {{grateful}} recollections {{of it as}} myself, gentlemen," [...] resumed the captain. [...] "You had no agency in <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> into the scrape, but the greatest possible agency in <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. Without the knowledge, prudence, and courage that you have all displayed, God knows what would have become of the poor Montauk, and {{from the bottom of}} my heart I thank you, each and all while I have the heartfelt satisfaction of seeing you around me, and of drinking to your future health, happiness and prosperity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right, Michael," [...] Harley soothed. [...] "Take it easy. Don't hurt yourself. The trouble's over. Anybody'll happen along {{any time}} now and <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this fix." ...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{thing we}} did was to devise a {{manoeuvre}} which was aimed at <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a difficult corner if we ever got into one. This may sound very extraordinary, probably, to practising pilots today, but it consisted of putting everything into the left hand front corner of the cockpit. If you saw a 109 on your tail, and it hadn't shot you down at that point, you put on full throttle, fine pitch, full left rudder, full left stick and full forward stick. This resulted in a horrible manoeuvre which was, in fact, a negative g spiral dive. But you would come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the bottom with no 109 on your tail and your aeroplane intact.

6000|$|... "Very well, Jeekie. Now {{listen to}} me--you've got to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Asiki-land by this day two months. If you don't, that lady will do {{anything}} to oblige me and no doubt there are more executioners left." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I reckon a {{good many}} of us had better try the same game," [...] a second man said seriously. [...] "The manager can't <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the hole, and we may as well begin to hustle for ourselves." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{they would}} lower {{a boat and}} come to our assistance; and, after quarter of an hour’s effort, would <b>get</b> <b>us</b> clean <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their way, {{so that they could}} go on; and we would thank them so much, and ask them to give us a tow. But they never would.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Archer, {{you take}} things very coolly, and I {{hope you will}} <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the scrape we have got into. If I had been by myself, I should have ridden up and {{surrendered}} to the first Russians I saw." ...|$|E
