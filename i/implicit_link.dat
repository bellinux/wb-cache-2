40|$|It is {{well known}} that Web-page {{classification}} can be enhanced by using hyperlinks that provide linkages between Web pages. However, in the Web space, hyperlinks are usually sparse, noisy and thus in many situations can only provide limited help in classification. In this paper, we extend the concept of linkages from explicit hyperlinks to <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> built between Web pages. By observing that people who search the Web with the same queries often click on di#erent, but related documents together, we draw <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> between Web pages that are clicked after the same queries. Those pages are implicitly linked. We provide an approach for automatically building the <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> between Web pages using Web query logs, together with a thorough comparison between the uses of <b>implicit</b> and explicit <b>links</b> in Web page classification. Our experimental results on a large dataset confirm that the use of the <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> is better than using explicit links in classification performance, with an increase of more than 10. 5 % in terms of the Macro-F 1 measurement...|$|R

50|$|The Implicit Association Test is a latency-based {{measure of}} the {{relative}} associations between two concepts. In a series of tasks, participants sort words or images representing a target concept such as race (white/black) and stimuli with known positive/negative valence into two categories (usually indicated by right or left location on a computer screen). Each category of concept words or images is paired with {{both positive and negative}} stimuli. The faster the catergoization occurs, the stronger the association is between words and/or images that are grouped together (ex. faster categorization of dogs when paired with positive rather than negative words), which would indicate and implicit attitude towards that object.

He was one of the [...] "Four Tutors" [...] who protested in March 1841 against the Anglo-Catholic John Henry Newman's Tract 90, despite his dislike of controversy.

40|$|Web link {{analysis}} {{has been proved}} to provide significant enhancement to the precision of web search in practice.

In this paper, we propose a novel link analysis algorithm which puts both explicit and <b>implicit</b> <b>link</b> structures under a unified framework, and show that HITS and DirectHit are essentially the two extreme instances of our proposed method. One important advantage of our method is its ability to analyze not only the hyperlinks between web-pages but also the interactions between the users and the Web at the same time. The importance of web-pages and users can reinforce each other to improve the Web link analysis. Compared with traditional HITS and DirectHit algorithms, our method further improves the search precision by 11. 8 % and 25. 3 %...|$|E

Most importantly, users tag their bookmarks for ease of information dissemination and later look up. However, it is the friendship links, that make delicious a social network. They exist independently of the set of bookmarks that belong to the users and have no relation to the tags typically assigned to the bookmarks. To study the interaction among users, the strength of the existing links and their hidden meaning, we introduce <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> in the network. These links connect only highly “similar” users. Here, similarity can reﬂect different aspects of the user’s proﬁle that makes her similar to any other user, such as number of shared bookmarks, or similarity of their tags clouds. We investigate the question whether friends have common interests, we gain additional insights on the strategies that users use to assign tags to their bookmarks, and we demonstrate that the graphs formed by <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> have unique properties differing from binomial random graphs or random graphs with an expected power-law degree distribution...|$|R

40|$|Social {{bookmarks}} allow Web {{users to}} actively annotate individual Web resources. Researchers are exploring {{the use of}} these annotations to create implicit links between online resources. We define an <b>implicit</b> <b>link</b> as a relationship between two online resources established by the Web community. An individual may create or reinforce a relationship between two resources by applying a common tag or organizing them in a common folder. This has led to the exploration of techniques for building networks of resources, categories, and people using the social annotations. In order for these techniques to move from the lab to the real world, efficient building and maintenance of these potentially large networks remains a major obstacle. Methods for assembling and indexing these large networks will allow researchers to run more rigorous assessments of their proposed techniques. Toward this goal we explore an approach from the sparse matrix literature and apply it to our system, GiveALink. org. We also investigate distributing the assembly, allowing us to grow the network with the body of resources, annotations, and users. Dividing the network is effective for assembling a global network where the implicit links are dependent on global properties. Additionally, we explore alternative <b>implicit</b> <b>link</b> measures that remove global dependencies and thus allow for the global network to be assembled incrementally, as each participant makes independent contributions. Finally we evaluate three scalable similarity measures, two of which require a revision of the data model underlying our social annotations. ∗ Corresponding author...|$|E

This inference is based in part on a novel utilization of data describing historical, repeating patterns of infection. We conclude with a description of a new ranking algorithm, iRank, for blogs. In contrast to traditional ranking strategies, iRank acts on the <b>implicit</b> <b>link</b> structure to find those blogs that initiate these epidemics...|$|E
