5000|$|Background and {{origin of}} the term [...] "pig":In the field, a device that travels inside a {{pipeline}} to clean or inspect it is typically known as a pig. PIG is an acronym for [...] "Pipeline Inspection Gauge". The acronym PIG came later as the nickname for [...] "pig" [...] originated from cleaning pigs (first designed pigs) that actually sounded like squealing or screeching pigs when they passed through the lines scraping, scrubbing and [...] "squeegeeing" [...] the internal surface. The name serves as common industry jargon for all pigs, both intelligent tools and cleaning tools. Pigs, in order to fit inside the pipeline, are cylindrical and are necessarily short {{in order to be}} able to negotiate bends in the pipeline. Many other short, cylindrical objects, such as propane storage tanks, are also known as pigs and it is likely that the name came from the shape of the devices. In some countries a pig is known as a [...] "Diablo", literally translated to mean [...] "the Devil" [...] relating to the shuddering sound the tool would make as it passed beneath people's feet. The pigs are built to match the diameter of a pipeline and use the very product being carried to end users to transport them. Pigs have been used in pipelines for many years and have many uses. Some separate one product from another, some clean and some inspect. An MFL tool is known as an [...] "intelligent" [...] or [...] "smart" [...] <b>inspection</b> <b>pig</b> because it contains electronics and collects data real-time while travelling through the pipeline. Sophisticated electronics on board allow this tool to accurately detect features as small as 1 cm by 1 cm, dimensions of the wall of a pipeline as well as depth or thickness of wall (helps indicate potential wall loss).|$|E
40|$|Pipeline pigging for in-line {{inspection}} {{is a fundamental}} practice in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Yet, the so-called "smart pigs" used for this purpose are expensive and delicate and the risk related to their possible blocking inside the pipeline is non-negligible, hence their deployment is rather infrequent (generally, just once in several years). In this paper, we present a new, low-cost and low-risk foam pig with inspection capabilities similar to those of a multi-channel caliper pig (i. e. able to detect, locate and size inner diameter changes and deformations) together with additional features that allow to detect internal roughness changes (e. g. due to corrosion) and perform some pH/salinity determinations, also useful for corrosion assessment purposes. One implementation of the new tool makes use of a foam pig "carrier", providing the required push with a good capability to surpass restrictions, equipped with specialized sensors and modules for data acquisition and storage. Another implementation, called "skeleton caliper pig" and suitable to prevent the massive displacement of condensates from gas lines, deploys the light plastic system without any foam pig carrier, pushed by the gas velocity alone.

Crude {{is processed}} at Garoupa by removing water and transferring {{it to the}} coast. For 10 years this pipeline had operated with more than 20 % of water. In 2001, the pipeline was surveyed with a Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) pig.

This type of indication {{is very difficult to}} size using MFL tools. The logistic arrangements were made to replace the damaged pipeline, but before the beginning of the work the pipeline was surveyed again using an Ultrasonic (US) pig this time, in order to enhance the sizing of all defects.

Key words: pipeline, corrosion, axial crack, broad-band ultrasonic inspection, The pipeline is the most economic and effective means of transferring {{oil and natural gas}} over long distance.

40|$|Abstract During {{abattoir}} meat <b>inspection</b> <b>pig</b> carcasses are partially or fully condemned upon {{detection of}} disease that poses {{a risk to}} public health or welfare conditions that cause animal suffering e. g. fractures. This incurs direct financial losses to producers and processors. Other health and welfare-related conditions may not result in condemnation but can necessitate ‘trimming’ of the carcass e. g. bruising, and result in financial losses to the processor. Since animal health is a component of animal welfare these represent a clear link between suboptimal pig welfare and financial losses to the pig industry. Meat inspection data {{can be used to}} inform herd health programmes, thereby reducing the risk of injury and disease and improving production efficiency. Furthermore, meat inspection has the potential to contribute to surveillance of animal welfare. Such data could contribute to reduced losses to producers and processors through lower rates of carcass condemnations, trimming and downgrading in conjunction with higher pig welfare standards on farm. Currently meat inspection data are under-utilised in the EU, even as a means of informing herd health programmes. This includes the island of Ireland but particularly the Republic. This review describes the current situation with regard to meat inspection regulation, method, data capture and utilisation across the EU, with special reference to the island of Ireland. It also describes the financial losses arising from poor animal welfare (and health) on farms. This review seeks to contribute to efforts to evaluate the role of meat inspection as a surveillance tool for animal welfare on-farm, using pigs as a case example. </p...|$|E

40|$|Meat {{inspection}} now {{incorporates a}} more risk-based approach for protecting human health against meat-borne biological hazards. Official post-mortem meat <b>inspection</b> of <b>pigs</b> {{has shifted to}} visual meat inspection. The official veterinarian decides on additional post-mortem inspection procedures, such as incisions and palpations. The decision is based on declarations in the food chain information (FCI), antemortem inspection and post-mortem inspection. However, a smooth slaughter and inspection process is essential. Therefore, one {{should be able to}} assess prior to slaughter which pigs are suitable for visual meat inspection only, and which need more profound inspection procedures. This study evaluates the usability of the FCI provided by pig producers and considered the possibility for risk ranking of incoming slaughter batches according to the previous meat inspection data and the current FCI. Eighty-five slaughter batches comprising 8954 fattening pigs were randomly selected at a slaughterhouse that receives animals from across Finland. The mortality rate, the FCI and the meat inspection results for each batch were obtained. The current FCI alone provided insufficient and inaccurate information for risk ranking purposes for meat inspection. The partial condemnation rate for a batch was best predicted by the partial condemnation rate calculated for all the pigs sent for slaughter from the same holding in the previous year (p < 0. 001) and by prior information on cough declared in the current FCI (p = 0. 02) statement. Training and information to producers are needed to make the FCI reporting procedures more accurate. Historical meat <b>inspection</b> data on <b>pigs</b> slaughtered from the same holdings and well-chosen symptoms/signs for reporting, {{should be included in the}} FCI to facilitate the allocation of <b>pigs</b> for visual <b>inspection.</b> The introduced simple scoring system can be easily used for additional information for directing batches to appropriate meat inspection procedures.

40|$|Pipeline <b>inspection</b> gauges (<b>pigs)</b> {{have been}} used for many years to perform various {{maintenance}} operations in oil and gas pipelines. Different pipeline parameters can be inspected during the pig journey. Although pigs use many sensors to detect the required pipeline parameters, matching these data with the corresponding pipeline location is considered a very important parameter. High-end, tactical-grade inertial measurement units (IMUs) are used in pigging applications to locate the detected problems of pipeline using other sensors, and to reconstruct the trajectories of the pig. These IMUs are accurate; however, their high cost and large sizes limit their use in small diameter pipelines (8 ″ or less). This paper describes a new methodology for the use of MEMS-based IMUs using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the pipeline junctions to increase the position parameters’ accuracy and to reduce the total RMS errors even during the unavailability of above ground markers (AGMs). The results of this new proposed method using a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) -based IMU revealed that the position RMS errors were reduced by approximately 85 % compared to the standard EKF solution. Therefore, this approach will enable the mapping of small diameter pipelines, which was not possible before...|$|R

In this paper, a new scheme of channel equalization is proposed for MFL signal in order to correct sensor misalignments, which eventually improves accuracy of defect characterization.

Due to the severe conditions they operate in, they are regularly inspected using conventional Pipeline <b>Inspection</b> Gages (<b>PIGs)</b> for corrosion damage. The motivation for researching a real-time distributed monitoring solution arose to mitigate costs and provide a proactive indication of potential failures. Fiber optic sensors with polymer claddings provide a means of detecting contact with hydrocarbons. By coating the fibers with a layer of metal similar in composition to that of the parent pipeline, corrosion of this coating may be detected when the polymer cladding underneath is exposed to the surrounding hydrocarbons contained within the pipeline. A Refractive Index (RI) change occurs in the polymer cladding causing a loss in intensity of a traveling light pulse due to a reduction in the fiber’s modal capacity. Intensity losses may be detected using Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) while pinpointing the spatial location of the contact via time delay calculations of the back-scattered pulses.

Thiosulfate-reducing and methanogenic enrichments {{were obtained from the}} MPN cultures that were able to use yeast extract as the electron donor. Molecular analysis revealed that both enrichments harbored the same dominant bacterium, which belonged to the genus Anaerobaculum. The dominant archaeon in the methanogenic enrichment was affiliated with the genus Methanothermobacter. With yeast extract as the electron donor, the general corrosion rate by the thiosulfate-reducing enrichment (8. 43 ± 1. 40 milli-inch per year, abbreviated as mpy) was about 5. 5 times greater than the abiotic control (1. 49 ± 0. 15 mpy), while the comparable measures for the methanogenic culture were 2. 03 ± 0. 49 mpy and 0. 62 ± 0. 07 mpy, respectively. Total iron analysis in the cultures largely accounted for the mass loss of iron measured in the weight loss determinations. Profilometry analysis of polished steel coupons incubated {{in the presence of the}} thiosulfate-reducing enrichment revealed 59 pits over an area of 71. 16 mm 2, while only 6 pits were evident in the corresponding methanogenic incubations. The results show the importance of thiosulfate-utilizing, sulfide-producing fermentative bacteria such as Anaerobaculum sp. in the corrosion of carbon steel, but also suggest that Anaerobaculum sp. are of far less concern when growing syntrophically with methanogens...|$|R
40|$|A {{key factor}} for the {{sustainable}} development of oil&gas industry is the remote monitoring of integrity and reliability of transportation pipelines. In order to mitigate the risk associated to third party interference (TPI) risks and to minimize the environment exposure, {{it is possible to}} deploy a Multipoint Acoustic Sensing (MAS) technology which makes use of multi sensors placed at discrete distances along the pipeline. Any interaction with the pipe generates acoustic waves that are guided within the fluid (gas, oil, products or water) for long distances, providing information on the source event and on the “transmission” channel. Acoustic propagation is mainly governed by both absorption coefficient and sound speed, which in turn are functions of the pipe, fluid and surrounding medium system. These features have been analyzed by processing real-time data collected with a proprietary MAS system (e-vpms™) on fluid transportation pipelines, in different operational and flow service conditions, producing exhaustive sets of TPI actions, leak trials and tracking <b>pig</b> <b>inspections.</b> The paper presents original procedures for real-time monitoring, as well as for long term supervision and advance intervention planning...|$|R
