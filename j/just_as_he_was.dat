5|$|At {{the funeral}} on 5 June at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité in Montmartre, more than 4,000 people were present. Adolphe Bizet led the mourners, who {{included}} Gounod, Thomas, Ludovic Halévy, Léon Halévy, and Massenet. An orchestra under Pasdeloup played Patrie, and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from Carmen. At the burial which followed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Gounod gave the eulogy. He said that Bizet {{had been struck}} down <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> becoming recognised as a true artist. Towards {{the end of his}} address, Gounod broke down and was unable to deliver his final peroration. After a special performance of Carmen at the Opéra-Comique that night, the press which had almost universally condemned the piece three months earlier now declared Bizet a master.|$|E
5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Poland began on 1 September 1939, and {{marked the beginning}} of World War II in Europe. Philipp's unit was tasked with bomber escort and ground attack as well as combat air patrol missions. He was credited with his first aerial victory on 5 September 1939 without firing a single shot. Philipp maneuvered himself into a favorable attack position and aimed carefully. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to open fire, the enemy pilot bailed out. Nevertheless, he was given credit for the destruction of the aircraft and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, which was presented to him on 10 October 1939. He lost his wingman during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force) in late November 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{first shot}} on goal was {{registered}} by Bonaventure Kalou, who forced a save out of Jens Lehmann. After 10 minutes, Shinji Ono spotted Lehmann off his line but sent his lofted shot wide of the target. This sparked Dortmund into life; they were thwarted when Patrick Paauwe intercepted Jan Koller <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{looking to get}} his shot away. On 15 minutes, they came even closer to breaking the deadlock, when Amoroso picked out Tomáš Rosický; however, he shot straight at Edwin Zoetebier. On 19 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk came close to scoring with a free kick, which hit the right-hand post. Feyenoord's Tomasz Rząsa was then booked for dissent on 23 minutes, and following the resulting free kick, Evanílson came close to scoring, though his shot went over the crossbar after Ewerthon's pass had sent him through.|$|E

25|$|At dusk, Abrash's {{tank was}} hit <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting his tank {{ready for a}} new attack, and he was killed.

He started to his left, then turned and retreated behind the Millsaps 40 and back to his right to avoid Millsaps linebacker Wheat (#14).

With the buyout the shares in Bell & Howell stock went from $5 to $64 per share during his tenure.|$|E
25|$|The Americans and British {{fought for}} about an hour, the combat ending with Savage in ruins. Her {{quarterdeck}} and forecastle had been completely cleared of resistance, her mizzenmast was blown away, and her mainmast was nearly gone as well.

25|$|A special, high gibbet {{was erected}} in the {{marketplace}} at Launceston, and Mayne was executed there on 29 November 1577. He {{was not allowed to}} speak to the crowd, but only to say his prayers quietly. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to be hanged, he refused to implicate his co-religionists. It is unclear if he died on the gibbet. One source states that he was cut down alive, but in falling struck his head against the butcher's scaffold. In any case, he was unconscious when being drawn and quartered.|$|E

25|$|Minas Gerais {{was also}} home {{to two of the}} most {{influential}} Brazilian politicians of {{the second half of the}} 20th century. Juscelino Kubitschek was president from 1956 to 1961, and he was responsible for the construction of Brasília as the new capital of Brazil. Tancredo Neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in 1984 to be the first civil president after the 1964 military countercoup. However, he died after a series of health complications <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to assume the position. Also, Itamar, Brazil's previous president, lived there, though he was not born in Minas.|$|E
25|$|Having contributed {{directly}} to L'Indépendence Roumaines success (it became the second-most popular newspaper by 1897), Claymoor made a return trip to Paris in 1899. He died in Bucharest on June 12, 1903, after falling {{down in front}} of L'Indépendence Roumaine office, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bringing in his latest Carnet chronicle. Although he is sometimes assumed to have died there, on the spot, he actually did so at his sister's home. The ultimate cause of death was a peptic ulcer. Claymoor was buried at Bellu cemetery, Plot 17. His objets d'art were auctioned off by January 1904, but the Almanach du High-Life continued to be published over the following years.|$|E

25|$|In 1941 Clair was {{stripped}} of his French citizenship by the Vichy government, though this was later reversed. It was also in 1941 that he learned {{of the death of}} his brother Henri Chomette in France from polio. In 1943, he was planning to go to Algeria to organise the Service Cinématographique de l'Armée, but funding for the project was withdrawn <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on the point of departure. In July 1945 he went back to France for a short visit, and then returned finally in July 1946, having signed a contract with RKO for his next film to be made in France.|$|E
25|$|Diocletian and Maximian {{stepped down}} as co-emperors on May 1, 305, {{possibly}} due to Diocletian's poor health. Before the assembled armies at Milan, Maximian removed his purple cloak {{and handed it to}} Severus, the new Caesar, and proclaimed Constantius as Augustus. The same scene played out at Nicomedia under the authority of Diocletian. Constantius, notionally the senior emperor, ruled the western provinces, while Galerius took the eastern provinces. Constantine, disappointed in his hopes to become a Caesar, fled the court of Galerius after Constantius had asked Galerius to release his son as Constantius was ill. Constantine joined his father's court at the coast of Gaul, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> preparing to campaign in Britain.|$|E
25|$|On March 9, 1987, LaMarche's {{father was}} murdered, {{shot to death}} by a lifelong friend in a Toronto hotel lobby, in front of dozens of witnesses. This sent LaMarche into {{depression}} and alcoholism for the next two years, effectively stalling his stand-up career. After getting sober on Inauguration Day in 1989, LaMarche embarked again into the world of his first love, standup comedy, {{in the early part of}} 1990. However, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> regaining lost momentum, tragedy struck once more, as his 18-year-old sister was killed in a car accident in September of that year. At this point, though he remained sober, LaMarche decided he just could not do standup comedy anymore.|$|E

His second son Po Than Gyaung had gone underground in 1976 to join the Communists like his brother before him. U Hla's death at the age of 72, in August 1982, was unexpected by most who knew him as someone who had always lived a healthy life, although he developed diabetes later in life. He was suddenly taken ill <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to be interviewed by a Japanese woman researcher accompanied by the writer Maung Tha-ya, rushed to hospital, and he died the same evening.|$|E

The following week, Karen slapped Angle, providing a distraction which allowed Jarrett to beat him down. On February 13 at Against All Odds, Jarrett defeated Angle in a singles match and as a result Angle was forced to walk Karen down the aisle, when she and Jarrett renewed their wedding vows on the March 3 edition of Impact!. On March 3, Angle proceeded to destroy the wedding set with an axe and forced wedding guest, New York Jet Bart Scott to tap out with the ankle lock.|$|E
25|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{attempting}} {{to move the}} colony, on 24 January 1788 Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse arrived off Botany Bay. The French expedition consisted of two ships led by La Pérouse which were on the latest leg of a three-year voyage that had taken them from Brest, around Cape Horn, up the coast from Chile to California, north-west to Kamchatka, south-east to Easter Island, north-west to Macao, {{and on to the}} Philippines, the Friendly Isles, Hawaii and Norfolk Island. The gale also prevented La Pérouse's ships from entering Botany Bay. Though amicably received, the French expedition was a troublesome matter for the British, as it showed the interest of France in the new land. To preempt a French claim to Norfolk Island, Phillip ordered Lieutenant Philip Gidley King to lead a party of 15 convicts and seven free men to take control of Norfolk Island. They arrived on 6 March 1788, while La Pérouse was still in Sydney.|$|E
