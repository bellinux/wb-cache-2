5|$|After {{additional}} weather-related delays, on February 26 salvors {{managed to}} float the 440foot(132m) bow section {{and began the}} process of towing it out to sea for disposal. By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had towed the bow from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an oil skimmer vessel, OSRV Oregon Responder. However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the bow was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS <b>David</b> <b>R.</b> Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from <b>David</b> <b>R.</b> Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|E

5|$|The company {{known today}} as Burger King itself began as a franchise; the {{predecessor}} of the modern company was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King. The original founders and owners, Kieth J. Kramer and Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around {{a piece of equipment}} known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, Kramer and Burns required all of their franchises to carry the device. The rights to open stores in Miami, Florida, belonged to two businessmen named James McLamore and <b>David</b> <b>R.</b> Edgerton and their company: South Florida Restaurants, Inc. Due to operational issues with the Insta-Broiler, in 1954 McLamore and Edgarton made the decision to replace the Insta-Broiler with a mechanized gas grill they called a flame broiler. Even though the company had rapidly expanded throughout the state until its operations totaled more than 40 locations in 1955, the original Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties and the pair of McLamore and Edgarton purchased the national rights to the chain and rechristened the company as Burger King of Miami.|$|E
