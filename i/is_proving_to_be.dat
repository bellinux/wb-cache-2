5|$|Serbia's strongest {{exports to}} the United States include Fiat {{automobiles}} manufactured in Kragujevac. Fiat purchased Zastava Automobili in 2008 and subsequently managed the factory in Kragujevac {{so that it would}} produce new Fiat automobiles as opposed to Zastava models (the last Zastavas were produced in 2008); in May 2013 alone, 3,000 Fiat 500L units were shipped from Serbia to Baltimore for sale in the United States. The Fiat 500L is the first automobile to have been exported from Serbia to the United States since the Zastava Koral before 1992, and <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a popular model with a large amount of advertising in the United States. Serbia is also the largest exporter of raspberries in the world (as of 2009), and much of the raspberries consumed in the United States are grown in Šumadija. In 2015, the two states discussed to find ways to increase investments in Serbia.|$|E

Some theory of classical first-order logic over an arbitrary language is formalized. A development of primitive recursive functions is given, and all primitive recursive functions <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> representable in a weak axiom system. Formulas and proofs are encoded as natural numbers, and functions operating on these codes <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> primitive recursive.

In particular, Peano arithmetic <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistent in Coq’s type theory and therefore is incomplete. ...|$|R

A study from by Inside Higher Ed and the Babson Survey Research Group shows that there is still disagreement as to the effectiveness of the approaches but the reach and accessibility <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more and more appealing.

25|$|Hawkeye remains {{with the}} Avengers for {{numerous}} adventures. He aids Avenger trainees Justice and Firestar {{to defeat the}} Taskmaster and Albino. Hawkeye later resigns the Avengers to assume leadership {{of the first generation}} of the Thunderbolts, who had broken away from the influence of Baron Helmut Zemo. Hawkeye trains the team in the fashion of former teammate Captain America, and shapes the team into a cohesive fighting unit. The Thunderbolts take on threats like the Masters of Evil, Graviton, and the Scourge of the Underworld. Hawkeye begins a romantic relationship with fellow Thunderbolts member Moonstone, who Hawkeye <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a good influence on. Later, Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts travel to Hell to save the soul of Mockingbird. They defeat the demonic Mephisto, but Hawkeye is unable to find his wife. To ensure that his Thunderbolts are given full pardons, Hawkeye allows himself to be arrested in their place. The Thunderbolts' past crimes are erased on the condition that they retire from costumed heroics. The team reluctantly agrees. Later, when Hawkeye had gotten out of prison, the team comes back together to defeat Graviton once again. Convinced that they are ready to be heroes in their own right, Hawkeye hands leadership of the Thunderbolts to Citizen V (whose mind was actually under the control of Baron Helmut Zemo) and leaves the team.|$|E

It's selling more than most Christmas No 1s would, and HMV has placed an urgent order for more copies." [...] On December 28, 2008, the UK Singles Chart listed it as the second biggest selling single for the year end countdown and the nineteenth best-selling single of the decade. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified the song double-platinum, denoting shipments of over 1.2 million copies within the country.|$|E

500|$|... "Why", asked Coward, [...] "am I always {{expected}} {{to wear a}} dressing-gown, smoke cigarettes in a long holder and say 'Darling, how wonderful'?" [...] The answer lay in Coward's assiduous cultivation of a carefully crafted image. As a suburban boy who had been {{taken up by the}} upper classes he rapidly acquired the taste for high life: [...] "I am determined to travel through life first class." [...] He first wore a dressing gown onstage in The Vortex and used the fashion in several of his other famous plays, including Private Lives and Present Laughter. George Walden identifies him as a modern dandy. In connection with the National Theatre's 2008 exhibition, The Independent commented, [...] "His famous silk, polka-dot dressing gown and elegant cigarette holder both seem to belong to another era.

500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} film in Atlanta {{because of its}} proximity to Cynthiana, Kentucky, Kirkman's hometown and the setting of his comic's first issue. [...] "At the beginning they talk about how {{some of the people}} in neighboring states would have gone to larger cities so they could fortify them and protect the population." [...] Kirkman had considered other cities, particularly New York City, Miami, and Chicago. Hurd had previously filmed in the city for Lifetime. Darabont felt that Atlanta offered the essentials; [...] "Atlanta and Georgia all-told <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brilliant for us in terms of what it has to offer, in terms of what the story needed, in terms of the variety of locations—it really is a fantastic place to shoot." [...] Prior to filming, Kirkman toured with Darabont around the central business district. He stated, [...] "I tagged along on a location-scouting expedition, and that was pretty fun—watching Frank Darabont walking through the streets of Atlanta as if he owned the entire city, daring cars to hit him. That was a lot of fun." [...] Darabont ventured onto the middle of a street to grasp a perfect shot, oblivious to oncoming traffic.|$|E

[...] The character attracted comparisons to previous Torchwood characters. Dan Martin wrote after the broadcast of [...] "Rendition" [...] that the character of Esther [...] "is shaping up as a Toshiko-style tragedy queen".

2500|$|As an {{adjuvant}} treatment, use {{of chemotherapy}} {{as an alternative}} to radiation therapy in the treatment of seminoma is increasing, because radiation therapy appears to have more significant long-term side effects (for example, internal scarring, increased risks of secondary malignancies, etc.).

The concept of carboplatin as a single-dose therapy was developed by Tim Oliver, Professor of Medical Oncology at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.

Get it? An appropriately hip-swaying beat swirls around the vocal, courtesy of ever-hitworthy producer Missy Elliott. This is the record that will propel Mýa to the A-list among today's pop/R icons; throughout the song, she delivers womanly strength and sass with a knowing wink.

Sheldon Pearce writing for XXL stated, [...] "Kid Ink is a masterful replicator that reinvents genre’s strengths and refashions them into a sound that moves forward while managing to stay true to its LA hip-hop roots. He hits all the high notes, tapping into the club energy that will undoubtedly make him a star, but he also hits all the right notes, crafting the more grounded records that will keep him humble. There aren’t many who can effortlessly {{make the transition from}} mixtape rapper to hitmaker. For Kid Ink, it <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an incredibly smooth one." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "Mixing the hazy, lazy feeling of cloud rap with a sound that's slick and entirely prepared to be the 2014 definition of radio-friendly, L.A.-based Kid Ink isn't necessarily in My Own Lane because of his patched-together style, but the talented, Drake-sounding rapper is certainly unique when it comes to cocky career development [...] Approach this release as album number two and it comes off as a celebration based on past success, so use Up & Away as an intro, then join Ink and all the inspired party people he invited to My Own Lane."
