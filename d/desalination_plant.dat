5|$|These {{operations}} {{contributed to}} victory by diverting enemy attention from real targets to dummy ones, wasting enemy ammunition, preserving vital {{resources such as}} the single water <b>desalination</b> <b>plant</b> at Tobruk, and deceiving the enemy as to allied strength and intentions.

5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her <b>desalination</b> <b>plant</b> and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>desalination</b> <b>plant</b> was {{impossible}} to hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant {{to look as if}} it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
5|$|Offshore the Arabian Peninsula, the cyclone {{produced}} rough {{waves that}} disabled an oil tanker; {{the crew was}} rescued by the Omani Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days. A fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah, killing {{one person in the}} crew of nine. Near where the storm moved ashore, the storm's strong winds heavily damaged the village of Ras Madrakah. Considered the worst storm in memory, the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings, including damaging the roof of the <b>desalination</b> <b>plant,</b> leaving residents without water for several days. Strong winds of over 93km/h (58mph) knocked down 20trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings. Across the storm's track through Oman, the rains replenished water levels in aquifers, while also washing out roads and isolating villages. This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work. The Jiddat al-Harasis desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population, although many livestock were killed. Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} large {{seawater}} <b>desalination</b> <b>plants</b> in Israel {{and two more}} scheduled to open before 2014.

50|$|As part of 50-year South East Queensland water {{strategy}} the QWC {{recommended that the}} Government of Queensland focus on recycled water projects, rather than <b>desalination</b> <b>plants,</b> because <b>desalination</b> <b>plants</b> are too energy intensive and recycled water provides supply regardless of changes in climate.|$|R

40|$|Large scale {{seawater}} <b>desalination</b> <b>plants</b> are operated {{along the}} coasts {{and dispose of}} their brine waste stream by discharging into the sea. As the need for desalinated seawater is steadily increasing, more new <b>desalination</b> <b>plants</b> are planned to be constructed. If <b>desalination</b> <b>plants</b> are closely clustered together along the coastlines, the adverse environmental impacts of the brine effluent discharges from plants such as these are strongly inter-dependent. A far field mathematical model for continuous brine discharges from two <b>desalination</b> <b>plants</b> on a uniformly sloping beach is presented. The analytical solutions are illustrated graphically to study the interaction of two brine discharge plumes. Asymptotic approximation {{will be made to}} the shoreline's brine concentration to evaluate the maximum salinity build-up in the coastal waters...|$|R

25|$|Desalination of {{seawater}} {{is expected}} to become {{more important in the}} future through a long-planned regional <b>desalination</b> <b>plant</b> that would provide desalinated water using the piped water network throughout the entire Gaza strip. For over 20 years, a major <b>desalination</b> <b>plant</b> for Gaza has been discussed. The Palestinian Water Authority has approved a $500 million facility. Israel supports it and has quietly begun to offer Palestinians desalination training. In 2012 the French government committed a 10 million-euro grant for the plant. Arab countries, coordinated by the Islamic Development Bank, committed to provide half of the necessary funds, matching an expected European financial commitment.

25|$|In 1997, {{the first}} reverse osmosis <b>desalination</b> <b>plant</b> in Israel opened in Eilat. In 2002, under {{the impact of}} drought, the Government {{approved}} the construction of large seawater desalination plants along the Mediterranean coast. These installations would supply 305 million m3/yr of desalinated water by the year 2010 and 500 million m³/yr by 2015. By mid-2008 two of the new plants with a capacity of 130 million m3/yr were in operation. In parallel to the desalination program the cabinet also decided to promote water savings activities that could reduce household water use by at least 10 percent. In 2012, the Ashkelon <b>Desalination</b> <b>Plant</b> was converting 15,000 to 16,000 cubic meters of seawater to fresh water every hour, supplying 15 percent of Israel's annual water supply.|$|E
25|$|Perth's {{water supply}} has {{traditionally}} relied on both groundwater and rain-fed dams. Reduced rainfall {{in the region}} over recent decades had greatly lowered inflow to reservoirs and affected groundwater levels. Coupled with the city's relatively high growth rate, this led to concerns that Perth could run out {{of water in the}} near future. The Western Australian Government responded by building desalination plants, and introducing mandatory household sprinkler restrictions. The Kwinana <b>Desalination</b> <b>Plant</b> was opened in 2006, and Southern Seawater <b>Desalination</b> <b>Plant</b> at Binningup (on the coast between Mandurah and Bunbury) began operating in 2011. A trial winter (1 June – 31 August) sprinkler ban was introduced in 2009 by the State Government, a move which the Government later announced would be made permanent.|$|E
