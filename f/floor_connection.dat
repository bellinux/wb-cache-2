40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} beam {{elongation}} in precast frame {{systems have been}} demonstrated to be a potential source of unexpected damage to precast floors. To control the damage to structural elements {{through the use of}} rocking systems, alternative solutions have been developed and are currently available to minimize floor damage. Recent research on an innovative “non-tearing <b>floor</b> ” <b>connection</b> using “hybrid ” (rocking-dissipating) connections has shown it to be efficient for mitigating the effects of beam elongation. This contribution presents a series of numerical studies on multi-storey post-tensioned hybrid frames using non-tearing <b>floor</b> <b>connections</b> with different configurations, subjected to pushover and time history analyses to investigate and evaluate the performance of this type of system to earthquake loading. The seismic response of the frames is compared with more traditional systems where the problems of beam elongation and floor damage can be appreciable. The response of the frames confirmed the unique flexibility of the proposed solution and highlighted the superior performance under seismic loading with only minor damage to the frame, wall and floor systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} beam {{elongation}} in precast frame {{systems have been}} recently demonstrated to be a potential source of un-expected damage up to failure of precast floor systems, unless adequate detailing accounting for displacement incompatibilities between the lateral resisting systems and the floor are provided. In this contribution, an innovative “non-tearing floor ” jointed connection solution with re-centering capabilities is proposed. An efficient floor-to-lateral-load-resisting connection can be obtained able to minimise {{the problems associated with}} beam elongation effects while maintaining the low-damage and re-centering characteristics of jointed ductile connections (e. g. PRESSS-Technology). The preliminary results of experimental and numerical investigations on the interaction between diaphragm and lateral resisting frames adopting non-tearing jointed ductile connections are presented. A series of 2 / 3 scaled beam-column subassemblies have been tested under uni-directional quasi-static loading regime. Both numerical and experimental results provide satisfactory confirmation of the unique flexibility and potentiality of the proposed solution {{for the development of the}} next generation of seismic resisting buildings.

40|$|The {{stability}} of steel storage racks, {{which are often}} unbraced, may depend solely on the pallet beam to upright connector and on the stiffness of the base plate to <b>floor</b> <b>connection.</b> This paper presents experimental results from cyclic tests performed on portal beam to upright bolted moment connections intended for cold-formed steel drive-in and drive-through storage racks. In storage racks, portal beams are typically connected to uprights by "tab connectors", which are costly to manufacture and experience initial looseness. By simply bolting the portal beams to the uprights, bolted moment connections may represent a cost-effective alternative to "tab connectors". A literature review shows that bolted moment connections between cold-formed steel members are economical and feasible. However, experimental results show {{a significant amount of}} looseness in the connection after an initial high moment-rotational stiffness. Being slender structures, storage racks are sensitive to the second-order P-? effect, and international racking specifications require the initial looseness of the tab connectors to be considered when analysing the {{stability of}} the rack in the down-aisle direction (sway motion). The non-linear cyclic behaviour of bolted moment connections is presented and explained herein. Based on finite element results, it is shown that, for drive-in and drive-through racks, the looseness in bolted moment connections can be ignored in ultimate limit states design. Finally, the paper concludes with proposing two methods, with different degree of complexity, for the design of drive-in and drive-through racks with bolted portal beam to upright bolted moment connections.

Zeolite concrete is one of the factors, which will contribute m improving the quality of many precast structural elements such as walls, beams, etc. This thesis is in two parts. The first part presents a study of fresh concrete properties, which are water content, slump, strength and cost of product. Tests were undertaken in four groups of concrete adopted. The first group (B) was of a standard mix proportion of 30 MPa. The second group (F) had partial replacement of cement with fly ash. The third group (S) had partial replacement of sand with granulated blast-furnace slag in a concrete mix that had the highest strength obtained from group (F). The fourth group (Z) had partial replacement of coarse aggregate (blue metal) with zeolite in a concrete mix that had the highest strength obtained from groups (F) and (S) to evaluate the effective of adding zeolite in fly-ash-slag concrete. Zeolite in concrete is seen to improve the freshness (workability) and hardness (strength) properties of the fly-ash-slag concrete. The second part of the thesis considers a particular connection. Connections are most important for precast structural elements. This thesis presents a study of strength and deformation behaviour of floor-wall connections in precast reinforced concrete walls in a plant building. Three half-scale walls and floors moulds were designed, built and tested in the structural laboratory to evaluate the deflection, strain and stress behaviour of steel connections, fixing bolts, walls and floor edge beams. The design of the walls was based on the structural analysis of precast concrete walls of a one storey plant typical of a commercial building. The load analysis and design of the concrete walls, steel reinforcement, steel connection and fixing bolts, their configuration and manufacturing were according to Australian standard recommendations. The three tests undertaken had different types of concrete strength. The first two walls had different types of reinforcing steel and different steel connections. The third wall, adopted after the first and second walls were tested and evaluated, allowed reasonable evaluation of the deformation behaviour. The load-deflection and strain curves of wall, <b>floor,</b> <b>connection</b> and fixing bolts were compared between the laboratory tests and the computer analysis using Strand 6 program. Also the rotation of the floor slab when failure occurred was evaluated to determine its effect on the behavior of the connection and the wall. The connections and walls demonstrated satisfactory moment resistance and shear capacities. The test results confirmed that this connection and fixing bolts would give satisfactory load capacity and ductility performance, and that they can safely carry the applicable loads [...] The connection can be safely applied to precast reinforced concrete elements in a commercial building. The crack behaviour for the three walls was studied, and conclusions were made, based on the test results and the analysis of computer results. Recommendations for future work are also given...|$|E
40|$|Traditional seismic design {{philosophy}} for {{reinforced concrete}} seismic frame structures localises damage and inelastic deformation to regions of significant plasticity within the beam (plastic hinge zones) during a severe earthquake event. Collapse prevention {{of the frame}} is applied through capacity design methods, requiring the maximum expected flexural strength of the beam plastic hinges to be reliably assessed in order to design for, and ensure, the predominantly elastic flexural response of the columns in the frame. Previous experimental and numerical investigations have shown that significant and detrimental damage to the frame and floor system occurs due to the formation and elongation of ductile beam plastic hinges; requiring extensive post-earthquake repair or demolition with likely loss of function of the building. This poses significant economic consequences to occupiers of the building, as {{the time required to}} reinstate the integrity of the structural and non-structural building components is often lengthy. More importantly, it has been highlighted that the interaction between elongating ductile plastic hinges and the accompanying floor system enhances the flexural strength of the beam hinges, altering the distribution of forces in the seismic frame compared to that assumed during capacity design. Research has shown that the consideration of frame-floor interaction in current New Zealand design codes significantly underestimates the flexural strength enhancement of beam plastic hinges, threatening the hierarchy of strength and collapse prevention mechanisms employed in capacity design. Recent research has introduced change in the design philosophy of precast concrete seismic frames. Rather than designing for localised damage in the frame, unique Non-tearing (of the <b>floor)</b> <b>connection</b> details have been developed which provide a gap or slot between the end of the beam and column face and force connection rotation to occur about a shallow hinge located {{at the top of the}} beam, thereby avoiding the formation of plastic hinges and associated beam elongation effects altogether. Research investigations have shown that Non-tearing connections successfully minimise damage to the structural frame and floor, while providing seismic energy dissipation characteristics at least comparable to that of traditional reinforced concrete connections. In this research, the mechanics of different non-tearing connection arrangements were investigated and original theory introduced for the aspects of connection behaviour which diverged from fundamental reinforced concrete design. A variety of precast concrete non-tearing connection details were developed, with the design focus placed on economic and construction efficiency in order to encourage the rapid implementation of non-tearing connection technology into New Zealand construction industry. The performance of the developed connection details were explored and assessed experimentally and analytically. A two bay precast concrete frame with precast floor system was tested under a demanding reversed cyclic, quasi-static loading protocol using displacement control. The seismic response of the non-tearing connection details employed in the test frame successfully minimised damage to the frame and floor systems. Only minor repair of one primary crack at each connection between the floor diaphragm and supporting beam would be required after a design level earthquake. Issues encountered with buckling of the longitudinal reinforcement in the bottom of the beam reduced the connection performance at high levels of drift. However, detailing measures were successfully employed in successive tests which improved the drift capacity of the connections. Detailing improvements to enhance the seismic response of the developed non-tearing connections were recommended based observations from the frame test. Numerical analysis of the non-tearing connection details was performed using simple rotational and compound spring models, with the key features of the experimental response captured with excellent accuracy. The analytical models were constructed using engineering theory, rather than by calibration with experimental observations. The modelling assumptions and principles adopted in the analysis have been presented for use in design offices or future research programmes when designing and analysing seismic frames using non-tearing connections. This research successfully contributed to the development and progression of non-tearing frame technology. With further research and the refinement of construction details, non-tearing floor connections exhibit impressive potential for providing superior seismic safety, performance and efficiency in precast concrete seismic frame buildings...|$|E

The objective of this thesis is to determine fatigue stresses in the stringer to <b>floor</b> beam <b>connections</b> of through plate girder (TPG) and through truss (TT) bridges in order to predict failure. Field observations by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) indicate failure in the stringer to <b>floor</b> beam <b>connections</b> of both the TPG and TT bridges, although a higher frequency of failure appears in the TT bridges. Accordingly, this study includes 1) creating analytical models for the TPG and TT bridges, 2) determining member internal forces, 3) developing force envelopes, 4) determining maximum internal stresses, and 5) comparing these results to field observations. First, bridge models for the TPG and TT bridge were assembled using a finite element analysis program in order to evaluate member internal forces. The TPG bridge model was taken from the plans of an existing bridge designed in 1912 and located near TX Highway 21 between College Station and Caldwell, TX. The TT bridge model was taken from the plans of an existing bridge designed in 1902 in the Chicago Office of the American Bridge Company. Next, a finite element analysis was conducted to obtain member internal forces. The resulting forces were compiled to create axial load, shear force, and moment envelopes. These envelopes were constructed to provide the magnitudes and location of the maximum forces required for analysis. These forces were also used to develop maximum tensile stresses for the rivets in the floor beams. After examining the results, the following conclusions were drawn. Axial load was predicted {{to be a source of}} higher failure frequency within TT bridges versus TPG bridges. Lower chord deformation in the TT bridge caused elongation of the floor system that, in turn, produced axial loads in the bridge members. The TPG bridge members, however, carried no axial load. Shear force was not predicted to be a contributing factor for increased connection failure rates in the TT bridges as compared to the TPG bridges, but bending moment was. This result, however, was sensitive to the degree of fixity in the stringer to <b>floor</b> beam <b>connection...</b>|$|R
40|$|Floor {{diaphragms}} have {{an important}} role in the seismic behaviour of structures, as inertia forces are generated by their masses and then transferred to the lateral load resisting system. Diaphragms also link all other structural elements together and provide general stability to the structure. As with most other structural components, there is concern about damage to floor diaphragms because of displacement incompatibilities. This paper describes two different experiments on engineered timber floors connected to post-tensioned timber frames subjected to horizontal loading. First a full scale two-bay post-tensioned frame was loaded with lateral loads through a stressed-skin <b>floor</b> diaphragm. Different <b>connection</b> configurations between the floor units on either side of the central column were tested.

40|$|Steel {{storage racks}} are {{typically}} made of thin-walled cold formed steel profiles, which {{prove to be}} the most versatile, economic and sustainable elements for industrial rack construction. Their lightweight structural systems are usually designed to resist heavy load units, reaching considerable heights. However, the global behavior of storage racks under seismic actions is much less predictable than the behavior of steel buildings made of standard steel profiles and connections, mainly due to the perforations in their thin walled upright columns, and their semi-rigid beam-column and base plate joints. Full scale experimental investigations are greatly needed in order to understand and quantify the global performance of storage racks, and improve their design for seismic actions. For the first time in Europe, thanks to the funding provided by Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS), an extensive full-scale push-over testing program has been carried out on 8 fully-loaded pallet racking specimens (4 unbraced and 4 braced racks), provided by 4 different international rack producers.

In particular, experimental global capacity curves of the tested specimens are presented, discussing the key factors influencing the racks’ response, as well as the failure mechanisms of the different rack typologies. Furthermore, the behavior factor (q) values of each specimen are derived from re-analysis of the test results.

40|$|In CLT {{buildings}} {{the properties}} and {{orientation of the}} mechanical connections are essential do they transfer the shear forces between the walls and floor slabs. Existing analysing methods of mechanical connections between CLT elements can be simplified hand calculations or advanced FEM analyses which can be time consuming and difficult to modulate properly. The CLT slabs are often connected both with wall to wall and wall to <b>floor</b> <b>connections</b> allowing the system of connectors to operate in three-dimensions. A theoretical model for handling three-dimensional analyses between elastic connections and stiff slabs is described. The theory is implemented in Excel where a program is created to rationally analyse connections between CLT-structures. An eight story high CLT building is analysed and the results reveals that the theory has a false assumption that the plates only could rotate in plane. The assumption causes a false locking of the connections that’s results in compulsive forces that makes {{the results from the}} program hard to construe. Absolute three-dimensional movement is necessary for the theory to be more accurate. The theory enables a real three-dimensional system of stiff plates connected with mechanical connections to be analysed in a three-dimensional manner where the geometry of the plates and the properties and orienting of the mechanical connections are considered. The three-dimensional analyse enables both horizontal and vertical connections, in a system with stiff boards, to be analysed. A complete three-dimensional modulation gives a significantly stiffer model with smaller deformations in the connections compared to an earlier FEM-analyse where only the horizontal connections was regarded to contribute to the total stiffness of the model. The actual process of data entry and analysis is a fast and different layouts and changes of these are easy to modulate. Further validation of the software is needed to ensure the validity and of the theory with the assumed presumptions.

40|$|Major {{advances}} {{have been observed}} {{during the last two}} decades in the field of seismic engineering with further refinements of performance-based seismic design philosophies and the subsequent definition of corresponding compliance criteria. Following the globally recognized expectation and ideal aim to provide a modern society with high (seismic) performance structures able to sustain a design level earthquake with limited or negligible damage, alternative solutions have been developed for high-performance, seismic resisting systems. In the last two decades, an alternative approach in seismic design has been introduced for precast concrete buildings in seismic regions with the introduction of “dry” jointed ductile systems also called “hybrid” systems based on unbonded post-tensioned rocking connections. As a result structural systems with high seismic performance capabilities can be implemented, with the unique capability to undergo inelastic displacement similar to their traditional monolithic counterparts, while limiting the damage to the structural system and assuring full re-centring capabilities (negligible residual or permanent deformations). The continuous and rapid development of jointed ductile connections for seismic resisting systems has resulted in the validation {{of a wide range of}} alternative arrangements, encompassed under the general umbrella of “hybrid” systems. This research provides a comprehensive experimental and analytical investigations of 2 - and 3 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, exterior beam-column joints subjected both uni and bi-directional (four clove) quasic-static loading protocols into the behaviour, modelling, design and feasibility of new arrangements for “dry” jointed ductile systems for use in regions of high seismicity. In order to further emphasize the enhanced performance of these systems, a comparison with the experimental response and observed damage of 2 -D and 3 -D monolithic beam-column benchmark specimens is presented. However, after a lot of attention given to the behaviour of the skeleton structure, more recently the focus of research in Earthquake Engineering has concentrated on the behaviour of the floor system within the overall 3 D behaviour of the building and the effects of beam elongation. The effects of beam elongation in precast frame systems have been demonstrated to be a potential source of un-expected damage, unless adequate detailing is provided in order to account for displacement incompatibilities between the lateral resisting systems and the floor. Two contributions to beam elongation are typically recognized: a) the material contribution due to the cumulative residual strain within the steel, and b) the geometrical contribution due to the presence of a neutral axis and actual depth of the beam. Regarding jointed ductile connections with re-centering characteristics, the extent of beam elongation is significantly reduced, being limited to solely the geometrical contribution. Furthermore, such effects could be minimized when a reduced depth of the beam is adopted due to the use of internal prestressing or external post-tensioning. However, damage to precast floor systems, resulting from a geometric elongation of the beam, has yet to be addressed in detail. In order to emphasize the enhanced performance in controlling and minimizing the damage of the structural elements via the use of the proposed advanced hybrid solutions, this research presents via experimental and analytical validation of two alternative and innovative solutions to reduce the damage to the floor using 2 and 3 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, exterior beam-column joints. The first approach consists of using standard precast rocking/dissipative frame connections (herein referred to as “gapping”) in combination with an articulated or “jointed” floor. This system uses mechanical devices to connect the floor and the lateral beams which can accommodate the displacement incompatibilities in the connection. The second approach to reduce the floor damage investigates the implementation of a “non-gapping” connection, also called non-tearing-floor connection, using a top hinge at the beam-column interface, while still relying on more traditional floor-to-frame connections (i. e. topping and continuous starter bars). Additionally, further refinements and constructability issues for the non gapping connection are investigated under the experimental and analytical validation of a major 2 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, two-story one-bay frame using non-tearing <b>floor</b> <b>connections.</b> Based on the non-tearing <b>floor</b> <b>connections,</b> a series of parametric analysis for beam-column joints and frames are carried out.

There is a corridor leading throw the building which is devided through open residence areas for the students. Holes in the <b>floors</b> create vertical <b>connections.</b> Displacement of the holes in the length of the building creates horizontal connection. Half-open one- ore two-storied residential areas are created which offer views through the whole building. In this spatial structure are placed the volumes of student housing...|$|R

[...] The school became Rommett's laboratory for developing the Floor-Barre, as she helped ballet, modern, jazz and musical theatre performers to overcome injuries and develop and refine their technique. Rommett discovered that working with the legs in a parallel position was {{an effective way to}} train and correct a dancer's placement. Rommett explained that [...] "one day to experiment I had the students bring their legs into parallel. Then and there I discovered the beautiful secret of my technique. By working in parallel, I could correct the body alignment for a perfect turnout." [...] Rommett later said that [...] "when you work in parallel on the <b>floor,</b> the <b>connection</b> of the ankle to knee to hip is so correct that the leg remains aligned when you turn out again" [...] and cautioned that [...] "it must be done meticulously to be effective." ...|$|R
2500|$|The floors {{consisted}} of [...] lightweight concrete slabs laid on a fluted steel deck. A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the <b>floors</b> with shear <b>connections</b> {{to the concrete}} slab for composite action. The trusses had a span of [...] in the long-span areas and [...] in the short-span area. The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were therefore on [...] centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to interior box columns on the interior side. The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with viscoelastic dampers, which helped {{reduce the amount of}} sway felt by building occupants.|$|R

The full music video was released on March 29, along with the mini-album re-release. In the music video, the girls performing the song in an empty street and also in a studio with black background. Also appears some solo shots of the girls on the empty street and under a white background with some incandescent lamps. In the end {{of the video}}, when Joo Hyun turns her head to the camera, the camera got some electrical defect and broke off alone, then the camera drops to the <b>floor,</b> interrupting its <b>connection.</b> The video ends with the name of the group (SPICA) and the song's name (Painkiller) appearing in a black screen.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{houses in}} North America are wood-framed structures. Wood {{is one of}} the best {{materials}} for earthquake-resistant construction since it is lightweight and more flexible than masonry. It is easy to work with and less expensive than steel, masonry, or concrete. [...] In older homes the most significant weaknesses are the connection from the wood-framed walls to the foundation and the relatively weak [...] "cripple-walls." [...] (Cripple walls are the short wood walls that extend from the top of the foundation to the lowest floor level in houses that have raised <b>floors.)</b> [...] Adding <b>connections</b> from the base of the wood-framed structure to the foundation is almost always an important part of a seismic retrofit. [...] Bracing the cripple-walls to resist side-to-side forces is essential in houses with cripple walls; [...] bracing is usually done with plywood. [...] Oriented strand board (OSB) does not perform as consistently as plywood, and is not the favored choice of retrofit designers or installers.|$|R
