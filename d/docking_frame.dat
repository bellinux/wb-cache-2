5|$|The Zveno-3 {{in which}} TB-3 carried two Grigorovich I-Z fighters under the wings {{presented}} a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground {{while it was}} suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control. During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the <b>docking</b> <b>frame</b> and crashed him {{into the bottom of}} the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Installation of {{deep water}} Xmas trees for subsea oil {{production}} is sometimes done {{by lowering the}} tree using one wire. Xmas trees are interfacing with other equip- ment on the seafloor and will therefore need to be positioned, and oriented correct. Today aligning the Xmas tree to existing interfacing structures on the seabed dur- ing installation is done by manual control of an ROV. In this thesis it is proposed to automate this process. The benefits of doing this is to gain a faster and more precise control {{of the position of}} the tree, as well as being less prone to human errors. This will make the operation faster, safer and less expensive. This thesis is a feasibility study of this new solution for aligning the Xmas tree in the installation process. In order to investigate the feasibility of the solution a mathematical model of an ROV and a Xmas tree that is hanging in a wire has been developed. Interaction forces between these objects are then defined. A model of the environment and sensor output from the ROV is also developed. A controller algorithm has been defined that uses the position of the Xmas tree to calculate the control forces the ROV need to control the motions of the Xmas tree. This controller algorithm is a nonlinear PID-controller where the output is translated from the body-centre of the Xmas tree to the body centre of the ROV in order to use some of the existing control system in the ROV. In addition to the controller an extended kalman filter has been implemented in order to handle the sensor feedback, and a reference model has been made to generate smooth and feasible trajectories as input to the control system. The mathematical model is used to simulate the behavior of the system, when the control system is connected. The simulations shows very promising results. An experimental setup has been made in order to test the control system in real life. The experimental setup consists of a downscaled Xmas tree model, a <b>docking</b> <b>frame,</b> and a small scale ROV. This setup was used to test the control system in the Trondheim fjord using R/V Gunnerus. Due to an error in the programming the testing was not able to fully verify the simulation results. The results obtained during the test did however seem promising when this error is taken into account, and thus proof of concept was established. </p...|$|E

500|$|Murphy has {{clashed with}} Stephen Maguire, {{another of the}} 2000 Young Players of Distinction, on several occasions. At the start of their 2004 Grand Prix match, there was an {{incident}} that resulted in Maguire being <b>docked</b> the opening <b>frame.</b> After they had shaken hands {{at the outset of}} the first frame, Maguire asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to leave the arena and retrieve his chalk, which he had forgotten. While Maguire was away, the referee and Murphy spoke before tournament director Mike Ganley arrived on the scene and <b>docked</b> Maguire a <b>frame</b> for technically not being ready to start at the scheduled time, which angered and surprised Maguire. Murphy refutes that the <b>docking</b> of the <b>frame</b> was down to him speaking to the referee. Maguire won the match 5–2 and later commented: [...] "Rules are rules but I've never heard of anything like that happening before".|$|R
2500|$|Williams, {{the world}} number two, {{was the highest}} ranked player to lose in the round when he lost 2–5 against Michael Judge. In the fifth frame, at 2–2, Williams was 64–0 ahead but a black ball {{clearance}} of 70 gave Judge the lead, {{who went on to}} win the match. After the match, Williams said that he was nowhere near the player he was a year ago. World number four and Masters champion Paul Hunter made breaks of 108 and 127 in defeating Darren Morgan 5–3. European Open winner Stephen Maguire defeated Murphy 5–2, a match in which Maguire had a <b>frame</b> <b>docked.</b> As the match was about to begin and after they had shaken hands, Maguire realised he had not brought his [...] with him. He asked for permission to retrieve it from referee Johan Oomen, which was granted. As Maguire was away, Murphy spoke to the referee and questioned whether Maguire should be <b>docked</b> a <b>frame,</b> as he was technically not ready to play at the scheduled time. Mike Ganley, the tournament director, was called and <b>docked</b> a <b>frame</b> from Maguire, a ruling which angered Maguire. Of the incident Maguire said [...] "Rules are rules but I've never heard of anything like that happening before." [...] The incident was said to be a key point in the rivalry between Maguire and Murphy.|$|R

5000|$|Team Challenge: The Floating Dock: Fabian and Luayn {{are placed}} in charge of an ambitious project to build a {{floating}} dock from lumber and foam floatation blocks. Unlike the gender split in the previous week, the teams can be divided up in any way, and Luayn supervises the Blue and Purple teams in cutting the lumber to size, while Fabian has the Green and Pink teams handling preliminary assembly work. During this phase, Hillary notices Steve using the power tools in an unsafe manner, and consequently bars him from using them {{for the rest of}} the challenge, entrusting Richelene to do the job instead. Work is initially slow, and further delayed when Fabian notices that the <b>dock's</b> <b>frame</b> has been put together poorly, forcing the teams to take it apart and reassemble it. When the dock is eventually finished (with a diving board added as an extra embellishment), the teams are faced with the difficult task of getting it into the water, a problem which Nicole solves. After some additional work reinforcing the structure, it goes into the lake and successfully floats, and even stands up to all the contestants attempting to capsize it standing on one side of it. For the second week in a row, the standout couples are felt to be the Green Team and the task leaders (the Red Team), the former for being the most valuable contributors, and the latter for successfully organizing a very difficult project. This time however, the decision swings in the direction of the task leaders, and the Red Team win their second successive challenge.|$|R
30|$|When it is {{necessary}} to perform bone transport, to optimize conditions for healing, the necrotic or infected bone ends should be resected and fashioned {{in such a way as}} to enhance <b>docking.</b> The <b>frame</b> should be carefully mounted to be parallel in both planes to prevent translation. Bone grafting of the docking site, if necessary, should be performed early. Our results are promising in terms of achieved union rates, axis alignment of the lower extremity, and eradication of infections. Although the superiority of one treatment modality over the other cannot be concluded based on our data, the study shows that the combined use of the TSF and Ilizarov frame for bone transport is useful for treatment of tibial nonunion with bone loss.|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} for the {{structural}} system for tall buildings, called the “Tubed Mega Frame”, {{has been developed}} by Tyréns AB. The structure consists of several hollow reinforced concrete columns at {{the perimeter of the}} building and at certain levels, the columns are tied together with perimeter walls. Together they carry all the vertical and lateral loads. A purpose of the new concept is to eliminate the core {{in the center of the}} building which allows utilizing more floor spacing compared with other skyscrapers. This kind of structure has never been examined before and thus never been designed for such a large building. In this thesis the vertical hollow concrete columns are designed according to the American concrete design code, ACI 318. A literature study on reinforced concrete columns has been investigated, where the goal was to identify the most critical design aspects for columns in high rise structures, especially utilizing high strength concrete. Since this kind of structure never has been designed before, an evaluation of the ACI 318 has been performed to check if it is possible to design the hollow reinforced columns in the Tubed Mega Frame according to this design code. The loads and forces used for the design were extracted from a global finite element model in ETABS of a concept prototype of 800 meter. The design process consisted of design calculations according to the ACI 318, a buckling analysis in SAP 2000 and a non-linear FE-analysis in ATENA. For the buckling analysis in SAP 2000 the lower region of the building was isolated between two main perimeter walls. The model was modified several times to analyze how sensitive the structure was to buckling, with regard to different wall thicknesses, cracked cross-sections, openings in the columns and the dependency of intermediate perimeter walls. The non-linear analysis in ATENA focused on a single hollow column between two perimeter walls in the lower regions of the building. Two models were created, one with a full wall thickness and one with a reduced wall thickness where the ultimate capacity and failure behavior of the columns were investigated. The ultimate capacity of the sections designed by hand calculations and analyzed in ATENA were found to be brittle failure modes. To achieve a more ductile failure, an alternative reinforcement geometry with confining reinforcement has been proposed. The results from the design shows that the structure is redundant against buckling, even with reduced bending stiffness and without intermediate perimeter walls. From the analysis in ATENA, the results demonstrated that the columns are capable of carrying all the ultimate loads even if the wall thickness is reduced by 50 %, and that it is possible to use the ACI 318 to design the reinforced concrete columns. However, an unexpected brittle failure occurred in the flanges of the column corners in the tensile region were shear lag may affect the behavior and caused the premature failure. A deductive conclusion has been drawn which states that proper confinement will be critical to achieve a ductile failure behavior even in the tensile region, which will require further studies in order to fully understand the behavior. Even though the results show that it was possible to reduce the cross-sectional thickness of the columns, more studies have to be performed to evaluate if the global structure fulfills the requirements with the decrease in column wall thickness.  Ett nytt strukturellt koncept för skyskrapor har utvecklats av Tyréns AB, "Tubed Mega Frame", där strukturen består av flera ihåliga armerade betongpelare i utkanten som hålls samman med omslutande tvärväggar, och tillsammans bär de alla vertikala och laterala laster. Denna typ av konstruktion har aldrig analyserats eller utformats tidigare. I detta examensarbete är de vertikala ihåliga betongpelarna dimensionerade enligt den amerikanske byggnormen, ACI 318 och de kritiska aspekterna med att utforma ett höghus i höghållfast betong med ihåliga pelare undersökts. Eftersom denna typ av konstruktion aldrig tidigare utformats, har en utvärdering av ACI 318 genomförts för att kontrollera om det är möjligt att dimensionera de ihåliga vertikala pelarna i Tubed Mega Frame enligt denna norm. De laster och krafter som används för dimensioneringen extraherades ur en global finit elementmodell för en konceptbyggnad på 800 meter i ETABS. Den dimensionerande processen bestod av dimensioneringsberäkningar enligt ACI 318, en knäckningsanalys i SAP 2000 och en icke-linjär FEM-analys i ATENA. För knäckningsanalysen i SAP 2000 isolerades en sektion i den nedre regionen av byggnaden, mellan två omslutande tvärväggar. Modellen ändrades flera gånger för att analysera hur känslig konstruktionen var med hänsyn till knäckning, och de ändringar som gjordes var: minskning av väggtjocklekar, reducering för spruckna tvärsnitt, öppningar i pelarna samt de omslutande mellanliggande tvärväggarnas inverkan på knäckningen av konstruktionen. Den icke-linjära analysen i ATENA fokuserade på en pelare mellan två omslutande tvärväggar i den lägre regionen av byggnaden. Två modeller skapades, en med en full väggtjocklek och en med en reducerad väggtjocklek för att analysera brottbeteendet och verifiera den handberäknade kapaciteten enligt ACI 318. De brottmoder som påträffades för tvärsnittsverifikationen i ATENA var spröda och karakteriserades med krossning av betongen, och för att uppnå ett mer segt brott härleddes en alternativ armeringsgeometri med sammanhållande armeringsbyglar i de mest kritiska regionerna av pelarna. Resultaten visade att konstruktionen är robust mot knäckning, även med minskad böjstyvhet och utan mellanliggande omslutande tvärväggar. Av analysen i ATENA visade resultaten att pelarna är kapabla att bära alla de kritiska lasterna även om väggtjockleken reduceras med 50 % och att det är möjligt att använda ACI 318 som norm för dimensionering av pelarna i Tubed Mega <b>Frame.</b> <b>Dock</b> inträffade ett oväntat sprött brott i den dragna flänsen i nedre regionen av pelaren, framförallt koncentrerat till hörnen. Anledningen till det spröda brottet har utvärderats och analyserats där hypotesen är att flänsskjuvning i kombination med höga spänningskoncentrationerna i hörnen orsakar det lokala brottbeteendet i flänsen. Slutsatsen som baseras på hypotesen är att sammanhållande armeringsbyglar skulle vara avgörande för att uppnå ett segt brottbeteende även för den dragna flänsen. Även om resultaten visade att det var möjligt att reducera tvärsnittstjockleken för pelarna, krävs mer studier för att utvärdera om den globala konstruktionen uppfyller kraven för en minskning av pelarnas väggtjocklekar. ...|$|R
