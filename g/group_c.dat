5|$|Group C's 9th Tabor had also, {{like the}} M-24s of Group B, {{struggled}} through the marshes {{during the first}} phase of the operation, and were late in arriving at the jumping-off point for phase two, the canal. At 08:45, Moroccan units of <b>Group</b> <b>C</b> were investigating the village of Phu An on the opposite side of the lagoon from Group D's landing area, when they came under heavy fire. Despite being nearer to Group D, the engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in <b>Group</b> <b>C,</b> who were by now some distance away, further inland. This delay, coupled with the failure of many of the units' SCR300 radios, meant that these advance elements of <b>Group</b> <b>C</b> failed to get through until 09:10. At 09:40, the commander of <b>Group</b> <b>C</b> called up various reinforcements from Hué including two companies of Vietnamese trainee NCOs and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of <b>Group</b> <b>C</b> until 18:00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter-attacked and occupied Phu-An. The 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Chasseurs Regiment had been requested to drop at 14:00 to support the advanced elements of <b>Group</b> <b>C</b> but did not jump until 16:50 and thus failed to assemble before the Moroccans themselves occupied Phu-An. With the final capture of Phu-An, the extreme southern tip of the encirclement, the pincer movement was complete.|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of beta-haemolytic non-Group A streptococci (BHNAS) in {{the throats of}} a paediatric population was examined over a 1 -year period. There was minimal seasonal fluctuation of Lancefield groups including species and biotypes within <b>Groups</b> <b>C</b> and G streptococci. A trend of increasing incidence with age of Streptococcus anginosus ('Streptococcus milleri') (possessing <b>Groups</b> <b>C</b> and G Lancefield antigens) was evident. A clinical impression of streptococcal pharyngitis was more common in patients with large-colony <b>Groups</b> <b>C</b> or G streptococci isolated from their throats compared with those patients where other BHNAS were isolated. This study is requisite to the planning of case control studies which are required to test the association of BHNAS (especially <b>Groups</b> <b>C</b> and G subgroups) and pharyngitis...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} stepwise sedation {{for elderly}} patients with mild/moderate {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) during upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. METHODS: Eighty-six elderly patients with mild/moderate COPD and 82 elderly patients without COPD scheduled for upper GI endoscopy {{were randomly assigned}} to receive one of the following two sedation methods: stepwise sedation involving three-stage administration of propofol combined with midazolam [COPD with stepwise sedation (<b>group</b> <b>Cs),</b> and non-COPD with stepwise sedation (group Ns) ] or continuous sedation involving continuous administration of propofol combined with midazolam [COPD with continuous sedation (group Cc), and non-COPD with continuous sedation (group Nc) ]. Saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO 2), blood pressure, and pulse rate were monitored, and patient discomfort, adverse events, drugs dosage, and recovery time were recorded. RESULTS: All endoscopies were completed successfully. The occurrences of hypoxemia in <b>groups</b> <b>Cs,</b> Cc, Ns, and Nc were 4 (9. 3 %), 12 (27. 9 %), 3 (7. 3 %), and 5 (12. 2 %), respectively. The occurrence of hypoxemia in <b>group</b> <b>Cs</b> was significantly lower than that in group Cc (P < 0. 05). The average decreases in value of SpO 2, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure in <b>group</b> <b>Cs</b> were significantly lower than those in group Cc. Additionally, propofol dosage and overall rate of adverse events in <b>group</b> <b>Cs</b> were lower than those in group Cc. Finally, the recovery time in <b>group</b> <b>Cs</b> was significantly shorter than that in group Cc, and that in group Ns was significantly shorter than that in group Nc (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: The stepwise sedation method is effective and safer than the continuous sedation method for elderly patients with mild/moderate COPD during upper GI endoscopy...|$|R
