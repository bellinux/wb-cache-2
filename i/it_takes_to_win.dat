500|$|In an October 7, 2009, {{exclusive}} with MTV News, Bieber {{confirmed that}} a music video {{had been shot}} in Watertown, Tennessee (a small town approximately 50 miles east of Nashville, Tennessee) with Roman White who directed the music video for [...] "You Belong With Me" [...] by Taylor Swift.

Everyone probably knows everyone I guess." [...] Promotional photography took place around the town {{a few days before the}} rest of the video shoot, including Bieber holding posters of his first shoot, and with an old turquoise truck. The video was the first to feature Bieber wearing his signature dog tag. In a behind-the-scenes feature, Bieber said that a fan gave it to him, and it belonged to one of their friends that died in the war. Bieber stated, [...] "I wear it because its cool and kind of a memory." [...] The basic concept of the video is Bieber's goal to win a girl's heart after leading her around the town. Director Roman White said, [...] "It’s romantic, it’s in a laundromat...that’s all <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a girl is strung lights".|$|E

500|$|James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch {{felt that}} Chris Sabin and Shocker versus Simon Diamond and Mikey Batts was [...] "solid wrestling" [...] and a [...] "nice opening match" [...] for the tournament. When {{it came to}} the second match of the tournament, [...] B.G. James and Cassidy Reilly versus Ron Killings and Sonjay Dutt, Caldwell felt that James and Killings [...] "undermined the spirit of the Candido tournament" [...] by dancing mid-way through their encounter. Caldwell commented on the pairing of Alex Shelley and Sean Waltman for the tournament, saying they were a [...] "natural fit working together" [...] and expressing hope that they would be a {{permanent}} fixture after the tournament concluded. Regarding the semifinal matches, Caldwell thought Sabin and Shocker versus Dutt and Killings was a [...] "solid match with a nice mini-storyline involving Sabin and Shocker having a miscommunication before settling their differences to win the match." [...] As for the finals, Caldwell stated that Shelley and Waltman versus Sabin and Shocker was a [...] "standard tag match" [...] but it was [...] "effective in telling the story of Waltman and Shelley doing whatever <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> while Shocker and Sabin continued to have differences that finally caused Shocker to go off." [...] Caldwell concluded by saying that [...] "Waltman and Shelley have impressed as a legit tag team since their first round match in the tournament," [...] going on to say that he hoped for a Waltman and Shelley victory at Unbreakable to [...] "give the tag division a fresh team to build around." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, during Mercedes' {{hospitalisation}} and recuperation she [...] "starts {{putting it}} on to get sympathy. She's determined to get what she wants". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not [...] "feel guilt at all - she just wants Riley back and she'll {{do whatever it takes}} to get him". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and will do what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. I want to see what happens when they don't..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien's key {{campaign}} man was Jim Karygiannis {{who became}} a living legend within the Liberal Party due to his ruthlessness. Chrétien told Lavelle that what he wanted was [...] "A tough guy. A guy who could go on a search-and-destroy mission, who could do a kamikaze raid for our side", and decided that Karygiannis was that man. At a meeting to select Liberal delegates for the Kitchener-Waterloo riding, Martin's supporters attempted to call on the pay phones as many potential Martin supporters as possible {{to come to the}} meeting, which led Karygiannis to put chewed gum into all of the pay phone coin slots, and thereby won Kitchener-Waterloo for Chrétien. At another delegate selection meeting, Karygiannis verbally attacked a pro-Martin Liberal official with such rage that the man was hospitalized for angina. Karygiannis specialised in signing up immigrants to serve as delegates for Chrétien, and personally signed 9,500 immigrants as Chrétien delegates between January and June 1990, leading one pro-Martin official to lament that [...] "We were getting Greeked. And if we weren't getting Greeked, we were getting Sikhed". Karygiannis later boasted in an interview that [...] "I signed up anything that moved". Chrétien is said to have praised Karygiannis with the remark [...] "Whatever <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>win,</b> Jimmy, whatever it takes to win". In large part because of Karygiannis and his team, by late April 1990 Chrétien had signed up 1,500 delegates to Martin's 500 delegates, making him the clear front-runner.|$|E
