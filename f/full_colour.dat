5|$|Doctor Who is unusual, however, in {{that each}} of its 97 missing episodes survives in audio form, {{recorded}} off-air by fans at home. Most episodes are also represented by stills or short video clips. Furthermore, after careful restoration, all 1970s episodes exist in <b>full</b> <b>colour,</b> which {{is not always the}} case for other series.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Bernard Meehan, Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin, {{produced}} an introductory booklet on the Book of Kells, with 110 colour {{images of the}} manuscript. His 2012 book contained more than 80 pages from the manuscript reproduced full-size and in <b>full</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{criteria}} for <b>Full</b> <b>Colours</b> {{are far more}} stringent than those for Half <b>Colours.</b> Upon achieving <b>Full</b> <b>Colours,</b> the student is presented with a gold scroll bearing {{the name of the}} field of endeavour. This scroll is sewn onto the normal school blazer, below the school badge. Each <b>Full</b> <b>Colours</b> scroll bears a certain number of points, either 2 points or 4 points. These points are used to calculate whether an individual is qualified for a Colours Blazer.|$|R
50|$|The College may award {{students}} with Half <b>Colours,</b> <b>Full</b> <b>Colours,</b> Colours Blazers and Honours Blazers, for outstanding achievements {{in a variety}} of fields.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Full</b> <b>colours</b> {{are worn}} on {{occasions}} such as Sunday Service, Leavers' Dinner, Celebration Day, the Christmas Meal, {{at the end}} of term and on exeat weekends. <b>Full</b> <b>colours</b> consist of the school's blazer; a white shirt; the school tie; grey trousers or shorts (depending on season); knee-length grey socks; black shoes; and the school cap. REPS Boys are known for their purple cap, known as the [...] "REPS cap" [...] which is worn with <b>full</b> <b>colours.</b> The colours are not only worn for ceremonies and occasions, but whenever students are representing the school in competitions, trials and inductions too. For example, when a REPS boy is selected for the Matabeleland Duikers team, he is invited to the induction ceremony where he'll be expected to wear <b>full</b> <b>colours</b> with or without the cap. In recent times, however, the head boy and his deputy wear <b>full</b> <b>colours</b> on a daily basis to distinguish themselves {{from the rest of the}} students.|$|R
5|$|Between 1982 and 1988 {{a series}} based on Irish {{architecture}} {{through the ages}} was released, with line drawings by Michael Craig and graphics by Peter Wildbur. It contained twenty-eight stamps, with values ranging from 1p to £5. Stamps based on Irish cultural heritage followed between 1990 and 1995. Irish birds feature in the 1997 series that span the conversion of currency from the Irish pound, through dual currency {{to the introduction of}} the Euro. These were the first definitives where all values were printed in <b>full</b> <b>colour.</b> On 9 September 2004 new stamps, featuring flowers native to the woodlands and hedgerows of Ireland, become available. These were replaced in September 2010 by a seventh series featuring animals and marine life using photographic images.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the Swiss {{publisher}} Urs Graf Verlag Bern {{produced the}} first facsimile of the Book of Kells. The {{majority of the}} pages were reproduced in black-and-white photographs, but the edition also featured forty-eight colour reproductions, including all the full-page decorations. Under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, Thames and Hudson produced a second facsimile edition in 1974. This edition included all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages, together with some enlarged details of the illustrations. The reproductions were all in <b>full</b> <b>colour,</b> with photography by John Kennedy, Green Studio, Dublin.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Casterman {{suggested}} to Hergé that his books {{be published in}} a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, and now in <b>full</b> <b>colour</b> rather than black-and-white. He agreed to this, and in 1943 The Crab with the Golden Claws was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus bringing {{it up to the}} standard 62-page format.|$|E

5|$|The {{current law}} {{regulating}} {{the design and}} use of the Belarusian emblem was passed on July 5, 2004. Article 9 of Chapter 3 of Law No. 301-3 begins by describing the official drawing of the Belarusian arms and regulates on its proper design. Officially, the arms can be drawn in <b>full</b> <b>colour,</b> monochrome or using two colors. Article 10 states that the national emblem must be displayed at specified locations on a continual basis, such as the residences of the Belarusian leader, the chamber of the National Assembly and at governmental offices of national and regional levels. The emblem can also be used on documents issued by the government, including money, passports and official letterheads.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{photo shoot}} with the band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative {{of the spirit of}} the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their <b>full</b> <b>colour</b> contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E

5|$|With Blood Money, Jones was {{determined}} to utilise the <b>full</b> <b>colour</b> range of the Amiga, opting to use the blitter {{as opposed to the}} hardware scrolling; the blitter allowed graphics to be drawn quickly. Tony Smith, who had worked on Menace, produced the graphics for Blood Money, while Jones began work on a new scrolling system. While developing his own game, Talisman, Mike Dailly created a compact method to move enemies on-screen, which Jones incorporated into Blood Money. The game's animations fascinated Jones' friend Gary Timmons, who then began experimenting with Deluxe Paint; his work on the program led to his employment at DMA Design, and inspired some of the animations used in DMA's next game, Walker (1993). The game's introduction required a star field, which Jones took from a quick demonstration that Dailly had been working on.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies has a dark red head, neck, and rump; the red is glossy, reflecting bright light. The {{rest of the}} upper body is a blackish-brown, and the upper breast and under-body a light brownish-grey. The red of the head is sharply demarcated against the brown plumage, giving the bird the appearance of having a red hood. The bill is black or blackish-brown, and the gape is black or yellowish. There is a distinct black loral stripe that extends to become a narrow eye ring. The iris is dark brown. The adult female's head and neck are grey-brown with a pink-red tint to the forehead and chin. The rest of the female's upper body is grey-brown with darker shades on the wings and lighter shades on the breast and underparts. The gape is yellow. One study suggested {{a connection between the}} female's bill colour and breeding status, with birds that had a horn-coloured (grey) bill also having well-developed brood patches. Juveniles are similar to females though with an obvious pale yellow edge to the lower mandible. Initially lacking in red plumage, they begin to get red feathers on their faces after around a month of age. Males keep their juvenile plumage for up to three months, and take a similar period to come into <b>full</b> <b>colour.</b> M. e. infuscata is similar in appearance to the nominate race but has red extending from the rump onto the back, a darker grey belly, and is slightly larger overall.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{if there}} be two Liquors of <b>full</b> <b>Colours,</b> suppose {{a red and}} blue, {{and both of them}} so thick as suffices to make their Colours {{sufficiently}} full; though either Liquor be sufficiently transparent apart, yet will you {{not be able to see}} through both together. For, if only the red-making Rays pass through one Liquor, and only the blue-making through the other, no Rays can pass through both. This Mr. Hook tried casually with Glass Wedges filled with red and blue Liquors, and was surprized at the unexpected Event, the reason of it being then unknown; which makes me trust the more to his Experiment, though I have not tried it my self. But he that would repeat it, must take care the Liquors be of very good and <b>full</b> <b>Colours.</b>|$|R
