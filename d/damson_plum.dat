50|$|Šljivovica, Śliwowica, Slivovitza, Schlivowitz, or Slivovitsa is a {{fruit brandy}} made from <b>damson</b> <b>plums,</b> often {{referred}} to as plum brandy. Slivovitz is produced in East-Central and South-East Europe both commercially and privately. Primary producers are in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia. In the Balkans, Slivovitz is considered a kind of Rakia, in Hungary Pálinka and in the Czech Republic and Slovakia Pálenka, corresponding to the distilled spirits category.|$|R

5000|$|The word {{slivovitz}} is a {{borrowing from}} a shared Slavic word for plum or (more specifically) for damson plum: šljiva, šljiva/шљива [...] - [...] <b>damson</b> <b>plum,</b> slíva, śliwka or slivka + postfix -vice or -vica [...] {{to indicate the}} food from which it was distilled. For example, Czech meruňka apricot → meruňkovice apricot brandy; broskev peach → broskvovice peach brandy.|$|E
50|$|Quetschentaart, {{a popular}} Luxembourg speciality, {{is an open}} fruit tart with zwetschgen or <b>damson</b> <b>plums.</b> Traditionally, it is a {{seasonal}} dish served in the autumn after the local plums have ripened in September. The dough for the pastry base consists of flour, yeast, milk, and butter. It is kneaded and allowed to rise for half an hour. The base is then basted with egg, sprinkled with sugar, placed in a baking dish, and covered with halved plums (no stones) arranged in circles. It is baked at 180 C for some 45 minutes or until ready.|$|R
50|$|Sausage, both link and patties, {{and usually}} flavored with sage, {{constitutes}} {{an important aspect}} to a traditional Virginian breakfast. Virginia is also well known for its peanuts which are prepared by either roasting or boiling them. A traditional Virginian dish is peanut soup which has been present in the cuisine since the colonial era. Historically, Greengage plums were common in Virginian cuisine, but their cultivation has been in decline since the eighteenth century, although it can still be found in Virginia occasionally. Instead <b>Damson</b> <b>plums</b> are more often found in Virginian cuisine. It is often used in jams, jellies, preserves, and desserts.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit is}} similar to a small <b>damson</b> or <b>plum,</b> {{suitable}} for preserves, but rather tart and astringent for eating, unless it is picked after {{the first few days of}} autumn frost. This effect can be reproduced by freezing harvested sloes.|$|R
5000|$|Provinces {{exported}} regional {{dried fruits}} such as Carian figs and Theban dates, and fruit trees from the East were propagated throughout the Western empire: the cherry from Pontus (present-day Turkey); peach (persica) from Persia (Iran), {{along with the}} lemon and other citrus; the apricot from Armenia; the [...] "Damascan" [...] or <b>damson</b> <b>plum</b> from Syria; and what the Romans called the [...] "Punic apple", the pomegranate from North Africa.|$|E
5000|$|The damson (...) or <b>damson</b> <b>plum</b> (Prunus domestica subsp. insititia, or {{sometimes}} Prunus insititia), also archaically called the [...] "damascene" [...] is an edible drupaceous fruit, a subspecies of the plum tree. Varieties of insititia are found across Europe, {{but the name}} [...] "damson" [...] is derived from and most commonly applied to forms which are native to Great Britain. Damsons are relatively small plum-like fruit with a distinctive, somewhat astringent taste, and are widely used for culinary purposes, particularly in fruit preserves or jam.|$|E
50|$|Chrysophyllum oliviforme, {{commonly}} known as the satinleaf, is a medium-sized tree native to Florida, the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, and Belize. It is also known as <b>Damson</b> <b>plum,</b> wild star-apple, saffron-tree, Caimitillo, Caimitillo de Perro, Camitillo Cimarró, Teta de Burra, Macanabo, and Caïmite Marron. It gets the name satinleaf from the distinctive colors of the leaves. The top of the leaf is dark green while the bottom is light brown or copper. This distinctive look makes it a very aesthetically pleasing tree that is commonly used as an ornamental in yards and public spaces.|$|E
50|$|Farming is {{the main}} {{occupation}} {{of the people in}} this region. The farming is still done in the traditional manner (using oxen) in the more remote locations and by machinery in the villages. The major rabi crops grown in Pattan Kalan are potatoes and maize. The only Kharif crop grown in the area is wheat, to which a very small area of the village is dedicated. There are two main purposes of this crop: to feed cattle and for the grain. Other vegetables grown in Pattan Kalan include turnips, radishes, peas, pumpkins, beans, and mustard. Fruits like pears, apples, black grapes, grapes, figs, peaches, <b>damson</b> <b>plums,</b> mulberries, wild figs, lemons, apricots, and cherries are grown in Pattan Kalan.|$|R
5000|$|Fruit was eaten fresh when in season, {{and dried}} or {{preserved}} over winter. Popular fruits included apples, pears, figs, grapes, quinces, citron, strawberries, blackberries, currants, <b>damson</b> <b>plums,</b> dates, melons, rose hips and pomegranates. [...] Less common fruits were the more exotic azeroles and medlars. Cherries and apricots, both {{introduced in the}} 1st century BC, were popular. Peaches were introduced in the 1st century AD from Persia. Oranges and lemons were known but used more for medicinal purposes than in cookery. Although known to the ancient Romans, lemons were not cultivated in Italy until the Principate. At least 35 cultivars of pear were grown in Rome, along with three types of apples. Cato described pear culture methods similar to modern techniques.|$|R
50|$|In {{certain parts}} of the world, some fruits are called plums and are quite {{different}} from fruits known as plums in Europe or the Americas. For example, marian plums are popular in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, otherwise also known as gandaria, plum mango, ma-praang, ma-yong, ramania, kundang, rembunia or setar. Another example is the Chinese Plum, popular as pipa or Chinese plums in East Asia and Southeast Asia, and as Japanese medlar, loquat, nispero, bibassier and wollmispel elsewhere. In South Asia and Southeast Asia, jambul, a fruit from tropical tree in Myrtaceae family, is similarly sometimes referred to 'damson plums', and it is different from <b>damson</b> <b>plums</b> found in Europe and Americas. Jambul is also called as Java plum, Malabar plum, jaman, jamun, jamblang, jiwat, salam, duhat, koeli, jambuláo or koriang.|$|R
5000|$|The name damson {{comes from}} Middle English damascene, damesene, damasin, damsin, and {{ultimately}} from the Latin (prunum) damascenum, [...] "plum of Damascus". One commonly stated {{theory is that}} damsons were first cultivated in antiquity {{in the area around}} the ancient city of Damascus, capital of modern-day Syria, and were introduced into England by the Romans. The historical link between the Roman-era damascenum and the north and west European damson is rather tenuous despite the adoption of the older name. The damascenum described by Roman and Greek authors of late antiquity has more of the character of a sweet dessert plum, not fitting well to the <b>damson</b> <b>plum.</b> Remnants of damsons are sometimes found during archaeological digs of ancient Roman camps across England, and they have clearly been cultivated, and consumed, for centuries. Damson stones have been found in an excavation in Hungate, York, and dated to the late period of Anglo-Saxon England.|$|E
40|$|Jamun (Syzygium cumini L. Skeels) (Black plum, <b>Damson</b> <b>plum)</b> fruits weigh between 2 - 5 g at maturity. Fresh seeds {{represented}} 20 - 80 % of {{the total}} fruit weight; the seed coat and cotyledons contributed 6 % and 94 % to the total seed weight respectively, while {{the weight of the}} embryonic axis was insignificant. Only the embryonic axis stained with Tetrazolium, not the cotyledons. The seeds are polyembryonic with up to four embryos, of which at most three germinate. Decoated seeds germinated faster than coated seeds under nursery conditions, with high significant germination percentages, dry matter production rates and vigor indices. The lack of staining of the cotyledon by tetrazolium was probably due to the presence of an impermeable layer. Decoating seeds for faster germination is recommended...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} methodology {{was developed for}} detection of malathion in the peels of tomatoes and Damson plums by surface-enhanced Raman imaging spectroscopy and multivariate curve resolution. To recover the pure spectra and the distribution mapping of the analyzed surfaces, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), multivariate curve calibration methods with alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) and MCR with weighted alternating least square (MCR-WALS) were utilized. Error covariance matrices were estimated to evaluate {{the structure of the}} error over all the data. For the tomato data, NMF-ALS and MCR-ALS presented excellent spectral recovery {{even in the absence of}} initial knowledge of the pesticide spectrum. For the <b>Damson</b> <b>plum</b> data, owing to heteroscedastic noise, MCR-WALS produced better results. This methodology enabled detection below to the maximum residue limit permitted for this pesticide. This approach can be implemented for in situ monitoring because it is fast and does not require extensive manipulation of samples, making its use feasible for other fruits and pesticides as well.

50|$|Infestation with B. cardui {{causes the}} margins of {{affected}} leaves to roll up. This aphid is a vector of plum pox, a serious viral disease affecting <b>plums,</b> <b>damsons,</b> peaches, apricots and some other plants.|$|R
50|$|Although once cultivated, and {{familiar}} to gardeners of the Tudor period, the bullace gradually {{fell out of}} favour as newer, larger or sweeter types of <b>damson</b> or <b>plum</b> displaced it, and it hung on at the fringes of cultivation. Its hardiness meant that, like the damson, it was occasionally planted as a windbreak or hedging tree, and until the 20th century was regarded as valuable for providing fruit very late in the year.|$|R
500|$|Fruit was readily {{combined}} with meat, fish and eggs. The recipe for Tart de brymlent, a fish pie from the recipe collection Forme of Cury, includes {{a mix of}} figs, raisins, apples and pears with fish (salmon, codling or haddock) and pitted <b>damson</b> <b>plums</b> under the top crust. It was considered important {{to make sure that}} the dish agreed with contemporary standards of medicine and dietetics. This meant that food had to be [...] "tempered" [...] according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients, condiments and spices; fish was seen as being cold and moist, and best cooked in a way that heated and dried it, such as frying or oven baking, and seasoned with hot and dry spices; beef was dry and hot and should therefore be boiled; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be roasted. In some recipe collections, alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the humoral nature than what a modern cook would consider to be similarity in taste. In a recipe for quince pie, cabbage is said to work equally well, and in another turnips could be replaced by pears.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{ethylene}} production, ACC quantification, and {{the determination}} of ACC-oxidase (ACO) activity and the transcript levels PdACS 1, PdACO 1, and PdACO 2, have been evaluated {{in different parts of}} developing flowers (sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils) and fruits (epicarp, mesocarp, and seed) of <b>damson</b> <b>plum</b> (Prunus domestica L. subsp. Syriaca), which is a drupe. The fertilized pistil was the only floral organ to register net ethylene production. PdACS 1 mRNA was detected exclusively in the stamen. Regarding PdACO 1 and PdACO 2 transcription, at pre-anthesis, anthesis, and post-anthesis, it was found that: (a) both genes were expressed in all studied floral organs, but accumulation of PdACO 1 transcripts was consistently higher; (b) anthesis provoked a sharp accumulation of PdACO 1 in sepals, petals, and stamens, while in the pistil no changes occurred; (c) an increase of PdACO 2 transcription occurred in sepals concomitantly with anthesis; (d) pollination appeared to activate the transcription of PdACO 1 in the pistil. The whole fruit of this plum produced ethylene only at the beginning of S 1 and in S 4 (climacteric), while the seed produced it {{at the end of the}} S 1 and throughout S 2, when a great richness in ACC and high ACO activity occurred. PdACS 1 expression was detectable in the whole fruit at the beginning of development and in the epicarp and mesocarp during ripening. No expression of PdACS 1 has been detected in isolated seeds. Even though the transcript for PdACO 2 was temporal and spatially absent in fruit development, mRNA levels of PdACO 1 notably changed. In the seed, the higher transcriptional activity of PdACO 1 appeared at the end of phase S 1. The greatest amounts of ACC were registered in the ripening mesocarp and epicarp. Whereas PdACO 1 mRNA was detected in the mesocarp at the middle of S 1, during the breaker stage (S 3), and at the end of the climacteric phase (S 4), in epicarp the expression occurred only in S 4 stage. These results clearly demonstrate that the seed actively participates in ethylene production during the first phase of <b>damson</b> <b>plum</b> development...|$|E
40|$|Sensitivity {{of field}} tests (AgriStrip  and Immunochromato), DAS-ELISA, two step RT-PCR and {{real-time}} RT-PCR for Plum pox virus (PPV) detection was tested in various tissues of apricot, peach, plum and <b>damson</b> <b>plum</b> trees infected with isolates belonging to PPV-D, PPV-M or PPV-Rec, the three strains present in Slovenia. Flowers of apricot and plum {{in full bloom}} {{proved to be a}} very good source for detection of PPV. PPV could be detected with all tested techniques in symptomatic parts of leaves in May and with one exception even in the beginning of August, but it was not detected in asymptomatic leaves using field tests, DAS-ELISA and partly also molecular techniques. PPV was detected only in some of the samples of asymptomatic parts of the leaves with symptoms and of stalks by field tests and DAS-ELISA. Infections were not detected in buds in August using field tests or DAS-ELISA. Field tests are useful for confirmation of the PPV infection in symptomatic leaves, but in tissues without symptoms DAS-ELISA should be combined or replaced by molecular techniques...|$|E
25|$|Sloe gin is {{traditionally}} {{described as a}} liqueur made by infusing sloes (the fruit of the blackthorn) in gin, although modern versions are almost always compounded from neutral spirits and flavourings. Similar infusions are possible with other fruits, such as <b>damsons</b> or beach <b>plums.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their diet {{consisted}} of sea turtles, flying foxes, fowls, wild cherries, Burdekin <b>plum,</b> <b>damson</b> berries, trochus shells, baler shells, green ant and cockatoo apples. They also hunted large sea mammals such as small whales from these canoes. This was only possible {{due to their}} development of barbed harpoon technology that enabled the Ngaro to kill their prey by exhausting them rather than bleeding them to death, which would attract sharks {{to compete for the}} catch..|$|R
50|$|Because damson stones may be {{difficult}} and time-consuming to separate from the flesh, preserves, such as jam or fruit butter, are often made from whole fruit. Most cooks then remove the stones, but others, either {{in order not to}} lose any of the pulp or because they believe the flavour is better, leave the stones in the final product. A limited number of damson stones left in jam is supposed to impart a subtle almond flavour, though as with all <b>plums</b> <b>damson</b> stones contain the cyagenic glycoside amygdalin, a toxin.|$|R
60|$|As, {{whenever}} the Reverend Septimus fell a-musing, his good mother {{took it to}} be an infallible sign that he ‘wanted support,’ the blooming old lady made all haste to the dining-room closet, to produce from it the support embodied in a glass of Constantia and a home-made biscuit. It was a most wonderful closet, worthy of Cloisterham and of Minor Canon Corner. Above it, a portrait of Handel in a flowing wig beamed down at the spectator, with a knowing air of being up to the contents of the closet, and a musical air of intending to combine all its harmonies in one delicious fugue. No common closet with a vulgar door on hinges, openable all at once, and leaving nothing to be disclosed by degrees, this rare closet had a lock in mid-air, where two perpendicular slides met; the one falling down, and the other pushing up. The upper slide, on being pulled down (leaving the lower a double mystery), revealed deep shelves of pickle-jars, jam-pots, tin canisters, spice-boxes, and agreeably outlandish vessels of blue and white, the luscious lodgings of preserved tamarinds and ginger. Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach. The pickles, in a uniform of rich brown double-breasted buttoned coat, and yellow or sombre drab continuations, announced their portly forms, in printed capitals, as Walnut, Gherkin, Onion, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Mixed, and other members of that noble family. The jams, as being of a less masculine temperament, and as wearing curlpapers, announced themselves in feminine caligraphy, like a soft whisper, to be Raspberry, Gooseberry, Apricot, <b>Plum,</b> <b>Damson,</b> Apple, and Peach. The scene closing on these charmers, and the lower slide ascending, oranges were revealed, attended by a mighty japanned sugar-box, to temper their acerbity if unripe. Home-made biscuits waited at the Court of these Powers, accompanied by a goodly fragment of plum-cake, and various slender ladies’ fingers, to be dipped into sweet wine and kissed. Lowest of all, a compact leaden-vault enshrined the sweet wine and a stock of cordials: whence issued whispers of Seville Orange, Lemon, Almond, and Caraway-seed. There was a crowning air upon this closet of closets, of having been for ages hummed through by the Cathedral bell and organ, until those venerable bees had made sublimated honey of everything in store; and it was always observed that every dipper among the shelves (deep, as has been noticed, and swallowing up head, shoulders, and elbows) came forth again mellow-faced, and seeming to have undergone a saccharine transfiguration.|$|R
