40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the current prevalence of consanguineous marriage in Western Australia, {{as a means}} of assessing the associated requirement for genetic counselling services. Subjects and Methods: The records of all intended marriages in Western Australia were examined over a 6 -year period (1994 – 1999), with the numbers and types of consanguineous unions collated and analysed by year, current <b>domicile</b> and countries <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Results and Conclusions: Of the 62, 549 proposed marriages, 144 (0. 23 %) were between couples who identified themselves as biological relatives, 82 (0. 13 %) of whom were first cousins. The mean coefficient of inbreeding α for the total sample was 0. 00009. In 75. 7 % of cases either {{one or both of the}} partners had been born outside Australia. Given the patterns of recent migration to Australia, it is suggested that these figures should be treated as minimal estimates of the actual levels of consanguinity in the population...|$|R

50|$|The United Kingdom {{contains}} three jurisdictions: England and Wales; Scotland; and Northern Ireland. All UK jurisdictions {{distinguish between}} <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (decided by the domicile of their father, or if parents unmarried their mother), {{domicile of choice}} (when a person has exercised a legal option to change their domicile as can be done when attaining majority) and domicile of dependence (applicable to those legally dependent on another such as some incapable persons, children or women married before 1974) but in general only one place can be a person's domicile {{at any one time}} thus preventing the creation of differing simultaneous domiciles for different purposes; the three types of domicile can enable a voluntary change when a person reaches a relevant age. If a domicile of choice lapses and is not replaced the <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> reasserts itself. The concept of domicile is not rooted in statute thus the basic matter of an individual's domicile is not decided by any single statute but rather by case law in combination with applicable international law and statutes following in accord.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} settle {{permanently}} {{has been held}} to arise only when one can become a permanent resident of the jurisdiction for immigration purposes. For example, suppose that A came from England to Canada on a visa to work for an employer in Ontario. While there, his son B is born. A likes Canada enough to have his status changed to that of landed immigrant. When B comes of age, he decides to leave Ontario for good, but dies before settling permanently elsewhere. B's <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is England, because of A's initial inability to settle permanently in Ontario. When A obtains permission to land, Ontario becomes his domicile of choice, and B (provided {{he is still a}} minor) automatically acquires it as a domicile of dependency. When B attains the age of majority, Ontario becomes his domicile of choice until he decides to leave for good, at which time it reverts back to the <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> His new domicile of choice would only occur once {{he had been able to}} settle permanently in a new jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the common}} law a married woman was deemed {{to have the same}} {{domicile}} as her husband, so the <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of the children of the marriage was {{the same as that of}} their father and the time of birth. Children gained their mother's domicile if their father was predeceased or they were born outside marriage. An orphan has the jurisdiction over the original domicile where he or she was found.|$|E

5000|$|The {{judgement}} to {{the preliminary}} issue {{to determine the}} domicile of Owen Davies was handed down on 12 July 2011 by Mr Charles Hollander QC and ruled against Adrian Davies and his associate Mark Simeon Jones (both barristers of 3 Doctor Johnson's Buildings, London). The Judge concluded that the evidence never came close to establishing a Belgian domicile of choice as alleged by the so-called Family Defendants and determined that [...] "Owen never lost his <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> and remained domiciled in England", and is further reported in the Stratford Herald on 14 July 2011.|$|E
50|$|In {{the common}} law, {{marriage}} {{can produce a}} common domicile for the spouses with the wife taking the domicile of the husband. This rule {{is derived from the}} proposition that a dependent wife will follow her husband in all aspects of her life. Although this provides a convenient law which is usually easy to identify (since the requirements for change of domicile depend on demonstrating an intention to reside indefinitely in the state of choice, the domicile of the husband is difficult to change) it may produce a result in which a person is domiciled in one state but the matrimonial home and all other features of the parties' lives may be in a second state. This problem is aggravated by the rules relating to the revival of the <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> when a domicile of choice is abandoned. For example, a husband with a <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in Japan establishes a domicile of choice in China where he marries a woman with a French domicile. When the relationship breaks down, he abandons his home in China and goes to live in Singapore. Immediately upon his leaving China, his Japanese domicile revives and his wife's domicile also changes to that of Japan even though she might never have set foot in that country. To avoid both the patriarchal implications and potentially unfortunate legal consequences implicit in the domicile of dependence, many states have amended their laws to permit women to retain their domcile of origin upon marriage, or to establish a domicile of choice independently of the husband during the subsistence of the marriage. In cases where the spouses have different domiciles, the choice of law rule must refer to both lex domicilii.|$|E
50|$|The Supreme Court {{felt that}} the {{arguments}} of the State of Delhi and the Delhi High Court judgement had lost sight of an essential feature of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, contained in Section 7 of the same Act. The Act is primarily concerned with {{the welfare of the}} minor child. With specific reference to children of unwed parents, the Supreme Court highlighted the fact that both Hindu and Mohameddan law in India recognised that custody of children of unwed parents was given to the mother. Under Christian law in India as well, the <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of the child belonging to unwed parents is the country of the child's mother {{at the time of the}} child's birth. The Supreme Court observed that when it came to the welfare of the child (of unwed parents), priority, pre-eminence and preference are given to the mother over the father.|$|E

50|$|Testamentary {{capacity}} is generally {{governed by the}} law of the testator's domicile {{at the time of his}} death, the form of the instrument in most countries either by the law of his domicile or {{the law of the}} place where the will was made, at his option. The old rule of English law was to allow the former alternative only. The law was altered for the United Kingdom in 1861 by the Wills Act 1861 (known as Lord Kingsdown's Act), by which a will made out of the United Kingdom by a British subject is, as far as regards personal estate, good if made according to the forms required by the law of the place where it was made, or by the law of the testator's domicile at the time of making it, or by the law of the place of his <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Subsequent change of domicile does not avoid such a will. Another act passed on the same day, the Domicile Act 1861, enacted that by convention with any foreign government foreign domicile with regard to wills could not be acquired by a testator without a year's residence and a written declaration of intention to become domiciled. By the same act foreign consuls may by convention have certain authority over the wills and property of subjects of foreign states dying in England.|$|E

40|$|Lifestyle of {{immigrants}} and recognized refugees Migration {{can be defined as}} more or less terminated process moving of people among places which are determinated by state borders. It is the process when person or group of people leave their land to find better place for living. Each person has his or her own lifestyle and {{it is one of the}} basic factors that influences the quality of living. The lifestyle is formed during life when is a person in interaction with enviroment. The theory is further split into 6 main chapters that involve all issues of lifestyle {{of immigrants}} and recognized refugees. The history of migration to the Czech Republic is analyzed, asylum processing and the most important lifestyle of national minorities is mentioned. In the last chapter of theoretical part integration {{of immigrants and}} asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is mentioned. The practical part is devoted to the research and it was dedicated to lifestyle of immigrants and asylum seekers in the Czech Republic and in their <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The aim of the thesis was to compare lifestyle of immigrants and asylum seekers in the Czech Republic and in their <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The hypothetical assumption suggested that lifestyle of immigrants and asylum seekers is the same in the Czech Republic as in their <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The regions of the research were South Bohemian region, Plzeň region and Ústí nad Labem region. To prove or invalidate the hypothesis a method of questionnaire was used. 100 people were accosted and they received questionnaire to fill in it during four months. I received 64 questionnaires back. After evaluation of the questionnaires I came to the result that people who had filled the questionnaire have the same lifestyle in the Czech Republic as in their <b>domicile</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The hypothesis was proved. Public, students of social school and their educators will be introduced with the results. I would recommend to focuse individual social work because each person has different needs. Easygoing integration into Czech society coheres with reaction of Czech people as well. My work could be used as text book referring about national minorities living in the Czech Republic. At the end of the thesis there are some supportive documents related to my work. It is neccesary to know that the more we can help foreigners to integrate themselves and we adopt them as our fellow-citizens the faster they will feel at home in the Czech Republic...|$|E
