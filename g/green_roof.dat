5|$|In Capital E Analysis' {{conclusions}} of the financial benefits of green buildings, {{it was determined that}} green roofs successfully lowered energy usage and raised health benefits. For every square foot of <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> used in one study the savings amounted to $5.80 energy-wise. There were also savings seen in the emissions, water, and maintenance categories. Overall, the savings amounted to $52.90-$71.30 on average while the cost of going green totaled -$3.00-$5.00.|$|E
40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>roofs</b> are an {{innovative}} solution for urban stormwater management. This paper examines governance arrangements for <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> as a ‘no-regrets’ climate adaptation measure in five cities. We analysed who governs <b>green</b> <b>roofs,</b> why {{and with what}} outcome. Our results show that hierarchical and market arrangements co-exist in the various stages of the policy process. Cities with a higher prevalence of hierarchical arrangements have substantially higher implementation rates for <b>green</b> <b>roofs.</b> Although private sector involvement is crucial for raising efficiencies, a significant level of public responsibility taken by local governments appears to be salient for unleashing the potential of <b>green</b> <b>roofs...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>roofs</b> {{can help}} address habitat loss {{in urban areas}} by {{supporting}} plant and animal communities. To determine whether <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> can support collembola biodiversity, we collected pitfall samples from April-June 2015 on two extensive and two intensive <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> in urban Portland, Oregon. Twenty morphospecies were found across the <b>roofs,</b> indicating that <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> support a diversity of collembola taxa. The intensive roofs were more biodiverse than the extensive, though roof type {{may not be the}} most significant factor affecting collembolan biodiversity. Each of the four <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> were characterized by a different and unique most dominant morphospecies, and, indeed, each roof possessed a different set of top-three abundant collembola taxa. While <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> support moderate collembola diversity, preserving natural habitat is important to maintain species richness...|$|R
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>roofs</b> {{provide a}} thermal mass layer which helps reduce {{the flow of}} heat into a building. The solar {{reflectance}} of <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> varies depending on the plant types (generally 0.3-0.5). <b>Green</b> <b>roofs</b> may not reflect {{as much as a}} cool roof but do have other benefits such as evapotranspiration which cools the plants and the immediate area around the plants, aiding in lowering rooftop temperatures but increasing humidity, naturally. Moreover, some <b>Green</b> <b>roofs</b> need maintenance such as regularly watering.|$|R
5|$|The {{surrounding}} {{area has been}} extensively landscaped to create outdoor learning areas and a wildlife garden. Energy-saving features include photovoltaic panels for electricity and {{ground source heat pump}} for heating. A <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> (a living roof that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium), is used to absorb rainfall and provide insulation. The centre is constructed using timber-frame walls insulated with straw bales.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, McGill premiered its Office of Sustainability {{and added}} a second {{full-time}} position in this area, the Director of Sustainability {{in addition to the}} Sustainability Officer. Recent efforts in implementing its sustainable development plan include the new Life Sciences Center which was built with LEED-Silver certification and a <b>green</b> <b>roof,</b> as well as an increase in parking rates in January 2008 to fund other sustainability projects. Other student projects include The Flat: Bike Collective, which promotes alternative transportation, and the Farmer's Market, which occurs during the fall harvest. The Farmer's Market and many other initiatives came out of student collaboration during the Rethink Conference 2008.|$|E
5|$|The LaSalle Street {{canyon is}} home to other {{historic}} buildings including the Rookery Building, a National Historic Landmark {{considered to be the}} oldest standing high-rise. A 1907 renovation included a lobby remodeled by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie School style. The name rookery comes from the previous building on the property which became home to many birds, especially pigeons. The nearby Reliance Building was the first skyscraper to have large plate glass windows comprise the majority of its surface area, and One North LaSalle was for some time one of Chicago's tallest buildings. Both the Reliance Building and One North LaSalle are on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1853, the governments of Chicago and Cook County have shared three different buildings {{at the north end of}} the canyon. The current Chicago City Hall, built in a Classical Revival style, was designed to symbolize the strength, dignity, and vigor of the government. Completed in 2001, an award-winning <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> was incorporated into the structure. All of the structures are designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Green</b> <b>roofs</b> are {{a passive}} cooling {{technique}} that stop incoming solar radiation {{from reaching the}} building structure below. Many {{studies have been conducted}} over the past 10 years to consider the potential building energy benefits of <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> and shown that they can offer benefits in winter heating reduction as well as summer cooling. With review and summarized the description of its functional traits in our country, this paper discuss the necessity to carry out the research on the functional traits of <b>green</b> <b>roofs,</b> and gave some suggestions about how to do this. At last, we propose the estimate method for the cost of <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> construction project and <b>green</b> <b>roof’s</b> economic value and ecological benefit...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{important}} distinction is between pitched <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> and flat <b>green</b> <b>roofs.</b> [...] Pitched sod roofs, a traditional feature of many Scandinavian buildings, {{tend to be}} of a simpler design than flat <b>green</b> <b>roofs.</b> [...] This is because the pitch of the roof {{reduces the risk of}} water penetrating through the roof structure, allowing the use of fewer waterproofing and drainage layers.|$|R
2500|$|Modern <b>green</b> <b>roofs,</b> {{which are}} made {{of a system of}} {{manufactured}} layers deliberately placed over roofs to support growing medium and vegetation, are a relatively new phenomenon. [...] However, <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> or sod roofs in northern Scandinavia have been around for centuries. [...] The modern trend started when <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> were developed in Germany in the 1960s, and has since spread to many countries. [...] Today, it is estimated that about 10% of all German roofs have been “greened”.

25|$|A {{properly}} {{designed and}} installed extensive green-roof system can cost $108–248/m2 ($10–23/ft2) while an intensive <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> costs $355–2368/m2 ($33–220/ft2) however, {{since most of}} the materials used to build the <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> can be salvaged it is estimated that the cost of replacing a <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> is generally one third of the initial installation costs.|$|E
25|$|Advances in <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> {{technology}} {{have led to}} the development of new systems that do not fit into the traditional classification of <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> types. Comprehensive green roofs bring the most advantageous qualities of extensive and intensive green roofs together. Comprehensive green roofs support plant varieties typically seen in intensive green roofs at the depth and weight of an extensive <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> system.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{urbanization}} of {{many regions}} of the world has resulted in the decline of suitable habitat for wild flora and fauna. <b>Green</b> <b>roofs</b> have been suggested as a potential avenue to provide patches of good-quality habitat in highly developed regions. In this study, we surveyed <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> for bee diversity and abundance to determine their potential as quality habitats in an urban area for these important pollinators. By comparing various biodiversity measures between <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> and ground-level sites, we show that <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> provide habitat to many bee species. Implications for pollinator conservation and urban agricultural production are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of green roofs {{is that the}} initial cost of installing a <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> can be double that of a normal roof. Depending {{on what kind of}} <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> it is, the maintenance costs could be higher, but some types of <b>green</b> <b>roof</b> have little or no ongoing cost. Some kinds of green roofs also place higher demands on the waterproofing system of the structure, both because water is retained on the roof and due to the possibility of roots penetrating the waterproof membrane. Another disadvantage is that the wildlife they attract may include pest insects which could easily infiltrate a residential building through open windows.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{intensive}} <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> {{are sometimes}} used in built-up city areas where residents and workers {{often do not}} have access to gardens or local parks. [...] Extensive <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> are sometimes used to blend buildings into rural surroundings, for example by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, who has one of the biggest <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> in Europe (covering more than 32,000m2 on their factory at Goodwood, West Sussex.|$|R
50|$|Mosses are {{sometimes}} used in <b>green</b> <b>roofs.</b> Advantages of mosses over higher plants in <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> include reduced weight loads, increased water absorption, no fertilizer requirements, and high drought tolerance. Since mosses {{do not have}} true roots, they require less planting medium than higher plants with extensive root systems. With proper species selection for the local climate, mosses in <b>green</b> <b>roofs</b> require no irrigation once established and are low maintenance.|$|R
