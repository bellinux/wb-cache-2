40|$|Abstract To {{determine}} how gelatinous fibres and gelatinous layers {{contribute to the}} magnitude of longitudinal growth stress in tension wood, anatomical measurements of gelatinous fibres were carried out on poplar tension wood (Populus I 4551). It was found that (a) no gelatinous fibres were observed under a growth strain level of 0. 06 to 0. 08 %; (b) almost 100 % of the non-conductive tissues contained gelatinous fibres above a growth strain level of 0. 15 to 0. 19 %; and (c) the area of fibres, the area of fibres with gelatinous layers per unit of tissue area, and {{the thickness of the}} gelatinous layers predominantly influence the magnitude of growth stress.

40|$|International audienceTransverse drying {{shrinkage}} was measured at microscopic and mesoscopic levels in poplar wood characterised by an increasing growth strain (GS), from normal to tension wood. Results show that: (a) The {{drying shrinkage}}, measured as a relative thickness decrease, {{was significantly higher}} for G-layer (GL) than the other layers (OL), GL shrinkage was not significantly correlated with GS and OL shrinkage was negatively correlated with GS. (b) In <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibre</b> (G-fibre), lumen size increased during drying and this increase was positively related with GS, but in normal wood fibre lumen size decreased during drying. These findings suggest that GL shrank outwards, so that its shrinkage feebly affected the total cell shrinkage and the mesoscopic shrinkage was controlled by the OL shrinkage which shrank inwards. (c) Measurements done on 7 × 7 mm² thin sections evidenced a negative correlation between transverse shrinkage and GS, significant in T direction but weak in R direction. These observations at both levels allow to discuss the contribution of GL to the mesoscopic shrinkage of tension wood...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the stern anatomical adaptations of the mangrove Bruguiera gymnorrhiza seedlings under experimental conditions that simulated semidiurnal tides The inundation periods in these treatments were 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h In the 0 - 6 h treatments, cortex thickness, pith radius and stem radius increased, but then declined when inundation period exceeded 6 h. Significant negative linear correlations were found between waterlogging duration and vessel element length, bar number per perforation plate and <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibre</b> ratio Whereas vessel density and fibre diameter showed only slight fluctuations, fibre cell wall thickness declined dramatically from 2 h treatments onwards, in contrast, vessel wall thickness increased under long-term waterlogging conditions (> 6 h). Tangential vessel diameter and fibre length exhibited similar tendencies, first decreasing significantly with prolonged inundation, and then increasing under long-term waterlogging duration up to 6 h These results indicated that the internal structure of B gymnorrhiza seedlings was affected by periodical waterlogging The distinct structural changes with short (6 h) term inundation suggest distinct strategies for maintaining a balance between growth, conductive capacity, conductive safety and mechanical strength Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|The {{occurence}} {{of reaction}} wood in numerous trees, small shrubs and herbs is described both in stems and roots, {{and the possible}} relation between <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres</b> and tension wood considered. In the roots {{of a number of}} dicotyledonous plants, <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres</b> were found to be abundant and more or less regularly distributed irrespective of the orientation of the organ with respect to gravity. It is suggested that <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres,</b> irrespective of their position in a stem or root and tension wood fibres are the cytological expression of the same phenomenon and should be considered as one type of fibre. The formation of tension wood bears less relation to the position of the ontogenetic centre of stems and roots than is generally thought. There was evidence that in horizontal branches, the distribution of tension wood fibres within a ring is more common in the early wood on the upper side and in the late wood on the lower side, but this is not invariable. The occurrence of gelatinous axial parenchyma in branch and root wood of robinia is recorded for the first time. Compression wood was not found in horizontally lying roots of a few gymnosperms examined. <p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{exogenous}} application of growth regulators (IAA, NAA, GA 3 and BAP) on xylogenesis {{has been investigated}} in actively growing shoots of Leucaena leucocephala by anatomical methods. Auxins are (both IAA and NAA) {{found to be the}} key regulators of differentiation of narrow lumen vessels and tracheids. These elements were derived not only from fusiform cambial cells, but also from axial parenchyma through transdifferentiation. The exogenous feeding of GA 3 induced differentiation of <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres,</b> deformed vessels, elongated thin walled fibres and a high fibre/vessel ratio. BAP application decreased the cambial activity and cell differentiation process resulting in development of thick walled fibres and vessel elements, and also delayed lignification of cell walls. The application of combination of hormones showed both synergistic and antagonistic nature of interaction among different hormones. Combination of GA 3 and auxins induced cambial cell division and relatively fast differentiation of xylem, while increasing concentrations of GA 3 over auxins induced differentiation of <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres.</b> The combination of high concentration of BAP either with auxins or with GA 3 slowed down cambial activity and xylem differentiation. Moderate concentrations of BAP and GA 3 induced <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres</b> with thick <b>gelatinous</b> layer indicating the synergistic effect of both hormones...|$|R
40|$|Young shoots of Poplar Ghoy {{have been}} {{inclined}} artificially during increasing periods to induce {{the formation of}} tension and opposite wood tissues as reaction to the gravitational stimulus. The shoots are able to react to an extremely short stimulus according to {{the scale of the}} normal growing season. After a presentation time of only 6 hours, the whole of the shoots present an opposite wood arc. However, on the upper face, it takes between 24 and 48 hours, for the shoots to feel the modification of their equilibrium state and start producing tension wood. After 48 hours of latent period, formation of <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres</b> can be observed on the upper face of the stem. The increase duration of the stimulus influences the quantity of <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres</b> and the arc angle of the tension wood. On the lower face, the opposite wood fibres are produced at a slower rate, causing a pith eccentricity. The shoots will return to the stand-up position after being submitted to a stimulus of approximately 4 to 8 days...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} what is controlling the magnitude of the longitudinal growth stress in tension wood, an experiment was carried out on poplar tension wood (Populus I 4551). Results show that (a) in the region where growth strain value is between 610 and 816 µstrain <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres</b> are common, above the value between 1540 and 1935 µstrain almost all <b>fibres</b> contain <b>gelatinous</b> layers; (b) the amount of fibres, the amount of <b>fibres</b> with <b>gelatinous</b> layer (G-Fibres), per unit of tissue area, and the thickness of the <b>gelatinous</b> layers in <b>fibres</b> control mostly the magnitude of growth stress; (c) other possible factors contributing to growth stress are the lignification, crystallinity and microfibril angle in the fibres without G-layer within the region partly containing G-fibres and in G-layers themselves...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{samples were}} taken from the upper and lower sides of 21 {{naturally}} tilted trees from 18 families of angiosperms in the tropical rain forest in French Guyana. The measurement of growth stresses ensured that the two samples {{were taken from}} wood tissues in a different mechanical state: highly tensile stressed wood on the upper side, called tension wood, and lower tensile stressed wood on the lower side, called opposite wood. Eight species had tension wood fibres with a distinct gelatinous layer (G-layer). The distribution of <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres</b> varied from species to species. One of the species, Casearia javitensis (Flacourtiaceae), showed a peculiar multilayered secondary wall in its reaction wood. Comparison between the stress level and the occurrence of the G-layer indicates that the G-layer is not a key factor in the production of high tensile stressed wood...|$|R

A conducting bundle between the atrium and the ventricle was found by Wilhelm His, Jr in 1893. In 1906, Sunao Tawara found a “complex knoten” of tissue at the proximal end of the His bundle. He concluded {{that this was the}} inception of an electrical conducting system which continued from the AV node through the bundle of His, divided into the bundle branches, and terminated as the Purkinje fibres. The collaboration of Arthur Keith and Martin Flack led to discovery of the sinus node, finalising the discovery of the electrical system of the heart and providing an anatomical answer to the baffling mystery: “Why does the heart beat?...|$|R

Morphologic similarities between leaves of espinheira-santa and mata-olho (Sorocea bonplandii), has motivated fakes {{in the market}} of phytotherapy. The present work consisted of the anatomical study, including stem and leaf, of the species M. ilicifolia, M. aquifolia and S. bomplandii. Samples of adult leaves and stem of plants located in the cities of Maringá and Marialva were collected. Both {{are located in the}} northwest region of Paraná State. The botanical material was prepared with using usual techniques of anatomy. The leaves of both Maytenus species presented great similarities, characterizing itself for the presence of epidermal cells with straight walls, biseriate palisade tissue, petiole vascular system represented by unique amphicribal bundle and sclereids, which were present in the stems of these two species. S. bomplandii leaves differed of Maytenus species for presenting epidermal cells with undulated walls, uniserite palisade tissue, petiole vascular system represented by many collateral bundles and <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres.</b> Non-glandular trichomes, glandular trichomes, and laticifer only occur in S. bomplandii...|$|R
40|$|Young shoots from poplar {{cuttings}} (P. euramericana cv ‘Ghoy’) were artificially {{inclined to}} 30 ° from vertical {{to quantify the}} anatomical modifications induced by this gravitational stimulus. At {{the end of the}} growing season, the tension wood tissue (from the upper face of the inclined axis) was compared to the opposite wood tissue (from the lower face), with radial position taken into account. On isolated elements after maceration, fibres and vessels were significantly longer in tension wood tissue. In the cross section, the <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres</b> had a smaller radial diameter than normal fibres in opposite wood. Vessel frequency and porosity were significantly lower in tension wood than opposite wood. Solitary vessels in tension wood were less circular in cross section than in opposite wood, but their surface area did not differ. Rays were more numerous in tension wood than opposite wood but their height did not differ between the two tissue types. Finally, there was a negative correlation between the proportion of vessels lumina (lowest in tension wood) and the proportion of fibres lumina including the G layer. The very controlled nature of this experiment (greenhouse, young clonal material, detailed anatomical observations within one growth ring) and the image analysis technology (allowing a large number of observations) enabled us to draw conclusions that may not have been seen in less-controlled experiments and/or those with smaller sample sizes.

40|$|Salicaceae {{have been}} {{enlarged}} {{to include a}} majority of the species formerly placed in the polyphyletic tropical Flacourtiaceae. Several studies have reported a peculiar and infrequently formed multilayered structure of tension wood in four of the tropical genera. Tension wood is a tissue produced by trees to restore their vertical orientation and most studies have focused on trees developing tension wood by means of cellulose-rich, <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres,</b> as in Populus and Salix (Salicaceae s. s.). This study aims to determine if the multilayered structure of tension wood is an anatomical characteristic common in other Salicaceae and, if so, how its distribution correlates to phylogenetic relationships. Therefore, we studied the tension wood of 14 genera of Salicaceae and two genera of Achariaceae, one genus of Goupiaceae and one genus of Lacistemataceae, families closely related to Salicaceae or formerly placed in Flacourtiaceae. Opposite wood and tension wood were compared with light microscopy and three-dimensional laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results indicate that a multilayered structure of tension wood is common in the family except in Salix, Populus and one of their closest relatives, Idesia polycarpa. We suggest that tension wood may be a useful anatomical character in understanding phylogenetic relationships in Salicaceae. Further investigation is still needed on the tension wood of several other putatively close relatives of Salix and Populus, in particular Bennettiodendron, Macrohasseltia and Itoa.

40|$|Tension wood {{is known}} to be the main {{mechanism}} for the shape control in angiosperms. An overview of the anatomical diversity of tension wood by comparison to opposite wood is presented from the result of a study on 21 species in tropical rain forest. Anatomical measurements on vessel and fibres do not allow to evidence common criteria for the high tensile stress generation. At the ultrastructural level, microfibrils angle is the only common criterion with a lower MFA in tension wood. Typical gelatinous (G-) layer appears to be present in few species only, some other species present an intermediary stage of modification between S 2 and G and in some other, fibres do not present any anatomical difference between normal and tension wood. Typical <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibres</b> do not show any evidence of producing a higher stress level than other types of tension wood. From this study, it appears that residual tension strains reach a maximum around 3500 µstrain. The presence of a maximum is discussed; it can be interpreted either as a physical limit in the mechanism generating maturation stress or as a trade-off in order prevent the stem from internal cracks. To increase the bending moment the role of opposite wood has to be taken into account. It can be observed some very low tensile stress value and sometime compression stress value {{on the opposite side of}} tension wood. Measurement of physical properties such as longitudinal shrinkage or ultrastructural features such as MFA have been done in order to prove that these compression values in angiosperms are not artefacts. Finally, few words are presented on another complementary mechanism: the growth eccentricity with the extreme case of buttresses of tropical rain forest trees...|$|R
40|$|Fibre {{crops are}} {{important}} natural resources, as they sustainably provide bast fibres, an economically-valuable raw material {{used in the}} textile and biocomposite sectors. Among fibre crops, textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is appreciated for its long and strong <b>gelatinous</b> bast <b>fibres.</b> The stem of fibre crops is a useful system for cell wall-oriented studies, because it shows a strong tissue polarity with a lignified inner core and a cellulosic hypolignified cortex, {{as well as a}} basipetal lignification gradient. Along the stem axis of fibre crops, a specific region, denoted snap point, marks the transition from elongation (above it) to fibre thickening (below it). After empirically determining the snap point by tilting the plant, we divided the stem segment containing it into three non-overlapping consecutive regions measuring 1 cm each, and carried out targeted RT-qPCR on cell wall-related genes separately, in outer and inner tissues. Different gene clusters can be observed, two of which are the major gene groups, i. e., one group with members expressed at higher levels in the inner tissues, and one group whose genes are more expressed in the cortex. The present results provide a molecular validation that the snap point is characterised by a gradient of events associated with the shift from fibre elongation to thickening...|$|R

For this, usual techniques of light microscopy and scanning electronic microscopy had been used. The three species present uniform structure in the pericarp and in the seed. The fruits are typical legumes and common aspects of the leguminous species have been observed in the pericarp.
