5000|$|The {{direction}} of flow {{in and around}} a separator along with other flow instruments are usually illustrated on the Piping and instrumentation diagram, (P&ID). Some of these flow instruments include the Flow Indicator (FI), <b>Flow</b> <b>Transmitter</b> (FT) and the Flow Controller (FC). Flow {{is of paramount importance}} in {{the oil and gas industry}} because flow, as a major process variable is essentially important in that its understanding helps engineers come up with better designs and enables them to confidently carry out additional research. Mohan et al (1999) [...] carried out a research into the design and development of separators for a three-phase flow system. The purpose of the study was to investigate the complex multiphase hydrodynamic flow behaviour in a three-phase oil and gas separator. A mechanistic model was developed alongside a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulator. These were then used to carry out a detailed experimentation on the three-phase separator. The experimental and CFD simulation results were suitably integrated with the mechanistic model. The simulation time for the experiment was 20 seconds with the oil specific gravity as 0.885, and the separator lower part length and diameter were 4-ft and 3-inches respectively. The first set of experiment became a basis through which detailed investigations were used to carry out and to conduct similar simulation studies for different flow velocities and other operating conditions as well.|$|E
50|$|As earlier stated, flow {{instruments}} that function with the separator in an {{oil and gas}} environment include the flow indicator, <b>flow</b> <b>transmitter</b> and the flow controller. Due to maintenance (which will be discussed later) or due to high usage, these flowmeters do need to be calibrated from time to time. Calibration {{can be defined as}} the process of referencing signals of known quantity that has been predetermined to suit the range of measurements required. Calibration can also be seen from a mathematical point of view in which the flowmeters are standardized by determining the deviation from the predetermined standard so as to ascertain the proper correction factors. In determining the deviation from the predetermined standard, the actual flowrate is usually first determined {{with the use of a}} master meter which is a type of flowmeter that has been calibrated with a high degree of accuracy or by weighing the flow so as to be able to obtain a gravimetric reading of the mass flow. Another type of meter used is the transfer meter. However, according to Ting et al (1989), transfer meters have been proven to be less accurate if the operating conditions are different from its original calibrated points. According to Yoder (2000), the types of flowmeters used as master meters include turbine meters, positive displacement meters, venturi meters, and Coriolis meters. In the U.S., master meters are often calibrated at a flow lab that has been certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST). NIST certification of a flowmeter lab means that its methods have been approved by NIST. Normally, this includes NIST traceability, meaning that the standards used in the flowmeter calibration process have been certified by NIST or are causally linked back to standards that have been approved by NIST. However, there is a general belief in the industry that the second method which involves the gravimetric weighing of the amount of fluid (liquid or gas) that actually flows through the meter into or out of a container during the calibration procedure is the most ideal method for measuring the actual amount of flow. Apparently, the weighing scale used for this method also has to be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well.In ascertaining a proper correction factor, there is often no simple hardware adjustment to make the flowmeter start reading correctly. Instead, the deviation from the correct reading is recorded at a variety of flowrates. The data points are plotted, comparing the flowmeter output to the actual flowrate as determined by the standardized National Institute of Standards and Technology master meter or weigh scale.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of the process sensors that supply real-time data to the safety systems in nuclear power plants (NPP) {{play a vital role}} in preventing plant accidents. If a critical process temperature, pressure, level, or flow experiences a step change, for example, the sensors that measure the process variable must act quickly to actuate the safety systems that will mitigate the consequence of an undesirable process excursion. The research conducted for this dissertation has been performed to ensure the prompt {{response of}} critical sensors by advancing, refining, validating, and implementing new methods for measuring the response time of temperature, pressure, level, and flow sensors in NPP safety systems. The essential significance of the new methods is that they can be performed remotely on installed sensors at operating conditions, thereby providing the actual in-service response time as opposed to the unrealistic response time provided by the manufacturer or by offline testing. The in-situ response time testing technique for temperature sensors is referred to as the Loop Current Step Response (LCSR) test. This technique is based on heating the sensor internally by applying a step change in the DC current to the sensor extension leads in the plant control room. The DC current heats the sensing element of the sensor, resulting in a temperature transient that is then analyzed to provide a true sensor response time, which accounts for all process conditions as well as for the effects of installation and aging. This dissertation presents the theoretical foundation of the LCSR, the details of the author’s extensive experimental research to validate and refine its use in multiple nuclear plant safety applications, and the assumptions that support the validity of the author’s research and experimental results. The in-situ response time testing technique for pressure, level, and <b>flow</b> <b>transmitters</b> is the so-called noise analysis method. This method is based on recording and analyzing the inherent process fluctuations present at the output of transmitters while the plant is operating. These fluctuations (noise) arise from random flux, turbulent flow, random heat transfer, process control action, and vibration. They are separated from the output of the transmitter by signal conditioning, recorded for about an hour, and analyzed in frequency and/or time domain to yield the response time of the pressure sensing system. This dissertation describes the theoretical foundation of the noise analysis technique, the details of the experimental research that the author has conducted for this dissertation to validate and expand the scope of this technique in actual plant applications, and the assumptions informing the author’s confidence that the research in this dissertation validates the noise analysis technique. The significance of the noise analysis technique is that it not only measures the in-service response time of the transmitter but also of its sensing lines. In contrast to other methods, it can thereby account for the effect of sensing-line length, blockages, and voids on sensor response time. As part of this research, both the LCSR and noise analysis techniques were validated through extensive laboratory measurements performed on temperature and pressure sensors of the types used in nuclear power plants. The author has used these results to indicate where these methods are most effective but also where they may pose significant uncertainties or may fail...|$|R
50|$|Conventional neurotransmitters are {{released}} from a ‘presynaptic’ cell and activate appropriate receptors on a ‘postsynaptic’ cell, where presynaptic and postsynaptic designate the sending and receiving sides of a synapse, respectively. Endocannabinoids, on the other hand, are described as retrograde transmitters because they most commonly travel ‘backward’ against the usual synaptic <b>transmitter</b> <b>flow.</b> They are, in effect, released from the postsynaptic cell and act on the presynaptic cell, where the target receptors are densely concentrated on axonal terminals in the zones from which conventional neurotransmitters {{are released}}. Activation of cannabinoid receptors temporarily reduces the amount of conventional neurotransmitter released. This endocannabinoid-mediated system permits the postsynaptic cell to control its own incoming synaptic traffic. The ultimate effect on the endocannabinoid-releasing cell depends {{on the nature of}} the conventional transmitter being controlled. For instance, when the release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA is reduced, the net effect is an increase in the excitability of the endocannabinoid-releasing cell. On the converse, when release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is reduced, the net effect is a decrease in the excitability of the endocannabinoid-releasing cell.|$|R

This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} simulation of an LVDS transceiver intended {{to be used in}} serial AER links. Traditional implementations of LVDS serial interfaces require a continuous data <b>flow</b> between the <b>transmitter</b> and the receiver to keep the synchronization. However, the serial AER-LVDS interface proposed in [2] operates in a burst mode, having long times of silence without data transmission. This can be used to reduce the power consumption by switching off the LVDS circuitry during the pauses. Moreover, a fast recovery time after pauses must be achieved to not slow down the interface operation. The transceiver was designed in a 90 nm technology.

The system is equipped with: regenerator bypass on the raw regenerator to allow {{for control of the}} temperature out of the regenerator and cascade hot water to heater product out temperature control to control the feed temperature to the MST inlet. The product is then fed to the inlet nozzle or nozzles of the MST chamber at a controlled pressure (pressure =  800, 000  Pa). Milk droplets are sprayed into the unit, at which time the milk is then heated to temperature within 0.02  s, which establishes the desired effect. The internal temperature of the MST unit is controlled by the cascade temperature control of hot water to internal temperature. This temperature is controlled at a value 10  °C higher than the inlet temperature. The lower jacket is cooled to prevent further heat treatment of the droplets collecting {{on the bottom of the}} MST Chamber. The discharge pump from the MST chamber controls a minimum level in the discharge leg of the MST chamber, and acts as the motive force to push through the downstream pasteurized regenerator and cooling sections of the process, and finally discharged to the destination. The system is controlled for circulation of water, water to product change-over, product discharge, product to water change-over, and clean-in-place (CIP) cycles. The milk is then cooled to 4  °C and expelled from the processor.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} available techniques and develop a methodology for the fault detection and diagnostics for two engineering systems, namely railway point systems (RPS) and three-phase separators (TPS). The fault detection of the RPS {{was performed on the}} measured current from the motor of point operating equipment (POE). The method of One Class Support Vector Machines has been chosen as the fault detection model. Elastic similarity measures, such as edit distance with real penalties and dynamic time warping, were chosen to compare the data of POE operations. A combination of Euclidean distance and elastic similarity measures has been proposed in order {{to take into account the}} absolute values and shape properties of the two compared time series. The proposed methodology has been tested on the in-field RPS data. The results indicated that the fault detection model was able to detect abnormal values and/or shape of the time series of measured current. However, not in all cases these changes could be related to a recorded failure of RPS in the database. The fault detection of TPS was performed given the sensor readings of <b>flow</b> and level <b>transmitters</b> of TPS. The method of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) has been proposed to overcome the late detection of faults with the threshold based alarm technique. An approach to observe sensor readings of TPS in several adjacent time intervals and to update the prior probabilities in the BBN after inserting the sensor readings as evidence was proposed. The proposed methodology has been tested on the data obtained from a TPS simulation model.

40|$|There is the {{existence}} of two main modes of intercellular communication in the Central Nervous System (CNS) : the wiring transmission (WT), the prototype being synaptic transmission and the volume transmission (VT). A novel type of WT, the tunneling nanotube type may exist. VT uses the extracellular space (ECS) and the ventricular system as important channels for chemical transmission in the CNS complementary toWTwith diffusion and <b>flow</b> of <b>transmitters,</b> ions, trophic factors, etc. in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A short distance type (extrasynaptic transmission) and a long distance type of VT including the CSF type are found together with an extracellular vesicle mediated VT, called a roamer type of VT. Via the latter subtype several messages are sent via extracellular vesicles, mainly exosomes, containing selected mRNAs and miRNAs, proteins and lipids. They are released into the ECS and diffuse and flow until the proper targets are reached. The intrinsic features of exosomes allow their specific interaction with the appropriate target cells. They roam from cell to cell to disseminate important information but can also transfer pathologically altered proteins (e. g. toxic oligomers of amyloid beta and of alphasynuclein) contributing to spread of neurodegeneration. The balance and integration of synaptic and VT signals are achieved to a substantial degree via allosteric receptor– receptor interactions in GPCR-GPCR heteroreceptor complexes and especially ion-channel receptor-GPCR heteroreceptor complexes in the plasma membrane of synaptic and extrasynaptic regions. Disturbances in these receptor–receptor interactions by mild enkephalitis may contribute to development of schizophrenia, since many NMDA, GABA, D 2 and 5 -HT 2 A receptors are protomers in heteroreceptor complexes and are also known targets for antipsychotic drugs. The hypothesis is that in neuroinflammation glial microvesicles (extracellular vesicles) may be released which contain chemokine and cytokine receptors. The extracellular vesicles can be internalized into surrounding neurons via cell adhesion receptors. In view of the bioinformatic results obtained based on the triplet puzzle theory, immune receptors CXCR 4, CCR 2 and IL 1 R 2 may form heteroreceptor complexes with neuronal NMDA, GABAA and GABAB receptors which involves the triplet homologies ITL, SVS, VST, GLL, LYS, and YSG. They appear {{to be part of}} the interface of these human heteroreceptor complexes built up of neural and immune receptor protomers. Through the allosteric receptor–receptor interactions in such postulated pathological heteroreceptor complexes the neuronal NMDA, GABAA and GABAB protomers may change their function in neuronal networks of the brain. This process can then contribute to positive, negative and/or cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia in line with the mild encephalitis hypothesis of schizophrenia. The glially derived kynurenines via VT participate in an important way in this integration of signals especially in the glutamate synapses and are altered in schizophrenia potentially related to mild neuroinflammation...|$|R
30|$|Recent {{and rapid}} {{progress}} in {{information and communication}} technology has exceeded our expectations for meeting the requirements of multimedia society in the twenty-first century. Free-space optical communication (FSOC) {{is considered to be}} one of the key technologies for realizing very high speed multigigabit per second (multi-Gb/s) large-capacity terrestrial and aerospace communications [1, 2]. The FSOC system provides a line of sight (LoS), wireless and high-bandwidth communication between remote sites. The FSOC system offers many transmission advantages including freedom from electromagnetic interference (EMI) and license or tariffs, flexibility, ease in installment, no need to dig up roads, last-mile access, service acceleration, metro network extensions, enterprise connectivity, fiber backup, backhaul, and high security [3, 4]. In addition, a photonics-based approach is expected to bring such ultra-high data rate wireless technologies to potential users and to meet and explore real-world applications at the earliest opportunity as a technology driver [5]. However, the propagating optical wave is influenced in the FSOC channel by random atmospheric changes (wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and pressure) [6], thermal expansion, weak earthquakes, and typical high-rise building sways which result in decreasing the average received power, increasing the bit error rate (BER), and severely degrading the communication link quality/reliability [7 – 9]. These are all the general problems that require attenuation to be dealt with. The major effects due to the random fluctuations of the atmospheric turbulence are (i) optical scattering and observation (characterized by atmospheric attenuation); (ii) random optical power fluctuation (characterized by scintillation index); (iii) beam wandering, i.e., beam surface global (temporal) tilt due to beam centroid displacement on the detector plane (characterized by effective scintillation index); and (iv) wavefront distortions, i.e., beam surface (spatial) local tilt (characterized by the Zernike polynomials) [10 – 12]. The conventional data coding and/or modulation techniques can be used to equalize/compromise the first two effects with respect to weather conditions at a given instant of time [13, 14]. The third and fourth effects cannot be compromised without incorporating the adaptive optics elements [15, 16]. During data transmission, the angle between the transmitter-receiver LoS and the transmitting beam axis must be kept within a fraction of the transmitting beamwidth which may be as small as a few microradians. The increase in the transmitting beam divergence angle/diameter is one way to maintain the link between the transmitter and receiver. It is clear that an overly wider beam will increase the required laser power, which increases the terminal cost and complexity. On the other hand, an overly narrow beam may result in a cutoff of the communication when there is building sway and/or beam wandering [2, 3, 7, 8]. The existence of a perfect LoS and continuous beam alignment between the communicating optical antennas is one of the key requirements for a successful installation of an FSOC system. To ensure an uninterrupted data <b>flow,</b> auto-alignment <b>transmitter</b> and receiver modules are necessary [12, 17, 18]. The data loss due to weak scintillation effects can be recovered using various data coding techniques developed for wire- and fiber-based communication systems [13, 14]. In contest, beam wandering and deep signal fading (wavefront distortions) represent unique and significantly more challenging problems, which cannot be resolved using conventional data coding techniques, and a major incentive for the incorporation of adaptive optics technology (beam wandering mitigation and wavefront corrections) into the FSOC architecture is an active prevention of long-term data loss [12, 15, 16]. The first and most important requirement for the successful installation of FSOC is beam steering (reduction of focal spot wander) that mitigates the beam wandering (temporal distortions) [1, 16 – 18] which is the research component and main contribution in this work.|$|R
