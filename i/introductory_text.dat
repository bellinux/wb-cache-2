According to Rajinikanth's biographer Naman Ramachandran, the film was also made to commemorate the 100thbirth anniversary of the production company's founder, A. V. Meiyappan.

25|$|By early 1992, {{the search}} was on for a good byte stream {{encoding}} of multi-byte character sets. The draft ISO 10646 standard contained a non-required annex called UTF-1 that provided a byte stream encoding of its 32-bit code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably {{that it did not}} have a clear separation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or extended ASCII), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range 0x21–0x7E that meant something else in ASCII, e.g., 0x2F for '/', the Unix path directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name and <b>introductory</b> <b>text</b> of its replacement.

500|$|Harrison drew {{inspiration}} for his lyrics from [...] "The Transformation: Dr. Richard Alpert, PhD. into Baba Ram Dass". A humorous story, [...] "The Transformation" [...] {{was the first}} of four sections in Ram Dass's book Be Here Now, a popular <b>introductory</b> <b>text</b> to Hindu spirituality. As Richard Alpert, Dass had been a Harvard academic and an associate of Timothy Leary during the early 1960s, before embracing Hinduism – like Harrison in 1966, via experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs – and changing his name. Before the book's publication in 1971, according to musicologist Ian MacDonald, the phrase [...] "Be here now" [...] had become a [...] "hippie maxim", reflecting a fundamental contention of Hindu philosophy regarding the all-importance of the present moment. For Harrison, the present meant his identity outside the public's perception of him as a Beatle, a role he had already tired of in 1965–66, {{during the height of the}} band's fame.|$|E
