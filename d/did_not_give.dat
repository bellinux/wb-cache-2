On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> Adams a name, only calling it “a very high humped mountain”.

Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers' shell casings were removed from the scene (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers were standing when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the casings, one for fear that they might be stolen and the other on the orders of a superior. Statements from other police and military witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>give</b> the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E
