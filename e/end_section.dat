40|$|Experimental {{study of}} bearing {{capacity}} of samples of two series performed by semiautomatic welding in CO 2 on the axis, and by robotic welding machine in mixture (CO 2 + Ar), is presented. Welds of constant cross section, welds with extended leg on <b>end</b> <b>sections,</b> and welds {{in the form}} of two dowels on <b>end</b> <b>sections</b> were performed. Efficiency of pilot samples of the first series (with extended leg on <b>end</b> <b>sections</b> by way of a smooth transition) defined by the ratio of weld metal volume to a crushing load reaches 28 % relative to samples with a leg constant as per length. Samples of the first series with an extended leg on <b>end</b> <b>sections</b> also showed efficiency increased to 17 %. According to the second series samples test results, the exceeding of bearing capacity of the samples performed with an extended leg on <b>end</b> <b>sections</b> by 24 % in comparison with the samples with a leg of constant cross section was determined. Samples of the second series performed {{in the form of}} two dowels on <b>end</b> <b>sections</b> demonstrated the exceeding of the relative bearing capacity by 42 % in comparison with the samples with a continuous leg of constant cross-section...|$|R

25|$|In London in June 1866, a {{localized}} {{epidemic in}} the East End claimed 5,596 lives, {{just as the}} city was completing construction of its major sewage and water treatment systems (see London sewerage system); the East <b>End</b> <b>section</b> was not quite complete. Epidemiologist William Farr identified the East London Water Company {{as the source of}} the contamination. Farr made use of prior work by John Snow and others pointing to contaminated drinking water as the likely cause of cholera in an 1854 outbreak. Quick action prevented further deaths. In the same year, the use of contaminated canal water in local water works caused a minor outbreak at Ystalyfera in South Wales. Workers associated with the company and their families were most affected, and 119 died.|$|E

25|$|The {{valley of}} Levers Water Beck below Brim Fell holds {{part of the}} Coniston Coppermines, a huge complex of shafts and tunnels {{extending}} over a square mile. The mine was at its most productive in the 1850s, declining in output until closure in 1915. Since then there have been occasional attempts at reopening, principally in 1954, but tourism has gradually taken over as the main activity in the valley. The mines exploited a number of veins, the copper-bearing mineral chalcopyrite being the main ore, although some nickel, cobalt and lead were also extracted. The Paddy <b>End</b> <b>section</b> of the mine on the lower slopes of Brim Fell was the most productive, with levels passing beneath the bed of Levers Water. Simons Nick, a large (and dangerous) multi-shaft opening above the dam is the most obvious remaining feature.|$|E
25|$|The Newark Light Rail {{system uses}} a new-model vehicle built by Kinki Sharyo of Japan. This vehicle, {{the same one}} used by the HBLR system, is a double-articulated vehicle with three {{sections}}. Each of the two end sections has an operator's cab at the far end, thus {{eliminating the need for}} the vehicle to turn itself around physically in order to reverse direction. Each <b>end</b> <b>section</b> also has seating for 16 passengers on an upper level, and seating for 13 passengers on the lower level, including one special fold-down seat next to an empty space that a passenger using a wheelchair may use. With these two sections, and a middle section that seats ten passengers (five on each side), the vehicle can comfortably accommodate 68 seated passengers and two wheelchairs. An additional 122 passengers could stand in the vehicle, if necessary. Vehicles can be coupled into two-unit sets. A contract to expand 10 of the 20 LRVs assigned to the Newark Light Rail system for the purpose of increasing passenger capacity was approved on July 9, 2014.|$|E

In this work an LMS-based algorithm based on smooth transition bands (at the end of the near end and at the beginning of the far <b>end</b> <b>sections)</b> is proposed to overcome the above problem.

500|$|The {{first major}} storm {{to strike the}} region in 40 years, Hurricane Eloise did not {{directly}} kill anyone {{in the state of}} Florida. However, four deaths of an indirect nature were attributed to the hurricane; two of them were related to heart attacks. Numerous people sustained injuries, largely from broken glass or cleanup efforts. Overall property damage from the storm in Florida amounted to $150 million. In the storm's aftermath, a study of the hurricane's effect on aquatic animals living in the swash zone (the immediate area where land and the ocean meet) of Panama City Beach was conducted. The study concluded that compared to 11 consecutive months of data prior to the storm, the swash zone experienced a brief influx of animal species normally found offshore. However, the number decreased to near normal shortly thereafter. Also along the shore, the hurricane dismantled or severely impaired several piers, including the total destruction of a [...] extension of the Okaloosa Island Pier built just three years earlier and part of its original span. A fishing pier at St. Andrews State Park also suffered vast damage, along with another wooden pier at Mexico Beach and the M.B.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of European Industrial Training [© Emerald]. The definitive version is available at: www. emeraldinsight. com/ 0309 - 0590. htm. Purpose - This study examines participant’s response rate on dual style training course evaluation forms. These combine structured and open ended formats. Pencil and paper forms {{have a long history of}} use by trainers in business and commerce and more recently in education. Research methods texts tend to have neglected the issue of response rates with this type of form. Design/methodology/approach - Approximately 2000 course participants attending 28 courses completed evaluation forms. These were designed with a series of structured responses scales followed by a <b>section</b> for open <b>ended</b> comments. Findings – It was found the completion rate for the open <b>ended</b> <b>sections</b> was low and thus validity was suspect. Various explanations were offered for this. Subsequently when a redesigned evaluation form was administered to a further 1641 course participants it was found response rates increased dramatically when open <b>ended</b> <b>sections</b> were placed earlier in the questionnaire. Practical implications – Indicates ways in which course evaluation forms can be redesigned to increase response rates for open <b>ended</b> <b>sections</b> and thus improve the validity of any findings. Originality/value – Provides information about response rates neglected by most methodology texts concerning the design of training evaluation questionnaires which include open <b>ended</b> <b>sections...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1971, {{construction}} {{began on}} the new Fleet line. Economic pressure and doubt over the final destination of the line had led to a staged approach. Under the first stage, the Baker Street-to-Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line was joined at Baker Street to a new [...] segment into central London, with intermediate stops at Bond Street and Green Park and terminating at a new station at Charing Cross, thereby relieving pressure on the West <b>End</b> <b>section</b> of the Bakerloo line between Baker Street and Charing Cross and also allowing increased frequencies on the section north of Baker Street. The new tube was to offer cross-platform interchange between the Bakerloo and Fleet at Baker Street, as pioneered on the Victoria line. The work was completed in 1979. As part of the works, Trafalgar Square (Bakerloo) and Strand (Northern) stations were combined into a single station complex, Charing Cross.
