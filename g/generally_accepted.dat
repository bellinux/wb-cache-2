5|$|In 1897, Hoffmann {{started working}} {{to find a}} less irritating {{substitute}} for salicylic acid. It is <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> that he turned to this idea because his father was suffering {{the side effects of}} taking sodium salicylate for rheumatism.|$|E

5|$|Intermediate birds occur {{where the}} {{recognised}} forms meet and interbreed, and have sometimes been given subspecies status, including S. b. kreczmeri in Poland and S. b. pateffi in Bulgaria, {{but these are}} not <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> as valid taxa.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> that Sai Baba {{stayed in}} Shirdi for three years, {{disappeared}} for a year, and returned permanently around 1858, which suggests a birth year of 1838.|$|E
5|$|Once {{spacecraft}} {{visited the}} planet during NASA's Mariner missions in the 1960s and 70s, these concepts were radically broken.

5|$|According to Diodorus, the Macedonian army {{numbered}} roughly 30,000 {{infantry and}} 2,000 cavalry, a figure <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> by modern historians. Philip took {{command of the}} right wing of the Macedonian army and placed his 18-year-old son Alexander (the future conqueror of the Persian Empire) in command of the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip's experienced generals.|$|E
5|$|Antlions {{are poorly}} {{represented}} in the fossil record. Myrmeleontiformia is <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> to be a monophyletic group, and within the Myrmeleontoidea, the antlions' closest living relatives {{are thought to be}} the owlflies (Ascalaphidae). The predatory actions of the larvae have attracted attention throughout history, and antlions have been mentioned in literature since classical times.|$|E

5|$|Descendants of the mutineers {{and their}} Tahitian consorts live on Pitcairn into the 21st century. The <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> view of Bligh as an {{overbearing}} monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, {{as depicted in}} well-known film accounts, has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a more sympathetic picture of Bligh, and a more critical one of Christian, has emerged.|$|E
5|$|If Malcolm {{exercised}} {{control over}} Moray, {{which is far}} from being <b>generally</b> <b>accepted,</b> then the annals record a number of events pointing to a struggle for power in the north. In 1020, Mac Bethad's father Findláech mac Ruaidrí was killed by the sons of his brother Máel Brigte. It seems that Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti took control of Moray, for his death is reported in 1029.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to stories {{of gender and}} sexual variance that are <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> by mainstream Hinduism, modern scholars and queer activists have highlighted LGBT themes in lesser known texts, or inferred them from stories that traditionally are considered to have no homoerotic subtext. Such analyses have caused disagreements about {{the true meaning of}} the ancient stories.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} the victory of Michael III over the Rus' was invented by the Byzantine historians in the mid-9th century or later and became <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> in the Slavic chronicles {{influenced}} by them. However, {{the memory of the}} successful campaign was transmitted orally among the Kievans and may have dictated Nestor's account of Oleg's 907 campaign, which is not recorded in Byzantine sources at all.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> {{by historians}} that, {{although}} Otto failed, he deeply loved Greece {{as his own}} new homeland. His failure was mainly {{a result of the}} continuous intrigues and competition among the three Great Powers. Before his death, Otto asked to be buried in his own Greek traditional uniform.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} {{thought that the}} dust was {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster, but at the age of about 100 million years <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> for the cluster, almost all the dust originally present would have been dispersed by radiation pressure. Instead, it seems that the cluster is simply passing through a particularly dusty region of the interstellar medium.|$|E

5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subspecies}} of the goldcrest {{have been}} described. In continental Eurasia, {{there are nine}} <b>generally</b> <b>accepted</b> and very similar subspecies, differing only in details such as plumage shade. At the genetic level, the two Central Asian forms, R. r. sikkimensis and R. r. himalayensis, {{are very close to}} each other, and have differentiated only in the recent past, but they diverged from the western subspecies around 2.8mya.|$|E
5|$|The 1592 date {{remained}} the established one until the 19th century.
