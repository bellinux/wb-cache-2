50|$|The actual {{reason is}} {{probably}} {{that the lack}} of major salt deposits in the area favored the drying process for the preservation of whitefish - a process known for millennia. Stockfish is very nutrient-rich, and one can assume that it was also consumed domestically, although it was during the boom in the stockfish trade in the late Middle Ages, the product became accessible throughout Scandinavia, as well as the rest of Europe. The higher quality stockfish would be soaked in water, then boiled and eaten with melted butter. Lower grade qualities would be harder and more <b>fuel</b> <b>consuming</b> to boil and {{it has been suggested that}} adding ash from beech or birch in the boiling water, would break down the protein chains and speed up the process.

30|$|Fires (natural and prescribed) can {{drastically}} modify {{ecosystem function}} by affecting soil nutrients, microbial activity and community, {{and the global}} carbon (C) balance. The extent to which an ecosystem is modified (post fire) is controlled largely by fire intensity, severity, and type. Fire intensity (reaction intensity) {{is defined as the}} rate of energy release by the combustion of fuels over a given area (kW m− 2), whereas fire severity is a measure of above- and belowground biomass change. Fire type defines the strata of fuel through which typical fires burn. In the case of gramminoid- and shrub-dominated wetland ecosystems, fire commonly moves through the densely spaced, continuous fine surface <b>fuels,</b> <b>consuming</b> the majority of biomass above the surface level of the water. These three factors, along with post-fire climate, area burned, and additional disturbance, dictate the ecosystem response (Keeley 2009) and are crucial when evaluating and predicting fire effects.|$|R

50|$|Fuel hedging is a {{contractual}} tool {{some large}} <b>fuel</b> <b>consuming</b> companies, such as airlines, cruise lines and trucking companies, use {{to reduce their}} exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. A fuel hedge contract is a futures contract that allows a fuel-consuming company to establish a fixed or capped cost, via a commodity swap or option. The companies enter into hedging contracts to mitigate their exposure to future fuel prices that may be higher than current prices and/or to establish a known fuel cost for budgeting purposes. If such a company buys a fuel swap {{and the price of}} fuel declines, the company will effectively be forced to pay an above-market rate for fuel. If the company buys a fuel call option and the price of fuel increases, the company will receive a return on the option that offsets their actual cost of fuel. If the company buys a fuel call option, which requires an upfront premium cost, much like insurance, and the price of fuel decreases, the company will not receive a return on the option but they will benefit from buying fuel at the then-lower cost.|$|E

40|$|The inland goods {{transportation}} {{sector has}} become dominant by high <b>fuel</b> <b>consuming</b> heavy goods vehicles, {{which are more}} commonly known as truck-trailer units.

Furthermore, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based techniques have been employed to analyse the aerodynamic performance of the truck–trailer unit.

The load computed can then be used to control the traffic signals. The main purpose of the developed algorithm is to compute total traffic load at a particular junction, which is then further used for real time traffic control by generating green light timing of the traffic signal.
