5000|$|... == Transfer of {{bacterial}} chromosome by Hfr cells == An Hfr cell can transfer {{a portion of}} the bacterial genome. Despite being integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the bacteria, the <b>F</b> <b>factor</b> of Hfr cells can still initiate conjugative transfer, without being excised from the bacterial chromosome first. Due to the F factor's inherent tendency to transfer itself during conjugation, the rest of the bacterial genome is dragged along with it. Therefore, unlike a normal F+ cell, Hfr strains will attempt to transfer their entire DNA through the mating bridge, in a fashion similar to the normal conjugation. Interestingly, in a typical conjugation, the recipient cell also becomes F+ after conjugation as it receives an entire copy of the <b>F</b> <b>factor</b> plasmid; {{but this is not the}} case in conjugation mediated by Hfr cells. Due to the large size {{of bacterial}} chromosome, it is very rare for the entire chromosome to be transferred into the F − cell as time required is simply too long for the cells to maintain their physical contact. Therefore, as the conjugative transfer is not complete (the circular nature of plasmid and bacterial chromosome requires complete transfer for the <b>F</b> <b>factor</b> to be transferred as it may be cut in the middle), the recipient − cells do not receive the complete <b>F</b> <b>factor</b> sequence, and do not become F + due to its inability to form a sex pilus.|$|E
30|$|Steinmetz et al.

He also proved that the <b>F</b> 2 <b>factor</b> correlates with adaptability. He reasoned this by the fact this reply is closer to the way how people “think” or how they negotiate with an unstable environment (situations). A higher personal need for structure may represent lower adaptability and flexibility. Stranovská et al. (2013) proved a negative relationship between need for structure and verbal intelligence.|$|R
40|$|A three {{dimensional}} (3 D) computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation and a neural network model are presented to estimate the behaviors of the Colburn factor (j) and the Fanning friction <b>factor</b> (<b>f)</b> for wavy fin - and - flat tube (WFFT) heat exchangers. Effects of the five geometrical factors of fin pitch, fin height, fin length, fin thickness, and wavy amplitude are investigated {{over a wide range}} of Reynolds number (600 <Re< 7000). The CFD simulation results express that the geometrical parameters of wavy fins have significant effects on the j and <b>f</b> <b>factors</b> as a function of Reynolds number. The computational results have an adequate accuracy when compared to experimental data. The accuracy of the calculations of the j and <b>f</b> <b>factors</b> are evaluated by the values of the absolute average relative deviation (AARD), being respectively 3. 8 % and 8. 2 % for the CFD simulation and 1. 3 % and 1 % for the neural network model.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{effective}} elimination of drug resistance (R) and sex (<b>F)</b> <b>factors</b> in Escherichia coli K- 12 strains by treatment with {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) is presented. Growth of E. coli harboring R or <b>F</b> <b>factors</b> in Penassay Broth containing SDS led {{to the loss of}} all or part of these genetic elements. Appearance of drug-susceptible or F− cells among survivors was observed after the culture reached the stationary phase. Drug-susceptible cells which had lost all of their resistance markers by SDS treatment could be efficiently infected with R or <b>F</b> <b>factors.</b> Among isolated segregants which came from resistant cells, tetracycline-susceptible cells were the major segregant class. Drug-susceptible cells gave no revertants to drug resistance. By treatment of F+ cells with SDS, unusual F+ cells which retained mating ability but showed resistance to M 12 phage were also isolated, together with mutants of another type which lost mating ability but retained sensitivity to M 12 phage. Since SDS is more toxic to R+ cells than R− cells, the isolation of drug-susceptible or F− cells under these conditions may be partly attributable to selective growth of drug-susceptible or F− cells in SDS-Penassay Broth...|$|R
50|$|In {{conjugation}} {{mediated by}} Hfr cells, transfer of DNA {{starts at the}} origin of transfer (oriT) located within the <b>F</b> <b>factor</b> and then continues clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the orientation of <b>F</b> <b>factor</b> in the chromosome. Therefore, the length of chromosomal DNA transferred into the F− cell {{is proportional to the}} time that conjugation is allowed to happen. This results in sequential transfer of genes on the bacterial chromosome. Bacterial geneticists make use of this principle to map the genes on the bacterial chromosome. This technique is called interrupted mating as geneticists allow conjugation to take place for different periods of time before stopping conjugation with a high-speed blender. By using Hfr and F− strains with one strain carrying mutations in several genes, each affecting a metabolic function or causing antibiotic resistance, and examining the phenotype of the recipient cells on selective agar plates, one can deduce which genes are transferred into the recipient cells first and therefore are closer to the oriT sequence on the chromosome.|$|E

50|$|Bacterial {{artificial}} chromosomes (BACs) are circular DNA molecules, {{usually about}} 7kb in length, that {{are capable of}} holding inserts up to 300kb in size. BAC vectors contain a replicon derived from E. coli <b>F</b> <b>factor,</b> which ensures they are maintained at one copy per cell. Once an insert is ligated into a BAC, the BAC is introduced into recombination deficient strains of E. coli by electroporation. Most BAC vectors contain a gene for antibiotic resistance and also a positive selection marker. The figure to the right depicts a BAC vector being cut with a restriction enzyme, followed by the insertion of foreign DNA that is re-annealed by a ligase. Overall, this is a very stable vector, but they may be hard to prepare due to a single origin of replication just like PACs.|$|E
50|$|The {{fertility}} plasmid or F-plasmid {{was discovered}} by Esther Lederberg and encodes information for the biosynthesis of sex pilus to aid in bacterial conjugation. Conjugation involves using the sex pilus to form a bridge between two bacteria cells; the bridge allows the F+ cell to transfer a single-stranded copy of the plasmid so that both cells contain {{a copy of the}} plasmid. On the way into the recipient cell, the corresponding DNA strand is synthesized by the recipient. The donor cell maintains a functional copy of the plasmid. It later was discovered that the <b>F</b> <b>factor</b> was the first episome and can exist as an independent plasmid making it a very stable vector for cloning. Conjugation aids in the formation of bacterial clone libraries by ensuring all cells contain the desired fosmid.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} how merozygotes can be formed is the {{transfer}} of genetic materialof an Hfr cell to an F- cell through conjugation. When an Hfr cell mates with an F- cell, the chromosome acts as a rolling circle transferring a part of its genomic chromosome across a conjugation bridge. The origin is the first bit of the DNA to be injected, while the F-factor is the last. Very rarely the whole portion of the DNA (from the origin through the F-factor) will be transferred, resulting in a very low chance of passing on the <b>F</b> <b>factor</b> to the F- cell. After conjugation, the F- cell will contain {{a part of the}} Hfr chromosome, the exogenote, as well as its own genomic chromosome, the endogenote. At this stage the cell is called a merozygote. This temporary partial diploid state may lead to recombination between the corresponding portions of the DNA, so that the genetic material of the donor may be incorporated into the chromosome of the recipient, thereby altering the genotype of the recipient. However, if no recombination occurs, the linear fragment of donor DNA in the recipient cytoplasm will be lost after one cycle. These merozygotes help to study dominance variation and mutation can be known.|$|E

40|$|The {{spatial pattern}} of {{transcription}} factor (TF) binding {{and the level}} of TF occupancy at individual sites across the genome determine how a TF regulates its targets. Consequently, predicting the location and level of TF binding genome-wide is of great importance and has received much attention recently. Protein-binding microarray (PBM) technology has become the golden standard for studying TF-DNA interactions in vitro, while Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by DNA Sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the standard method for inferring TF binding in vivo. However, direct interpretation of in vitro results in an in vivo context is challenging and to-date remains scarce. In this study, we focus on the E 2 F family of paralogous TFs, whose mode of binding to DNA has been controversial. Previous studies have shown that E 2 <b>F</b> <b>factors</b> bind to the TTTSSCGCG motif, where S can be a C or a G. Still, {{only a small fraction of}} in vivo targets are reported to contain this motif, hinting at indirect recruitment of the protein. We observed that genomic occupancy of E 2 <b>F</b> <b>factors</b> directly correlates with their in vitro binding affinities. By using data from universal PBM experiments, we show that E 2 <b>F</b> <b>factors</b> likely bind to DNA through direct sequence recognition and not through cofactor interaction. Furthermore, we developed a kinetic binding model using the PBM data to describe competition between different members of the E 2 F family and successfully distinguished between their unique targets. Overall, these results demonstrate how the straightforward and simple in vitro PBM experiments can be used for inferring the complex in vivo landscape of TF binding and elucidate the mechanism of E 2 F-DNA interaction.
