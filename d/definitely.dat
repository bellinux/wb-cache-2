5|$|One Devon manufacturer, <b>Definitely</b> Devon was {{purchased}} by Robert Wiseman Dairies in March 2006, closing {{one of the two}} Devon dairies and moving all production to Okehampton. However, in 2011 Robert Wiseman sold the <b>Definitely</b> Devon Brand to Rodda's, who moved the production of <b>Definitely</b> Devon to Cornwall, which caused some controversy as the name was not changed, prompting an investigation by Trading Standards.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February 2014, Noel via the band's {{official}} website {{announced that the}} first three studio albums would be reissued, remastered and re-released throughout the remainder of 2014 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of <b>Definitely</b> Maybe. A remastered 3-disc version of <b>Definitely</b> Maybe was released on 19 May 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Scots Pine and Common Juniper are {{the only}} {{coniferous}} trees <b>definitely</b> native to Scotland with Yew a possible contender.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher {{has said}} that he used only 100-watt Marshalls early in his career. After <b>Definitely</b> Maybe, he began using smaller amps, {{singling}} out Fenders (Princeton and Bandmaster), and also a combo made by Clark Amplification, which builds amplifiers based on vintage Fender and Marshall amps.|$|E
5|$|Richard Romanus as Vinnie Genzianna, {{leader of}} the Stompers. A cool, stylish young man. Though he <b>definitely</b> has his problems, he does seem to care about those he is close to and at least tries {{to be strong and}} respectful.|$|E
5|$|The Castrum Maris {{was built}} {{sometime}} in the Middle Ages. The castle <b>definitely</b> existed by the 13th century, and it {{was involved in the}} Battle of Malta of 1283. By the early 16th century, it belonged to the de Nava family.|$|E
5|$|We love, obviously, to do provocative imagery... {{we always}} try to <b>definitely</b> push the limits... I think because, in the end, it's not really at all about {{domestic}} violence. It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that <b>definitely</b> plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E
5|$|African-American {{history and}} culture scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was a {{consultant}} on the film, and researcher David Fiske, co-author of Solomon Northup: The Complete Story of the Author of Twelve Years a Slave, provided some material used to market the film. Nevertheless, news and magazine articles {{around the time of}} the film's release described a scholar alleging some license that Northup could have taken with his book, and liberties that McQueen <b>definitely</b> took with Northup's original, for dramatic, modernizing, or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (<b>definitely</b> one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed {{on the basis of}} his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not <b>definitely</b> propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
5|$|By 1241, the Gran Castello or Cittadella on Gozo was <b>definitely</b> fortified, {{although}} a settlement {{on the hill}} had existed since the Bronze Age. The city's fortifications were improved over the years, and the northern walls {{of the city that}} still stand today were built around the 15th century by the Crown of Aragon.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{remained}} in Washington {{for a few}} weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, {{and by the time he}} <b>definitely</b> determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, at age 12, he {{impressed}} former football manager Lars Tjærnås {{during a}} nationwide tournament for under-16s: The best 15-year-olds {{in the country}} were gathered for a tournament between the top clubs... It was <b>definitely</b> {{not the first time}} he had astonished his opponents or the spectators. He was three or four years younger than the others. It was impossible not to realize that we were witnessing something out of the ordinary.|$|E
5|$|In March 1950 the {{municipality}} decided <b>definitely</b> {{to close the}} tramway, but its actual closure came somewhat later. It was not until Saturday, 28 February 1953 that the last tram ran on the Champ de Courses line, 76 years after the network's first service. But the Rouennaise did not forget the tram's services rendered, organising a first-class funeral: Just before the last scheduled run, a parade of honour made up of three trams ran from the Hôtel de ville to the Trianon depot, cheered by the crowds.|$|E
5|$|In the manga, at 16 years old, Mikako sends {{a message}} to 25 years old Noboru, telling him that she loves him. By this time, Noboru has joined the UN, which has {{launched}} a rescue mission for the Lysithea. When Mikako hears that the UN is sending help for their rescue, she consults a list of people on the mission, and finds that Noboru is among them. The manga ends with Mikako saying that they will <b>definitely</b> meet again.|$|E
5|$|It {{had a big}} impact. He was a {{founding}} member and really created the vocal style we are known for. Just felt like part of the band died too. Like when he died, it was just weird to think about doing shows or recording without him around, {{even if he was}} no longer in the band. He was a good person and <b>definitely</b> deserves to be remembered.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And <b>definitely</b> when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man {{standing}} there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|MacPhee had {{material}} of Plesiorycteropus from twelve sites in central, western, and southern Madagascar. It and other recently extinct Madagascar mammals may {{have lived in}} and near wetlands. P.madagascariensis is known from sites throughout this range, but P.germainepetterae has only been <b>definitely</b> recorded from the center; small bones from southern sites may also belong to it. Thus, the two species apparently had widely overlapping ranges.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and <b>definitely</b> not strong enough to break human skin.|$|E
5|$|More of Rupert's cavalry {{arrived at}} York to gain {{touch with the}} garrison. With York <b>definitely</b> relieved, Newcastle sent Rupert a fulsome letter of welcome and congratulations. Rupert replied, not in person but through Goring, with a {{peremptory}} demand for Newcastle to march his forces to Rupert's assistance on the following morning.|$|E
5|$|On 8 July 2009, Costa {{was sold}} to Real Valladolid {{as part of the}} deal that sent goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo in the {{opposite}} direction, with the transfer including a €1million buy-back option that could be activated by Atlético at the end of the season. García Pitarch confessed that there was a verbal agreement that Costa would <b>definitely</b> return at the end of the campaign, and that the deal had been made to look permanent in order to give Costa more commitment to his new club.|$|E
5|$|Once {{you hear}} the song 'Fighting Temptation', and all the music in this film, you can't help but {{fall in love with}} it. You'll <b>definitely</b> get emotional. You might become happy or even sad, but your heart will get full. All the songs are {{touching}} and spiritual, and that's what the movie itself is like.|$|E
5|$|One of Celtic's most {{important}} players, striker Joe McBride was {{to miss the}} match. He had suffered a long-term knee injury and his last match of the season was on 24 December 1966. McBride would <b>definitely</b> have played had he been fit. He was in such good form for Celtic that, despite missing half the season, McBride finished as the top scorer in Scotland that year with 35 goals in 26 appearances.|$|E
5|$|The {{etymology}} of Buffalo Creek is unknown. No buffalo {{have ever}} been <b>definitely</b> observed on the creek, although there are rumors about old buffalo wallows. Buffalo Township, Buffalo Valley, and Buffalo Mountain are all named after the creek. Historical industries in the watershed included mills and timbering, but livestock raising and agriculture are {{more common in the}} 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The neck {{vertebra}} {{referred to}} Hatzegopteryx sp. contains {{a number of}} traits that allow {{for it to be}} <b>definitely</b> identified as that of an azhdarchid. The centrum is relatively low, the zygapophyses are large and flattened, and the preserved portions of the neural spine indicate that it is bifid, or split into two.|$|E
5|$|The {{thought of}} {{acting in a}} film had never even entered their minds. They're easy-going people, {{they have a good}} time {{in front of the camera}} and I don't think there was a single moment where either of them felt they were working. Paz, however, was <b>definitely</b> {{conscious}} of the fact that she was interpreting a role.|$|E
5|$|Tytila (died around 616) was a semi-historical pagan king of East Anglia, a small Anglo-Saxon kingdom {{which today}} {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Early sources, including Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, identify {{him as an}} early member of the Wuffingas dynasty who succeeded his father Wuffa. A later chronicle dates his reign from 578, {{but he is not}} known to have <b>definitely</b> ruled as king and nothing of his life is known. He is listed in a number of genealogical lists.|$|E
5|$|We all {{holed up}} in (producer) David Bianco's lovely studio, which {{was built in the}} '70s and hasn't changed much since then—and though it was the sticky, hot LA summer outside, inside, it was snowy, {{delightful}} Christmastime. We.. everything together around an invisible campfire; everyone picking up different instruments and playing them on a moment's notice. There was <b>definitely</b> some holiday magic in the air that week.|$|E
5|$|At {{the science}} fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet {{tarantula}} has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps {{up behind her}} during the chaos, and pinches her leg {{to make it seem}} that the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated in front of her teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will <b>definitely</b> make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{alliance}} contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia {{declared war on}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their goal was to <b>definitely</b> expel Turks from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. The Turkish forces had left the city the day before. The Serbian annexation led to the exodus of many Turks: 725 Turkish families left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population was evaluated at 37,000 by the Serbian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics <b>definitely</b> favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|He {{disappeared}} from the records until found as Official to the Archdeacon of Lothian (1283 × 1285). It is possible that in this period he left Scotland for further study. The position of Official was held under the absentee Archdeacon of Lothian, Adam de Gullane, and afterwards, Archdeacon William Frere, and was probably held along with the post of vicar of Haddington; the latter he <b>definitely</b> held by 1295. Nicholas is found as Official in a document dating certainly between 1273 and 1285, a document which can probably be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like a photo album, so every single scene is kind of like a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll <b>definitely</b> feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very {{different}} and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|It's <b>definitely</b> riskier than {{something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe <b>definitely</b> did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Pořádek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped {{the fact that he was}} not wanted on stage.|$|E
5|$|Speaking is {{the default}} {{modality}} for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other {{components of the}} vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language. The study of the genetic bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has <b>definitely</b> been implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder if affected by mutations.|$|E
