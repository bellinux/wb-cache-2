500|$|In 2012, the RAF's Merlin HC3/3A fleet {{began to}} be {{transferred}} to the Royal Navy for use by the Commando Helicopter Force. [...] Royal Navy personnel worked alongside RAF crew at Benson to build experience during the transition. A Â£454m Merlin Life Sustainment Programme will see 25 HC3/3A airframes fitted with the cockpit electronics of the HM2, folding tails and main rotor heads, strengthened landing gear, <b>deck</b> <b>lashing</b> mounting points, obsolescence updates, fast-roping points and a common emergency egress system. The first HC4 is to begin flight trials in September 2017, with an IOC in mid-2018; an interim folding main rotor head will be fitted to some HC3 for shipborne operations prior to the HC4 upgrade. [...] Command of the UK Merlin HC3/3A fleet was formally transferred from the RAF to the Royal Navy during a ceremony at RAF Benson on 30 September 2014. [...] As part of the same ceremony, the RAF's 78 Sqn was disbanded and the Royal Navy's 846 Naval Air Squadron stood-up with the Merlin. [...] The RAF's 28(AC) continued to operate as part of the Commando Helicopter Force until July 2015, when 28(AC) Sqn stood down and 845 Naval Air Squadron stood-up. 846 NAS relocated from RAF Benson to RNAS Yeovilton in March 2015, with 845 NAS following in June 2016.|$|E
6000|$|... "Overhaul the big one, too," [...] Captain Warfield ordered, taking charge. [...] "And here, some of you, hoist in this boat. Lower {{her down}} to the <b>deck</b> and <b>lash</b> her bottom up." ...|$|R
50|$|The Bosun, Holcomb Lammon, {{collected}} dunnage {{from the}} <b>deck</b> and <b>lashed</b> {{it into a}} makeshift life-raft. Six Armed Guard and five merchant crew owe their lives to this raft. Lammon also died with the ship, and {{he was awarded the}} Meritorious Service Medal.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} that struck me as being {{different}} from anything I had yet seen during my short career on the sea, was the hoisting of the anchor on <b>deck</b> and <b>lashing</b> it firmly down with ropes, {{as if we had}} now bid adieu to the land for ever and would require its services no more.|$|R
60|$|He unlashed the {{fastenings}} {{of the cover}} of the circular hole above him, reached his hand forward and got hold of Luka's paddle, and passed it with his own out through the hole. Then he sat up himself. Confident as he felt in the canoe, he was almost frightened at the wild aspect of the sea. The wind was literally howling, driving the rain before it with a force that stung Godfrey's neck as it struck it. He got out a strip of deer-skin lashing, of which there was a supply always close at hand under the <b>deck,</b> <b>lashed</b> the paddles together, and then, leaning aft, lashed them at the centre firmly to the tow-rope. Then with some difficulty he got out his knife and cut the rope close to its fastening; the paddles flew overboard, and the boat drifted rapidly astern, the drag of the paddles being, as Godfrey observed with satisfaction, sufficient to keep her head to wind. Then he wriggled himself down underneath the apron again and lashed down {{the cover of the}} hole.|$|R
60|$|With the {{foremast}} in, {{the work}} now went on apace. Almost before I knew it, and without one serious hitch, I had the mainmast stepped. A derrick-boom, rigged to the foremast, had accomplished this; and several days more found all stays and shrouds in place, and everything set up taut. Topsails {{would be a}} nuisance and a danger for a crew of two, so I heaved the topmasts on <b>deck</b> and <b>lashed</b> them fast.|$|R
60|$|The Rowan came up head to wind, and Whitney {{was hard}} at work {{for the next few}} minutes, {{handling}} heavy chain that ran out furiously and then stopped until he dragged more up from below, paying out the thick kedge-warp that coiled all about the <b>deck,</b> and <b>lashing</b> the thrashing jib to the bowsprit. Then he and Andrew got the mainsail down and the boat rode to her moorings; though she was not at rest. Sometimes the wind drove her up against the tide and the short waves washed on deck; sometimes the current swept her back, while the tightening cable rang and it looked as if she must drag her anchors and ground upon the surf-swept bank.|$|R
60|$|The {{amount of}} spoil taken {{was so great}} that the Tigress, when she set sail again, was nearly a foot deeper in the water than when she entered the bay. The prisoners had been the subject of much discussion. It was agreed that they were {{probably}} no worse than their comrades who had escaped, and they did not like the thought of handing them over to be executed. They were, therefore, on the third day after the arrival of the brig, brought up on <b>deck.</b> Three dozen <b>lashes</b> were administered to each, then they were given one of the boats in which they had attacked the ship, and told to go.|$|R
6000|$|Availing {{himself of}} the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes, and in {{preparation}} for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still retained it on <b>deck,</b> fast <b>lashed</b> to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pikeheads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.--Most miserable! ...|$|R
60|$|The gentlemen {{who were}} near him {{were talking about}} the rockets--the same rockets that Rollo had seen when {{he went back to the}} stern of the ship to look out at the sea, on the day of the storm. One of the men, who had often been at sea before, and who seemed to be well acquainted with all {{nautical}} affairs, said that the rockets were used to throw lines from one ship to another, or from a ship to the shore, in case of wrecks or storms. He said that sometimes at sea a steamer came across a wrecked vessel, or one that was disabled, while yet there were some seamen or passengers still alive on board. These men would generally be seen clinging to the <b>decks,</b> or <b>lashed</b> to the rigging. In such cases the sea was often in so frightful a commotion that no boat could live in it; and there was consequently no way to get the unfortunate mariners off their vessel but by throwing a line across, and then drawing them over in some way or other along the line. He said that the sailors had a way of making a sort of sling, by which a man could be suspended under such a line with loops or rings, made of rope, and so adjusted that they would run along upon it; and that by this means men could be drawn across from one ship to another, at sea, if there was only a line stretched across for the rings to run upon.|$|R
60|$|In {{the dismal}} {{prospect}} of undergoing another night like the last, {{and being in}} imminent hazard of parting from our cable, the writer thought it necessary to advise with the master and officers of the ship as to the probable event of the vessel's drifting from her moorings. They severally gave it as their opinion that we had now every chance of riding out the gale, which, in all probability, could not continue with the same fury many hours longer; and that even if she should part from her anchor, the storm-sails had been laid to hand, and could be bent {{in a very short}} time. They further stated that {{from the direction of the}} wind being N.E., she would sail up the Firth of Forth to Leith Roads. But if this should appear doubtful, after passing the Island and Light of May, it might be advisable at once to steer for Tyningham Sands, on the western side of Dunbar, and there run the vessel ashore. If this should happen at the time of high-water, or during the ebbing of the tide, they were of opinion, from the flatness and strength of the floating light, that no danger would attend her taking the ground, even with a very heavy sea. The writer, seeing the confidence which these gentlemen possessed with regard to the situation of things, found himself as much relieved with this conversation as he had previously been with the seeming indifference of the forecastle-men, and the smile of the watch upon <b>deck,</b> though literally <b>lashed</b> to the foremast. From this time he felt himself almost perfectly at ease; at any rate, he was entirely resigned to the ultimate result.|$|R
