As stated by the distinguished historian Andrew Stirling, present-day Cuttack was established as a military cantonment by king Nrupa Keshari of Keshari dynasty in 989 CE. Stirling based his opinion on the Madala Panji, a chronicle of the Jagannath temple of Puri. The reign of Maharaja Markata Keshari was distinguished for the stone <b>embank</b> built to protect the new capital from flood in 1002 CE.|$|E

One feature is an outdoor deck overhanging an <b>embank</b> that overlooks ponds at the refuge. This [...] long concrete deck is of a cantilevered design that extends [...] over the embankment. Other amenities include footbridges, education sites, and walking trails. [...] There are nearly five miles (8.0km) of trails, but they are closed in the fall and winter. Centennial and River are two of the viewing areas along the trails, each offering a place to view wildlife. Photographers have access to blinds which allow them to take pictures without disturbing the wildlife.|$|E

Whereupon, we {{must also}} pause, to <b>embank</b> {{ourselves}} somewhat; and before other things, try what we can understand in this name of Frank, concerning which Gibbon tells us, in his sweetest tones of satisfied moral serenity--"The love of liberty was the ruling passion of these Germans. They deserved, they assumed, they maintained, the honourable epithet of Franks, or Freemen." [...] He does not, however, tell us in what language of the time--Chaucian, Sicambrian, Chamavian, or Cattian,--'Frank' ever meant Free: nor can I find out myself what tongue of any time it first belongs to; but I doubt not that Miss Yonge ('History of Christian Names,' Articles on Frey and Frank), gives the true root, in {{what she calls the}} High German [...] "Frang," [...] Free Lord. Not by any means a Free Commoner, or anything of the sort! but a person whose nature and name implied the existence around him, and beneath, of a considerable number of other persons who were by no means 'Frang,' nor Frangs. His title is one of the proudest then maintainable;--ratified at last by the dignity of age added to that of valour, into the Seigneur, or Monseigneur, not even yet in the last cockney form of it, 'Mossoo,' wholly understood as a republican term! ...|$|E

In that enfeebled clutch the pen itself tends to waggle and drop; and hence, in short, my appearance of languor over the inkstand. This {{is a dark}} moist Sunday a.m., and I sit alone in the great dim solemn library of this Club (Thackeray's Megatherium or whatever,) and say to myself that the conditions now at last ought to be auspicious--though indeed that merely tends to make me but brood inefficiently over the transformations of London as such scenes express them and as I have seen them go on growing. Now at last the place becomes an utter void, a desert peopled with ghosts, for all except three days (about) of the week--speaking from the social point of view. The old Victorian social Sunday is dust and ashes, and a holy stillness, a repudiating blankness, has possession--which however, after all, has its merits and its conveniences too.... Cadogan Gardens, meanwhile, know me no more--the region has turned to sadness, as if, with your absence, all the blinds were down, and I now have no such confident and cordial afternoon refuge left. Very promptly, next winter, the blinds must be up again, and I will keep the tryst. I have been talking of you this evening with dear W. E. Norris, who is paying one of his much interspaced visits to town and has dined with me, amiably, without other attractions.

He now can splendidly decorate his house, lay out its grounds magnificently, and richly supply his table, and that of his household and retinue. And thus, without any abuse of right, we should find established all the phenomena of poverty and riches, which (it is supposed necessarily) accompany modern civilization.

6000|$|The {{examination}} of these various modes of collection {{and use of}} riches will form the third branch of our future inquiries; but {{the key to the}} whole subject lies in the clear understanding of the difference between selfish and unselfish expenditure. It is not easy, by any course of reasoning, to enforce this on the generally unwilling hearer; yet the definition of unselfish expenditure is brief and simple. It is expenditure which if you are a capitalist, does not pay you, but pays somebody else; and if you are a consumer, does not please you, but pleases somebody else. Take one special instance, in further illustration of the general type given above. I did not invent that type, but spoke of a real river, and of real peasantry, the languid and sickly race which inhabits, or haunts--for they are often more like spectres than living men--the thorny desolation {{on the banks of the}} Arve. Some years ago, a society formed at Geneva offered to <b>embank</b> the river, for the ground which would have been recovered by the operation; but the offer was refused by the (then Sardinian) government. The capitalists saw that this expenditure would have [...] "paid," [...] if the ground saved from the river was to be theirs. But if when the offer that had this aspect of profit was refused, they had nevertheless persisted in the plan and, merely taking security for the return of their outlay, lent the funds for the work, and thus saved a whole race of human souls from perishing in a pestiferous fen (as, I presume, some among them would, at personal risk, have dragged any one drowning creature out of the current of the stream, and not expected payment therefor), such expenditure would have precisely corresponded to the use of his power made, in the first instance, by our supposed richest peasant--it would have been the king's, of grace, instead of the usurer's, for gain.|$|E

40|$|<b>Embanked</b> {{floodplains}} are the status-quo where {{humans are}} {{a major component of}} the environment, especially across Europe and North America. Effective management of <b>embanked</b> rivers requires a comprehensive knowledge of past and present-day geomorphic processes, including sediment transport and channel and floodplain dynamics. Many approaches to management include activities and modifications which take into account past natural and human impacts and management decisions, resulting in a palimpsest of river and floodplain management. A synthesis of 12 diverse case studies provides evidence of the palimpsest in river-floodplain management, and illustrates four key roles for geomorphology in the design of effective management strategies, including (1) regional and longer term context, (2) system evolution and past human impacts, (3) engineering design and management options, and (4), environmental and geomorphic restoration as an end-product. A review and comparison of heavily managed <b>embanked</b> rivers spanning a range of climatic and geomorphic provinces across North America and Europe illustrate the role of geomorphology in this palimpsest and its value to integrated management...|$|R

These designs tended to fine detailing in brick, but in a restrained manner characteristic of the romantic movement of the Arts Crafts. The prominent use of rain heads and down spouts in the composition is an interesting pointer to Plottel’s later work.|$|E
