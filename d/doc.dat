30|$|We have {{generated}} a new loss-of-function mutation in the DOCS 1 gene (<b>docs</b> 1 – 2) using the CRISPR-Cas 9 technology. This new loss-of-function mutant and <b>docs</b> 1 – 1 present similar phenotypes suggesting the original <b>docs</b> 1 – 1 was a null allele. Besides the aluminum sensitivity phenotype, both <b>docs</b> 1 mutants shared also several root phenotypes described previously: less root hairs and mixed {{identities of the}} outer cell layers. Moreover, our new results suggest that DOCS 1 could {{also play a role}} in root cap development. We hypothesized these <b>docs</b> 1 root phenotypes may affect gravity responses. As expected, in seedlings, the early gravitropic response was delayed. Furthermore, at adult stage, the root gravitropic set angle of <b>docs</b> 1 mutants was also affected since <b>docs</b> 1 mutant plants displayed larger root cone angles.|$|R
