5|$|<b>Kent</b> <b>State</b> {{had entered}} the weekend of November 24 ranked 23rd in the BCS standings, but after every team ranked between 15 and 21 lost that day, the Golden Flashes rose to 17th in the November 25 rankings, with Northern Illinois rising to 21st. At the same time, no team from the Big East, which had an {{automatic}} place in a BCS bowl, was in the top 25. The teams ranked immediately ahead and behind <b>Kent</b> <b>State,</b> UCLA and Texas, had to play higher-ranked teams on the road during the championship weekend. UCLA visited 8th ranked Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship Game, and Texas visited sixth-ranked Kansas State to end both teams' regular seasons.

5|$|Northern Illinois got {{the ball}} to start the game and, after three plays totaling three yards, were forced to punt, going three-and-out.

The first scoring drive occurred for the Golden Flashes on their second drive, but they were aided by Huskies' punt returner Angelo Sebastiano fumbling a <b>Kent</b> <b>State</b> punt. They {{took advantage of the}} mistake and ultimately scored on a 15-yard touchdown run by Dri Archer. After the Huskies failed to score on their next drive, <b>Kent</b> <b>State</b> capitalized again on a 37-yard field goal by Freddy Cortez.

Northern Illinois responded with a field goal of their own, a 40-yarder by Sims. After the first overtime, the score was tied at 37. NIU got the ball to start the second overtime, and took only two plays to score a touchdown: a 23-yard run by Akeem Daniels followed by a 2-yard run by Lynch, his third touchdown of the game. <b>Kent</b> <b>State</b> then had to score a touchdown in order to force the game to a third overtime.
