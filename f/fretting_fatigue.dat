50|$|The {{shockwave}} generated coldwork (plastic strain) in {{the workpiece}} material creates compressive and tensile residual stresses {{to maintain an}} equilibrium state of the material. These residual stresses are compressive at the workpiece surface and gradually fade into low tensile stresses below and surrounding the laser peened area. The cold work also work hardens the surface layer. The compressive residual stresses, {{and to a lesser}} extent, the cold work, from laser peening have been shown to prevent and mitigate high cycle fatigue (HCF), low cycle fatigue (LCF), stress corrosion cracking, <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> and to some degree, wear and corrosion pitting.

50|$|Fretting wear is the {{repeated}} cyclical rubbing between two surfaces. Over {{a period of}} time fretting which will remove material from one or both surfaces in contact. It occurs typically in bearings, although most bearings have their surfaces hardened to resist the problem. Another problem occurs when cracks in either surface are created, known as <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue.</b> It is the more serious of the two phenomena because it can lead to catastrophic failure of the bearing. An associated problem occurs when the small particles removed by wear are oxidised in air. The oxides are usually harder than the underlying metal, so wear accelerates as the harder particles abrade the metal surfaces further. Fretting corrosion acts in the same way, especially when water is present. Unprotected bearings on large structures like bridges can suffer serious degradation in behaviour, especially when salt is used the during winter to deice the highways carried by the bridges. The problem of fretting corrosion was involved in the Silver Bridge tragedy and the Mianus River Bridge accident.|$|E

This paper presents an all-in-one 2 D cylinder on flat numerical model for life assessment on coupled <b>fretting</b> wear and <b>fatigue</b> phenomena. In the literature, two stages are usually distinguished: crack nucleation and its subsequent growth. The method combines the Archard wear model, a critical-plane implementation of the Smith-Watson- Topper (SWT) multiaxial fatigue criterion coupled with the Miner-Palmgren accumulation damage rule for crack initiation prediction. Then, the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) via eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) embedded into the commercial finite element code Abaqus FEA has been employed to determine the crack propagation stage.

Various influences on the <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> life are investigated. Shot peened Rene’ 95 had better <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> life compared to shot peened Rene’ 88. Shot peening produced a 2 x increase in life for Rene’ 95, but only a marginal improvement in the <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> life for Rene’ 88. Minor cycles in variable amplitude loading produces significant damage to the specimen. Addition of occasional overpeaks in load produces improvements in <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> life. ^ Contact tractions and stresses are obtained through a variety of available tools. The contact tractions can be efficiently obtained for limited geometries, while FEM can provide the contact tractions for a broader class of problems, but with the cost of increased CPU requirements. Similarly, the subsurface contact stresses can be obtained using the contact tractions as a boundary condition with either a semi-analytical FFT method or FEM. It is found that to calculate contact stresses the FFT was only marginally faster than FEM. The experimental results are combined with the analysis to produce tools that are used to design against <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue.</b> ^ Fractographic analysis of the fracture surface indicates the nature of the <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> crack behavior. Interrupted tests were performed to analyze the crack at intermediate lives. <b>Fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracks were found to have formed in less than 10 % of total <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> life. In addition to the formation of the individual <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracks, by 10 % of the total expected <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> life, the individual <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracks have linked together to form a through the thickness edge crack.

40|$|Tribocorrosion {{refers to}} a complex {{degradation}} of materials occurring due to the interaction between a tribological process and a corrosive environment. From the tribological point of view, the interaction with the material may include sliding or abrasive wear, erosion, impact, <b>fretting</b> or <b>fatigue</b> processes. The environmental solicitation may result from temperature, humidity, liquids or gases in permanent or intermittent contact with the materials. Failure in the metallic part or of the metal/ceramic interfaces existing in dental restorations, such as crowns and bridges, are still relatively frequent. Also, excessive degradation of dental materials is sometimes observed in other dental materials. Most of the failures are due to the simultaneous action of mechanical (wear, <b>fretting</b> and <b>fatigue)</b> and chemical (saliva) solicitations. As a consequence, {{the investigation of the}} tribocorrosion mechanisms in such systems becomes essential. Regarding this aspect, in last years particular focus is being given to the exploitation of electrochemical methods as a tool for the investigation of the combined corrosion-wear degradation of the materials. Also, it is known that the mechanical contact geometry is of crucial importance regarding the degradation behaviour. In this work the tribocorrosion behaviour of commercially pure titanium in contact with artificial saliva solutions was investigated. Tests were conducted in a reciprocating sliding geometry with movement amplitudes varying from 200 m (fretting) up to 6 mm (wear), and normal loads between 2 and 10 N. The electrochemical noise technique was used in order to follow the evolution of both the corrosion current and of the open circuit potential of the system during the wear tests. The pH of the artificial saliva solution was varied between 4 and 7. Results show that the behaviour of the material is strongly influenced by the pH of the solution. In fact, acidification of the solution improves the electrochemical response of the material, in particular the repassivation kinetics after sliding, in all the test conditions used in this work. However, the characteristics of the passive film formed on the material surface appear to be less protective than that formed at neutral pH. Also, an abnormal amount of titanium is removed from the material at low pH, when the normal load applied during the wear test is increased...|$|R

In addition, the ecological costs should be (but typically are not) considered.

A new damage accumulation methodology for the adaptive mesh simulation, based on the cyclic material removal, has been developed. Four methods (Mansonâs universal slope, Muralidharan modified universal slopes, medians and fatigue SâN curves) for estimation of the fatigue coefficients of the wire have been used.

In {{previous}} paper we introduced the <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> life estimation methods in high cycle region {{by considering the}} wear process.

In this paper we estimated the low cycle <b>fretting</b> <b>fatigue</b> life based on new critical distance theory, which is modified for high stress region using ultimate tensile strength σB, and fracture toughness KIC. Firstly the critical distance for estimating low cycle fatigue strength was calculated by interpolation of critical distance on fatigue limit (estimated from σw 0 and ΔKth) with critical distance on static strength (estimated from σB and KIC).

This paper gives a survey about corrosion induced failure mechanisms of prestressing steels with a particular emphasis on post-tensioning tendons. Depending on the prevailing corrosion situation and the load conditions as well as the prestressing steel properties the following possibilities of fracture must be distinguished: • Brittle fracture due to exceeding the residual load capacity. Brittle fracture is particularly promoted by local corrosion attack and hydrogen embrittlement. • Fracture as a result of hydrogen induced stress-corrosion cracking. • Fracture as a result of fatigue and corrosion influences, distinguishing be-tween corrosion <b>fatigue</b> cracking and <b>fretting</b> corrosion/fretting <b>fatigue.</b> ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die gelegentlich an den im Spannbetonbau verwendeten Spannstählen auf-tretenden Brüche sind im Regelfall auf korrosionsbedingte Einflüsse zurückzu-führen. Die Versagensmechanismen werden häufig nicht ausreichend verstan...|$|R
