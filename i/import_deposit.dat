40|$|This report proposes {{an action}} plan for the {{rationalization}} of tax structures for Central America. To harmonize tax policies among Central American nations, the report recommends the following: (a) continuing trade liberalization, by reducing thelevel and dispersion of effective trade protection; (b) shifting the tax system from reliance on trade to reliance on domestic transactions and income; (c) making the value added tax {{the backbone of the}} tax system; and (d) improving tax administration. It also recommends; (e) harmonizing taxes on inputs and exempting nontraditional exporters from paying import duties; (f) moving toward coordinating factor incomes to avoid double taxation; (g) eliminating all quantitative import restrictions, prior <b>imports</b> <b>deposits,</b> non-common <b>import</b> tariffs and other restrictions on imports from other Central American Common Market (CACM) members; (h) applying similar principles in designing export taxes on coffee and bananas; and (i) not using differential exchange rates to discriminate against regional trade. If implemented, it is hoped that these reforms, along with other structural reforms, would help spark the latent growth potential in Central American economies.

40|$|The Central and East European economies {{closed the}} year well behind 1995, {{with an average}} GDP growth of 3. 5 percent. High {{investment}} helped to maintain high GDP growth in Poland and Slovakia. The banking crisis in Bulgaria resulted in strong GDP decline and very high inflation. Russia and Ukraine achieved remarkable success in disinflation, {{at the cost of}} further GDP decline. Moderate disinflation continues in all of the more advanced CEE economies, although the low budget deficits and recent restrictive monetary policies have not brought about the rapid disinflation authorities had hoped for. Real appreciation of the domestic currencies, as well as rising competition, seem to have been important in the continuing reduction of inflation rates. In Croatia and FYR Macedonia, deflationary tendencies previously at work now seem to have been overcome. Current account deficits have been growing in Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In 1996, none of these countries had a problem achieving the necessary inflow of capital needed to compensate. Forces underlying recent performance will continue to be at work in 1997 and 1998. GDP growth in more advanced CEE countries will continue to be moderate, and lower still in the less advanced economies. Assuming only marginal improvement in the West European business climate, there will be little opportunity to boost exports. The advanced CEE countries will probably try to prevent excessive increases in imports through additional devaluation's, but short of the drastic restrictions on domestic consumption and investment that seem likely in Romania and Bulgaria. The Czech Republic is fighting foreign trade imbalances by newly introduced <b>import</b> <b>deposits</b> and slowing down wage increases, without however devaluating the national currency. In Slovakia, import levels could be cooled by slowing down the pace of government investments in infrastructure. Hungary and Slovenia will be less likely to need restrictions. In both Russia and Ukraine maintaining relatively stable prices will undoubtedly remain a priority. Economic stabilization is at least a possibility in these two countries.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first aerial additive building manufacturing system developed {{to create and}} repair civil engineering structures remotely using polymers extruded from unmanned aerial robots (drones). The structural potential of three commercially available expanding polyurethane foams of varying density (LD 40, Reprocell 300 and Reprocell 500), and their feasibility for deposition using an autonomous flying dual-syringe device is described. Test specimens consisting of one and two layers, with horizontal and vertical interfaces, were mechanically tested both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of expansion. LD 40 specimens exhibited ductile failure in flexural tests and provided evidence that the interfaces between layers were not necessarily regions of weaknesses. Hand-mixed specimens of Reprocell 500 possessed compressive strengths {{comparable to those of}} concrete and flexural strengths {{similar to those of the}} lower range of timber, though they exhibited brittle failure. There are challenges to be faced with matching the performance of hand-mixed specimens using an autonomous dual-syringe deposition device, primarily concerning the rheological properties of the material following extrusion. However, the device successfully <b>imported</b> and <b>deposited</b> two liquid components, of varying viscosity, and maintained correct mixing ratios.

50|$|The {{legislation}} regarding container deposit systems was updated so {{that from}} January 1, 2006, containers from other plastics and metals, e.g., steel cans, can {{be included in}} the deposit systems. The law also makes it illegal in Sweden to sell consumption-ready beverages in containers that are not part of an authorized Swedish container deposit system, with the exception of beverages that mainly consist of dairy products or vegetable, fruit, or berry juice. However, private importation from (mainly Eastern European) countries without deposit occurs by vendors that thus compete with a somewhat lower customer price. The recycling of these contraband cans has not been seen as a problem, but Returpack made a campaign in 2010 offering 0.10 krona for each <b>imported</b> can (without <b>deposit)</b> to the benefit of WWF, retrieving 17 million cans. In 2011, a similar campaign was repeated, retrieving almost 18 million cans.Non-deposit glass containers are collected in large glass garbage bins, for clear or coloured glass, placed centrally in most urban areas.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} airmass trajectories and their role in air pollution transport. It describes the concept, history, and basic calculation of air trajectories citing various trajectory models used worldwide. It highlights various areas of trajectory applications and errors associated with trajectory calculations. South Asian region receives airmasses from Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Indian Ocean, and so forth, depending upon the season. These airmasses are responsible for export and <b>import</b> of pollutants <b>depositing</b> in nearby states. Trajectory analysis revealed that soil is contributed by the dust storms coming from Oman through Gulf and Iran, while most of black carbon (BC) sources are located in India. A detailed review of trajectories associated with wet deposition events indicated that airmasses coming from Europe and Middle East carry high concentration of acidic pollutants which are deposited in Himalayan ranges. Similarly, trajectory analysis revealed that acidic pollutants from continental anthropogenic sources are transported to an ecosensitive site in Western Ghats in India and the outward fluxes of anthropogenic activities of Indo-Gangetic region are transported towards Bay of Bengal. Hence, transboundary and long range transport of pollutants are very important issues in South Asia which need immediate attention of scientists and policy makers...|$|R
