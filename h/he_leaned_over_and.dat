2500|$|Prior to {{the live}} session, Miles Davis had already {{established}} {{a reputation as}} one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as [...] "The Jazz Corner of the World", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating [...] "Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, I want this sound', and it turn out be a very key thing that changes the whole character of the [...] For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way : the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a half tone. That was [...] <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I want this here.'" [...] Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{touched her}} hand. His tone and manner had {{softened}} wonderfully.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{touched the}} {{crouching}} form upon the shoulder. There was no response.|$|E
60|$|As {{she made}} her promise she turned her sweet face up to his, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> her, <b>and</b> kissed her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good night,' <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> {{kissed her}} forehead, in a grave {{grateful}} way {{that brought the}} tears into her eyes as he silently departed.|$|R
60|$|She {{burst into}} a torrent of {{confused}} supplication and the tears coursed down her painted cheeks. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> her <b>and,</b> lifting her face, forced her to look at him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> brushed a {{scrap of}} paper from her grey cloak. She shivered slightly.|$|E
60|$|At this {{question}} the waiter shrugged his shoulders. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> whispered into Tom's ear.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Chalk {{turned in}} hopeful amaze; then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> shook hands solemnly with Mr. Tredgold. [...] "Iâ€™ll take the bet," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to her, <b>and</b> put his hand, {{strong and}} {{clenching}} now, on hers.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to me, <b>and</b> gripped my hand {{where it}} {{lay on the}} {{saddle-bow}} clutching the reins.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the bed-rail <b>and</b> laughed joyously. Mr. Scutts, through half-closed eyes, {{gazed at}} him in silent reproach.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{kissed her}} behind the drawn curtains. [...] "I will, Alice! I will indeed! I won't keep {{anything}} from you after this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to-day!" [...] sang out Tom, {{and riding}} forward, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> caught the {{dangling}} reins. Then, watching his chance, he {{leaped into the}} other saddle.|$|E
60|$|Maraton {{felt himself}} {{suddenly}} {{at the edge}} of the world. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> looked into the abyss called hell. For a moment he shivered; then he set his teeth.|$|E
60|$|Monty had {{recovered}} a little his power of speech. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> his spade <b>and</b> smiled benignly at his visitor.|$|R
60|$|Dartrey {{rose to his}} feet, {{produced}} the corkscrew and found the cork amenable. He filled Nora's glass and his own. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> took her hand for a moment. His face was full of kindness and he was curiously disturbed.|$|R
5000|$|When Tony hears Paulie {{laughing}} loudly, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> his balcony <b>and</b> sees Paulie {{sitting on}} his bed, watching the 70's sitcom Three's Company.|$|R
60|$|With care Dick {{took the}} hooks {{and threw them}} out of the machine. At the same time <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> allowed the ends of the ropes to catch on the swiftly-revolving wheels of the machine.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are trying}} to make out where they are," [...] said Decoud in a whisper. Again <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> put his fingers into the water. [...] "We are moving quite smartly," [...] he {{informed}} Nostromo.|$|E
60|$|Santa {{laughed and}} laid his finger aside {{of his nose}} as if {{thinking}} what to reply. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> whispered something in the Wizard's ear, at which the Wizard smiled and nodded as if he understood.|$|E
60|$|And {{presently}} Taug, who {{had escaped}} {{with only a}} few scratches, came and squatted beside Tarzan and watched him as he played with the little balu, and at last <b>he</b> too <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> helped Teeka with the cleansing and the healing of the ape-man's hurts.|$|R
60|$|At this plain {{declaration}} made by Dave, Mr. Asa Dickley grew fairly purple. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> his counter <b>and</b> {{shook his}} clenched fist in Dave's face.|$|R
6000|$|Ruggedo the Nome {{saw what}} was {{happening}} and was afraid Kiki would spoil all his plans, so <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the rock <b>and</b> shouted: [...] "Stop, Kiki--stop!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All the same," [...] he observed, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> {{shook hands}} with his host, [...] "I should never be {{surprised}} to come across you in that smoke-disfigured den of infamy! Look me up when you come, won't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|The mate sprang at her, but she dodged {{round the}} table. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and,</b> {{catching}} {{her by the}} left arm, drew her towards him; then, with her flushed, laughing face close to his, he forgot everything else, and kissed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's what I think," [...] said Dan. [...] "Better let it go. I {{guess it}} will explain {{itself in the}} course of time. But I don't want any blots around." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> looked her smilingly in the face.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a lovely}} city!" [...] {{he said as}} <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the bulwark <b>and</b> looked at the town {{standing}} on the steep hills sloping down to the river.|$|R
60|$|Chauvelin's keen eyes {{tried to}} pierce the {{surrounding}} darkness. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the parapet <b>and</b> {{peered into the}} remote angles {{of the building and}} round the booths below him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are too inquisitive, St. John," [...] murmured Mary {{in a low}} voice; but <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{the table}} <b>and</b> {{required}} an answer by a second firm and piercing look.|$|R
60|$|The two {{men stood}} up in the automobile. Sabatini's face had darkened. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> said {{something}} to the chauffeur. They drove on through the press of people, who gave way sullenly. A police inspector came {{to the side of the}} car.|$|E
6000|$|... "What you're {{going for}} is to save life, not to drown your boat's crew for nothing," [...] he growled {{severely}} in my ear. But as we shoved off <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> cried out: [...] "It all rests {{on the power of}} your arms, men. Give way for life!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The rumble, thus encouraged, deepened again. It became {{confident}} and was heard to laugh. Mr. Hartley rose and, {{standing on the}} hearthrug with legs apart, resolved to play the man. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> rang the bell. The voices stopped. Then he heard Rosa say, [...] "Not him! you stay where you are." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Da Souza cringed no longer, {{and there}} shot from his black eyes the venomous twinkle of the serpent whose fangs are out. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the table, <b>and</b> dropped his voice.|$|R
60|$|Immediately the Scarecrow {{threw out}} the anchor, so as to hold the boat in that place, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the side <b>and</b> through the clear water looked at his friend sorrowfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maryanne, if I {{might have}} my wish, {{it should be}} this. Let us both sit down, with our cigars lighted,--ay, and with tapers in our hands,--on an open barrel of gunpowder. Then let him who will sit there longest receive this fair hand as his prize." [...] And as <b>he</b> finished, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> her, <b>and</b> took up her hand in his.|$|R
