5|$|Trainspotting {{director}} Danny Boyle was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to direct the}} film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, {{but he was not}} interested in pursuing the project and went on to make A Life Less Ordinary instead. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as he could not <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about an Alien film. In 1995, after the release of The Usual Suspects, 20th Century Fox approached Bryan Singer to direct. Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the film's producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to Amélie and was surprised he was offered the job for Alien Resurrection, as he thought the franchise had finished with Alien 3 and believed that making a sequel was a bad idea. Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. He required an interpreter as he did not speak much English when filming began.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{protection}} {{training is}} unnecessary {{because they are}} natural guard dogs and always have been. As with every breed, obedience training is very important. The Neapolitan is very tolerant of pain due to the breed's early fighting background and the fact the skin is loose on the body, so {{it is important to}} routinely check for health problems, as a Neapolitan may not behave differently when injured or ill. They also are renowned for drooling especially after drinking or if they <b>get</b> <b>excited.</b>|$|E

500|$|Ville Valo is {{the main}} {{songwriter}} of HIM and his songs largely deal with themes of love. When talking about his songwriting, Valo stated: [...] "I didn't know {{how to cope with}} the world. Then I found an instrument, and through that I realized, that I am able to cope with the world and its evils, a bit better, through writing songs." [...] In terms of lyrical content, Valo has stated that [...] "I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It's the only thing than touches me." [...] Valo also takes inspiration from literature, explaining that [...] "as a guy who writes songs, I <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don't necessarily <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about the whole of Tolkien, I just <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive." [...] Valo and the rest of HIM have referred to their music as [...] "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences, such as Black Sabbath and Type O Negative. Valo has described the music of HIM as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with NME in 2014 whilst promoting his solo debut album Everyday Robots, Damon Albarn hinted at a collaborative project with Gallagher. Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything to <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know. It {{would be fair to}} say, we have discussed it at least once." ...|$|E

It was planned by Chiyomaru Shikura, the founder {{and executive director of}} 5pb, and was written by Naotaka Hayashi, with character designs by Mutsumi Sasaki and original concept art by Yukihiro Matsuo. Shikura intended to make the story [...] "within the confines of reality", to make it more relatable due to the events of the story feeling like they could happen in real life. He said that he personally finds it difficult to [...] "buy into" [...] fantasy, and that he was unconvinced that people <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> for [...] "exaggerated fantasy stories".

500|$|Radcliffe is a {{supporter}} of the Labour Party. Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told The Big Issue: [...] "...I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has been around long enough and stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and <b>get</b> <b>excited.</b> It is great." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Canning of IGN {{did not think}} there was anything [...] "terrible" [...] about the episode, {{but he did not}} think there was anything to <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about, either. Canning thought {{there were a number of}} throwaway jokes in the episode that he felt worked well, [...] "but the episode as a whole failed to grab me. As stated, there are a number of episodes that already fit this mold, and most of those are far superior." [...] Daniel Aughey of TV Guide thought the episode provided a [...] "healthy balance" [...] of humor, story and heart. [...] "Exactly what makes a great Simpsons episode!" [...] Aughey would have liked to see Homer's storyline explored as an A story in its own episode rather than cut short as a C story.|$|E
500|$|Hardcore Gamer Edward Dang was {{positive}} to the game, {{and hoped that}} {{it would lead to}} virtual reality releases of complete Danganronpa games. Jordan Devore at Destructoid thought that the game did not look exciting based on off-screen footage, but noted that this often is the case for virtual reality games, and thought that it [...] "could be the start of something neat". Chris Carter, also writing for Destructoid, enjoyed the game and called it worth playing, but not something to <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> over due to its short length. Aki Otsuki at 4Gamer.net recommended the game, and said that experiencing the punishment sequence in virtual reality was horrifying. Famitsu liked the immersion given by the virtual reality and the 360-degree movements. Hiroaki Mabuchi at IGN Japan said that the new environment graphics were a great reproduction of their Trigger Happy Havoc counterparts, and that the mysterious atmosphere suited Danganronpa well.|$|E

500|$|Graphically, Wave Race 64 {{was praised}} for its fluid animations, {{realistic}} physics, clean waters, and textured polygons. IGN's Doug Perry commented, [...] "The {{way in which}} jetskis cut into the ocean's surface, lift off ramps, bounce into and off oncoming waves, or slide on icy surfaces is not only believable and engaging, but simply unparalleled." [...] Writing for The Electric Playground, Victor Lucas highlighted the game's distinct environments, saying that each course offers players something to <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about. He also gave high marks to the game's satisfying sound effects, particularly when players submerge under the waves, but described the music as [...] "undeniably shallow". GamePro agreed, describing the music as juvenile and the announcer's voice as irritating. In contrast, AllGame's Jonti Davies felt that the game's [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "distinctly '80s theme" [...] soundtrack combined with the announcer's [...] "hyperexcited cries" [...] gives the game a light and arcade feel.|$|E
500|$|Loud was {{recorded}} in various recording studios worldwide including the Larrabee Sound Studios, The Village and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, Platinum Sound Recording Studios, and Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and The Bunker Studios in Paris.

I'm just gonna be me, because that's what you guys love the most, and that's what makes me feel best. Just being normal, normal for me is Loud! Sassy, fun, flirty, energetic." [...] While Rihanna was filming Battleship, she explained {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Tonight, [...] "Loud is, the word, the name of the album definitely reflects the attitude of it, it's really sassy and flirty and it grabs your attention and that's why I enjoy it. It takes you through a really really interesting ride. So colorful the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Carter, Duchovny and Anderson {{celebrated the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} series at a July 18, 2013 panel at the San Diego Comic-Con hosted by TV Guide. During the discussion, Anderson {{discussed}} Scully's influence on female fans, relating {{that a number of}} women have informed her that they entered into careers in physics because of the character. Anderson also indicated that she was not in favor of an X-Files miniseries, and Duchovny ruled out working with her on an unrelated project, but both expressed willingness to do a third feature film. Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, [...] "You need a reason to <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about going on and doing it again." [...] The series attained a degree of historical importance, as well. On July 16, 2008, Carter and Spotnitz donated several props from the series and new film to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.
