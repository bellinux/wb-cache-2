5|$|The 1999, it was {{reported}} that the Nagano Olympic bid committee had spent approximately $14 million to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> 62 IOC members and many of their companions.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service, but was told that men of his age, thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months. The {{government}} quickly came to the view that most actors would do more good performing to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> troops and the general public than serving, whether suitable or not, in the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Because with Calcraft's methods the {{condemned}} took several minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would sometimes dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders {{in an effort}} to break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> crowds, sometimes numbering 30,000 spectators or more.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve.

There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, 1824, {{just months}} after the election, the state capitol {{building}} was destroyed by a fire. Some furnishings and records were saved, but the four-year-old building was a total loss. When Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette toured the United States in 1825, a new capitol {{had not yet been}} constructed and the governor's mansion was too small to host a proper reception, so the governor had to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> dignitary at Weisiger's Tavern.|$|E
5|$|Prospero then {{explains}} that he tested Ferdinand, and betroths a willing Miranda to him. He then asks Ariel to bring some other spirits and create a masque to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> young couple. These spirits present a blessing by Iris, Ceres, and Juno, followed by dancing. Prospero suddenly remembers the plot against his life, dismisses the spirits and Miranda and Ferdinand, and sets a trap for Caliban, Trinculo, and Stephano. They are chased offstage by goblins {{in the shape of}} hounds.|$|E
5|$|The fear of {{national}} disintegration were played upon military leaders close to Suharto and remained {{as one of}} Indonesia's strongest justifications for refusing to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> prospect of East Timorese independence or even autonomy until the late 1990s. The military intelligence organisations initially sought a non-military annexation strategy, intending to use APODETI as its integration vehicle.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} was {{also involved in}} the provision of social, educational and cultural institutions to Belgian refugees. In 1942, the government sponsored the creation of the Belgian Institute in London to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> Belgian refugee community in London. By 1943, there were also four Belgian schools in Britain with 330 pupils between them, in Penrith, Braemar, Kingston and Buxton.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} crossing {{was greeted}} with enthusiastic cheers, the tunes of the Young Australian Band, the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey's International Show Band, who had all come to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> crowds, and the shrilling of the steamers' whistles. L'Estrange soon reappeared in a small row boat to greet the crowds, although many had already rushed the steamers to leave, resulting in a few being jostled into the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The uniform {{made its}} Olympic debut at Sydney's Bondi Beach in the 2000 Summer Olympics amid some criticism. It {{was the fifth}} largest {{television}} audience of all the sports at the 2000 Games. Much of the interest {{was because of the}} sex appeal of bikini-clad players along with their athletic ability. Bikini-clad dancers and cheerleaders <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> audience during match breaks in many beach volleyball tournaments, including the Olympics. Even indoor volleyball costumes followed suit to become smaller and tighter.|$|E

5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{visitors}} could {{participate in}} solving chess {{problems at the}} National Flag Square from 1 August to 14 September. At the Baku Boulevard, three giant chess sets were available to the visitors from 10 August to 14 September, while one-metre high painted chess pieces made by 30 professional artists were being displayed from 20 August to 14 September. The Baku Boulevard also hosted Chess Queen dances and performances from 1 to 14 September. The Queen as a chess piece symbolises freedom of movement. The role of the Queens is played by acclaimed artists that performed dances as well as greet and <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> visitors.|$|E
5|$|The What If? book {{contains}} {{a selection of}} questions and answers from the original blog, as well as nineteen new ones. Furthermore, Munroe selected a few unanswered questions from his inbox and collected those in separate sections in the book. Alt text, which was commonly used for illustrations on the original blog, was omitted from the book in many cases, though is sometimes included as small captions underneath the images. Instead, Munroe has added footnotes to the essays in the book to inform or <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> reader. The cover of the book depicts a Tyrannosaurus rex being lowered into a Sarlacc from Star Wars, a topic not covered in the book.|$|E

5|$|The first festival {{was held}} in 1974, {{organised}} by Royce Creasey and friends, as a small event, for the local musicians to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> local community. The first festival took place over four successive weekends with bands playing from a stage improvised from a flat bed truck. Bristol City Council donated £50. The following year the festival took place over one weekend and was located near to Ashton Court mansion. After this, new organisers came on board and fund-raising gigs were held enabling the event to grow steadily through the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2000, Hi-5 have {{performed}} annually at Vision Australia's Carols by Candlelight in Melbourne, which are broadcast {{live by the}} Nine Network on Christmas Eve. The group perform a short selection of Christmas songs to <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> younger viewers of the event, and are joined by Santa Claus, who was played for many years by Terry Gill, and Humphrey B. Bear. Several members have noted the shows as a highlight {{of their time in}} the group and over the years it became common for the performance to be the final concert of departing members. Hi-5 did not perform at the Carols between 2013 and 2015, and during this time, appeared at local Christmas events. Hi-5 returned to Carols by Candlelight in 2016 as part of their reestablished partnership with Nine.|$|E
