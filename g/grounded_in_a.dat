5|$|Austen's novels have {{resulted}} in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance, and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, The Bennets (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Still {{intended}} his {{new system}} of medicine to be a reformation of the existing 19th-century medical practices. He imagined that someday [...] "rational medical therapy" [...] would consist of manipulation of the musculoskeletal system, surgery, and very sparingly used drugs. He invented the name [...] "osteopathy" [...] by blending two Greek roots osteon- for bone and -pathos for suffering in order to communicate his theory that disease and physiologic dysfunction were etiologically <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> disordered musculoskeletal system. Thus, by diagnosing and treating the musculoskeletal system, he believed that physicians could treat a variety of diseases and spare patients the negative side-effects of drugs.|$|E
500|$|Friedman argued {{further that}} other {{advantages}} of the negative income tax were that it could fit directly into the tax system, would be less costly, and would reduce the administrative burden of implementing a social safety net. Friedman reiterated these arguments 18 years later in Free to Choose, with the additional proviso that such a reform would only be satisfactory if it replaced {{the current system of}} welfare programs rather than augment it. According to economist Robert H. Frank, writing in The New York Times, Friedman's views in this regard were <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> belief that while [...] "market forces... accomplish wonderful things", they [...] "cannot ensure a distribution of income that enables all citizens to meet basic economic needs".|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} editors writing for People also praised the record's [...] "fresh and original" [...] melodies and [...] "quick-tempoed cool", adding, [...] "Kudos to Green Day, young punk's reigning purists, for {{sticking}} {{with what they}} know best." [...] Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "mature songwriting that really makes this album tick", noting that [...] "Naturally, a couple of thrash 'n' bash hard-core paeans are included, but they're surrounded by songs that are surprisingly varied in character and <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pop aesthetic that evokes a gaggle of great tunesmiths." [...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If Green Day still has a loyal following, its fans are bound {{to find something to}} like on Nimrod; for all the attempts at diversity, the record is packed with mile-wide hooks and sing-along anthems." ...|$|E

500|$|Bruce Feirstein, who {{had worked}} on GoldenEye, wrote the initial script. Feirstein claimed that his {{inspiration}} was his own experience working with journalism, stating that he aimed to [...] "write something that was <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nightmare of reality." [...] Feirstein's script was then passed to Spottiswoode, who gathered seven Hollywood screenwriters in London to brainstorm, eventually choosing Nicholas Meyer to perform rewrites. The script was also worked on by Dan Petrie, Jr. and David Campbell Wilson before Feirstein was brought in for a final polish. (Although Feirstein retained sole writing credit in the film and in the advertising, Meyer, Petrie and Wilson were given credit with Feirstein on the title page of the film's novelization by Raymond Benson.) While many reviewers compared Elliot Carver to Rupert Murdoch, Feirstein based the character on Robert Maxwell. There is {{a reference to the}} mogul's death when M instructs Moneypenny to issue a press release stating that Carver died “falling overboard on his yacht." ...|$|E
500|$|Chatterjee's view of Larkin is <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{detailed}} analysis of his poetic style. He notes a development from Larkin's early works to his later ones, which sees his style change from [...] "verbal opulence through {{a recognition of the}} self-ironising and self-negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual incompatibles – which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives, between abstracts and concretes, between fallings and risings and between singleness and multiplicity – are found to be the last stumbling-block for an artist aspiring to rise above the impasse of worldliness". This contrasts with an older view that Larkin's style barely changed {{over the course of his}} poetic career. Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by Bernard Bergonzi's comment that [...] "Larkin's poetry did not ... develop between 1955 and 1974". For Chatterjee, Larkin's poetry responds strongly to changing [...] "economic, socio-political, literary and cultural factors".|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers praised its music's [...] "depth and complexity", {{adding that}} it [...] "highlights his focused {{language}} skills within musical settings that touch upon rock, electro, dubstep and classical fanfare, <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> thick bottom that guarantees plenty of booty bounce". Gregg Lipkin of PopMatters praised the album's [...] "shifting tones and musical invention". Sean Fennessey of Spin praised its bass-heavy tracks and called Big Boi [...] "a deceptively elegant rhymer". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen commented on Big Boi's performance, [...] "He's got an inimitably slick and speedy flow and a personality bigger and more forceful than anything his producers can throw at him". Pitchforks Tom Breihan called the album [...] "inventive, bizarre, joyous, and masterful" [...] and stated [...] "He just does so many things with his voice and cadence, letting his words fall over the snares one moment and fighting upstream against the beat the next [...] blissfully free of both old-man hectoring and drug-rap nihilism".|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{have held}} {{different}} {{opinions about the}} royal touch, ranging from deprecation in the 19th and early 20th century to more sympathetic treatment. The Whig politician Lord Macaulay (1800–1859) ridiculed it as an [...] "absurd superstition of a pre-enlightened age". The University of London medicine professor Sir Raymund Crawfurd published a study in 1911, revealing his fascination with the [...] "dubious if exotic" [...] practice. A study by the French historian Marc Bloch followed in 1924. Bloch was baffled by the tenacity of the esoteric practice and agreed with Lord Macaulay's assessment that it was <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> form of mass hysteria. Recently, however, historians have avoided attributing {{the popularity of the}} royal touch to naivety of the masses. The British historian Keith Thomas discussed the royal touch in the context of religion and magic, while his colleague and compatriot J. C. D. Clark attributes the survival of the practice into the 18th century to the persisting notion of the divine right of kings.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The {{plot of the}} episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of Under the Radar gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that [...] "this new episode is rarely grounded {{in any kind of}} reality. The best examples of The Simpsons center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what is wrong with the show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes,... definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fairly real world of Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters. I'd like to see more of that. I miss them." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan's voice also {{received}} critical attention. New York Times critic Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as [...] "a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronk's." [...] David Bowie, in his tribute, [...] "Song for Bob Dylan", described Dylan's singing as [...] "a voice like sand and glue". His voice continued to develop {{as he began}} to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] as [...] "at once young and jeeringly cynical". As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal Oral Tradition, [...] "Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs—this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in [...] "Everything is Broken" [...] (on the album Oh Mercy) is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> concrete sonic reality." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{the book}} concludes, Gladwell {{writes about the}} unique roots of his Jamaican mother, Joyce, a {{descendant}} of African slaves. Joyce attended University College in London, where she met {{and fell in love}} with Graham Gladwell, a young mathematician. After moving together to Canada, Graham became a math professor and Joyce a writer and therapist. While Gladwell acknowledges his mother's ambition and intelligence, he also points out opportunities offered to his parents that helped them live a life better than those of other slave descendants in the West Indies. Gladwell also explains that, in the 18th century, a white plantation owner in Jamaica bought a female slave and made her his mistress. This act inadvertently saved the slave and her offspring from a life of brutal servitude. As one of the slave's descendants, this turn of luck led to Gladwell's relatively successful position in life. Summarizing the publication, Gladwell notes that success [...] "is not exceptional or mysterious. It is <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky", and at the end of the book, he remarks, [...] "Outliers wasn't intended as autobiography. But you could read it as an extended apology for my success." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{worked to}} incorporate 1980s fashion {{into the show}} {{in a way that}} [...] "felt fun, definitely, but also <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reality where [...] could tell dramatic stories." [...] The styles featured were therefore constructed so that viewers would not be distracted from an emotional scene by characters wearing 1980s makeup, hairstyles, or shoulder pads. In addition, show makers wanted to make the series feel [...] "like something that you'd {{want to be a part}} of, rather than make fun of", and that young women would be inspired by the clothing styles featured in the spin-off as well as on Gossip Girl. During flashbacks in [...] "Valley Girls", Lily dresses in two styles of clothing. She appears in a preppy, upper-crust riding outfit while associating with her rich parents, but changes into a dress more typical of the [...] "underground punk-rock scene" [...] after running away to the San Fernando Valley. Snow describes her hairstyle as [...] "a little teased, feathered like Farrah Fawcett with curly bangs like Brooke Shields." [...] In present-day scenes, Blair and Serena both attend Prom in designer dresses; Blair dons a black and gold gown from the Marchesa Spring 2008 collection, while Serena wears a pink halter dress from the Christian Dior Spring 2009 collection. Belinda Goldsmith of Reuters cited the episode's Prom scene as an example of the media's glamorization of U.S. formal dances, which she says has caused the cost of formal dances around the world to rise.|$|E
500|$|In early 2003, Nolan {{approached}} Warner Bros. {{with the}} idea {{to make a new}} Batman film. Fascinated by the character and story, he wanted to make a film <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "relatable" [...] world more reminiscent of a classical drama than a comic-book fantasy. Batman Begins, the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, premiered in June 2005 to both critical acclaim and commercial success. Starring Christian Bale in the title role, along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson, the film revived the franchise, heralding a trend towards darker films which rebooted (or retold) backstories. It tells the origin story of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham City. Praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance, Kyle Smith of The New York Post called it [...] "a wake-up call to the people who keep giving us cute capers about men in tights. It wipes the smirk {{off the face of the}} superhero movie." [...] Batman Begins was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2005 in the United States and the year's ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards. On the film's 10th anniversary, Forbes published an article describing its influence: [...] "Reboot became part of our modern vocabulary, and superhero origin stories became increasingly en vogue for the genre. The phrase [...] "dark and gritty" [...] likewise joined the cinematic lexicon, influencing our perception of different approaches to storytelling not only in the comic book film genre but in all sorts of other genres as well." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the first season of Luke Cage, The Atlantics David Sims wrote on the pacing issue of Marvel's Netflix series, a common {{complaint}} to that point, stating, [...] "After two seasons of Daredevil, one of Jessica Jones, and now one of Luke Cage, the Netflix model feels fundamentally flawed, encouraging the kind of molasses-slow plotting comic books are designed to eschew. The problem isn’t that these shows are bad, necessarily... But they all take far too long to get going, by which point many viewers will have already tuned out." [...] He felt one of the problems was the fact that Netflix does not rely on viewers tuning into a particular series as broadcast series do each week, but rather subscribers who, if they lose interest, [...] "can take as long as they want to catch up... as long as they keep paying their subscription fee every month." [...] The Netflix series are also afforded the opportunity to explore elements in more detail, with Sims noting [...] "A lot of this detail [...] good, {{but it could have been}} considerably compressed—none of the Marvel Netflix series, so far, would have lost much by being squeezed into 10 episodes, or even 8. If Netflix shaved the 60-minute running time down quite a bit, it would likely inspire more economical—and better—storytelling from its shows." [...] Sims concluded by saying, [...] "What’s most frustrating of all is that Netflix isn’t getting rid of this approach anytime soon. Daredevil season three, Jessica Jones season two, Iron Fist, and The Punisher are all on their way, and each will follow the same 13-episode structure... The only respite may come in the form of The Defenders, a planned crossover series... over the course of just eight episodes. Who knows? The show might even surprise viewers and explain its villain’s motivations within the first hour. Until then, fans will be stuck needlessly giving over entire days to these series, while others are deterred from watching at all." [...] In her review for the first season of Iron Fist, Allison Keene of Collider.com spoke more on the pacing of Marvel's Netflix series, stating, [...] "By focusing so intently on making these series... much more <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gritty real world than what we typically expect from a superhero show (like DC's candy-colored [...] on The CW), the problem is that they miss out on the key element: this [...] be fantastical entertainment." [...] With The Defenders, Jeff Jansen of Entertainment Weekly felt many improvements were made to the general complaints the previous seasons received. He said, [...] "The Defenders is far from perfect. But it’s an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations that I hope Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist. If Danny Rand must persist, add him to the other shows and let the stronger players carry him." ...|$|E
