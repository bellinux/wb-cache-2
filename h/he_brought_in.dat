Intended to run to twenty volumes, Histoire des Civilizations folded after just five.|$|E
5|$|Dooley {{also changed}} {{position}} coaches, naming Terry Joseph defensive backs coach and Eric Russell special teams coach. To coach quarterbacks, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> Darin Hinshaw of Memphis. He hired Charlie Baggett to coach wide receivers {{and serve as}} assistant head coach, and added assistant coach Harry Hiestand and strength and conditioning coach Bennie Wylie. He retained offensive coordinator Jim Chaney from Kiffin's staff.|$|E
5|$|Albert Balink, a Dutch journalist, {{began work}} on {{what was to become}} Pareh in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> two of the Wong brothers, Chinese filmmakers who had been {{inactive}} since making Zuster Theresia (Sister Theresa) in 1932. The Wongs donated their studio– an old tapioca flour factory– as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much of the funding came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the money came from the cinema mogul Buse, while EYE Film Institute records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen and meant to promote migration from Java to Sumatra.|$|E

5|$|Baker was {{promoted}} to temporary captain and made a flight commander in No.4 Squadron on 24 October. Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant Thomas Barkell led a formation of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near Tournai in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to shoot the Fokker down out of control. In all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{finished}} the 1947 {{season with a}} 12–1–1 win-loss-tie record and beat the New York Yankees to win its second straight AAFC championship. While the team was successful in those {{first two years of}} existence, head coach Paul Brown made numerous roster changes before the 1948 season. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> linebacker Alex Agase and defensive tackle Chubby Grigg via a trade with the Chicago Rockets. Tommy James, a defensive back who stayed with the team through the 1955 season, came from the National Football League's Detroit Lions. Defensive back Warren Lahr also joined the team but did not play in 1948 after breaking a leg in the preseason.|$|E
5|$|In 1531, the ikki {{control of}} Kaga was of such {{dominance}} that a conflict for leadership within the Hongan-ji embroiled the province {{in a civil}} war, often called the Daishō-Ikki, or Big League-Little League, war. A faction led by Renjun, a son of Rennyo, {{came to power in}} the Hongan-ji, and was hostile to the three main Kaga temples. In the resultant war, the three Kaga temples were backed by the Togashi clan, other powerful vassals, local Hongan-ji priests, and the ikki based in Echizen. Renjun was backed by many of the smaller temples and emerged victorious from the conflict when <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> an Ikkō-Ikki army from Mikawa Province. Togashi Taneyasu was exiled, as were the other opposition leaders, and the position of shugo abolished.|$|E

5|$|Taylor {{took over}} as manager of Derby County in November 1982, to the great {{surprise}} of {{most people in the}} game. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> Roy McFarland as his assistant, and signed Archie Gemmill and Bobby Davison. At the time Derby were going through serious financial problems and were bottom of the table, but he steered them to a mid-table position {{by the end of the}} season with a 15-match unbeaten run. In the Third Round of the FA Cup on 8 January 1983 they knocked out Clough's Forest team with a 2–0 win at the Baseball Ground. They reached the Fifth Round, where they were knocked out by Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|West {{took over}} a year and {{invested}} two million dollars towards the construction of Late Registration. The majority of the recording sessions for the album took place at Sony Music Studios in New York City and at The Record Plant in Hollywood, California; other sessions took place at Chalice Recording Studios and Grandmaster Recording Studios in Hollywood. He began working in the studio after he finished touring with Usher on the R singer's The Truth Tour. By November 2004, West had completed nearly seventy-five percent of the album. However he felt unsatisfied with its outcome and in March of the following year, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> Jon Brion, which drastically altered the project's direction.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore was far {{and away}} the most {{successful}} of any American CFL team on the field and off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal. Perhaps most remarkably, they were reported to have turned a profit in their first year after an initial US$7 million investment by Speros.|$|E

5|$|The sale of star midfielder Joey Beauchamp to West Ham for a club record £1million allowed Smith {{money to}} spend in the {{transfer}} market, and he spent £100,000 each on Norwich City midfielder David Smith and Sunderland striker David Rush. Oxford formed a strong promotion push in 1994–95, but were knocked out of the FA Cup {{in the first round}} by non-League Marlow. In February 1995, he spent £60,000 on Hartlepool United's Phil Gilchrist, who would form a highly effective centre-back partnership with Elliott. Oxford finished the season in seventh place, six points outside the play-offs. In November 1995, Smith re-signed Beauchamp for £300,000, who continued his excellent form after returning to his native Oxfordshire. The next month <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> striker Martin Aldridge on a free transfer. The club were 14th in January 1996, but lost only once in their last 17 matches of 1995–96 in a tremendous {{second half of the season}} that saw them climb 12 places to win promotion as runners-up. At the end of the season, Smith became a director of the club.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved on}} to Ipswich Town in 1969 {{and it was there}} that he {{established}} his reputation as a successful manager, supported by the club chairman John Cobbold and then later by his brother Patrick Cobbold. He won the vacant job at the Suffolk club after a chance encounter with Town director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton. After four mediocre seasons, Robson led Ipswich to fourth place in the First Division and success in the Texaco Cup in the 1972–73 season. In the following nine seasons, Ipswich finished lower than sixth place in the First Division only once, in the 1977–78 season. However, that season was a success with a 1–0 victory over Arsenal] in the FA Cup final. His reign at Ipswich lasted 13 years, during which time the club twice finished as League runners-up, and made regular appearances in European competitions, capturing the UEFA Cup in 1981 with a 5–4 aggregate victory over Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar. During his 13-year tenure, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> only 14 players from other clubs, most notably Allan Hunter, Bryan Hamilton and Paul Mariner, relying instead on players developed through Ipswich's youth programmes, including Terry Butcher, George Burley, John Wark, Mick Mills, Colin Viljoen, Alan Brazil, Trevor Whymark, Brian Talbot, Kevin Beattie and Eric Gates, who all went on to play international football. His imports included Dutch players Frans Thijssen and Arnold Mühren. Robson was not a tactical genius but he showed a talent for developing new players, with his good interpersonal skills, caring attitude, hard work and enthusiasm helping them to achieve their best.|$|E

25|$|His {{record in}} the {{transfer}} market was sound. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> England under-23 international Dick Neal to replace Len Boyd, bought wingers Harry Hooper and future England player Mike Hellawell, and gave first professional contracts to youngsters Malcolm Beard and Colin Withers.|$|E
25|$|In May 2006 Cossiga {{gave his}} {{support to the}} {{formation}} of Prodi's second government.

His nephew Zac, who was then working for ISEC, eventually took over the editorship on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|Kaufmann {{wanted a}} plan for the Point that was more urban and {{developed}} than the park others were imagining. In particular, Kaufmann was a major supporter of Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera and wanted to provide it with a permanent building. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> Wright, by that time a preeminent architect, who had done numerous other projects for Kaufmann in the past, including Kaufmann's landmark home at Fallingwater and an unbuilt design for a parking garage.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s Robertson was {{a railway}} company promoter, {{initially}} working in 1833–4 for the London & Greenwich Railway with George Landmann and George Walter. They also employed John Herapath, {{a contributor to}} the Mechanics' Magazine, as an engineer. The subscription list was padded, and, Herapath later alleged, Robertson was responsible. Walter founded the Railway Magazine, having seen the potential in the Mechanics' Magazine and its railway promotion; <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> John Yonge Akerman as its editor.|$|E
