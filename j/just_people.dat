500|$|Fincher had {{previously}} worked with director of photography Harris Savides on Seven (he shot the opening credits) and The Game. Savides loved the script but realized, [...] "there {{was so much}} exposition, <b>just</b> <b>people</b> {{talking on the phone}} or having conversations. It was difficult to imagine how it could be done in a visual way." [...] Fincher and Savides did not want to repeat the look of Seven. The director's approach to Zodiac was to create a look mundane enough that audiences would accept that what they were watching was the truth. The filmmakers also did not want to glamorize the killer or tell the story through his eyes. [...] "That would have turned the story into a first-person-shooter video game. We didn't want to make the sort of movie that serial killers would want to own," [...] Fincher said.|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} U2 songs, [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] can be {{interpreted}} in a religious manner. Author Cameron Conant related the opening verse to the doubt he felt about his convictions on politics, marriage, and faith as he aged, concluding that a person's confidence in their beliefs makes {{it seem as if}} they know more than they do. Music critic Bill Friskics-Warren felt that the final line, [...] "Blessings not just for the ones who kneel, luckily", was a way for Bono to berate himself for not praying enough, and was an attack on Christianity because [...] "faith often perpetuates the misery and divisiveness that he decries." [...] Steve Stockman, a chaplain at Queen's University of Belfast, believed the song was a metaphor for growing up, and that the final line meant that not <b>just</b> <b>people</b> of faith could be blessed.|$|E

We're <b>just</b> <b>people.</b> #AllLivesMatter," [...] to which Baer responded with a scathing column on Crashburn Alley, a blog affiliated with ESPN, in which he stated that De Fratus is [...] "complicit in perpetuating a system which inflicts violence on those who didn’t {{have the luxury of}} being born white and male and straight and in an economically-stable area." [...] Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, [...] "I sincerely hope that you will take the time to talk to me personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters. I do not apologize for anything I have said. I have a platform and I WILL use it for the agenda of love." ...|$|E
500|$|According to CNN, {{he became}} a drug dealer and used the Bible that his {{grandmother}} gave him as a good luck charm. After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it. He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a [...] "misfit of a person." [...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." [...] He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women [...] "as the emptiness became more profound." [...] At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced {{him that he was}} at a [...] "dead end." [...] Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church. A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife. Lecrae {{was surprised to find that}} the members of the Bible study [...] "were <b>just</b> <b>people</b> like me. [...] They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really what drew me in." [...] Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though [...] "it wasn't overnight" [...] and he [...] "spent a lot of time making bad decisions." ...|$|E

As of September 2014, Rolling Jubilee claims to have cancelled more than $15 million in medical debt and $4 million in private student loan debt.

2500|$|Conference {{attendance}} gets {{much attention}} on Gerbic's bi-weekly segments on the Skeptic Society's Skepticality podcast. She stresses {{how important it}} is for skeptics to attend, and if there aren't conferences nearby, then to create a conference, be it a SkeptiCamp or a Skeptics in the Pub event. She insists that conference attendance is the first step towards activism. [...] "What I do know is that the one-on-one contact recharges our batteries. People like Harriet A. Hall (Skepdoc), Lindsay Beyerstein (co-host of Point of Inquiry), and myself came from CSI’s Skeptic's Toolbox.

2500|$|Indeed, Mailer was outspoken {{about his}} mistrust of {{politics}} in general {{as a way of}} meaningful change in America. [...] In Miami and the Siege of Chicago (1968) he explained his view of [...] "politics-as-property" [...] where he likened politicians to property holders who are [...] "never ambivalent about his land, he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own". [...] Thus politics is <b>just</b> <b>people</b> trading their influence as capital in an attempt to serve their own interests. [...] This cynical view of politicians serving only themselves perhaps explains his views on Watergate. [...] Mailer saw politics as a sporting event: [...] "If you played for a team, you did your best to play very well, but there was something obscene… with in starting to think there was more moral worth to Michigan than Ohio State." [...] Mailer thought that Nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team. [...] President Johnson on the other hand, Mailer thought, was just as bad as Nixon had been, but he had had good charisma so all was forgiven.|$|E

2500|$|Sin Vega of Rock, Paper, Shotgun {{received}} VA-11 HALL-A generally positively. He {{found the}} writing to be [...] "decent" [...] {{and the characters}} [...] "generally enjoyable, even when they're not exactly likeable", and praised the game's references to current pop-culture issues and internet climate, for example 4chan, human augmentation and manufactured pop stars. The music and gameplay were also complimented, but the game's presentation was criticised– especially {{the presentation of the}} dialogue, which only takes up a few lines per page. Caty McCarthy of Kill Screen wrote that VA-11 HALL-A [...] "flips the atypical ways of cyberpunk", and lauded the game's story, which [...] "has heart" [...] as a [...] "story of its people, its liliths, its sentient preserved-brains, its talking dogs. It's the story of Jill and her customers, all being lost, and eventually finding their way." [...] She compared it also to a good book, where [...] "we, the player, take the backseat, and soak it all in." [...] A final score of 80/100 was awarded. Zack Kotzer, writing for Motherboard, compared VA-11 HALL-A to [...] "Ghost in the Shell meets Cheers", and added that what makes the game engaging is that it chooses to focus on [...] "one very specific corner" [...] of a complex world, writing [...] "sure, there's an urban war brewing outside, but inside this [...] is <b>just</b> <b>people.</b> Chatter about current events and politics, morality, and sex." ...|$|E

[...] Scruggs and Certain began dating and fell in love. They were married {{about a year and a}} half later in April 1948. When Flatt and Scruggs formed the new group, Scruggs had done most of the bookings for the band, but being on the road for hours in a car and stopping at a phone booth to communicate with venues, often at odd hours, was difficult. Louise had a business aptitude and began helping by doing the phone work. She eventually became the [...] booking agent and ultimately the group's manager, Nashville's first female to become prominent in that role. Her acumen and skills in the job were prescient. She turned the band into TV personalities, and helped propel them into what today would be called rock stars, touring with Joan Baez and performing at the prestigious Newport Folk Festival. [...] She recruited noted artist Thomas B. Allen, who had done covers for The New Yorker and Sports Illustrated to create cover illustrations for 17 of the group's albums. She helped market the group to younger audiences at college campuses and arranged a live album to be recorded at Carnegie Hall. Earl Scruggs said, [...] "What talent I had never would have peaked without her. She helped shape music up as a business, instead of <b>just</b> <b>people</b> out picking and grinning". [...] Louise died on February 2, 2006 at age 78, predeceasing her husband by six years.
