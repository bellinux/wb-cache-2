40|$|Abstract. The ultra-fine denier PET full <b>drawing</b> <b>yarn</b> (PET-FDY) with {{monofilament}} {{linear density}} equal to 0. 38 dTex was produced. During the practical process of ultrafine denier PET-FDY, the yarn should be heat-set at certain temperature following the drawing process {{in order to}} improve the mechanical properties and reduce the boiling water shrinkage. The influence of heat-setting temperature on the structure and performance of ultra-fine denier PET FDY was studied in this paper. With heat-setting temperature increasing, crystalline in PET FDY became perfect and crystallite size became bigger. According to the density method, crystallinity was augmented. Crystal orientation factor and overall orientation factor were both increased. The tenacity and tensile stress at 10 % strain of PET FDY were increased and the breakage percentage and boiling water shrinkage were reduced with the heat-setting temperature increasing...|$|R

As a result, the dispersibility of TiO 2 particles in a PET matrix is found to depend on the particle size and its surface characteristics. Surface modification of TiO 2 by dimethyl polysiloxane resulted in the improved dispersibility and affinity of TiO 2 particles in the PET matrix. Especially, residence time, mixing temperature, and mixing shear rate in the new line injection system under the SDY spinning process were very important parameters to minimize the agglomeration of TiO 2 particles. The FD SDY prepared by the new line injection system was superior to those using the polymerization process and the conventional masterbatch chip dosing process in the color-L and color-b values of the fibers...|$|R

25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short <b>draw</b> creates worsted <b>yarns,</b> and long <b>draw</b> creates woollen <b>yarns.</b> Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|R

50|$|Although crochet may be {{done with}} ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by {{spinning}} fibers. In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or S-twist yarn. If the fibers are first aligned by combing them and the spinner uses a worsted type drafting method such as the short forward <b>draw,</b> the <b>yarn</b> is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed and the spinner uses a woolen drafting method such as the long backward <b>draw,</b> the <b>yarn</b> is fuzzier and called woolen-spun. The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, {{or they may be}} staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning. The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn. In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension. The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.|$|R

40|$|Air {{drag force}} on a nylon {{monofilament}} yarn in a confined jet was measured {{as a basic}} study for operating yarn by airflow, for example; for weft-insertion, for holding the yarn end, for adjusting yarn tension and for <b>drawing</b> <b>yarn</b> into a hollow spindle. The relative velocity of airflow around a yarn was expanded up to 300 m/s. Previously, this had been investigated up to 100 m/s. Both the supplying air pressure and combinations of nozzles and pipes changed diffusion of the flow in a pipe. Air drag force increased extremely if the primary stream acted on the yarn directly when the jet from the nozzle was directed at very high speed (around sonic velocity). Yarn was often stuck inside the pipe by the airflow when very thin pipes were used. When this occurred, air drag force was reduced to half. The air drag coefficient Cf for monofilament yarn has been arranged using the radius Reynolds number, Rea, for suction flow with lower than 100 m/s. The formula, Cf = KRea-n, has been applied for suction flow under 500 in Rea. Cf could be arranged {{in the same manner}} for annular jet or confined jet if airflow acted on a yarn in the pipe uniformly. This formula, then, is also available even for very high velocity over 100 m/s. According to these results, we were able to calculate air drag force on monofilament yam.

40|$|Rotor spun yarn, {{despite its}} growing popularity, suffers the {{disadvantages}} of lower tenacity, limited count range, and harsh {{handle of the}} resulting fabrics. Therefore, this work probes the possibility of eliminating these drawbacks by using tensile <b>drawing.</b> The <b>yarns</b> are produced with different specifications from the same fibers. The results are encouraging, since contrary to predictions, staple yarns treated this way do perform properly. Tensile drawing especially improves rotor spun yarn quality in terms of structural/mechanical evenness and processability. Other features include increased packing density, reduced yarn diameter, enhanced mechanical rigidity, and even the potential for larger tenacity. The influence of processing variables on yarn properties is also revealed by examining {{the contribution of the}} number of yarn loops mounted on the feed roller and rewinding to drawing and the resulting products. The number of yarn loops wound on the feed roller is significant in terms of drawing tension. Optimum drawing can be obtained without rewinding in terms of better yarn properties and economics, though rewinding can effectively eliminate fiber breakage. Moreover, the truely critical factor in the drawing extent should be drawing tension rather than the so-called drawing ratio. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|PP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{synthetic}} textiles. It is a synthetic polymer for the production of textile products. It is widely used because of its cheap production expenditures, universal utilization, easy recycling, and good mechanical features. In addition, polypropylene is flexible and firm, but in a low temperature it can become very fragile. Polypropylene is not resistant to aging – features deteriorate, it decomposes from light exposure, dampness, and warmth. 	PP materials are commonly used in various spheres: agriculture, chemistry, food industry, manufacturing, and others that may require firm and reliable packaging; initial and secondary carpet production, secondary fabrics, geotextile, cable and rope production. Thanks to their durability, light weight and usage simplicity, they are popularly used for pre-packing and transporting such goods as: flour, sugar, composite forage, grains and seeds, fertilizer, manufacturing materials, wood granules, second-hand clothes, cement.

In the centre of the analysis is tape <b>yarn</b> <b>drawing</b> ratios influence on their structure and stretch characteristics. The width, thickness and weight of PP tape yarn was measured, additionally, the statistical calculations were made: calculation of mean, absolute error, relative error, and variation coefficient. The stretch test was carried out until the absolute yarn breakage. Experimental results were analyzed in detail. After the analysis of PP tape yarn, it was concluded, that the yarn and product weight, as well as the strength features, were dependant on the drawing ratio. 	The features of textile products that were made from polypropylene (affected by mechanical forces and environmental factors) get worse, the elasticity contracts, the level of fragility and breakage rises, rigidity appears. Because of these factors, products tend to lose firmness, and there is a higher chance of cracking and tearing. 	To achieve precision, three different drawing ratios were used for the polypropylene tape yarn strength feature test. Tests showed that on the lowest drawing ration (A- 6, 002), polypropylene tape yarn is the thickest, widest, heaviest, and has the biggest height density, but from the perspective of consumption, it is a big flaw. The conducted conclusion is that for consumption purposes it is best to use the biggest <b>drawing</b> ratio <b>yarn</b> (C- 6, 869).
