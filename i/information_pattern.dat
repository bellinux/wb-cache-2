He demonstrated that the <b>information</b> <b>pattern</b> of a three-dimensional object can be encoded in a beam of light, which is more-or-less two-dimensional. Gabor also developed a mathematical model for demonstrating a holographic associative memory. One of Gabor's colleagues, Pieter Jacobus Van Heerden, also developed a related holographic mathematical memory model in 1963. This model contained the key aspect of non-locality, which became important years later when, in 1967, experiments by both Braitenberg and Kirschfield showed that exact localization of memory in the brain was false.|$|E

40|$|A seller-buyer {{supply chain}} {{represents}} a network {{consisting of a}} seller who wholesales a product to a buyer, who in turn retails it to the consumer. Most seller-buyer supply chains are modeled by non-cooperative and cooperative games under a deterministic and symmetric <b>information</b> <b>pattern.</b> Under a symmetric <b>information</b> <b>pattern,</b> the seller and buyer have complete information on each other&# 039;s operations. However, in a supply chain, the buyer and seller, being independent entities, have private information about various aspects of their businesses which are not common knowledge. In this paper, several seller-buyer supply chain models are proposed under an asymmetric <b>information</b> <b>pattern.</b> The proposed models rely {{on the fact that}} the seller&# 039;s setup/purchase costs are unknown to the buyer and the buyer withholds certain information related to market demand. The relationships between seller and buyer are modeled by non-cooperative Stackelberg games where buyer and seller take turn as leader and follower. In addition, a semi-cooperative model, where sharing marketing expenditure is used as an incentive strategy to reveal information, is proposed. Finally, numerical examples presented in this paper, including sensitivity analysis of some key parameters, seek to compare results between the different models considered...|$|E

First, "novelty" is redefined {{based on the}} proposed <b>information</b> <b>patterns,</b> and several different types of <b>information</b> <b>patterns</b> are given corresponding to different types of users&# 039; information needs.

Finally, a unified information-pattern-based approach to novelty detection (ip-BAND) is presented for both specific NE topics and more general topics. Experiments on novelty detection on data from the TREC 2002, 2003 and 2004 novelty tracks show that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of novelty detection in terms of precision at top ranks.

40|$|In this paper, for linear time-invariant plants, where a {{collection}} of possible inputs and outputs are known a priori, we {{address the problem of}} determining the communication between outputs and inputs, i. e., information patterns, such that desired control objectives of the closed-loop system (for instance, stabilizability) through static output feedback may be ensured. We address this problem in the structural system theoretic context. To this end, given a specified structural pattern (locations of zeros/non-zeros) of the plant matrices, we introduce the concept of essential information patterns, i. e., communication patterns between outputs and inputs that satisfy the following conditions: (i) ensure arbitrary spectrum assignment of the closed-loop system, using static output feedback constrained to the <b>information</b> <b>pattern,</b> for almost all possible plant instances with the specified structural pattern; and (ii) any communication failure precludes the resulting <b>information</b> <b>pattern</b> from attaining the pole placement objective in (i). Subsequently, we study the problem of determining essential information patterns. First, we provide several necessary and sufficient conditions to verify whether a specified <b>information</b> <b>pattern</b> is essential or not. Further, we show that such conditions can be verified by resorting to algorithms with polynomial complexity (in the dimensions of the state, input and output). Although such verification can be performed efficiently, it is shown that the problem of determining essential information patterns is in general NP-hard. The main results of the paper are illustrated through examples...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} {{of new information}} in a document stream {{is an important component}} of many potential applications. In this work, a new novelty detection approach based on the identification of sentence level <b>information</b> <b>patterns</b> is proposed. First, the information- pattern concept for novelty detection is presented with the emphasis on new <b>information</b> <b>patterns</b> for general topics (queries) that cannot be simply turned into specific questions whose answers are specific named entities (NEs). Then we elaborate a thorough analysis of sentence level <b>information</b> <b>patterns</b> on data from the TREC novelty tracks, including sentence lengths, named entities, sentence level opinion patterns. This analysis provides guidelines in applying those patterns in novelty detection particularly for the general topics. Finally, a unified pattern-based approach is presented to novelty detection for both general and specific topics. The new method for dealing with general topics will be the focus. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of novelty detection for general topics as well as the overall performance for all topics from the 2002 - 2004 TREC novelty tracks...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{distributed}} estimation and control problems over graphs under partially nested information patterns. We show a duality result {{that is very}} similar to the classical duality result between state estimation and state feedback control with a classical <b>information</b> <b>pattern,</b> under the condition that the disturbances entering different systems on the graph are uncorrelated. The distributed estimation problem decomposes into $N$ separate estimation problems, where $N$ is the number of interconnected subsystems over the graph, and the solution to each subproblem is simply the optimal Kalman filter. This also gives the solution to the distributed control problem due to the duality of distributed estimation and control under partially nested <b>information</b> <b>pattern.</b> We then consider a weighted distributed estimation problem, where we get coupling between the estimators, and separation between the estimators is not possible. We propose a solution based on linear quadratic team decision theory, which provides a generalized Riccati equation for teams. We show that the weighted estimation problem is the dual to a distributed state feedback problem, where the disturbances entering the interconnected systems are correlated.
