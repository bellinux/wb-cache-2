When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, <b>flicking</b> the <b>light</b> switch on and off.|$|R

5000|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in paranormal phenomena such as psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as <b>flicking</b> a <b>light</b> switch) in a reliable way, but the processes connecting the two are not consciously accessible. Hence though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory, called [...] "apparent mental causation", acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This could happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link.|$|R

2500|$|It must {{be noted}} that {{anglicism}} is a political term and does not necessarily indicate the etymology or history of the word itself. Rather, it indicates the common attitudes and perceptions about the (theoretically English) history of the word. For example, because English itself borrowed a great amount of French vocabulary after the Norman Conquest, some anglicisms are actually Old French words that dropped from usage in French over the centuries but were preserved in English and have now come full circle back into French. For instance, one attested origin of the verb [...] "to flirt" [...] cites influence from the Old French expression conter fleurette, which means [...] "to (try to) seduce". (Other possible origins for the word include flit, E. Frisian flirt (a <b>flick</b> or <b>light</b> stroke) and E. Frisian flirtje (a giddy girl)). This expression is no longer used in French, but the English Gallicism [...] "to flirt" [...] has now returned to French and is considered an anglicism, despite its likely French origins.|$|R

Several small fires were reported that season. After those incidents, the city of Mountain View commissioned methane testing studies to define the location of methane vapors emanating from the soil within the amphitheater. These tests were used in developing a design for improved methane monitoring and more efficient methane extraction to assure the amphitheater became safe as an outdoor venue. Ultimately, the lawn was removed, a gas barrier and methane removal equipment were installed, and then the lawn was re-installed.|$|R

25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as <b>flicking</b> a <b>light</b> switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|R
5000|$|On 30 April 2012, Dale Oen {{collapsed}} in the shower at his training camp in Flagstaff, Arizona. When his teammates thought he was spending a long time showering, they {{knocked on the door}} and <b>flicked</b> the <b>light</b> on and off, to which there was no response. They then broke in the door and began administering CPR until the ambulance arrived. Dale Oen was transferred to hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival, aged 26. An initial autopsy was inconclusive, but a second revealed that Dale Oen suffered from severe atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, with the three main coronary arteries feeding his myocardium up to 90 percent occluded by atherosclerotic plaque, as well as an enlarged heart, and that he died of a myocardial infarction. The autopsy also revealed that he had suffered a series of small heart attacks in the months prior to his death, which apparently went unrecognised. He had experienced pain that radiated down his arm, and into his shoulder, face and chest, but this was attributed to a shoulder injury and a pinched nerve. The only conventional risk factors Dale Oen had for heart disease were a [...] "slightly elevated cholesterol level" [...] and the fact that his grandfather died suddenly at 42, of an unknown cause. His death reminded many of the death of fellow athlete Sergei Grinkov, who also died of coronary artery disease seventeen years earlier at age 28.

Data of Pre-color adaption and that of post-color adaption have been compared and ① Evidence of opponent effect is found. This result is contraversary to coefficient law and the "two process" hypothesis are supported; ② Opponent effect is strongly related to the kinds of stimuli ③ When the background <b>light</b> <b>flicks,</b> subjects sensitivity to target stimuli is obviously increased while under the condition of flicking target stimuli less increase can be found. But the increase in sensitivity seem to be not related with color adaption. 本实验采用最小步骤法对色适应过程中，人眼对色目标感受性的变化及有关问题进行了研究。实验是在 6 °视角背景适应光中，将 1 °视角的目标刺激叠加在背景光中心，让被试进行最小差别阈限辨别。目标和背景分别进行时间市制（闪烁）（闪烁频率为 2 H_Z－ 5 H_Z），并且有目标与背景光刺激的不同的呈现组合方式的变化。实验结果表明，①当对目标刺激进行时间市制时，比较色适应前及适应后的人眼对色光目标的感受性的变化，发现了明显的颉抗效应，这与系数律相矛盾，但支持两过程假设。②不同呈现组合方式对结果能否出现颉抗效应有明显影响。③在对背景光进行时间调制时，与前对目标色光实行时间调制情形相比，被试对目标的感受性有明显增加，但这似乎与色适应无关...|$|R

To fly it to the museum, Major Clyde Good intended to follow an F-100 being delivered the same day. After an en route refuelling stop the two aircraft became separated, and Good was forced to follow roads to the St. Louis area when it turned dark and overcast. The aircraft was not equipped with cockpit or instrument lighting, so Good periodically <b>flicked</b> his Zippo <b>lighter</b> to read the instruments. Guessing a heading, he flew close enough to Dayton to be seen on radar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and was talked down to the runway. It was then that Good discovered that the landing lights had not been installed either, but he was able to successfully land the plane while using the Zippo to light the airspeed indicator through the approach.|$|R
50|$|Eight Days {{was officially}} {{announced}} {{in a trailer}} that was played during Sony's E3 2006 Press Conference. The trailer began with a scene of two men staring at guns inside {{the trunk of a}} car. The trailer then cuts to a group of people standing in the Arizona desert. It then cuts to a scene in which passengers in two separate sports cars are shooting at each other. After being shot at, one of the cars flips over, destroying it. The other car arrives at the spot where the group of people were standing. They then engage in a gun battle with the two men from the first scene. The fight continues, and eventually the two men run off as a tanker truck slides and crashes into a diner, causing an explosion. The trailer then cuts to the logo of the game. A final scene after the logo is displayed shows one of the men picking up a lighter from the body of a dead enemy. He then <b>flicks</b> open the <b>lighter</b> and drops it in the gasoline from the tanker. As he walks away an explosion occurs.|$|R
40|$|Does {{the mere}} {{presence}} of the things we have tended to influence our actions systematically, in ways that escape our awareness? For example, while entering a tool shed, does perceiving objects that we once tended to (e. g., tools, musical instruments) influence how we then execute a simple action (e. g., <b>flicking</b> the shed¿s <b>light</b> switch) ? Ancient traditions (e. g., feng shui) and contemporary approaches to action production (e. g., continuous flow and cascade models) hypothesize that the answer is yes. Although relevant to several fields (e. g., motor cognition, social cognition), for various reasons this hypothesis cannot be tested by traditional choiceresponse time interference paradigms, which involve more complex processes than our tool shed scenario. Using new paradigms that resemble detection tasks, three studies demonstrated that "very incidental" actionrelated distracters systematically interfere with simple, repeated actions that involve minimal response selection and decision-making processes. In Study 2, incidental musical notation interfered more with the simple actions of expert sight-readers than with the same actions of non-musicians. A similar pattern of effects was obtained with a fully experimental design. The implications for theories of action production, environmentally-driven automaticity, and social cognition are discussed...|$|R
