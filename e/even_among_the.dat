5|$|At its height, {{the second}} city {{was the home}} of about 40,000 people. This {{population}} was East-Semitic speaking one, and used a dialect much similar {{to the language of}} Ebla (the Eblaite language), while the Shakkanakku period had an East-Semitic Akkadian speaking population. West Semitic names started to be attested in Mari since the second kingdom era, and by the middle Bronze-Age, the west Semitic Amorite tribes became the majority of the pastoral groups in the middle Euphrates and Khabur valleys. Amorite names started to be observed in the city {{toward the end of the}} Shakkanakku period, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> ruling dynasty members.|$|E
5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> younger fans who {{had never seen the}} band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion. At the 2011 reunion of Malón, Claudio O'Connor said that their personal conflicts with Iorio would not allow it and that they would not reunite the band if the four members do not have a good personal relationship.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{so close}} {{was the great}} house, and so minute a watch was kept, that the fact of Lord Ivinghoe's {{spending}} the whole day at the parsonage was known, and conclusions were arrived at. Maura stole down in <b>the</b> late <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> olive trees, ostensibly to ask Anna and Francie to come {{and listen to the}} nightingales.|$|R

50|$|The {{relationship}} between Islam {{and domestic violence}} is disputed. <b>Even</b> <b>among</b> Muslims, <b>the</b> uses and interpretations of sharia, the moral code and religious law of Islam, lack consensus.|$|R
5|$|Most 17th-century Muscovites {{received}} little education, {{and there were}} low levels of literacy <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and {{a small amount of}} history and geography. Religious scholars were usually the exception to this rule and were often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children—Feodor, and his sister Tsarevna Sophia—received a thorough education from the religious scholars of Kiev, and could speak Latin and Polish.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli was {{initially}} {{brought up in}} a pro-Ottoman environment, owing to his family's connections in Istanbul. The restrictions of the Abdul Hamid II era, however, started to be felt around the Ottoman Empire, and discontent was brewing <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> empire's elite. Following the Young Turk Revolution against Abdul Hamid II in 1908, parliamentary elections were called in all provinces, and liberal Arab intellectuals like Shukri al-Asali, Shafiq Muayyad al-Azm, and Rushdi al-Shama'a secured seats as deputies (members of the legislature) representing Damascus. The liberal current that established itself through these figures, and the political dailies they established including al-Qabas ("The Firebrand") and al-Ikha' al-Arabi ("Arab Brotherhood"), greatly influenced Quwatli and other Arab youths.|$|E
5|$|Following his ousting, Peter the Venetian {{took refuge}} in Germany. In response, Samuel stormed Austria in 1042, {{provoking}} a retaliatory invasion by the German monarch, Henry III in 1043. It forced Samuel to renounce all Hungarian territories {{to the west of}} the rivers Leitha and Morava as well as agree to the payment of a tribute. The funding of the tribute payment was through new taxes on the Christian prelates and seizure of Church estates. This policy caused discontent <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> members of Samuel's own council. He had a number of his councillors executed during Lent. In order to punish the king, Bishop Gerard of Csanád (modern-day Cenad, Romania) refused to perform the annual ceremony of putting the royal crown Gerard upon the monarch's head at Easter.|$|E
60|$|We {{advanced}} to the fire, which was an agreeable spectacle after our late ride, during the chillness of an autumn <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> mountains, and first {{attracted the attention of}} the guests who had preceded us, by calling for the landlady. She approached, looking doubtfully and timidly, now at us, now at the other party, and returned a hesitating and doubtful answer to our request to have something to eat.|$|R
60|$|When {{two weeks}} had gone, Grace and Barbara sat one <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> stones by a lake. The evening was calm, {{the sun was}} setting, and {{the shadow of the}} pines {{stretched}} across the tranquil water. Now and then the reflections trembled and a languid ripple broke against the driftwood on the beach. In the distance a loon called, but when its wild cry died away all was very quiet.|$|R

5|$|In Sri Lanka the Sinhala Buddhists also worshiped Kartikeya as Kumaradevio or Skanda-Kumara {{since at}} least the 4th century, if not earlier. Skanda-Kumara was {{known as one of the}} {{guardian}} deities until the 14th century, invoked to protect the island; they are accommodated within the non-theistic Buddhist religion. During the 11th and 12th century CE, the worship of Skanda-Kumara was documented <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> royal family. At some point in the past Skanda-Kumara was identified with the deity in Kataragama shrine, also known as Kataragama deviyo and Kataragama deviyo, became one of the guardian deities of Sri Lanka. Numerous legends have sprung about Kataragama deviyo, some of which try to find an independent origin for Katargamadevio from the Hindu roots of Skanda-Kumara.|$|E
5|$|This tactic did {{not prove}} successful: pro-Nazi {{propaganda}} and protests were rampant, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian population, {{and the local}} government was powerless to prevent them. The Nazis physically harassed Lithuanian organizations. On 1 November 1938 Lithuania was pressured into lifting martial law and press censorship. During the December elections to the Klaipėda Parliament, pro-German parties received 87% of votes (25 seats out of 29) in the Klaipėda territory. Dr. Ernst Neumann, the chief defendant in the 1934 trials, {{was released from prison}} in February 1938 and became the leader of Klaipėda's pro-German movement. In December he was received by Adolf Hitler, who assured him that the Klaipėda issue would be resolved by March or April 1939. Neumann and other Nazi activists claimed the right of self-determination for the region and demanded that Lithuania open negotiations over the political status of Klaipėda. The parliament was expected to vote for a return to Germany when it convened on 25 March 1939. Germany's official channels maintained silence on the issue. Germany hoped that Lithuania would voluntarily give up the troubled region, and a public stance could have disturbed the sensitive discussions it was then engaged in with Poland over an anti-Communist alliance against the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Hindu {{ceremonies and}} rituals {{performed}} by Brahmins (Hindu priests), usually only held among ruling elites of the king's family, nobles, and the ruling class. The empire's official religions included Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism until Theravada Buddhism prevailed, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> lower classes, after its introduction from Sri Lanka in the 13th century.|$|E
50|$|Shaw told Ellen Terry:Kissing in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> trees {{was very}} pleasant, {{but she knows}} the value of her {{unencumbered}} independence, having suffered a good deal from family bonds and conventionality before {{the death of her}} mother and the marriage of her sister left her free... The idea of tying herself up again by a marriage before she knows anything — before she has exploited her freedom and money power to the utmost.|$|R

25|$|Extreme metal bands {{were rarely}} covered in {{mainstream}} media and rarely appeared on television. Part of what separated the British metal {{music of the}} 1990s {{was a sense of}} a humor and irony that was not as nearly widespread as the European and American metal groups of the era. <b>Even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> more 'serious' British groups such as Carcass or Gorerotted have displayed a tongue-in-cheek attitude.|$|E
25|$|Atypically <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> country's small educated elite, Sukarno was {{fluent in}} several languages. In {{addition}} to the Javanese language of his childhood, he was a master of Sundanese, Balinese and of Indonesian, and was especially strong in Dutch. He was also quite comfortable in German, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, {{all of which were}} taught at his HBS. He was helped by his photographic memory and precocious mind.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 165 men served in this unit from June 15, 1861, to May 11, 1865. A {{remarkable}} number of original members {{served with the}} battery through the entire conflict. The battery {{had one of the}} lowest desertion rates in the Confederate Army. <b>Even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> large number of conscripts who joined the battery in 1863 there were relatively few deserters. From all contemporary accounts, it seems that the Jackson Light Artillery enjoyed competent leadership and high morale throughout the war.|$|E

25|$|These men, {{whom you}} see {{slaughtered}} on the ground, were neither Pagans nor Mahometans, at whose death we should rejoice—they were Christians, lately your subjects and your countrymen, {{some of them}} your relations. This is not victory, which is gained over ourselves. In killing these, you drive the sword into your own entrails. How many men have you slaughtered? How many more have you to kill? We have become a proverb, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Pagans and Moors, for carrying on this war, and apostatizing, as they say, from the faith of our ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Christians of Syria and Egypt {{preferred}} {{the rule of}} Islam to that of Byzantines... The people of the conquered provinces did not confine themselves to simply accepting the new regime, {{but in some cases}} actively assisted in its establishment. In Palestine the Samaritans, according to tradition, gave such effective aid to the Arab invaders that they were for some time exempted from certain taxes, and there are many other reports in the early chronicles of local Jewish and Christian assistance.|$|E
25|$|The Free Standards Group is an {{organization}} formed by major software and hardware vendors that aims to improve interoperability between different distributions. Among their proposed standards are the Linux Standard Base, which defines a common ABI and packaging system for Linux, and the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard which recommends a standard filenaming chart, notably the basic directory names found on {{the root of the}} tree of any Linux filesystem. Those standards, however, see limited use, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> distributions developed by members of the organization.|$|E
60|$|Tavernake {{felt that}} he had indeed wandered into an alien world as he took his place <b>the</b> {{following}} <b>evening</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> little crowd of people who were waiting outside the stage-door of the Atlas Theatre.

Two very handsome motor-cars were drawn up against the curb, and behind them a string of electric broughams and taxicabs, proving conclusively that the young ladies of the Atlas Theatre were popular in other than purely theatrical circles.|$|R

25|$|In August 1940 Ryti {{also agreed}} to secret {{military}} cooperation with Germany, in order to strengthen Finland's position vis-à-vis the threatening Soviet Union. Over time it became increasingly likely that the peace between the two great totalitarian powers would end, and the experts' opinion - <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> enemies of Germany - was that in case of invasion the Soviets could not stop the German war machine. Ryti apparently turned, step by step, to being in favour of seizing the opportunity to secure Finnish claims to areas he saw {{to be in the}} country's interests, in case the great realignment of ownership of East European territory by force were to materialize.|$|E
25|$|Professor Cheyne {{put forth}} a {{surprising}} theory concerning the Jerahmeelites. In his view they were a powerful north-Arabian tribe, with which the Hebrews came into conflict on their first approach to the land. A part of the Jerahmeelites was absorbed by the Hebrews, but there were many contests between the Israelites and {{the main body of}} the Jerahmeelites all through the period of the Kings. <b>Even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> post-exilic opponents of Nehemiah, the Jerahmeelites appear again. Cheyne believes that echoes of these conflicts once reverberated throughout the Old Testament, but that, owing to the corruption of the Masoretic text, they must now be reawakened by conjectural emendation of the text.|$|E
25|$|Shōmu abdicated in 749 {{in favour}} of his daughter, Princess Takano-hime, then Empress Kōken. While being an {{independent}} and strong-willed woman who identified herself with the Chinese autocratic Empress Wu, during her first reign until 758 she would still be under the shadows of her father, retired Emperor Shōmu and Kōmyō. She would favour the Fujiwara and particularly Nakamaro giving him lots of revenue and power by bestowing on him titles. When Moroe publicly criticized Kōken at a drinking party in 755, Nakamaro and his followers forced him to retire. Nakamaro's rapid rise through favoritism was seen with envy, <b>even</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Fujiwara clan members and particularly by his brother Toyonari.|$|E
