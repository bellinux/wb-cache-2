40|$|This article {{provides}} an analytical {{discussion of the}} adjustment to EU accession for an economy under alternative assumptions about monetary policy rules. The post-accession phase is characterized by rapid capital inflows and real exchange rate appreciation. If accession is combined with membership of the euro area and a pegged exchange rate, then the post-accession period exhibits excessive foreign borrowing, high wage inflation, an excessive stock market boom, and much too rapid growth in the non-traded sector {{at the expense of}} the exportable goods sector. Alternative monetary policies can be used to eliminate the inefficiencies of the post-accession adjustment, but some bring real costs in terms of lower growth and unemployment. We find that the best policy is one of flexible inflation targeting with some weight on exchange rate stability. In the absence of exchange rate adjustment, fiscal policy could be used, but this requires complicated time-varying <b>expenditure</b> <b>taxes.</b> While the analytical discussion emphasizes the benefits of exchange rate adjustment, a later section of the article explores some more recent arguments regarding non-traditional costs of exchange rate volatility.

40|$|The {{economic}} changes associated with globalization tighten financial pressures on governments of high-income countries {{by increasing the}} demand for government spending while making it more costly to raise tax revenue. Greater international mobility of economic activity, and associated responsiveness of the tax base to tax rates, increases the economic distortions created by taxation. Countries with small open economies have relatively mobile tax bases; as a result, they rely much less heavily on corporate and personal income taxes than do other countries. The evidence indicates that a ten percent smaller population in 1999 {{is associated with a}} one percent smaller ratio of personal and corporate income tax collections to total tax revenues. Governments of small countries instead rely on consumption-type taxes, including taxes on sales of goods and services and import tariffs, much more heavily than do larger countries.

40|$|Standard tax-policy advice {{suggests}} cutting income taxes, and relying more on <b>expenditure</b> <b>taxes,</b> {{to raise}} growth. The standard {{basis for this}} advice is endogenous growth theory, and the proof that an expenditure tax is preferred has involved a comparison of two proportional taxes in models with just one group of households. There is no formal evaluation of the concern that a proportional expenditure tax is regressive.

This paper examines this presumption. Following Mankiw (2000), our simple endogenous growth model involves two groups. The first is an infinitely lived family dynasty that smooths consumption in the usual fashion. The second group is impatient and does not accumulate physical capital. Beyond the investment in human capital that is required to keep a job, these individuals simply consume their income (labour earnings plus a transfer payment).

40|$|It is {{possible}} to employ either income or expenditure as the base for personal taxation. A considerable literature has developed that investigates the relative efficiency of these bases. The answer is usually {{in favor of the}} expenditure tax since it encourages capital accumulation through the avoidance of the double taxation of saving. In contrast, the literature is almost silent on the relative equity of the two bases. We investigate the redistributive consequences of the choice in models with two sources of heterogeneity: skill in employment and lump-sum endowment. The Gini coefficient is used to measure the degreee of equity achieved by the tax bases in static and dynamic settings. Income taxes and <b>expenditure</b> <b>taxes</b> that generate equal welfare (or equal revenue) are compared. In the static economy the income tax leads to lower inequality except when skill and endowment are negatively correlated. Inequality is always lower with the income tax in the dynamic economy. These results support the choice of income as the base for personal taxation if reduction in inequality is a priority of policy.

40|$|This report lists 290 <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> and, where possible, {{provides}} {{an estimate of}} the dollar value or order of magnitude of the benefit to taxpayers. Introduction A <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> arises where the actual tax treatment of an activity or class of taxpayer differs from the benchmark <b>tax</b> treatment. 	<b>Tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> typically involve <b>tax</b> exemptions, deductions or offsets, concessional tax rates and deferrals of tax liability. 	 	A positive <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> reduces <b>tax</b> payable relative to the benchmark. A negative <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> increases <b>tax</b> payable relative to the benchmark. 	  Benchmarks represent a standard taxation treatment that applies to similar taxpayers or types of activity. 	 	Benchmarks may also incorporate structural elements of the tax system; for example, the progressive income tax rate scale for individual taxpayers. 	 Determining benchmarks involves judgment. Consequently, the choice of benchmark may be contentious and benchmarks may vary over time. The choice of benchmark should not be interpreted as indicating a view on how an activity or taxpayer ought to be taxed.   	To facilitate discussion and understanding of the impact of using different benchmarks, the 2013 TES included an illustrative case study which showed the differences in the estimates for superannuation <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> if an <b>expenditure</b> <b>tax</b> benchmark was used rather than the usual income tax benchmark — see Appendix A, 2013 <b>Tax</b> <b>Expenditures</b> Statement. Although that exercise has not been repeated for this year’s TES, the conceptual points that were discussed in the 2013 TES remain.    ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> are {{government}} indirect spending, {{hidden in}} the tax system, often used to support government’s social and economic objectives. Instead of directly allocating money for a particular objective, the government forgoes tax revenues from those who undertake activities that could achieve the objective. Therefore, <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> should be analysed as government spending programs. <b>Tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> reporting and analysis has been a regular practice among many countries in the world, especially in developed countries, to ensure efficient and effective allocation of government resources and enhance government’s transparency. Unfortunately, despite having lavish tax incentives, the Malaysian government has not produced a <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> report. As a result, <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> are mistakenly analysed as aspects of the tax collection system rather than as part of spending programs. This thesis sets a foundation for <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> reporting and analysis in Malaysia by identifying and analysing <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> of Malaysia’s corporate income tax arising from all sources of tax law – tax legislation, case law and administrative practices. In addition, this thesis also identifies and analyses negative <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> that provide disincentives to government-disfavoured activities. The main objective of this thesis is to determine whether particular corporate income <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> or corporate negative income <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> should be removed, maintained or modified using the conventional <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> analysis. Prior to identifying <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures,</b> elements of a benchmark tax structure are developed. This thesis contributes to new knowledge by proposing Malaysian accounting standards as the benchmark tax base to identify corporate <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Any <b>tax</b> rules that deviate from the benchmark tax structure are analysed as <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> (if they lower tax payable) or negative <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> (if they increase tax payable). Conventional <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> analysis commences with an assertion of (or speculation about) the apparent objective {{of each of the}} <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> and negative <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> being assessed, asking first whether there are justifiable reasons for the government to intervene in the market by offering subsidies or imposing penalties based on taxpayers’ behaviour. If government intervention can be justified, {{the next step is to}} propose the optimal vehicle to achieve the objective. The findings of this thesis reinforce doubts held by some about the effectiveness of <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> as tools to promote government objectives. A number of the <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> identified appear to be redundant, providing government support for companies to undertake actions that they would likely do even without the <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Most <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> in Malaysia are not accurately targeted; they only benefit profitable companies and thus miss many enterprises most in need of assistance. There are also <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> that have lost their relevancy, including a few that were inherited from the British tax system. They have been forgotten or accepted as part of the normative tax system, and are left in the legislation with no revision. Most negative <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> that are explicitly legislated have plausible reasons to stay in the tax system. However, implicit negative <b>tax</b> <b>expenditures</b> that stem from strict judicial interpretations have led to the denial of deductions for some normal business expenses. This is unfair to businesses. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the importance of <b>tax</b> <b>expenditure</b> reporting and analysis, particularly in Malaysia, to help the government in managing its resources and formulating better policies...|$|R

Watson tackles Heath's assessment of the social benefits of productivity growth directly, starting with the issues of social inequality and poverty. He argues that there has been no flagging in redistributive effort in Canada and he challenges what he sees as Heath's preference for enhancing public expenditures, emphasizing the scope for government failures and of the possibility that higher tax rates in the contemporary period have increased the marginal cost of public funds. Even if one were able to resolve the question of the appropriate balance between the public and private sectors, Watson believes that the case for higher productivity would remain compelling. Without powerful analytical guidance, Watson concludes that reform of social policy will inevitably be guided primarily by intuition, politics and hunches.

40|$|In Ireland as in {{many other}} {{countries}} there has been an ongoing debate on the nature, degree and trends of regional imbalance, which has led to substantial research output. While much is now known about these trends, {{the degree to which they}} are ameliorated by existing public policies has not been systematically examined. This paper considers two aspects of public policy namely the fiscal system and public expenditure. In particular regional government accounts are constructed, which identify the level of taxation, subsidisation and public expenditure at the regional level. These are then used to identify the degree of regional re-distribution. That analysis confirms that the fiscal system does reduce relative income differences in Ireland. Dublin and the South-West contribute to a substantial resource transfer to other regions.
