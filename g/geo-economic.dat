40|$|With {{the rise}} of China and the {{implementation}} of the “ 21 st Century Maritime Silk Road” strategy, research on geo-economics between China and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries has become increasingly important. Current studies mainly focus on influencing factors, while there is little consideration about how these influencing factors act on <b>geo-economic</b> relationships. Therefore, this paper explores the key driving forces for <b>geo-economic</b> relationships between China and ASEAN countries by use of the structural equation modeling based on Partial Lease Squares. There are three main findings: (1) Economic factors have the greatest impact on <b>geo-economic</b> relationships and the total path effect is 0. 778. Geo-location, geopolitics and geo-culture act on <b>geo-economic</b> relationships directly and indirectly. Their total path effects are 0. 731, 0. 645 and 0. 513, respectively. (2) Indirect effects of geo-location, geopolitics and geo-culture impacting <b>geo-economic</b> relationships are far greater than direct effects. Geo-culture, in particular, has a vital mediating effect on <b>geo-economic</b> relationships. (3) Economic drivers promote <b>geo-economic</b> relationships through market, industrial policy, technical, network and benefit-sharing mechanisms. Political drivers improve <b>geo-economic</b> relationships through cooperation, negotiation, coordination and institutional mechanisms. Cultural drivers enhance <b>geo-economic</b> relationships through transmission mechanism. Location drivers facilitate <b>geo-economic</b> relationships through selection mechanism. We provide new insights on the <b>geo-economic</b> relationships through quantitative analysis and enrich the existing literature by revealing the key driving forces and mechanisms for <b>geo-economic</b> relationships...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, China’s {{economic}} power has experienced great changes and {{has brought about}} {{a profound impact on}} the world economy. This led us to ask a question: do changes in China’s economic power shift the <b>geo-economic</b> relationships between China and its neighboring countries? To answer this question, we researched the evolution of <b>geo-economic</b> relationships between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Using the Euclidean distance method, we explored the changes in these <b>geo-economic</b> relationships between China and ASEAN countries from 1980 to 2014. Our findings resulted in five conclusions: (1) Over time, <b>geo-economic</b> relationships between China and ASEAN countries remained relatively stable. (2) Geographically, the main <b>geo-economic</b> relationships between China and continental ASEAN countries were complementary, while the main <b>geo-economic</b> relationships between China and island ASEAN countries were competitive. (3) Geopolitics and geo-culture were attributed to the changes in <b>geo-economic</b> relationships. (4) The evolution of <b>geo-economic</b> relationships was characterized by path dependence. (5) <b>Geo-economic</b> relationships between China and ASEAN countries could be classified into four types: game type, with high cooperation and competition; complementary type, with high cooperation and low competition; fight type, with low cooperation and high competition; and loose type, with low cooperation and competition.

The relevance of analyzing international movement of human resources, not labor ones, in building the <b>geo-economic</b> strategy of a country or a regional grouping is justified. The connection between the international migration of human resources and the trends in development of individual countries and regions (oil exporting countries, newly industrialized countries and least developed agrarian countries) is determined, the general patterns of migration flows in these countries are described. Furthermore, the topical issues in studying international migration of human resources {{in the context of the}} directions of geo-economics identified by scientists are formulated.

Systemic determinants of gravitational processes are revealed in geo- economic space and the asymmetry of global activate ravitional processes in <b>geo-economic</b> space are observed, and methodological interconnectedness coinfluence of two complementary determinants of global development – convergence and divergence and the contradiction between them are examined, which at the same time underlie the inevitable internal contradictions of the process, creating conditions for further configuration of the «new globalization community», which is built on the principles of nonlinear dynamics and logic gravitational processes in <b>geo-economic</b> space. Taking into account the relevant uncertainties, the attention is focused on the isolation of several myths around which the debate that has important methodological significance {{in the context of the}} current global inter-system transformations is held.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} economic {{importance of the}} Asia-Pacific Region, the economic interdependence among {{countries in the region}} has gradually enhanced. With the continuous opening up of the two countries, Sino-Vietnamese economic relations have also been deepened. However, the export trade between Vietnam and China has been competitive. China and Vietnam seek to dominate or join an agreement that is conducive to their own trade, which also exacerbates the trade competition between the two countries. This paper compares China and Vietnam and analyzes their foreign trade data from 2005 to 2014. By analyzing the competitiveness of export commodities, the trade division effect and spatio-temporal changes of the <b>geo-economic</b> relationship in the Asia-Pacific Region, this study explores Sino-Vietnamese trade relations and compares the pattern of <b>geo-economic</b> evolution between the two countries. The findings show that China and Vietnam have similarities and substitutability in textiles, apparel and footwear in terms of commodity structure. There is already a trade diversion effect between Vietnam and China on these commodities, but it is not substantial. From a geographic perspective, China’s <b>geo-economic</b> relations in the Pacific Rim present an increasingly dispersed trend. However, the spatial pattern of Vietnam’s geo-economy has maintained a low-level and stable spatial agglomeration over the last decade...|$|E
