40|$|Vascular endothelial cells, {{serving as}} a barrier between vessel and blood, are exposed to shear stress in the body. Although endothelial {{responses}} to shear stress are important in physiological adaption to the hemodynamic environments, they can also contribute to pathological conditions [...] e. g., in atherosclerosis and reperfusion injury. We have previously shown that shear stress mediates a biphasic response of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP- 1) gene expression in vascular endothelial cells and that the regulation is at the transcriptional level. These observations led us to functionally analyze the 550 -bp promoter region of the MCP- 1 -encoding gene to define the cis element responding to shear stress. The shear stress/luciferase assay on the deletion constructs revealed that a 38 -bp segment (- 53 to - 90 bp relative to the transcription initiation site) containing two divergent phorbol ester " 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate" (TPA) -responsive elements (TRE) is critical for shear inducibility. Site-specific mutations on these two sites further demonstrated that the proximal one (TGACTCC) but not the distal one (TCACTCA) was shear-responsive. Shear inducibility was lost after the mutation or deletion of the proximal site. This molecular mechanism of shear inducibility of the MCP- 1 gene was functional in both the epithelial-like HeLa cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). In a construct with four copies of the TRE consensus sequences TGACTACA followed by the rat prolactin minimal promoter and luciferase <b>gene,</b> <b>shear</b> stress induced the reporter activities by 35 -fold and 7 -fold in HeLa cells and BAEC, respectively. The application of shear stress on BAEC also induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Pretreatment of BAEC with TPA attenuated the shear-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, suggesting that shear stress and TPA share a similar signal transduction pathway in activating cells. The present study provides a molecular basis for the transient induction of MCP- 1 <b>gene</b> by <b>shear</b> stress...|$|R

40|$|Objective—The {{similarities}} between valvular and vascular lesions suggest pathological initiation mediated through endothelium, but {{the role of}} hemodynamics in valvular endothelial biology is poorly understood. Methods and Results—Monolayers of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) or porcine aortic valve endothelial cells (PAVECs) were exposed to 20 dyne/cm 2 steady laminar shear stress for 48 hours, with static cultures serving as controls. Multiple microarray comparisons were made using RNA from sheared and control batches of both cell types. More than 400 genes were significantly differentially expressed in each comparison group. The resulting profiles were validated at the transcription and protein level and expression patterns confirmed in vivo by immunohistochemistry. PAVECs {{were found to be}} less intrinsically inflammatory than PAECs, but both cell types expressed similar antioxidant and antiinflammatory genes in response to shear stress. PAVECs expressed more genes associated with chondrogenesis, whereas PAECs expressed osteogenic <b>genes,</b> and <b>shear</b> stress had a protective effect against calcification.

To analysis has been used 333 meat samples of Czech Pied bulls. Genotypization of GH and GHR loci was performed by PCR-RFLP. For detection of single nucleotide polymorphism in both genes was used restriction endonuclease AluI. To determine meat tenderness was used the method of measuring shear force by Warner and Bratzler. The shear force values of raw meat samples were measured at day 14 post mortem. Then was statistically evaluated the association between genotypes and shear force. In the study population occurred for GH locus 166 individuals with genotype LL, 161 heterozygotes LV and 6 homozygotes VV.

40|$|SummaryThe {{mechanisms}} by which transcription factor haploinsufficiency alters the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape in human cells to cause disease are unknown.

Sedentary, healthy subjects were studied (105 women/ 26 men, age 32 ± 1 years [mean ± standard error of the mean]). Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism, and haplotypes were determined by a Bayesian-based algorithm. Vascular reactivity was evaluated by the percentage of change in forearm vascular conductance provoked by 5 minutes of circulatory occlusion before (baseline) and 10, 60, and 120 minutes after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. Vascular reactivity increased 10 minutes after exercise in the entire sample (baseline: 218 ± 11 % vs 10 minutes: 284 ± 15 %, P T polymorphism had lower vascular reactivity than wild counterparts (group effect, P = 0. 05). Furthermore, subjects with haplotype 2 (H 2), containing the − 786 T>C and 894 G>T polymorphisms, had lower vascular reactivity than wild counterparts (haplotype 1 [H 1]) (group effect, P = 0. 05), whereas subjects with haplotype 4 (H 4), containing only the 894 G>T polymorphism, had vascular reactivity {{similar to that of}} wild counterparts (H 1) (group effect, P = 0. 35). Altogether, these results indicate that the 894 G>T polymorphism reduced exercise-mediated increase in vascular reactivity, particularly when it occurred concomitantly with the − 786 T>C polymorphism...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Shear stress {{generated}} by distinct blood flow patterns modulates endothelial cell phenotype to spatially restrict atherosclerotic plaque development. Signaling through p 21 -activated kinase (PAK) mediates {{several of the}} deleterious effects of shear stress, includ-ing enhanced NF-κB activation and proinflammatory <b>gene</b> expression. Whereas <b>shear</b> stress activates PAK in endothelial cells on a fibronectin matrix, basement membrane proteins limit shear-induced PAK activation and inflammation through a protein kinase A–dependent path-way; however, the mechanisms underlying this regulation were unknown. We show that base-ment membrane proteins limit membrane recruitment of PAK 2, the dominant isoform in en-dothelial cells, by blocking its interaction with the adaptor protein Nck. This uncoupling response requires protein kinase A–dependent nitric oxide production and subsequent PAK 2 phosphorylation on Ser- 20 in the Nck-binding domain. Of importance, shear stress does not stimulate nitric oxide production in endothelial cells on fibronectin, resulting in enhanced PAK activation, NF-κB phosphorylation, ICAM- 1 expression, and monocyte adhesion. These data demonstrate that differential flow–induced nitric oxide production regulates matrix-specific PAK signaling and describe a novel mechanism of nitric oxide–dependent NF-κB inhibition...|$|R

An optical tweezer model has been employed to exert different levels of shear stress on a single non-adherent human bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cell to simulate physiological flow conditions. A single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that collagen type 1, alpha 2 (COL 1 A 2), heat shock 70 -kDa protein 1 A (HSPA 1 A) and osteopontin (OPN) are expressed to a detectable level {{in most of the}} cells. After exposure to varying levels of shear stress, there were significant variations in gene transcription levels across human mesenchymal stem cells derived from four individual donors. Significant trend towards upregulation of COL 1 A 2 and OPN <b>gene</b> expression following <b>shear</b> was observed in some donors with corresponding variations in HSPA 1 A gene expression.

40|$|The focal {{distribution}} of atherosclerotic lesions in the arterial tree {{is related to}} the local shear stress generated by blood flow, but the molecular basis of the atherogenic response of endothelial cells in these lesion-prone areas is still unclear. We report that shear stress mediates a biphasic response of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP- 1) gene expression in vascular endothelial cells (EC). Northern blot analysis indicated that the level of MCP- 1 mRNA in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) subjected to a shear stress of 16 dynes/cm 2 (1 dyne = 10 microN) for 1. 5 hr increased by 2 - to 3 -fold when compared with static cells. The MCP- 1 gene expression decreased to the basal level at 4 hr and then declined further to become completely quiescent at 5 hr after the onset of <b>shear.</b> Once the <b>gene</b> expression was fully suppressed, it remained quiescent even after static incubation for 1. 5 hr and would not respond to reshearing after this static incubation. However, if the postshearing incubation extended from 1. 5 to 24 hr, the MCP- 1 mRNA returned to the basal level and was then able to increase after the reapplication of shear stress. Nuclear run-on experiments showed that the shear-induced increased MCP- 1 mRNA in HUVEC was regulated at the transcriptional level. By using cycloheximide, it was shown that de novo protein synthesis was not necessary for the induction of MCP- 1 by shear stress. The biphasic response of MCP- 1 gene expression was found in experiments in which the applied shear stress was 6, 16, or 32 dynes/cm 2, and it was observed not only in HUVEC but also in HeLa cells, glioma cell lines, and skin fibroblasts. This in vitro study demonstrates that the response of MCP- 1 <b>gene</b> to <b>shear</b> stress represents an immediate early gene activation and suggests that this gene is probably suppressed in EC that have been exposed to a constant shear stress...|$|R

40|$|Atherosclerotic plaque rupture and {{subsequent}} thrombosis {{is the main}} cause of sudden coronary death. Remarkably, atherosclerosis only develops in certain predisposed areas of the vasculature. Endothelial cells in these predisposed areas experience low or oscillatory shear stress, which activates the proinflammatory and procoagulant transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP- 1) and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), thus inducing a proinflammatory, procoagulant surface. In contrast, healthy endothelial cells that are exposed to prolonged high laminar shear stress, express anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant <b>genes.</b> The key <b>shear</b> stress-induced transcription factors that govern the expression of these genes are Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF 2) and nuclear factor erythroid 2 -like 2 (Nrf 2). Together KLF 2 and Nrf 2 govern approximately 70 % of the <b>shear</b> stress-elicited <b>gene</b> sets.

A 152 -kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) encoding phytochrome A (PHYA) was fully sequenced, revealing 16 open reading frames with a gene density similar to many regions of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. The sequences of genes in the orthologous region of the maize (Zea mays) and rice genomes were obtained using the gene-island sequencing method.

Most studies have had limited ability to deeply sample community structure (e. g.

Here, we combine the higher taxonomic resolution of near-full-length 16 S rRNA gene amplicons with the economics and sensitivity of short-read sequencing to assay the abundance and identity of organisms that represent as little as 0. 01 % of sediment bacterial communities. We used {{a new version of}} EMIRGE optimized for large data size to reconstruct near-full-length 16 S rRNA <b>genes</b> from amplicons <b>sheared</b> and sequenced with Illumina technology. The approach allowed us to differentiate the community composition among samples acquired before perturbation, after acetate amendment shifted the predominant metabolism to iron reduction, and once sulfate reduction began. Results were highly reproducible across technical replicates, and identified specific taxa that responded to the perturbation. All samples contain very high alpha diversity and abundant organisms from phyla without cultivated representatives. Surprisingly, at the time points measured, there was no strong loss of evenness, despite the selective pressure of acetate amendment and change in the terminal electron accepting process. However, community membership was altered significantly. The method allows for sensitive, accurate profiling of the "long tail" of low abundance organisms that exist in many microbial communities, and can resolve population dynamics in response to environmental change...|$|R

In order to achieve this, a number of technological innovations were necessary and developed. We present an approach, named ARNI, to logically model and construct through abductive reasoning, regulatory gene networks from gene expression profiles and background prior knowledge on gene functions and interactions. We demonstrate the improved predictive power and complexity of our inferred network topologies compared with those generated by other non-symbolic inference approaches. A bioinformatics workflow for the integration of gene expression profiles across platforms and species is presented and applied for generating an integrated endothelial cell mechanoresponsive gene expression profile. The integrated dataset identified > 1600 <b>genes</b> to be <b>shear</b> responsive, more than any other study, and in this gene set all known mechanosensitive genes and pathways were present. We also present the first high-throughput RNAi platform to demonstrate successful reverse electroporation of mammalian primacy cell lines and which couples RNAi screening with mechanotransduction studies. Each step of the assemblage is evaluated and effective loss-of-function is demonstrated for multiple gene targets. The tools presented in this thesis provide the basis for developing qualitative models and targeted therapies, in order to further our pursuit for shear-mediated atherosclerosis prevention.

40|$|The high {{mortality}} from {{cardiovascular diseases}} {{is caused by}} atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis develops due to multiple factors, including biomechanical factors, such as shear stress generated by {{the flow of blood}} on the inner lining of blood vessels. In order to tackle this serious life-threatening condition, we aimed to develop synthetic and systems biology tools for studying the effect of atherogenic shear stress regimes on vascular cells. Our tools could potentially also lead to the identification of drug targets and of drug candidates against cardiovascular disease. The first tool that we developed is a network of genes consisting of a shear stress sensor module, a reporter module and a linker module which signals from the sensor to the reporter module. This circuit is capable of processing the shear stress or ligand activation signal into a fluorescent readout, allowing screening for drug candidate compounds that modify the activity of the shear stress sensor. Instead of the reporter module, the gene network could be coupled to therapeutic genes in order to express these <b>genes</b> under atherogenic <b>shear</b> stress conditions. Our second developed tool is a flow chamber which facilitates exposure of vascular cells to linearly increasing shear stress {{along the length of the}} channel floor for in vitro cellular biomechanical studies. This device outperforms currently available linear shear stress inducing devices in terms of the magnitude of shear stress range, linearity of shear stress along the channel length, and the large sampling area granted by the uniformity of shear stress across the channel width. The third tool that we developed is an electroporation and flow device capable of inserting genetic material into primary vascular cells in their adherent state, exposing these cells to fluid flow. This device allows investigations into cardiovascular mechanotransduction pathways under relevant physiological flow conditions. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Blood flow-generated {{shear stress}} (FSS) {{is the major}} {{determinant}} of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS- 3) expression. In humans, a promoter variant of the NOS 3 gene, the C-variant of the T- 786 C single nucleotide polymorphism, renders the <b>gene</b> insensitive to <b>shear</b> stress, resulting in a reduced endothelial cell (EC) capacity to generate nitric oxide (NO). Endothelial dysfunction, commonly associated with decreased NO bioavailability, may facilitate vascular inflammation. Consequently, individuals homozygous for the C-variant have {{an increased risk of}} developing cardiovascular (e. g., coronary heart disease (CHD)) and rheumatic diseases (e. g., rheumatoid arthritis (RA)). However, {{there are at least two}} mechanisms by which insuffcient NO production can be counterbalanced in CC-genotype endothelial cells (ECs), one of which involves a multicomponent pathway leading to the increased release of the anti-inflammatory prostanoid 15 -deoxy-Δ 12, 14 -prostaglandin J 2 (15 d-PGJ 2). Exposure of human ECs to physiological levels of FSS effectively reduced monocyte migration, not only through monolayers of TT- but most notably also of NO-deficient CC-genotype ECs. FSS up-regulated the expression of COX- 2 and L-PGDS, the rate-limiting enzymes for 15 d-PGJ 2 synthesis, solely in CC-genotype ECs, and only these cells revealed an increased release of 15 d-PGJ 2 in response to FSS. Exogenously added 15 d-PGJ 2 significantly reduced the transmigration of monocytes through EC monolayers. In addition, pre-treatment with 15 d-PGJ 2 or exposure to FSS-pretreated CC-genotype ECs exerted a pronounced anti-inflammatory effect on the (transmigrated) monocytes, as demonstrated e. g. by an inhibitory effect on interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) expression, a marker for monocyte pro-inflammatory activation. This inhibition occurs at the transcriptional level, as 15 d-PGJ 2 repressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced IL- 1 beta promoter activity in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. The anti-inflammatory activity of 15 d-PGJ 2 in monocytes involves the Nrf 2 -antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. Similar to 15 d-PGJ 2, constitutive activation of Nrf 2 reduced the expression of IL- 1 beta. Bioinformatic analysis revealed three putative Nrf 2 -responsive elements (i. e., AREs) in the human IL- 1 B promoter, suggesting that Nrf 2 may act through an as yet unknown mechanism to repress transcription of the IL- 1 B gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed a 15 d-PGJ 2 -induced binding of Nrf 2 to the promoter of the IL- 1 B gene. Deletion of two of the identified ARE motifs attenuated the inhibitory potency of 15 d-PGJ 2 toward IL- 1 B promoter activity, thereby corroborating Nrf 2 as a downstream effector of this prostanoid’s transcriptional effects. Given its powerful immunomodulatory properties, 15 d-PGJ 2 has been proposed to have anti-atherogenic potential. To evaluate its prognostic relevance, the relationship between plasma 15 d-PGJ 2 levels and disease severity and outcome in patients suffering from CHD, RA or both was investigated. The levels of 15 d-PGJ 2 were found to be significantly increased in the CHD group compared to age-matched controls, suggesting that 15 d-PGJ 2 may constitute a general defense mechanism to counteract the ongoing chronic inflammatory process in affected individuals. Moreover, pre-treatment with 15 d-PGJ 2 potently inhibited the in vitro transendothelial migration of interferon-gamma-producing human T helper type 1 cells, major players in atherosclerosis as well as various other chronic inflammatory disorders. Despite an inadequate capacity to form NO, CC-genotype ECs maintain a robust anti-inflammatory phenotype by enhancing the shear stress-dependent synthesis of 15 d-PGJ 2. Its anti-inflammatory activity on human monocytes may ascribe a novel role to Nrf 2 as a direct repressor of pro-inflammatory gene expression...|$|R
