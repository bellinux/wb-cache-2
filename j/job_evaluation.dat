The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} for saying the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase in pay. The tentative deal included a wage freeze {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four. Full-time employees will also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time workers will get a pro-rated bonus. As well a new <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP). Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE.|$|E

40|$|Comparable worth {{proposals}} {{presume that}} the gender wage gap {{is a result}} of occupational segregation. The proposals argue that females are channeled into "women's jobs" and that overcrowding depresses women's wages below the "value" of the work performed. Comparable worth legislation proposes replacing the idea of equal pay for equal work with a principle of equal pay for different work of comparable worth determined by <b>job</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Such <b>job</b> <b>evaluations</b> are feasible only for the public sector and large private employers. The analysis in this paper recognizes that comparable worth wage adjustments are to be limited to the large employers. It examines how employers in the covered sector tend to alter their pay packages and hiring standards. Comparable worth legislation also affects wages in the uncovered sector populated by small employers. The rationing of women's jobs and the changes in hiring standards for men's jobs in the covered sector tend to redound to the benefit of smart, energetic women and dull, indolent men.

50|$|Research {{regarding}} <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> has mainly {{been conducted}} using qualitative {{data collection methods}} such as interviews, large scale surveys and basic experimental methods. Therefore, {{there is a large}} gap for research on <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> collecting quantitative data for a more statistical analysis.

50|$|<b>Job</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{needs to}} be {{differentiated}} from job analysis. Job analysis is a systematic way of gathering information about a job.

Thus, <b>job</b> <b>evaluation</b> begins with job analysis and ends at that point where the worth of a job is ascertained for achieving pay equity between jobs and different roles.|$|E

The United States Constitution also prohibits discrimination by federal and state governments against their public employees. Discrimination in the private sector is directly constrained by the Constitution, but has become subject to a growing body of federal and state law. Federal law prohibits discrimination in a number of areas, including recruiting, hiring, <b>job</b> <b>evaluations,</b> promotion policies, training, compensation and disciplinary action.

The theoretical part covers different approaches to job satisfaction and its characteristics. In introduction apart from basic terminology important theoretical approaches to work satisfaction (e. g. single-factor and double-factor theories) are presented. Further the main focus is on factors related to job satisfaction such as age, seniority, gender, education and salary. Also the effect of job satisfaction on phenomena such as work motivation, work performance, fluctuation and absenteeism is mentioned. The final chapter of theoretical part of the work is focused on the methods of <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>evaluation</b> in the Czech Republic {{as well as in the}} world. The theoretical part of the work is followed by empirical part which designs a research project of job satisfaction in actual organization. Research project is divided into two parts.

Using surviving analysis through Kaplan Meier filter and a new approach to propensity score computation, the Authors shows that the policies run by the Labor Market Authorities are able to compensate the disavatanges that secondary labor forces such as migrants, old age or less educated workers have in getting a job when fired. Moreover, they put new light on the transitions from temporary job to permanent jobs, and show that the probability of transitions is very low.

50|$|New Jersey {{actually}} {{became the}} first state to pass tenure legislation when, in 1910, it granted fair-dismissal rights to college professors. The Incumbent law, passed in 1983, required that teachers be evaluated for performance during a two-year probationary period before gaining tenure. In the winter of 2004, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sponsored a bill to amend the state Constitution to require merit pay for teachers. The state legislature voted against the bill in February 2005. The next month, Governor Schwarzenegger formally endorsed the Put Kids First Act, written and submitted by Assemblymember Bonnie Garcia (Republican, Cathedral City). That act laid out the conditions for Proposition 74, including increasing probationary period from two to five years and allowing school districts to dismiss teachers who receive two consecutive negative <b>job</b> <b>evaluations.</b> It qualified for the ballot June 6.|$|R

5000|$|There {{has been}} {{research}} that both substantiates and refutes {{the benefits of}} information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are [...] "dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values" [...] of such organizations. However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive <b>job</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{and were more likely}} to be promoted. Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.|$|R
