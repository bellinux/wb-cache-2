25|$|When Traynor {{retired in}} 1961, Haughey succeeded him as Minister for Justice. As such, he {{initiated}} an extensive scale of legislative reforms. He introduced new legislation including the Adoption Act; the Succession Act, which protected the inheritance rights of wives and children; the Criminal Justice Act, which abolished capital punishment; and the <b>Extradition</b> <b>Act,</b> which virtually prevented extradition for IRA offences. Haughey also introduced the Special Military Courts which helped {{to defeat the}} Irish Republican Army's Border Campaign.|$|E

He shows a news film to Watson that proves Wheeler was in South Africa during the assassination attempt. The scandal threatens Dilman's Presidency. Dilman obtains Wheeler's confession and hands him over for <b>extradition.</b> The <b>act</b> alienates his activist adult daughter, Wanda. Wheeler calls the President a [...] "House Person"; the President responds that [...] "Black men don't burn churches and kill four children; they don't hunt down a Martin Luther King with a telescopic sight. Passion may drive you {{to the streets to}} throw a brick, but to buy a gun, plant an alibi and travel 5000 miles and kill a human being is bloodless, worthy of the selective morality of Adolf Eichmann." [...] The President addresses reporters, explaining that some people think violence is the only answer, but he will rely on diplomacy and peaceful means. He washes his hands of the Wheeler issue.|$|R
25|$|In October 1985, Soering and Elizabeth Haysom fled to Europe; and, on 30 April 1986, {{they were}} arrested in England, United Kingdom on charges of cheque fraud. Six weeks later, a grand jury of the Circuit Court of Bedford County, Virginia, indicted Soering with the capital murder of the Haysoms, {{as well as their}} {{separate}} non-capital murders. On 11 August 1986, the United States requested extradition for the pair, based on the 1972 extradition treaty.

25|$|During the Chase Court-era, Congress had {{stripped}} the Court {{of the authority}} to hear appeals from habeas petitions in the circuit courts. In Ex parte Royall (1884), the Waite Court dismissed such an appeal, holding that the jurisdiction had never been restored.

Before his extradition to the United States in November 2010, Bout expressed confidence that this U.S. trial would eventually lead to his acquittal, but this did not occur. From January 2011 to June 2012, Bout was incarcerated in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City.

25|$|But Moyer was in Colorado, not Idaho. Idaho {{authorities}} {{were concerned that}} Orchard's confession {{would not be enough}} to persuade a judge to issue <b>extradition</b> papers. <b>Acting</b> in concert with law enforcement leaders, McParland perjured himself to convince a judge to issue the extradition papers against Moyer, falsely representing that Moyer had been in Idaho {{at the time of the}} murder, and was a fugitive from justice (under Idaho law, conspirators were considered to be present at the scene of the crime.) McParland arrived in Denver on Thursday, February 15, and presented the extradition papers to Colorado Governor McDonald, who, by prior arrangement with the governor of Idaho, accepted them immediately. But they waited until Saturday evening to arrest Haywood, Pettigrew, and Moyer, then held the three overnight in the Denver Jail, and refused requests by the three to contact lawyers and family. Early Sunday morning the prisoners were put on a special train, and guarded by Colorado militia, were sped to Idaho. Although the events were very controversial, the extradition was ultimately upheld by the US Supreme Court.|$|R
40|$|<b>Extradition</b> as an <b>act</b> of {{international}} cooperation for {{the repression of}} criminal activities of the criminal offenders {{is one of the}} various models whereby one sovereign state delivers up the alleged accused criminals found within its jurisdiction, on demand, to another sovereign state, so that they might be dealt with according to the penal laws. Extradition has evolved among states because they are vitally interested in the repression of crimes and punishment of criminals who violate their national laws and thus disturb the general peace of the society. This article aims to describe the problems with which extradition is faced, especially with the obligation to extradite and with the obligation {{to take care of her}} own citizens in situations when the Constitution does not allow extradition of own nationals and in the absence of an extradition treaty...|$|R
40|$|The author’s main {{objective}} was to present the principles concerning extradition. The European Convention on Extradition drawn up in Paris on 13 Dec 1957 is a significant legal act that is {{the starting point for}} presenting principles of <b>extradition</b> in legal <b>acts</b> at the constitutional level in different countries. This article deals with the principles of the constitutions of selected federal countries, such as the USA or Switzerland, as well as some others, e. g. Italy or Spain. A discussion is presented of the principle of exterritoriality of some other countries in reference to extradition as well as the institution of the European warrant of arrest, which is to come into force on 1 st Jan 2004. The analysis of the international agreements signed by Poland, the forms of accepted solutions as well as the temporary schemes of conclusions all bear out the significance of the accepted political system and its role in promoting the image of Poland as a democratic country and a reliable partner in negotiations that respects internationally recognised rules. The institution of extradition urgently requires the simplification of procedures; it imposes a very difficult task upon the national legislator and international institutions. At the present stage Poland faces the challenge of developing an effective execution of the law...|$|R
2500|$|Soering filed a {{petition}} for habeas corpus with the Divisional Court and requested permission for {{judicial review of}} the decision to commit him, arguing that the <b>Extradition</b> <b>Act</b> 1870 did not authorise extradition for a capital charge. He also cited article IV of the US-UK extradition treaty, which provides that an extradition request for an offence carrying the death penalty can be refused if the requesting country has not given [...] "assurances [...] that the death penalty will not be carried out." [...] An assurance had been provided by the Commonwealth Attorney of Bedford County; but Soering contended it was worthless. On 11 December 1987, Lord Justice Lloyd in the Divisional Court admitted that the assurance [...] "leaves something to be desired" [...] but refused the request for judicial review, stating that Soering's request was premature, as the Home Secretary had not yet accepted the assurance.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 {{the governments}} of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, {{intended}} to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the <b>Extradition</b> <b>Act</b> 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes célèbres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and [...] "there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States".|$|E

40|$|The {{institution}} of extradition dates {{back from the}} thousands of years, during which the institution mentioned above has become in permanent evolving, with social relations getting complicated. Globalization, as a socio-political phenomenon, has {{the greatest impact on}} extradition having complicated and modified the process making it responds to current challenges on the part of society. And, despite the fact that eventually positive attitude toward human rights has come to characterize the {{institution of}} <b>extradition,</b> such legal <b>acts</b> as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Convention on the Protection of the Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Convention against Torture and many others have become an important stage on its way, which ultimately have brought about changes in usual perception of the institution, having adopted the necessity of securing individual rights in it in connection with extradition through transnational cooperation. Intensive discussion of extradition questions in legal literature, abundance of legal acts by no means approaching emerging issues repetitively, constantly arising empirical evidence of lack of clearly defined methods of international cooperation on extradition questions lead to the need to address the deep causes of the problem, to determine the place of extradition in the system of international law, to work out effective legal standards that would enable the institution of extradition to realize its full potential in the fight against world crime. In the post-Soviet space a set of regulations and principles, concerning extradition issues, appeared. It determined the process of getting out offenders: the rule of double criminality, the rule of specialization, the principle to extradite or prosecute and others. The article is ted to study of the institution of extradition and is focused on the analysis of its past, changes, which it endured during its formation, and problems that the institution faces nowadays. This subject is quite sensitive strictly because it is regulated not only by rules of a particular state, but by rules of international law. Contemporary international law can be characterized as a vector directed to protect human rights that undoubtedly affected the nature of the institution. Inaccuracies in contemporary legislation, penal problems of extradition are often complicated by interference of a political factor. In other words, relations between states on the world stage often have a huge influence on the process of extradition. At the same time, current political situation and political motives of subjects have a great impact on the institution of extradition. In this work the authors consider the political aspect of the institution of extradition (giving the offenders out) in modern legislation. The study of these issues, connected with exclusion of political crimes from the scope of extradition, should be further developed in both international contract law and national legislation. </p...|$|R
60|$|Among {{other matters}} of {{importance}} in which I took an active part, but which excited {{little interest in}} the public, two deserve particular mention. I joined with several other independent Liberals in defeating an Extradition Bill introduced {{at the very end of}} the session of 1866, and by which, though surrender avowedly for political offences was not authorized, political refugees, if charged by a foreign Government with acts which are necessarily incident to all attempts at insurrection, would have been surrendered to be dealt with by the criminal courts of the Government against which they had rebelled: thus making the British Government an accomplice in the vengeance of foreign despotisms. The defeat of this proposal led to the appointment of a Select Committee (in which I was included), to examine and report on the whole subject of Extradition Treaties; and the result was, that in the <b>Extradition</b> <b>Act</b> which passed through Parliament after I had ceased to be a member, opportunity is given to any one whose extradition is demanded, of being heard before an English court of justice to prove that the offence with which he is charged, is really political. The cause of European freedom has thus been saved from a serious misfortune, and our own country from a great iniquity. The other subject to be mentioned is the fight kept up by a body of advanced Liberals in the session of 1868, on the Bribery Bill of Mr. Disraeli's Government, in which I took a very active part. I had taken counsel with several of those who had applied their minds most carefully to the details of the subject--Mr. W.D. Christie, Serjeant Pulling, Mr. Chadwick--as well as bestowed much thought of my own, for the purpose of framing such amendments and additional clauses as might make the Bill really effective against the numerous modes of corruption, direct and indirect, which might otherwise, as there was much reason to fear, be increased instead of diminished by the Reform Act. We also aimed at engrafting on the Bill, measures for diminishing the mischievous burden of what are called the legitimate expenses of elections. Among our many amendments, was that of Mr. Fawcett for making the returning officer's expenses a charge on the rates, instead of on the candidates; another was the prohibition of paid canvassers, and the limitation of paid agents to one for each candidate; a third was the extension of the precautions and penalties against bribery to municipal elections, which are well known to be not only a preparatory school for bribery at parliamentary elections, but an habitual cover for it. The Conservative Government, however, when once they had carried the leading provision of their Bill (for which I voted and spoke), the transfer of the jurisdiction in elections from the House of Commons to the Judges, made a determined resistance to all other improvements; and after one of our most important proposals, that of Mr. Fawcett, had actually obtained a majority, they summoned the strength of their party and threw out the clause in a subsequent stage. The Liberal party in the House was greatly dishonoured by the conduct of many of its members in giving no help whatever to this attempt to secure the necessary conditions of an honest representation of the people. With their large majority in the House they could have carried all the amendments, or better ones if they had better to propose. But it was late in the session; members were eager to set about their preparations for the impending General Election: and while some (such as Sir Robert Anstruther) honourably remained at their post, though rival candidates were already canvassing their constituency, a much greater number placed their electioneering interests before their public duty. Many Liberals also looked with indifference on legislation against bribery, thinking that it merely diverted public interest from the Ballot, which they considered--very mistakenly as I expect it will turn out--to be a sufficient, and the only, remedy. From these causes our fight, though kept up with great vigour for several nights, was wholly unsuccessful, and the practices which we sought to render more difficult, prevailed more widely than ever in the first General Election held under the new electoral law.|$|E
