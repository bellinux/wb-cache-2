This paper aims to fill this gap and uses household survey data to measure the impacts of household <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> on peasants’ willingness to return rural residential land. The results show that the household <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> reduced the farmers’ enthusiasm to exit the rural residential land, that is, household <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> had a significant negative impact on farmers’ willingness to return rural residential land...|$|R

The study found the civil registration system in Iraq to be largely intact and functional, in spite of the wars experienced in Iraq over the past three decades.

40|$|Soon after gaining independence, the Ghana {{government}} {{adopted a}} deed <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> for recording land ownership. A legislative instrument supported this decision. The deficiencies of the deed <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> resulted in innumerable cases of land ownership disputes. Juxtaposed {{with the official}} <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> is the customary land tenure system, which authorized custodians of the stool lands to allocate parcels through the customary process. Because the customary system did not mandate written documentary evidence of the transaction, the allocation process created situations where the same parcel of land was allocated to multiple owners. The weaknesses in the two systems engendered lucrative, illegal and unrecorded land market activities. With increasing population and associated competing interests in available land, it became imperative {{for the government to}} review the existing legislation for recording and maintaining records of land parcel ownership. A new legislation was promulgated, based on a land title <b>registration</b> <b>system.</b> While efforts are being made to improve the customary land allocation process, the new legislation seeks to remove the deficiencies in the deed <b>registration</b> <b>system.</b> The introduction of the title <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> has resulted in a duality of the record keeping process.

40|$|Background: Hospitals have {{expressed}} {{no knowledge of}} patients’ opinions regarding diversified appointment <b>registration</b> <b>systems,</b> despite efforts to develop novel appointment <b>registration</b> <b>systems</b> that assist patients and increase hospital efficiency. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the use of diversified appointment <b>registration</b> <b>systems</b> and explore the factors influencing patients’ <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> choices. Methods: A survey study using a questionnaire was conducted in West China Hospital in February 2012. Outpatients were randomly selected from different hospital departments and the questionnaire was distributed and collected on-site. Results: Data from 1, 009 patients were available for analysis. Of these, 63. 4 % used appointment systems to register while others chose a traditional queuing method to register. 114 telephone (30. 4 %) and on-site (22. 9 %) appointments were made, whereas other systems were less used by patients. Between the non-appointment and appointment groups there were significant differences in gender, educational degree, and residence location (P P > 0. 05). While the clinical appointment system had the greatest number of appointment days (25. 75), the bank’s self-service terminal appointment had the least number of appointment days (5. 05). Leaflets sent from the hospital (50. 70 %) and the recommendations of friends or families (40. 77 %) were the two main ways of knowing about the appointment <b>registration</b> <b>systems.</b> With the exception of those who felt no need to make an appointment (30. 12 %), not having the capability to use the appointment systems (24. 10 %) and the lack of a registered health card (34. 53 %) were the two main reasons for not using appointment <b>registration</b> <b>systems.</b> Conclusions: Convenience was a major motivation for patients’ use of appointment <b>registration</b> <b>systems.</b> Personal knowledge and capability were the two important factors that influenced patients’ appointment system choices. Hospitals must improve the design and promotion of appointment <b>registration</b> <b>systems</b> to better facilitate their use. </p...|$|R
40|$|Improvements in {{technology}} and the Internet have seen a rapid rise {{in the use of}} technology in various sectors such as medicine, the courts and banking. The conveyancing sector is also experiencing a similar revolution, with technology touted as able to improve the effectiveness of the land registration process. In some jurisdictions, such as New Zealand and Canada, the paper-based land <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> has been replaced with one in which creation, preparation, and lodgement of land title instruments are managed in a wholly electronic environment. In Australia, proposals for an electronic <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> are under way. The research question addressed by this thesis is what would be the impact on fraud of automating the registration process. This is pertinent because of the adverse impact of fraud on the underlying principles of the Torrens system, particularly security of title. This thesis first charts the importance of security of title, examining how security of title is achieved within the Torrens system and the effects that fraud has on this. Case examples are used to analyse perpetration of fraud under the paper <b>registration</b> <b>system.</b> Analysis of functional electronic <b>registration</b> <b>systems</b> in comparison with the paper-based <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> is then undertaken to reveal what changes might be made to conveyancing practices were an electronic <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> implemented. Whether, and if so, how, these changes might impact upon paper based frauds and whether they might open up new opportunities for fraud in an electronic <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> forms {{the next step in the}} analysis. The final step is to use these findings to propose measures that might be used to minimise fraud opportunities in an electronic <b>registration</b> <b>system,</b> so that as far as possible the Torrens system might be kept free from fraud, and the philosophical objectives of the system, as initially envisaged by Sir Robert Torrens, might be met...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a research work {{to develop a}} 3 D land <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> for 3 D cadastre objects. In general, current 2 D land registration is managed separately by two agencies, i. e. Land Offices (LO) and Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM). Each agency has their own <b>registration</b> <b>system,</b> namely, Computerized Land <b>Registration</b> <b>System</b> (CLRS) and Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB) respectively. Previous research revealed the drawbacks of existing <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> especially on 3 D cadastral objects, and obviously this situation has to be tackled if a full 3 D registration needs to be realized. This 3 D cadastre registration {{will serve as a}} first attempt to develop a more complete system. The main idea of the work is to combine the two databases i. e. CLRS and DCDB. The work also aims to enhance current <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> especially for 3 D objects e. g. buildings. This paper attempts to elaborate on developed schema for the combine CLRS and DCDB database and focus on the aspect of 3 D registration for 3 D objects. The design of the <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> will be presented i. e. the conceptual and the logical model. The output from the experiment will be highlighted, i. e. database queries of the 3 D objects and incorporated with a simple GUI...|$|R
