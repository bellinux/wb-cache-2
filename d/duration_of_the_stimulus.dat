Introduction of the pre-loss stimulus on an extinction baseline (avoidable losses were omitted), however, reinstituted lowered rates. It is proposed that the pre-loss stimulus assumed discriminative control over low rates because responding in the presence of the stimulus was ineffective in avoiding the unavoidable loss.

In a third experiment visual stimuli were constituted by black circles. <b>The</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>stimulus</b> was fixed at 300 ms. Subjects had to indicate <b>the</b> relative <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test <b>stimulus</b> compared with <b>the</b> reference one. The main results showed that, regardless <b>of</b> digit magnitude, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stimuli</b> presented in <b>the</b> left hemispace is understimated and that <b>of</b> <b>stimuli</b> presented in <b>the</b> right hemispace is overestimated. On the other hand, in medline position, duration judgements are effected by <b>the</b> numerical magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presented <b>stimulus,</b> with time understimation of stimuli of low magnitude and time overestimation of stimuli of high magnitude. These results argue for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> strict interactions between space, time and magnitude representation on the human brai...|$|R
40|$|According to a {{dominant}} view, the approximate number system (ANS) is <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> symbolic math abilities. Due to <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> math abilities {{for education and}} career, {{a lot of research}} focuses on <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ANS and its relationship with math performance. However, the results are inconsistent. This might be caused by studies differing greatly regarding <b>the</b> operationalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ANS (i. e., tasks, dependent variables). Moreover, many methodological aspects vary from one study to the next. In the present review, we discuss commonly used ANS tasks and dependent variables regarding their theoretical foundation and psychometric features. We argue that the inconsistent findings concerning the relationship between ANS acuity and math performance may be partially explained by differences in reliability. Furthermore, this review summarizes methodological aspects of ANS tasks having important impacts on <b>the</b> results, including <b>stimulus</b> range, visual controls, presentation <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stimuli</b> and feedback. Based on this review, we give methodological recommendations on how to assess the ANS most reliably and most validly. All important methodological aspects to be considered when designing an ANS task or comparing results of different studies are summarized in two practical checklists...|$|R
