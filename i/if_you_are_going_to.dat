Entrances to metro {{stations}} are marked using the letter M which looks {{the same in the}} Russian and Roman alphabets. On the Moscow Metro, announcements on trains are made in Russian and English, and direction signs and maps often include English. Apart from buses and trams, trolleybuses are a very common means of overground transport in Russian cities. For more information see the list of trolleybus systems in Russia. Another widely used means of public transport is marshrutkas, or shared taxies. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> visit Moscow and use public transport, see the article about the Troika card (a similar card known as Podorozhnik is used in St Petersburg). Taxi services available in major Russian cities include Yandex.Taxi, Uber (company), and Gett.|$|E

He boarded with a host family and worked in a wool store to pay his expenses. But his initiation into Guthrie's training program was difficult. After seeing O'Halloran's freestyle technique for the first time, Guthrie asked him, [...] "Can you swim any other stroke? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> swim for me, you'll have to learn all over again." ...|$|E

500|$|Barrett, {{along with}} Pink Floyd's managers, Peter Jenner and King, wanted {{to release the}} song as a single in the new year, before being vetoed by both the band and Norman Smith. Jenner said that [...] "Jugband Blues", along with two others that Syd wrote around this time, ("Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man") were [...] "amazing songs." [...] When {{compared}} to [...] "Bike" [...] and [...] "The Scarecrow", Jenner said [...] "You think, 'Well, OK, those are all right, but these are powerful disturbing art.' I wouldn't want anyone {{to have to go}} as mad and disturbed as Syd did to get that, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go that disturbed give me something like that. That's great art." [...] Jenner had also called [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] "an extraordinary song, the ultimate self-diagnosis on a state of schizophrenia, [...] the portrait of a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E
500|$|A review {{published}} in The Times {{shortly after the}} book's publication {{described it as a}} [...] "very charming philosophical tale", and in his paper the historian and lecturer Bob Barker praised the novel for being [...] "remarkable for its cool yet vivid style". Critic Orville Prescott, writing in The New York Times, although admitting that the novel was [...] "beautifully written" [...] and [...] "a triumph of delicate and suggestive mystification", nevertheless concluded that the story was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and [...] "vexatious". He ended his review with the words: [...] "One feels constantly that shining truths are about to be revealed; that there is something important, something significant, hidden in these pages. But it is never made clear, while the ridiculous details remain all too conspicuously in view." [...] Prescott was just as critical of Rexroth's preface to the first American edition, describing it as a [...] "pretentious introduction of uncommon density". Writing in The Independent in 1993, shortly after the 100th anniversary of Read's birth, critic Geoffrey Wheatcroft commented that Read may not have been a great novelist [...] "but The Green Child is the kind of book to write <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave just the one novel behind: singular, odd, completely original".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{reviewing}} the New York production generally gave it poor reviews. [...] Ben Brantley of The New York Times applauded the creative team's [...] "honorable intentions" [...] in bringing back a work {{thought to be}} [...] "terminally out-of-date", but felt both the new Mei-li and the show in general lacked personality. [...] Howard Kissel of the New York Daily News termed it [...] "an entertaining, albeit vulgar revival", and Clive Barnes of the New York Post found it no more memorable than the earlier version. [...] The review in Talkin' Broadway is scathing, criticizing Hwang's use of the songs and characters, and the orchestrations, and commenting: [...] "Hwang's book lacks much of the charm, warmth, and wit of the original, and never takes the high road where the low road will do. ... Hwang {{felt it necessary to}} reduce the original, uniquely colorful story into just another backstager with a love triangle and lame jokes." [...] Michael Kuchwara commented about Harvard in his lukewarm review for Associated Press: [...] "Then there's Linda Low's gay confidante, Harvard. [...] Talk about stereotypes. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> perpetuate one at least give him better jokes." [...] On the other hand, both USA Today and Time magazine gave it positive reviews. [...] The CurtainUp review was mostly positive and observed that Hwang and Longbottom [...] "were able to keep numbers like 'Chop Suey' and milk it for its razzle-dazzle fun while using its condescending stereotyping as a springboard to satirize attitudes towards Asians." [...] Brantley disagreed, writing, [...] "because the show's satiric point of view is so muddled, there's no verve in such numbers, no joy in the performing of them." ...|$|E

If Israel is a synonym and will give the indication of Zionism mentality, no. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> conclude that we have said the people there have to be removed or we [...] they have to be massacred or so, this is fabricated, unfortunate selective approach to what the mentality and policy of Islamic Republic of Iran is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Al-Manar {{was placed}} on a US {{terrorist}} watchlist in December 2004. Reporters without Borders said that no evidence was presented of Al-Manar's involvement with terrorism. The main evidence provided for Al-Manar being anti-semitic was its partial showing, in October–November 2003, of the Syrian-produced 29-part series Ash-Shatat ("The Diaspora"). [...] "Al Manar management apologized for airing the series, dropped it and explained that the Station had purchased it without first viewing the entire series." [...] Lebanon's ambassador to the United States, Farid Abboud, protested: [...] "If you want simply to demonize or eliminate one side, you're not going to advance the issue. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> focus on one side {{simply because of the}} political message, it's unacceptable and it's a grave breach of the freedom of speech.".|$|E
2500|$|The tumultuous {{relationship}} between Wilder and Chandler only enhanced {{the product of}} their collaboration. Wilder, in fact, believed that discord, a tug-of-war, was a vital ingredient necessary for a fruitful collaboration: [...] "If two people think alike," [...] he once said, [...] "it's like two men pulling {{at one end of}} a rope. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> collaborate, you need an opponent to bounce things off of." [...] His tugging with Chandler did have a softer side, it seems: over 60 years after the film's initial release, it was discovered that Chandler had agreed to appear in a fleeting cameo at 16 minutes 12 seconds into the film, glancing up from a book as Neff walks past in the hallway. This is notable because, other than a snippet from a home movie, there is no other footage of Chandler known anywhere.|$|E
2500|$|A {{day after}} the Columbine High School {{massacre}} in Littleton, Colorado on April 20, 1999, Stern's comments regarding the incident drew criticism from some listeners.

[...] Hundreds complained to KXPK, the show's affiliate in Denver. Stern argued his comments were taken out of context, and accused critics of being overly sensitive. [...] "I dared to ask if kids had sex. So what? That's how I think. I had zero intent to make fun of the situation. The point in making that comment was an attempt to try to understand a motive. We didn't know anything about motives [...] and were trying to consider all possibilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|By the mid-1890s, Morley {{adopted a}} doctrinaire {{opposition}} to state intervention {{in social and}} economic matters. He repeatedly expressed his hope that social reform would not become a party issue and warned voters to [...] "Beware of any State action which artificially disturbs the basis of work and wages". Politicians could not [...] "insure steady work and good wages" [...] because of [...] "great economic tides and currents flowing which were {{beyond the control of}} any statesman, Government, or community". Morley also opposed the state providing benefits for sections or classes of the community as the government should not be used as a tool for sectional or class interests. The Unionist government had proposed to help farmers by assuming some of their rates and wanted to subsidise West Indian sugar producers. Morley viewed these as dangerous precedents of [...] "distributing public money for the purposes of a single class" [...] and he asked voters: [...] "How far are you going to allow this to take you? ... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give grants to help profits, how are you off from giving grants in favour of aiding wages?" [...] The end of this process, Morley warned, would see [...] "national workshops to which anybody has a right to go and receive money out of your pockets".|$|E
2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
