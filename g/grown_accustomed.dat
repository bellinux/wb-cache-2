At the same time, Jonas attempts to both aid them and look after himself after being captured by Whispers, who is now involved in a cat-and-mouse game with Will, each of them trying to outsmart the other.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, rainy Friday night, only 4,124 spectators paid {{to see the}} game, more to see {{players from}} the Philadelphia Eagles, the local American {{football}} team, play an exhibition basketball game against their colleagues from the Baltimore Colts before the NBA game started. The arena's capacity was over 8,000, and Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb was infamous for exaggerating attendance numbers. Warriors home attendance had dropped from 7,000 in Chamberlain's rookie season to less than 5,000 in this, his third, season. College basketball had started offering doubleheaders during the Great Depression to provide customers value for their money. Fans had <b>grown</b> <b>accustomed</b> to watching two games, so doubleheaders in the NBA became common.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{of the new}} contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti's mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni's death in 1924. By Szigeti's own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference {{brought on by the}} then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had <b>grown</b> <b>accustomed</b> to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought. He knew little of the works of the great masters; he could play them, but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoni—particularly through their careful study of Bach's Chaconne—"shook me once and for all out of my adolescent complacency".|$|E

5|$|The 1952 and 1953 seasons {{followed}} a similar pattern: Cleveland reached {{the championship game}} but lost both times to the Detroit Lions. In 1952's championship game, Detroit won 17–7 after a muffed punt by the Browns, several Lions defensive stands and a 67-yard touchdown run by Doak Walker scuttled Cleveland's chances. The team finished 11–1 in 1953, but lost the championship to the Lions 17–16 on a 33-yard Bobby Layne touchdown pass to Jim Doran with just over two minutes left. While the championship losses disappointed Cleveland fans who had <b>grown</b> <b>accustomed</b> to winning, the team continued to make progress. Len Ford, who the Browns picked up from the defunct AAFC's Los Angeles Dons team, emerged as a force on the defensive line, making the Pro Bowl each year between 1951 and 1953. Second-year wideout Ray Renfro became a star in 1953, also reaching the Pro Bowl.|$|E

40|$|Full {{waveform}} inversion {{suffers from}} the high non-linearity in the misfit function, which causes the convergence to a local minimum. In the other hand, traveltime tomography has a quasi-linear misfit function but yields low- resolution models. Wave equation tomography (WET) tries to improve on traveltime tomography, by better adhering {{to the requirements of}} our finite-frequency data. However, conventional (WET), based on the crosscorelaion lag, yields the popular hallow banana sensitivity kernel indicating that the measured wavefield at a point is insensitive to perturbations along the ray theoretical path at certain finite frequencies. Using the instantaneous traveltime, the sensitivity kernel reflects more the model-data dependency we <b>grown</b> <b>accustom</b> to in seismic inversion (even phase inversion). Demonstrations on synthetic and the Mamousi model support such assertions...|$|R

25|$|During the FFA's {{administration}} of the club, they indicated an openness to changes to the Perth Glory name and colours. Even though this move was welcomed by many long time supporters who remember the original motives of the Nick Tana led consortium in the mid 1990s to purchase the naming and livery rights and all other historical assets related to the oldest (albeit with a non-continuous history) Western Australian football club, Perth City FC, resulting in being rebuffed at the final minute, this was still not a popular move amongst the bulk of paid-up Perth Glory members who have <b>grown</b> <b>accustomed</b> to the current name and colours thus closing the door on any popular compromise. Thankfully for said members, the new ownership triumvirate consisting of Messrs Sage, Spence and McKeon stated that the colours will certainly not be changed under their reign.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, Brodovitch collaborated in the {{production}} of the revolutionary publication Portfolio. It has been widely acknowledged as perhaps the definitive graphic design magazine of the twentieth century. The idea for the publication came from art director Frank Zachary. He wanted to put out a magazine that focused solely on art and design, but was at the same time an outstanding example of design itself. Brodovitch was intrigued by the concept. Although he enjoyed his work at Harper's Bazaar, the limitations of space and subject matter often cramped his creative style. Portfolio freed him from the practical and aesthetic restraints to which he had <b>grown</b> <b>accustomed.</b> The pages of the publication were space for his graphic imagination to run wild. George S. Rosenthal, whose family owned a printing company dedicated to mass-market pictorial paperbacks, signed on too.|$|E
25|$|As ultranationalist {{students}} {{demonstrated in}} the city and outside the venue, the police presence was especially heavy inside and around the stage. According to Tony Barrow, the police feared that these right-wing students might have placed snipers in the audience. The stage itself was set on an 8-foot-high podium; all ground-floor seating had been cleared, meaning the audience was restricted to the hall's first and second tiers. Concertgoers were warned that anyone standing up or cheering risked being arrested. The Beatles felt that the uniformed officers subdued the crowd, although the Japanese fans' more reserved nature, relative to the group's usual audiences, was also a factor. The band gave an especially poor performance on 30 June. According to Barrow and Aspinall, the group were humbled by this, having <b>grown</b> <b>accustomed</b> to not hearing themselves play, and resolved to perform well {{for the remainder of the}} Budokan dates.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in a radio}} address, the Emperor of Japan announces {{the end of the}} War. Suzu, having faced countless {{setbacks}} and tragedies during the war, and had <b>grown</b> <b>accustomed</b> to the single-minded focus of keeping the family alive, is forced to accept the reality of her losses and temporarily falls into despair. Soon, the times begin to change rapidly: US occupation forces, no longer the enemy, come to Kure and provide food for its citizens. Suzu visits her grandmother Ito's family house in Kusatsu, a rural town to the west of Hiroshima and out of the affected area, to see her sister Sumi, who took refuge from deserted Hiroshima and is the only survivor of Suzu's family. Sumi informs Suzu of the fate of their parents; Sumi herself has fallen seriously ill from the radiation left behind by the atomic‐bomb radiation. Shūsaku, who returns from his naval service, meets with Suzu by chance in a deserted area of Hiroshima and tells her that he has found a new job. They come across a little girl, a war (atomic bomb) orphan struggling to survive in the ruins after losing her mother, and adopt her into their home in Kure. Suzu regains her passion for life slowly, with the courage and affection of her friends and family. As the credits roll, their adopted daughter is shown growing up in Suzu & Shūsaku's family home, sewing clothes with her own hands, aided by Suzu in peaceful post-war Japan.|$|E

500|$|Trollope's preface {{suggests}} that he anticipated controversy from the depiction of Carry Brattle in [...] The Vicar of Bullhampton. This did not happen. [...] The Times declared it [...] "a nice, easy, safe reading book for old ladies and young ladies... welcome in all well-regulated families". Contemporary reviewers tended to neglect the Carry Brattle subplot and focus on Mary Lowther, whose conduct was criticised by Blackwood's Magazine, by The Times, and by Mrs. Oliphant. The Saturday Review complained that [...] " [...] sort of savageness pervades the book", and that [...] "obody is pleasant", and described the novel as [...] "third-rate" [...] and as a [...] "not very satisfactory book". This was {{in keeping with the}} reaction of many readers and reviewers who had <b>grown</b> <b>accustomed</b> to the wholesome tone and genteel characters of the Barchester novels, and were not happy with the darker and more pessimistic tone of Trollope's later works.|$|E
500|$|Louise's {{relationship}} with the two sisters closest to the Queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous nature, had <b>grown</b> <b>accustomed</b> to treating Beatrice with pity {{on account of the}} Queen's constant need for her. Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual {{relationship with}} her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: [...] "he [...] was almost the greatest friend I had—I, too, miss him more than I can say". In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant nothing to him.|$|E
