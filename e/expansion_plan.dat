Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, African American rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties. The board of directors approved Baldwin's <b>expansion</b> <b>plan,</b> except for the international efforts.|$|E

5|$|The Bayside {{extension}} was tentatively {{approved in}} June 1913, {{but only after}} {{the construction of the}} initial extension to Flushing. Under the revised subway <b>expansion</b> <b>plan</b> put forth in December 1913, the Flushing Line would be extended past Main Street, along and/or parallel to the right-of-way of the nearby Port Washington Branch of the LIRR towards Bell Boulevard in Bayside. A spur line would branch off north along 149th Street towards College Point.|$|E

5|$|The {{airport was}} officially renamed McCarran International Airport in September 1968. Further {{expansion}} {{took place between}} 1970 and 1974 {{with the construction of}} the A and B gates. After the airline industry was deregulated in 1978, the number of airlines serving McCarran doubled from seven to fourteen in only two years. In response, the county launched an <b>expansion</b> <b>plan</b> named McCarran 2000, detailing expansion projects to be undertaken into the year 2000. Expanded baggage claim facilities, an esplanade, and a parking garage were inaugurated in 1985. The C Gates and the first line of the people mover system followed in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{approved}} {{the design and}} intended to lay down three ships under the 1892 programme, but work on the 12in gun was taking longer than predicted, and so construction was delayed to the 1893 programme. By that time, the third ship {{of what was to}} be the Majestic class was redesigned as a second-class battleship, , leaving only two ships to be laid down under the 1893 estimates. By August 1893, however, the public perceived the strength of the Royal Navy to have fallen relative to its traditional rivals, the French and Russian navies. John Spencer, the First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed a large naval <b>expansion</b> <b>plan</b> referred to as the Spencer Programme that included seven more Majestic-class battleships to soothe public opinion.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian Navy {{also made}} plans to acquire {{additional}} ships in the 1920s and 30s, but both were sharply reduced from the original proposals. In 1924, they contemplated constructing a relatively modest number of warships, including a heavy cruiser, five destroyers, and five submarines. In the same year, the newly arrived American naval mission, led by Rear Admiral Carl Theodore Vogelgesang, tendered a naval <b>expansion</b> <b>plan</b> of 151,000tons, divided between battleships (70,000), cruisers (60,000), destroyers (15,000), and submarines (6,000). The United States' State Department, led by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes and fresh from negotiating the Washington Naval Treaty, was not keen on seeing another dreadnought race, so Hughes quickly moved to thwart {{the efforts of the}} mission. Only one Italian-built submarine, , was acquired during this time.|$|E
30|$|The {{method of}} {{separated}} gas and power system <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> (EP) is briefly clarified here for better understanding. As {{we can see}} from Fig.  1, there are three parts in total: the upper part denotes gas transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> elements in future time; the middle part denotes coupled elements in the ECP framework and the market interaction; the lower part denotes power transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> elements in future time. In the situation of EP framework, the middle part is eliminated, and only {{the upper and lower}} parts are kept. The gas transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> aims to determine the size and location of pipelines, compressor stations, and storage facilities, while the power <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> tries to find the idea size and location of transmission lines, transformers, etc. These processes are conducted separately without considering coupled load centers and coupled generation centers. For detailed EP method, please refer to the upper/lower part in Fig.  1.|$|R

5|$|Trinity Grammar School in Prospect Road is {{a private}} school {{catering}} for students from PreK to Year 12. The schools's site has been in continuous use for education for 120 years. The headmaster's house at Trinity was erected circa 1877. The site operated as several different teaching institutions until it was purchased by the Anglican Church, becoming known as Trinity Grammar School in 1925. Trinity Grammar {{is one of many}} wealthy schools in New South Wales, and has previously received some of the largest government subsidies, when comparing total government subsidies per school. An <b>expansion</b> <b>plan</b> by Trinity involving the demolition of houses in nearby Seaview Street caused controversy in 2007. The development was nonetheless approved by the New South Wales Land and Environment Court.|$|E
5|$|The IND Second System {{proposal}} from 1929 {{estimated that the}} cost of the southern tunnel route from Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, to Fort Hamilton would cost upward of $75,000,000, though the tunnel was not officially part of the subway plans and was illustrated as a vehicular tunnel on the map of the plans. Many of the proposals were part of this ambitious <b>expansion</b> <b>plan,</b> which would have connected the tunnel to the IND South Brooklyn Line (today's IND Culver Line). An updated proposal in 1931 had the connection to the IND at the current Smith-Ninth Streets station, with the tunnel traveling north from Staten Island through Red Hook and Gowanus. Yet another update, from 1933, was projected to cost $45,000,000, running the original route between Saint George and 67th Street in Bay Ridge. The line would then run on Second Avenue north through the Bay Ridge Flats on Brooklyn's western shore, meeting up with the Culver Line near Hamilton Avenue (the current Gowanus Expressway) between the Smith-Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue stations; it was suggested that the Hylan tunnel shafts be used. An application for a $47 million loan for this extension was approved by the Board of Estimate in 1937.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the company}} managed {{to cover it}} costs, and the company stated that it hoped to have a revenue of NOK 30 million the {{following}} year, through an ambitious <b>expansion</b> <b>plan.</b> A private offering for NOK 8 million was issued to allow this expansion. Among the purchasers was the Municipality of Narvik and Narvik Port Authority. In March, Chair Rune Arnøy was forced to withdraw after accusations of conflict of interest, since he was both chair of Ofotbanen and harbormaster at the Port of Narvik. CargoNet, a freight competitor of Ofotbanen, had {{felt that they were}} being unfairly treated by the port after the municipality had bought shares in Ofotbanen and appointed Arnøy as chair. The legality of the port's purchase of the shares was considered by the Norwegian Coastal Administration; though deemed legal, the port authority was required to sell the shares within three years. In April, Ofotbanen received a permit to operate in Sweden, and started offering charter trains between Narvik and Kiruna in Sweden, primarily for cruise ship passengers. It also announced {{that it was going to}} bid for the public service obligations for subsidized passenger railway transport that the government was planning to conduct in 2006. In June, Ofotbanen received permission to operate freight trains throughout the entire railway network in Norway. This was the first time such permission was granted to a different company than NSB or its subsidiaries.|$|E
