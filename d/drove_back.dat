5|$|Years later, an {{interview}} with Henry Lee Loggins's son Mayor Jhonny B. Thomas revealed that Till was shot and tossed over the Black Bayou Bridge in Glendora, Mississippi, near the Tallahatchie River. The group <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> to Roy Bryant's home in Money, where they reportedly burned Emmett's clothes.|$|E
5|$|The army marched deeper inland {{and pitched}} camp near a Galatian stronghold called Cuballum. While they were there, the Galatian cavalry {{attacked}} the army's advance guard and caused significant casualties before the Roman cavalry counter-attacked and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> the Galatians with heavy losses. The consul, {{knowing that he}} was in reach of the enemy, decided to move forward more cautiously.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{returned}} to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, where he had lunch. As his aides arrived, he informed them of his sacking. Whitlam drafted a resolution for the House, expressing confidence in his Government. No ALP Senate leaders were at The Lodge, nor did Whitlam and his party contact any when they <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> to Parliament House, confining their strategy to the House of Representatives.|$|E

5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E
5|$|Brynn {{drove to}} the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing, but {{initially}} he did not believe her. The pair <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> to the house in separate cars, and Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time. Upon seeing Hartman's body, Douglas called 911 at 6:20a.m. Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans' two children from the premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom and committed suicide by shooting herself in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{increasing}} dissatisfaction with Everman {{over the course}} of the Bleach tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> to Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later claimed that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller. However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on {{the left}} flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a {{considerable}} amount of ground before its weight <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by the deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape {{with a small group of}} men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; most of their army was routed with only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought surviving the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Germans soon intervened {{to assist}} Italy. Hitler sent German forces to Libya in February, {{and by the}} end of March the Axis had {{launched}} an offensive which <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> the Commonwealth forces which had been weakened to support Greece. In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk that fell later. The Commonwealth attempted to dislodge Axis forces in May and again in June, but failed on both occasions.|$|E
5|$|We {{believe the}} enemy has {{undoubtedly}} suffered a crushing defeat. We thank Admiral Kinkaid for his intervention yesterday. We thank Lee for his sturdy effort last night. Our own aircraft has been grand in its relentless hammering of the foe. All those efforts are appreciated but our greatest homage goes to Callaghan, Scott and their men who with magnificent courage against seemingly hopeless odds <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> the first hostile attack and {{paved the way}} for the success to follow. To them the men of Cactus lift their battered helmets in deepest admiration.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Bleach in June 1989, Nirvana {{embarked}} on its first national tour, and the album became a favorite of college radio stations. Due to increasing differences between Everman {{and the rest of}} the band over the course of the tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> to Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later said that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller, and had initial sales of 40,000 copies. However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album. In late 1989, the band recorded the Blew EP with producer Steve Fisk.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher {{moved up}} a {{position}} as he passed Button for fifth position at turn three on the same lap. On lap twenty-eight, Trulli <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> to his garage to retire with a hydraulics failure that was caused by his power steering becoming heavy during the safety car period. Vettel set a new fastest lap of the race of 1:54.098, extending his lead over Alonso to 3.5 seconds. Button, who was under pressure from HÃ¼lkenberg and Kubica, made a pit stop {{at the end of}} lap twenty-eight for intermediate tyres and rejoined in fifteenth place. Kovalainen was sent into a spin by Buemi, having been passed by Petrov two laps later.|$|E
5|$|The {{long march}} from Seminary Ridge had left {{some of the}} Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused {{momentarily}} at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it moved toward the ridge. Willard's New Yorkers drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field, and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> Willard's men in turn.|$|E

5|$|To counter this, Philippicus {{ordered the}} men of the central {{division}} to dismount and form a shield-wall with their lances projecting from it (the fulcum formation). It is not clear what happened next, but apparently the Byzantine archers shot at the Persians' horses, breaking their momentum. At the same time, the Byzantine left managed to launch a successful counter-thrust which <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> the opposing Persian right in disarray. Soon the Persian right broke and fled, pursued by the Byzantines. With both wings having disintegrated, the Persian centre was now subjected to an attack from the reformed Byzantine right, which drove them towards the area once occupied by the Persian right. Outnumbered and attacked from several sides, the Persians soon began to break and flee.|$|E
5|$|After a {{month of}} training, McKinley and the 23rd Ohio, now led by Colonel Eliakim P. Scammon, set out for western Virginia (today part of West Virginia) in July 1861 {{as a part of}} the Kanawha Division. McKinley {{initially}} thought Scammon was a martinet, but when the regiment finally saw battle, he came to appreciate the value of their relentless drilling. Their first contact with the enemy came in September when they <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> Confederate troops at Carnifex Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Three days after the battle, McKinley was assigned to duty in the brigade quartermaster office, where he worked both to supply his regiment, and as a clerk. In November, the regiment established winter quarters near Fayetteville (today in West Virginia). McKinley spent the winter substituting for a commissary sergeant who was ill, and in April 1862 he was promoted to that rank. The regiment resumed its advance that spring with Hayes in command (Scammon by then led the brigade) and fought several minor engagements against the rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|Although Theophilos's {{principal}} commanders, Theophobos and the Domestic of the Schools Manuel, both advised for {{a surprise}} night attack, the Emperor sided with {{the opinion of the}} other officers and resolved to wait and launch his attack on the next day. The Byzantine army attacked at dawn, and initially made good progress: they <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> one wing of the opposite army, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the Arabs. Near noon, Theophilos resolved to reinforce the other wing, and detached 2,000 Byzantines and the Kurdish contingent to do so, abandoning his post and passing behind his own army's lines. At this point, however, Afshin launched his Turkish horse-archers in a ferocious counter-attack which stymied the Byzantine advance and allowed the Arab forces to regroup. The Byzantine troops then noticed the emperor's absence, and, thinking he had been killed, began to waver. This soon turned into a disorderly retreat; some men fled as far as Constantinople, bringing with them the rumour that the Emperor had been killed. Some units, however, were apparently able to retreat in good order and assemble at a place called Chiliokomon.|$|E
50|$|As Demars {{approached}} Courtrai, Beaulieu advanced out of {{the town}} and <b>drove</b> them <b>back.</b> HÃ©douville brought up reinforcements from Menin, but these too were driven back, pursued closely by the Austrians.|$|R

60|$|The Highlanders {{sprang from}} the ditch {{in which they were}} lying, the {{bagpipes}} struck up the slogan of the regiment, and with leveled bayonets they threw themselves upon the French column. In vain its leading companies attempted to make a stand. The Highlanders <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> in confusion, and they broke and fled to the shelter of the hedgerows, where they tried to resist the advance, but the Highlanders burst through without a pause. Their colonel, John Cameron, fell dead; but his men, more furious than before, flung themselves on the French, and <b>drove</b> them <b>back</b> in confusion into the wood.|$|R
5|$|Corippus narrates the {{subsequent}} battle at length, but his imitation of Virgilian verse provides little concrete detail: {{it is clear}} that it was a long, indecisive, and bloody conflict, which probably took place to the south or east of Sbeitla in late 546 or early 547. Eventually, the Byzantines prevailed and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> the Moors, breaking through their defences and storming their camp. According to Corippus, Ierna, who was the chief priest of the god Gurzil, was killed while trying to protect an image of the god. Many other tribal leaders fell, and the remainder scattered. The remains of the Tripolitanian tribes abandoned Byzacena, and Antalas was forced to lay down arms. In addition, many prisoners were released from the Moorish camp, and among the treasures captured there were the military standards lost by Solomon at Cillium in 544. These were dispatched to Constantinople, while Troglita held a triumphal entry into Carthage.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the war, Fort Bayard came under attack only once. During the Battle of Fort Stevens in July 1864, Confederate general Jubal Early {{launched}} a 25,000-man raid into Maryland with the hope of drawing off some of General Ulysses S. Grant's troops, who were pressing hard against the Army of Northern Virginia in the Siege of Petersburg. The raid hoped to attack Washington, thereby distracting Grant and potentially allowing the Confederate forces time to rest and regroup. On the morning of July 11, Confederate cavalry and infantry under the command of Brigadier General John McCausland advanced towards Washington with the goal of capturing Fort Reno, which defended the village of Tenleytown. Though they <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> the skirmish line in front of Fort Bayard, the Confederate cavalry were met with a heavy barrage of cannon fire from Bayard and its supporting forts. Discouraged by the resistance, McCausland's brigade moved to join up with the rest of Early's force, which was grouping for an assault on Fort Stevens.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of partisans under Lieutenant Elijah Clarke. This unit was pursued by British Major Patrick Ferguson. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby's men were gathering peaches from an orchard when they were surprised by some of Ferguson's men on a reconnaissance mission. Shelby's men quickly readied their arms and <b>drove</b> <b>back</b> the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby's men were winning the battle when Ferguson's main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not reach them. Now safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson's force withdrew from the area. Thus ended the Battle of Cedar Springs.|$|E
