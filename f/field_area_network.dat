40|$|Gateway {{functionality}} is a {{key point}} in leveraging the potential of a home or building automation network. High-level interfaces providing abstractions of <b>field</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (FAN) functionality significantly reduce the effort involved in creating application-level solutions. Such interfaces are presented on two different levels of abstraction. First, an interface corresponding to the Network layer of a FAN used in building automation (European Installation Bus, EIB) is shown, which unifies handling of the various physical media and bus access hardware available. Second, an approach {{with the goal of}} providing a generic representation of narrow-band building control functionality independent of a specific FAN technology is proposed. The interfaces are designed to be used by lightweight components of an OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative) platform, which is introduced as well. 1...|$|E
40|$|Field area {{networks}} are rapidly expanding {{to include a}} wide range of applications. Intelligent nodes on the network will be installed in a small to medium geographical area to monitor and control processes. Such nodes are generally connected to a centralized gateway used by a service provider to monitor and control various applications. The growth in popularity of ubiquitous computing requires the use of embedded network processors in everyday objects. Even though the idea of interaction between the digital devices around us could bring a great deal of convenience it also introduces great risks. Therefore such applications would not only require measurement, control and communication functionality but also a high level of security. Smart cards offer a simple, inexpensive method of incorporating a cryptographic processor into an embedded system that will allow for the implementation of security services. A <b>field</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> has resource limitations that influence security service implementation, such as low bandwidth, limited processing power, limited storage capacity and limited communication protocols. This dissertation discussed the implementation of a security policy for embedded field area networks used in distributed real-time applications, using smart card technology. The primary objective is to formulate a policy that can be implemented to secure a <b>field</b> <b>area</b> <b>network.</b> The secondary objective is to determine whether this policy can be implemented using mechanisms provided by smart card technology, while maintaining reasonable system performance. It states the approach taken to finding a viable solution to the problem defined above. A comprehensive literature study provides background on relevant technology and possible solutions. In a system overview the system’s boundaries and functional requirements are defined. The implementation section outlines possible solutions and describes how these can be implemented. Evaluation, verification and quantification of the performance of the proposed system are performed according to the experimental procedures described. The results obtained are documented and discussed. In the conclusion the proposed solution and the findings from the results are placed in context. Future topics of research in this field are suggested. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006. Computer Scienceunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Nowadays, {{state-of-the-art}} agent platforms cannot run on fieldbus systems, {{due to the}} constrained {{characteristics that}} the nodes present. Therefore, <b>field</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (FANs) are far from taking advantage of software agents and distributed intelligence techniques.

30|$|NAN can be {{considered}} as a bridge which collects data from multiple HANs and transmits the data to a data concentrator, and the command information in the other direction. NAN is a mesh network of smart meters, data collectors, and gateways. Smart meters typically act as the access points or relay nodes, and the backup power is generally not provided for them. NAN could also be called <b>field</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> when it is comprised of field electronic devices. There are usually no strict standards for the definition of this network. A single-hop approach is permitted, and also multiple hops approach is allowed to achieve a large coverage, although it would make the network more complex and costly. High scalability which would allow addition of more access points is necessary, and time sensitivity is not much of an issue. NAN requires bandwidth varying from 100 Kbps to 10 Mbps, and the coverage distance is up to 10 km. NAN can be implemented over a large number of communication technologies, such as ZigBee, WiFi, PLC, WiMAX, cellular, and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) [19 – 22].|$|E
40|$|Smart grid (SG) is an {{intelligent}} combination of computer science and electricity system whose main characteristics are measurement and real-time monitoring for utility and consumer behavior. SG {{is made of}} three main parts: Home Area Network (HAN), <b>Field</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> (FAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN). There are several techniques used for monitoring SG such as fiber optic but very costly and difficult to maintain. One {{of the ways to}} solve the monitoring problem is use of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). WSN is widely researched because of its easy deployment, low maintenance requirements, small hardware and low costs. However, SG is a harsh environment with high level of magnetic field and background noise and deploying WSN in this area is challenging since it has a direct effect on WSN link quality. An optimal relay node placement which has not yet worked in a smart grid can improve the link quality significantly. To solve the link quality problem and achieve optimum relay node placement, network life-time must be calculated because a longer life-time indicates better relay placement. To calculate this life-time, it is necessary to estimate packet reception rate (PRR). In this research, to achieve optimal relay node placement, firstly, a mathematical formula to measure link quality of the network in smart grid environment is proposed. Secondly, an algorithm based on neural network to estimate the network life-time has been developed. Thirdly, an algorithm based on genetic algorithm for efcient positioning of relay nodes under different conditions to increase the life-time of neural network has also been developed. Results from simulation showed that life-time prediction of neural network has a 91 % accuracy. In addition, there was an 85 % improvement of life-time compared to binary integer linear programming and weight binary integer linear programming. The research has shown that relay node placement based on the developed genetic algorithms have increased the network life-time, addressed the link quality problem and achieved optimum relay node placement...|$|E

40|$|The {{interconnection}} between <b>field</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> and IP-based LANs {{as well as}} the Intemet as a {{whole is}} becoming more and more popular. Emerging security issues have been neglected or underrated in the past. However, traditional security concepts that work well for LANs and the Intemet are hardly applicable to fieldbus systems. Based on an example from home automation, we review the problem and consider ways to prevent attacks both from the outside world and from within the fieldbus. Particular emphasis is given to firewalls, which are found to be of only limited value for securingfield-bus-Internet gateways. To tackle the security problem both on fieldbus level and in the Intemet, we propose the use of smart cards for authentication and encryption. We discuss modifications that are necessary to make field-bus nodes secure, why smart cards are “different ” and strategies to implement access control on the gateway. 1...|$|R
