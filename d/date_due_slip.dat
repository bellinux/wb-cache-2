40|$|There is {{potential}} for library <b>date</b> <b>due</b> <b>slips</b> to contain personal information (e. g., names) that compromises patron privacy. A {{survey was conducted}} of fifty-five Canadian English language public library systems to determine what sort of information is being printed on <b>date</b> <b>due</b> <b>slips.</b> While {{it was discovered that}} personal information was sometimes included, it was most often {{in the form of the}} borrowerâ€™s library card number, an almost anonymous identifier. The most commonly included information had to do with library services such as the name of the library, the titles of items borrowed, and the <b>due</b> <b>date.</b> Respondents cited patron privacy as the main reason for not including personal patron information. It appears that Canadian public libraries are aware of the importance of maintaining confidentiality in regard to library user records, at least in terms of the content of <b>date</b> <b>due</b> <b>slips...</b>|$|R

Simpson and commissioned on 21 September 1985 in Newport, Rhode Island, with Cmdr. H. Wyman Howard Jr. in command. The ship was delivered 13 September 1985. Bath Iron Works plans called for delivery to occur 9 August 1985, but that <b>date</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>due</b> to an extended strike at BIW that began 30 June 1985. Simpson was homeported at Naval Station Newport until switching to Naval Station Norfolk on 31 March 1994. Simpson moved to Naval Station Mayport in July 2001.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} performance of <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> resource allocation, project release, and activity scheduling rules in a multiproject environment. The results show that workload sensitive <b>due</b> <b>date</b> rules always provide better <b>due</b> <b>date</b> estimates than workload insensitive <b>due</b> <b>date</b> rules. In contrast, {{the performance of}} <b>due</b> <b>date</b> sensitive resource allocation rules is severely affected by <b>due</b> <b>date</b> nervousness. When <b>due</b> <b>date</b> nervousness is not mitigated, the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> insensitive First In System First Served (FISFS) resource allocation rule performs better than the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> sensitive resource allocation rules. Project release rules can, however, mitigate the effect of <b>due</b> <b>date</b> nervousness. Using a simple project release rule, {{the results show that}} the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> sensitive Minimum Project <b>Due</b> <b>Date</b> resource allocation rule performs better than FISFS and two other <b>due</b> <b>date</b> sensitive resource allocation rules in many project environments...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of maintaining open order <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> in job shops that plan and schedule their operations using Material Requirements Planning (MRP) methodology. Two different techniques for dealing with open order <b>due</b> <b>date</b> changes are analyzed using customer service level and total inventory level performance measures. With the first technique, called the fixed <b>due</b> <b>date</b> approach, <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> are never changed from those originally assigned to orders when released to the shop. With the second technique, called the dynamic <b>due</b> <b>date</b> approach, all <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> are updated to reflect actual need dates. Beyond evaluating them in an MRP context, this study extends current understanding of these two techniques by observing them in a variety of different operating environments. The results of the study indicate that: (1) the dynamic <b>due</b> <b>date</b> approach performs as good as, or better than, the fixed <b>due</b> <b>date</b> approach across a wide range of operating conditions; and (2) operating conditions have an important effect on the magnitude of the performance differential between the two approaches. production scheduling, material requirements planning, shop floor control, <b>due</b> <b>date</b> maintenance, rescheduling...|$|R

40|$|VirtualClock service {{scheduling}} scheme [1] is an Earliest <b>Due</b> <b>Date</b> (EDD) scheme {{where the}} <b>due</b> <b>date</b> {{of a cell}} is its departure time from a single server queue with constant service rate equal to the allocated bandwidth of the cell's Virtual Connection (VC). The initial implementation of the VirtualClock scheme [1] computed the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> of an arriving cell and stamped the cell with the <b>due</b> <b>date.</b> The stamped cells were placed in a sorted buffer and served in increasing order of <b>due</b> <b>dates.</b> Since <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> are monotonically increasing parameters, a large buffer is needed to store stamped cells. In this paper, a new implementation is proposed which does not use cell stamping nor any monotonically increasing parameters such as virtual and real clocks. Instead of storing the <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> of each cell, the proposed implementation only keeps track of the time to <b>due</b> <b>date</b> of the Head-of-the-Line (HOL) cell of each VC. Moreover, the proposed implementation also sheds light on the relationship betwee [...] ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increased}} emphasis on the effective management of operational issues in supply chains, the timely delivery of products has become even more important. Companies have to quote attainable delivery dates and then meet these, or face large tardiness penalties. We study systems that can be modeled by single-machine scheduling problems with <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment and controllable job-processing times, which are either linear or convex functions {{of the amount of}} a continuously divisible and nonrenewable resource that is allocated to the task. The <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment methods studied include the common <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> the slack <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> which reflects equal waiting time allowance for the jobs, and the most general method of unrestricted <b>due</b> <b>dates,</b> when each job may be assigned a different <b>due</b> <b>date.</b> For each combination of <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment method and processing-time function, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal job sequence, <b>due</b> <b>date</b> values, and resource allocations that minimize an integrated objective function, which includes the weighted number of tardy jobs, and <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment, makespan, and total resource consumption costs. delivery time quotation, order sequencing, single-machine scheduling, <b>due</b> <b>date</b> assignment methods, controllable processing times, resource allocation...|$|R
