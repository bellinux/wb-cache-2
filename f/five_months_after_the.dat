Construction of MD 70 began from US 50, then also under construction, to Weems Creek, including the bridge over the creek, in October 1952.

Bladen Street was expanded to a two-way boulevard in 1983. MD 70 was extended north to its present terminus and its junction with US 50 and US 301 was changed to a partial cloverleaf interchange in 1991.
