5|$|After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda {{began working}} on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As she had missed Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she had {{returned}} to the Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while checking {{in and out of the}} hospital. She did not get better, nor did she finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda was locked into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the <b>dumbwaiter</b> shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died.|$|E

5000|$|Building codes have {{regulated}} {{the construction}} and operation of <b>dumbwaiters</b> in parts of North America since the 19th century. Modern <b>dumbwaiters</b> in the United States and Canada must comply with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) codes and, therefore, have features {{similar to those of}} passenger elevators. [...] The construction, operation and usage of <b>dumbwaiters</b> varies widely according to country.|$|R
50|$|More recent <b>dumbwaiters</b> {{can be more}} sophisticated, using {{electric}} motors, {{automatic control}} systems, and custom freight containers of other kinds of elevators. Recently constructed book lifts in libraries and mail or other freight transports in office towers may be larger than many <b>dumbwaiters</b> in public restaurants and private homes, supporting loads as heavy as 450 kg (990 lbs).|$|R

25|$|The building's {{flat roof}} was modeled {{from that of}} a {{storm-proof}} deck from an ocean liner and included a loggia, deck, and recreation room. Once covered with ceramic tiles, the flooring had to be replaced and covered with roofing for it to endure the harsh mid-western winters. At some point in time, a <b>dumbwaiter</b> was also located on the terrace; however, it was removed shortly after the move to Beverly Shores.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{ascension}} to the throne, Louis XVI presented the Petit Trianon to Marie Antoinette. Immediately thereafter, the queen ordered modificationlargely {{under the direction}} of Richard Miqueto the Petit Trianon and its gardens. The house was remodeled, which necessitated the removal of the <b>dumbwaiter</b> system that Louis XV installed that allowed the dining table to be lowered to the kitchen level of the house, thus eliminating the need for servants in the dining room. At this time, the jardins botaniques were removed to Paris and the Hameau de la reine constructed in their stead.|$|E
25|$|Lanier's campus {{has been}} {{expanded}} numerous times {{since it was}} first built. The most notable expansion was {{the addition of the}} area of the building housing the cafeteria and gymnasium. This expansion has resulted in some quirks in the building that are still visible today, most notably a door leading to stairs to the basement that is only half-exposed above the floor of the hallway. These stairs are no longer in service, though the door can be opened even though it's blocked by the hallway floor. Students aren't allowed to open the door and/or go down those stairs. Prior to this expansion, the cafeteria was located where the library is today, on the third floor. A <b>dumbwaiter,</b> located where the elevator is today, carried food to the cafeteria.|$|E
50|$|A {{division}} of the state public safety department, The Board of Elevator Regulations, has eight members who are appointed to serve by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Board of Elevator Regulations regulates the construction, installation, alteration and operation of all elevators in Massachusetts. The term “elevator” includes moving stairways, <b>dumbwaiters,</b> moving walkways, material lifts, vertical reciprocating conveyors, and <b>dumbwaiters</b> with automatic transfer devices, wheelchair lifts, automatic people movers and other associated devices that are commonly included within the elevator industry. All elevator constructors, maintenance people, repairpeople, and operators must be licensed by the Board.|$|R

25|$|The Main Roads Department {{building}} was purpose-designed, accommodating the Main Roads Department's diverse uses in repetitive and rationalised floor plates. Although offices and administration areas comprised the majority, the building also included: basement car parking; food facilities {{for the staff}} - a large cafeteria with kitchen, kiosk for snacks, and lunch room; staff training facilities - a large, double-height auditorium with the latest projection equipment; a technical and recreation library; a room for displaying models of major Main Roads projects, and; a large air-conditioning plant and a caretaker's flat. The {{building was}} designed to incorporate modern office technology. The department's technical and commercial electronic data processing divisions were accommodated in the basement, including their {{state of the art}} computer, the largest in Queensland at the time. The computer was serviced by a special, independent air-conditioning system, designed to keep the computer room at a constant temperature and humidity, with the heat generated by the computer absorbed by the ornamental ponds {{at the front of the}} building. A system of vacuum message tubes connected all sections of the building and there were telephones and a master clock system, CCTV, a teleprinter system, a Xerox machine, and a <b>dumbwaiter</b> for the movement of files between floors.|$|E
500|$|Pullman-Standard built 30 dining cars; Bombardier built another 39. The dining cars can seat {{a maximum}} of 72 people on the upper level in tables of four. The galley {{occupies}} the entire lower level. At {{the center of the}} car are stairs down to the kitchen. A <b>dumbwaiter</b> is used to bring food and drink to the dining level, as well as to return dishes, glasses, and cutlery for washing. A late 2010s overhaul added a refrigerator on the upper level for easy access and replaced incandescent lights with LED lighting.

500|$|The plain {{exterior}} is contrasted by {{the elegance}} of {{the interior of the}} house. The house has elaborate hall ceilings, detailed woodwork and arched marble fireplaces. The floor plan is built around the central hall with an offset stairway. The parlor rooms to the right are separated by a wide archway. The two rooms to the left are a dining room and a pantry that has a <b>dumbwaiter</b> to the kitchen in the cellar. The National Historic Register of Places nomination noted that the cellar contained the [...] "remains of the kitchen, washroom and wine cellar". The second floor is made of four chambers and the attic consists of five small rooms. The attic's rooms served as the servants' cubicles.|$|E
500|$|Six dining {{cars were}} built. Each dining car seated 80 (all {{on the upper}} level), {{compared}} to 36 in a single-level diner. The lower level housed the kitchen; <b>dumbwaiters</b> carried food to the upper level. The dining cars, the largest single-unit dining cars ever built, weighed [...] and rode on six-wheel trucks.|$|R
50|$|Krzyżtopór was {{furnished}} with amenities that were rarely {{seen in the}} 17th century, such as ventilation and heating system, and unique waterworks that provided all rooms with fresh water. Allegedly, the ceiling in one of dining rooms {{was made up of}} an aquarium containing exotic fish. Additionally, a system of <b>dumbwaiters</b> carried food from pantries to the upper floors.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{his release}} from prison, he moved to New York City and briefly teamed up with Johnny Thunders. They formed the band Gang War. He also played with popular 1980 band Fats Deacon and the <b>Dumbwaiters,</b> making {{appearances}} on [...] "The Uncle Floyd Show", and appearing at all the major clubs of that era. The <b>Dumbwaiters</b> also included singer, songwriter, keyboards, Derek [...] "Fats Deacon" [...] Jones, drummer Paul Blaccard and bassist Anthony Lombardo, Drummer Joey [...] "Bones" [...] Amanna, guitarist Bobby [...] "Slacks" [...] Brunswick (of Dungaree Dogs fame). Wayne appeared {{the first time as}} guitarist for Fats Deacon, with Bobby [...] "Slacks" [...] as bassist, on the Uncle Floyd Show.

[...] Wayne supplied the screaming hot guitar lead fills, Bobby Brunswick did the rhythm guitar tracks. The song was recorded and produced at Song Shop Records on West 22nd street in Manhattan, New York.|$|R
500|$|The {{combined}} hotel, after merging in 1897, had 1,300 {{bedrooms and}} 178 bathrooms, {{making it the}} largest hotel {{in the world at}} the time. With a telephone in every room and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater {{to the needs of the}} socially prominent, [...] "wealthy, upper crust" [...] of New York, as well as distinguished foreign visitors to the city. It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms, and featured numerous Turkish and Russian baths for the gentlemen of the day to relax in. Many of the floors were arranged as separate hotels to further the comfort of the guests. Each of these floors had its own team of assistants—clerks, maids, page boys, waiters—as well as telephone and <b>dumbwaiter</b> service, and refrigerators. The bedrooms and corridors were heated by direct radiation. The family included a stained glass picture of Walldorf in the design of the hotel; it was located on the 33rd Street side over the main entrance to the South Palm Garden.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the University {{planned to}} use the Tower as a library space, using a <b>dumbwaiter</b> system to carry books from the upper floors to the {{students}} requesting them in the circulation room on a lower floor. Library employees were stationed every other floor; students filled out paper book request slips, which were sent upstairs by a pneumatic tube. The books were sent down to the students using an 18-story <b>dumbwaiter.</b> This proved ineffective, and the <b>dumbwaiter</b> was removed to place network and other computer cabling in the same shaft. The building now mainly contains administrative offices, though it does still house a three-floor life sciences library and the Miriam Lutcher Stark Library of early and significant editions of English Romanticist works. Two separate sets of elevators serve the building; one in the front, one in back. In the floors above the stacks and below a few top-floor offices, several floors contain the university herbarium (Plant Resources Center). U.S. Census data analysis is compiled and analyzed {{on some of these}} floors. Lastly, two secure elevators provides access to the entire 27 floors of the Tower while an elevator on the 27th floor provides access to the 28th floor Observation Deck. [...] There is also a book elevator in the stacks that serves floors 2 through 17.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the back}} of the room is a <b>dumbwaiter,</b> which {{delivers}} occasional food orders. This is mysterious and both characters seem to be puzzled why these orders keep coming; the basement is clearly not outfitted as a restaurant kitchen. At one point they send up some snack food that Gus had brought along. Ben has to explain to the people above via the dumbwaiter's [...] "speaking tube" [...] that there is no food.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dumbwaiters</b> {{are small}} freight {{elevators}} that {{are intended to}} carry food, books or other small freight loads rather than passengers. They often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors. They usually {{do not have the}} same safety features found in passenger elevators, like various ropes for redundancy. They have a lower capacity, and they can be up to 1 m tall. Control panels at every stop mimic those found in passenger elevators, allowing calling, door control and floor selection.|$|R
2500|$|In the United States, the Union Pacific Railroad {{operated}} dome dining cars. These {{cars had}} a {{kitchen in the}} short end, with a pantry in half the space under the dome. The {{other half of the}} space under the dome was a private dining room for small groups. Between the pantry and kitchen there was a <b>dumbwaiter</b> to transfer items between the kitchen and the dining area in the dome portion of the car. The [...] "long end" [...] was the main dining area.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} five seasons, from 1976 to 1980, the show was set in Milwaukee (executive {{producer}} Thomas L. Miller's home town), taking place from roughly 1958–59 through the early 1960s. Shotz Brewery bottle cappers and best friends, Laverne DeFazio and Shirley Feeney, live in a basement apartment, where they communicate with upstairs neighbors Lenny and Squiggy by screaming up the <b>dumbwaiter</b> shaft connecting their apartments. Also included in the show are Laverne's father, Frank DeFazio, proprietor of the Pizza Bowl, and Edna Babish, the apartment building's landlady, who would later marry Frank. Shirley maintained an off-again on-again romance with dancer/singer/boxer Carmine Ragusa. During this period, characters from Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley would make occasional guest appearances on each other's shows. During the fifth season, the girls went into the Army, and they contended with a tough-as-nails drill sergeant named Alvinia T. Plout (Vicki Lawrence).|$|E
2500|$|Bogart, a heavy smoker and drinker, had {{developed}} {{cancer of the}} esophagus. He almost never spoke of his failing health and refused {{to see a doctor}} until January 1956 after much persistence from Bacall. A diagnosis of cancer was made several weeks later. He underwent a surgical operation on March 1, 1956, where his entire esophagus, two lymph nodes, and a rib were removed but, by then, {{it was too late to}} halt the disease, even with chemotherapy. He underwent corrective surgery in November 1956 after the cancer had spread. With time, he grew too weak to walk up and down stairs, fighting the pain yet still able to joke: [...] "Put me in the <b>dumbwaiter</b> and I'll ride down to the first floor in style." [...] It was then altered to accommodate his wheelchair. [...] Frank Sinatra was a frequent visitor, as were Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.

50|$|An {{elevator}} mechanic {{is someone}} who constructs, modernizes, repairs, or services conveyances. Typically elevator mechanics only work on elevators, escalators, <b>dumbwaiters,</b> wheelchair lifts, moving walkways, and other equipment providing vertical transportation. In many countries, particularly in North America, the elevator mechanic belongs to a trade, called Elevator Constructors. In this profession, labor unions have a large impact on who works as an elevator mechanic, depending on the country they work in. Local codes and laws only allow certain people with permits, to work on conveyances like elevators.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} was modernized and living conditions improved during capital expenditures {{during the late}} 1870s that saw rooms painted and decorated, {{as well as the}} installation of <b>dumbwaiters</b> and elevators, hot water throughout the building, improved ventilation, water closets, and a central laundry service operating steam-heated washers and dryers. An 1878 addition (the first of five) was constructed to the building for housing male patients and a workshop was opened for them in 1880. In 1881 an addition was constructed for female patients which helped to relieve overcrowding concerns.|$|R
2500|$|Traces of log boom {{operation}} are scant, {{as most of}} {{the structures}} were removed when the business closed in 1914. [...] The historical marker is located near the site of the mess hall. [...] A shallow cave near the base of the river stairs was used as a natural root cellar. [...] The cook shanty stood on the blufftop directly above, and a <b>dumbwaiter</b> was rigged through a hole cut in the cave roof to deliver food directly from its storage area. [...] The scenic overlook rises above the point where the main log boom was chained across the river. [...] Across the highway from the wayside parking area is a private home that was once the St. Croix Boom Company House and Barn, built circa 1885 as the residence of the on-site superintendent. [...] It was long assumed that no other structures remained from the log boom era, but in 1975 a historical survey crew from the National Park Service rediscovered two buildings hidden by forest. [...] One was identified as a crew office that also functioned as a winter warming hut.|$|E
2500|$|More than 100 {{kilograms}} of gold {{were used to}} gild the sophisticated stucco façade and numerous statues erected on the roof. In front of the palace a great formal garden was laid out. It centres on the azure-and-white Hermitage Pavilion near the lake, designed by Mikhail Zemtsov in 1744, remodelled by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1749 and formerly crowned by a grand-gilded sculpture representing The Rape of Persephone. The interior of the pavilion featured dining tables with <b>dumbwaiter</b> mechanisms. The grand entrance to the palace is flanked by two massive [...] "circumferences", also in the Rococo style.

2500|$|The Field Guide, {{the first}} book in the series, was {{published}} in May 2003. It opens in Maine, where nine-year-old identical twins Jared and Simon and their thirteen-year-old sister Mallory move into the decrepit Spiderwick Estate with their mother, Helen. On the first night, they discover a secret library {{on the second floor}} using a <b>dumbwaiter.</b> They later discover that the library connects {{to the rest of the}} house via a hidden door in a hall closet. [...] A brownie named Thimbletack, who has lived in the house for years, becomes angry with the Grace children when they destroy his nest inside the walls, and Jared is blamed for the ensuing havoc wrought by the brownie in retaliation including assaults on Mallory, Simon, and the trashing of the kitchen. Following a clue in the form of a riddle-poem, Jared finds Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You in a secret compartment in a trunk in the attic. The Field Guide is an old hand-written and illustrated book with information on different types of faeries. The novel ends as the Grace children make amends with Thimbletack by building him a new home out of an old birdhouse. Thimbletack then warns them that the book which they found is dangerous and was not meant to be in the hands of mortals.|$|E

50|$|The Ritz Tower {{was built}} from 1925 to 1927 and was {{designed}} by Emery Roth and Thomas Hastings, formerly of Carrère and Hastings, for journalist Arthur Brisbane, who was also the developer. It was built as an apartment hotel, with no individual kitchens {{in any of the}} 400 units; food was provided by centralized kitchens using <b>dumbwaiters</b> to pantries on each floor. Since apartment hotels were not subject to the same height restrictions as residential apartment buildings, the developer was able to build taller than would otherwise have been allowed.
