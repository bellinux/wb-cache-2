500|$|The {{band has}} stated that the album's tenth track, [...] "Wretches and Kings", pays homage to the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Speaking to NME about the song's {{reference}} to Public Enemy, Shinoda said, [...] "There is a homage to Chuck D on there. It's probably the most hip-hop song on the record {{and one of the}} most aggressive...Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively." [...] Ian Winwood of Kerrang! noted that [...] "Wretches and Kings" [...] references the Public Enemy song [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and compared the album's content to Public Enemy's third studio album, Fear of a Black Planet. Chuck D later provided vocals on a remix by HavocNdeeD. The fifth track [...] "When They Come for Me" [...] references , the seventh studio album by hip hop artist Jay-Z, with whom the band collaborated on the 2004 EP Collision Course. The album includes samples of notable speeches by American political figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Mario Savio.|$|E

It was past noon, therefore they ordered their landlord, downstairs, to send up hot beefsteaks, chickens, and such things, and these they ate, sitting comfortable at the several tables, whilst they chatted, disputed and laughed. The door to the surgeon's room stood open, meantime, but the cutting, sewing, splicing, and bandaging <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> in plain view did not seem to disturb anyone's appetite. I went in and saw the surgeon labor awhile, but could not enjoy; it was much less trying to see the wounds given and received than to see them mended; the stir and turmoil, and the music of the steel, were wanting here--one's nerves were wrung by this grisly spectacle, whilst the duel's compensating pleasurable thrill was lacking.|$|E
