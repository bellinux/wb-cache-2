40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increase}} in railway usage which led to reduced time for rail maintenance. Railway switches and crossings (S&C) are an important asset and they typically account for 30 % of the total budget spent on maintenance. The first part of this work researches the feasibility of automatically inspecting S&Cs in accordance with Network Rail inspection requirements and the likely necessary advancements. Current S&C inspection requirements, as well as current and developing inspection solutions, were analysed and categorised. This revealed the required technological advances and likely changes that the railway will have to adopt. The second part of the work researches the weakness of conventional S&C profile inspection practices used in industry. The work identified the main reasons that can lead to poor traditional inspection of the S&C profile, developed a novel, automatic method to carry out the profile measurements which eliminated human error and identified possible improvements in the area of S&C profile inspection. During this research, an <b>inspection</b> <b>trolley</b> was prototyped, field trials were carried out, and good results were obtained...|$|E

5000|$|Bridges Adams {{patented}} {{an improved}} carriage spring, {{which he called}} [...] "bow springs". These {{could also be used}} on railway carriages, and the manufacture proved profitable. The manufacture was based in the Currier Factory in Drury Lane and Parker Street, Soho. The business was carried out in the name of Samuel Adams, Bridges Adams's uncle. In 1842 the factory moved from its small premises to three acres of land adjoining the Eastern Counties Railway at Fair Field, Bow. The company now traded as Adams & Co. He founded the Fairfield Locomotive Works (...) in Bow, East London, in 1843, where he specialized in light engines, steam railcars (or railmotors) and <b>inspection</b> <b>trolleys.</b> These were sold in small numbers to railways all over Britain and Ireland, including the Fairfield steam carriage for the broad gauge Bristol and Exeter Railway and the Enfield for his most important customer, the Eastern Counties Railway, with its headquarters at nearby Stratford. Dissatisfied with the scarf joints then in use for joining iron track, he invented the first railway fishplate, {{in the form of an}} unbolted wedge between adjoining chairs, in collaboration with Robert Richardson, a junior engineer under Peter Bruff on the Eastern Counties Railway. The two men patented the invention in 1847. Although the design was successful, with sales to the Eastern Counties Railway among others, financial difficulties forced Adams to relinquish the patent. This [...] "wedge" [...] version was soon overtaken by an improved, bolted design by James Samuel of the Eastern Counties Railway. He also supplied an 2-2-0 well tank to the Roman Railway.|$|R
40|$|Subject of investigation: contact {{network of}} trunk {{electrified}} railways. Purpose of the work: provision for reliable and economic current pick-off and {{improvement of the}} quality of operation of the contact network of electrified railways. A principle is developed for simultaneous measurement of wear of two contact wires in the fixed points {{with the use of a}} system monitoring the position of wires relative to the plan-view way axis. Methods are created for the design and investigation of the measuring skids with follow-up movable carriages. A device is developed for measuring the wear of the wires. Created are a stand and a specialized sector for the experimental dynamic investigation of the contact network diagnostical devices. The device for measuring the wear of contact wires is incorporated in the complex of the developed equipment of a laboratory railway <b>inspection</b> <b>trolley</b> for testing the contact network. The results of the work provide for the increase of the reliability of operation of the contact network owing to the detection of impermissible deviation of its parameters, and for the increase of labour productivity by way of automation of the production processesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{high speed}} dual purpose rail/road {{vehicles}} employing fixed non-destructive testing (NDT) sensors {{are used to}} inspect rails. Due to the uncertainties in characterisation of the defects when they are detected at high speed, manual re-visiting of the defects by expert operators is required before any decision regarding track maintenance is made. This research {{has been driven by}} a desire from the rail industry for a robotic system performing faster than human operators and being capable to both detect and characterise rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks in rails with the aim of automating the existing manual inspection and enhancing its accuracy and reliability. This thesis combines expert systems technologies with robotic NDT to fulfil this aspiration. A great deal of effort has been spent to develop a robotic <b>inspection</b> <b>trolley</b> which can automatically detect and characterise the RCF cracks in rails using an alternating current field measurement (ACFM) sensor. It uses a rule based expert system (RBES) proposed to control the robotic trolley and more importantly process ACFM data for both detecting and sizing defects. The developed system can detect the possible presence of defects in railway tracks at high speed pass (5 - 20 km/h) and can automatically return to an identified defect location to perform a slower and more detailed scan (up to 20 mm/s) across a rail section to determine the size, depth and number of cracks present in that section...|$|E
40|$|Laser-EMAT (ElectroMagnetic Acoustic Transducer) ultrasonics is a {{suitable}} technique for on-line surface and internal defect detection in a steel mill. The system {{is intended to}} automatically inspect steel, at temperatures in excess of 700 degrees C, as it moves through the steel manufacturing process. It {{is one of the}} few ultrasonic systems that could ever be used in the harsh operating environment of a steel mill due to its non-contact nature. In the laboratory and pilot development stages, the equipment can be optimised and designed to work under these harsh conditions. Before the technology can be used on hot, moving product in the steel plant, it is necessary to conduct experiments on moving steel at ambient temperatures, so that system optimisation is performed under more practical conditions. As such, the design of an automated <b>trolley</b> <b>inspection</b> systemfor inspecting a 1. 6 m-long 110 mm-square steel billet at room temperature will be discussed. The laserEMAT system was later used to find a surface defect in the steel, as it moved at 800 degrees C on a pilot scale rolling mill. B-scan data will be presented highlighting the presence of a surface defect on the steel moved both under laboratory and industrial conditions. ...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I he was visiting England and about to join the staff of General Sir Hubert Hamilton in Belgium, but instead was ordered to German South West Africa as Assistant Q.M-General to Brigadier-General Duncan McKenzie's force with the rank of Colonel. From LÃ¼deritz Bay {{he was in charge}} of the restoration of the railway and of supplying the forces with water, critically important in the semi-desert region. On 19 May 1915 while returning from a tour of <b>inspection,</b> his motor <b>trolley</b> collided with a construction train at Kuibis, near Gibeon, and he succumbed to his injuries the following day. He was buried in Bedford Farm Cemetery east of Johannesburg - Bedford Farm was named for his boyhood hometown. Farrarmere, a suburb of Benoni in the East Rand of Johannesburg, South Africa is also named after him as his hunting lodge was located there. He married Ella Mabel Waylen (c.1869-1922) on 3 June 1893 and had six daughters: Helen Mabel b. 1894; Muriel Frances b. 1896, who married Anthony Lowther, Viscount Lowther; Gwendoline b. 1897; Kathleen Elizabeth b. 1907; Ella Marguerite b. 1911. [...] Although Farrar had no male heirs and his baronetcy became extinct, through his daughter Muriel he was the grandfather of James Lowther, 7th Earl of Lonsdale and the great grandfather of Hugh Lowther, 8th Earl of Lonsdale.|$|R
