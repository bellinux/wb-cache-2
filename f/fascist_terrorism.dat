Writing under the pen name Fjordman, Jensen has developed a range of writings, some of which have come to operate at the interface between Islamophobic populism and contemporary <b>fascist</b> <b>terrorism.</b> To explore this interface, this article analyzes the various writings by Jensen/Fjordman that Breivik himself reproduced in his manifesto 2083 : A European Declaration of Independence. It concludes that, while not directly instructing Breivik to carry out an act of terrorism, there is nevertheless a looser connection between Jensen’s rhetoric, which points toward violent action, and the behavior of others such as Breivik. It explores this link through the lens of “license,” a methodology developed by Aristotle Kallis. This approach allows the analysis to highlight that, beneath a veneer of more moderate anti-Muslim populism, the discourse Peder Jensen has written under the pen name Fjordman evokes many of the tropes of fascism, including coded endorsement of ethnic nationalism, misogyny, conspiracy theories, a concern with profound cultural decadence, and a palingenetic language that idealizes revolution coming about through wa...|$|E

"When the Spanish {{war broke}} out, Bernanos {{had been living}} {{for more than a}} year in Palma, Majorca, in very {{difficult}} circumstances, and suffering from the after-effects of a motor-cycle accident. It was in Majorca that Bernanos watched civil war, or rather - since the island fell almost at once into the hands of the <b>Fascists</b> - watched <b>terrorism</b> eating its slow way into this little middle-class and peasant community." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the aims, strategies and constraints under which terrorist organizations act, we have to analyze carefully their actions. Some terrorist organizations carry out indiscriminate attacks, some others opt for selective killings. Some terrorist organizations focus on attacks against the State, some others attack social groups. To shed light on this variation, we propose in this paper a new methodological approach to the analysis of target selection. Going beyond gathering information about objective traits of the victims, we connect the selection of the victim with the aims and strategies of terrorist organizations. Thus, we codify information about victims in two different variables. One {{has to do with the}} selectivity of the killing-the “how ” of the attack. The other, with the strategic aim of the killing –the “why ” of the attack. Building on those two variables, we propose a codification scheme general enough to fit the violence of different types of terrorism. To illustrate our methodology, we have created an exhaustive dataset of terrorist killings for three types of terrorism in three Western European countries (Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). In total, we have collected detailed evidence, based on local sources, on 3, 230 fatalities for the period 1965 - 2005. We consider cases of (i) revolutionary or left-wing terrorism (Red Brigades, GRAPO); (ii) ethno-nationalist terrorism (ETA, IRA); (iii) and <b>fascist</b> or right-wing <b>terrorism</b> (Nar, Ordine Nero). To make sense of the data, we suggest six propositions that may account for the unearthed variance in target selection within terrorist organizations...|$|R
