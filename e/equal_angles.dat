25|$|A {{converse}} of a theorem is {{a statement}} formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and {{what is to be}} proved. For example, the isosceles triangle theorem states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are <b>equal</b> <b>angles</b> is the statement that two <b>equal</b> <b>angles</b> must be right angles, and this is clearly not always the case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} steel sections {{have been}} increasingly used in buildings and bridges, and steel angles {{have also been}} widely used in many steel structures, especially in transmission towers and long span trusses. However, high strength steel exhibits mechanical properties that are quite different from ordinary strength steel, and hence, the local buckling behavior of steel <b>equal</b> <b>angle</b> members under axial compression varies with the steel strength. However, {{there is a lack}} of research on the relationship of the local buckling behavior of steel <b>equal</b> <b>angle</b> members under axial compression with the steel strength. A finite element model is developed in this paper to analyze the local buckling behavior of steel <b>equal</b> <b>angle</b> members under axial compression, and study its relationship with the steel strength and the width-to-thickness ratio of the angle leg. The finite element analysis (FEA) results are compared with the corresponding design method in the American code AISC 360 - 05, which provides a reference for the related design...|$|R

The results showed that increasing the axial compressive load leads to a reduction of the natural frequency of the structure. The theory of end rotational stiffness for pinned end support (σ= 0) and clamped support (σ=∞) are difficult to occur on the implementation. The analytical predictions of the axial compressive force by regression of the frequency for combinations of pinned-pinned, clamped-clamped and pinned-clamped supports provide better accuracy than that the original data of the frequency of the test results...|$|R

2500|$|Hatch marks, {{also called}} tick marks, {{are used in}} {{diagrams}} of triangles and other geometric figures to identify sides of equal lengths. A side can be marked with a pattern of [...] "ticks", short line segments {{in the form of}} tally marks; two sides have equal lengths if they are both marked with the same pattern. In a triangle, the pattern is usually no more than 3 ticks. An equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 sides, an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 sides, and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all sides since no sides are equal. Similarly, patterns of 1, 2, or 3 concentric arcs inside the angles are used to indicate <b>equal</b> <b>angles.</b> An equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 angles, an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 angles, and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all angles since no angles are equal.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{probability}} that a certain event will happen, one sums {{the probability}} amplitudes for all of the possible ways in which the event can occur, and then takes the square of the length of the result. The probability amplitude for a photon from a monochromatic source to arrive at a certain final point at a given time, in this case, can be modeled as an arrow that spins rapidly until it is evaluated when the photon reaches its final point. For example, for {{the probability that}} a photon will reflect off of a mirror and be observed at a given point a given amount of time later, one sets the photon's probability amplitude spinning as it leaves the source, follows it to the mirror, and then to its final point, even for paths that do not involve bouncing off of the mirror at <b>equal</b> <b>angles.</b> One can then evaluate the probability amplitude at the photon's final point; next, one can integrate over all of these arrows (see vector sum), and square the length of the result to obtain the probability that this photon will reflect off of the mirror in the pertinent fashion. The times these paths take are what determine the angle of the probability amplitude arrow, as they can be said to [...] "spin" [...] at a constant rate (which is related to the frequency of the photon).|$|E

60|$|In {{the more}} complex {{branches}} of knowledge, the deductions seldom consist, as in the examples hitherto exhibited, of a single chain, a a mark of b, b of c, c of d, therefore a a mark of d. They consist (to carry on the same metaphor) of several chains united at the extremity, as thus: a a mark of d, b of e, c of f, d e f of n, therefore a b c a mark of n. Suppose, for example, the following combination of circumstances: 1st, rays of light impinging on a reflecting surface; 2d, that surface parabolic; 3d, those rays {{parallel to each other}} and to the axis of the surface. It is to be proved that the concourse of these three circumstances is a mark that the reflected rays will pass through the focus of the parabolic surface. Now, each of the three circumstances is singly a mark of something material to the case. Rays of light impinging on a reflecting surface are a mark that those rays will be reflected at an angle equal to the angle of incidence. The parabolic form of the surface, is a mark that, from any point of it, a line drawn to the focus and a line parallel to the axis will make <b>equal</b> <b>angles</b> with the surface. And finally, the parallelism of the rays to the axis is a mark that their angle of incidence coincides with one of these <b>equal</b> <b>angles.</b> The three marks taken together are therefore a mark of all these three things united. But the three united are evidently a mark that the angle of reflection must coincide with the other of the two <b>equal</b> <b>angles,</b> that formed by a line drawn to the focus; and this again, by the fundamental axiom concerning straight lines, is a mark that the reflected rays pass through the focus. Most chains of physical deduction are of this more complicated type; and even in mathematics such are abundant, as in all propositions where the hypothesis includes numerous conditions: “If a circle be taken, and if within that circle a point be taken, not the centre, and if straight lines be drawn from that point to the circumference, then,” etc.|$|E
