50|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background is radiation left over <b>from</b> <b>decoupling</b> after the epoch of recombination when neutral atoms first formed. At this point, radiation produced in the Big Bang stopped Thomson scattering from charged ions. The radiation, first observed in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson, has a perfect thermal black-body spectrum. It has a temperature of 2.7 kelvins today and is isotropic to one part in 105. Cosmological perturbation theory, which describes the evolution of slight inhomogeneities in the early universe, has allowed cosmologists to precisely calculate the angular power spectrum of the radiation, {{and it has been}} measured by the recent satellite experiments (COBE and WMAP) and many ground and balloon-based experiments (such as Degree Angular Scale Interferometer, Cosmic Background Imager, and Boomerang). One of the goals of these efforts is to measure the basic parameters of the Lambda-CDM model with increasing accuracy, as well as to test the predictions of the Big Bang model and look for new physics. The recent measurements made by WMAP, for example, have placed limits on the neutrino masses.|$|E

We start with an (F, D 3) bound state Lorentz-boosted along one D 3 -brane direction perpendicular to the F-string, and show that insisting a decoupled NCOS allows only infinitesimal Lorentz boosts. In this way, it is shown that the V-duality relates a family of NCOS by Galileo boosts. Starting with a Lorentz-boosted (D 1,D 3) bound state, we show that a similar V-duality works for noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) theories as well.

In addition, numerous research studies have established that FCS-MPC yields smaller total harmonic distortion (THD) and smaller mean absolute current reference tracking error as compared to traditional linear controllers [31, 36, 37, 40, 41]. Hence, FCS-MPC could be an excellent alternative for PEV charger control. However, {{there is a lack of}} application of MPC using either current control or power control in the PEV charger.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{proposes a}} general {{framework}} for the description of short- and long-term behavior of cement-based materials subjected to mechanical loading and chemical degradation. The framework can take into account two different damage mechanisms, mechanical damage and chemical damage, and their interaction also can be considered.

The elastic modulus, Drucker-Prager–type criterion, and empirical evolution law of creep strain are related to mechanical damage and chemical damage variables. The evolution kinetic of mechanical damage caused by compression and tensile stress are defined, respectively. The chemical damage is defined {{with respect to the}} actual concentration of calcium in the solid skeleton, which is calculated from the mass balance equation of calcium ions.

Considering the fact that, in naive implementations of interval algorithms, overestimation might lead to unnecessarily conservative results, suitable consistency tests are essential to obtain the tightest possible enclosures. In this contribution, a general framework {{for the use of}} constraints based on physically motivated conservation properties is presented. The use of these constraints in verified simulations of dynamical systems provides a computationally efficient procedure which restricts the state enclosures to regions that are physically meaningful. A branch and prune algorithm is modified to a consistency test, which is based on these constraints. Two application scenarios are studied in detail. First, the total energy is employed as a conservation property for the analysis of mechanical systems.

The model is calibrated to the region 'Hohenlohe' in Baden-Württemberg which is char-acterised by intensive livestock farming on the plains and extensive cattle and dairy farming in more remote valleys. The policy simulations show that impacts on structural change, competitiveness, and income distribution vary greatly depending on how the policy scheme is implemented.

Nowadays, the "symmetry data" of any band structure, i. e., the irreducible representations of all valence bands, can be readily extracted from standard numerical calculations based on first principles. On the other hand, the topological invariants, the defining quantities of topological materials, are in general considerably difficult to calculate ab initio. While topological materials promise robust and exotic physical properties both scientifically intriguing and favorable for the designs of new quantum devices, their numerical prediction and discovery have been critically slowed down by the involved calculation of the invariants. To remove the hindrance to a fast and automated search for topological materials, we provide an explicit and exhaustive mapping from symmetry data to topological invariants for any gapped band structure in {{each one of the}} space groups in the presence of time-reversal symmetry.
