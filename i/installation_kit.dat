The current generation of Land Rover used by British Army, the Snatch 2, have upgraded and strengthened chassis and suspension compared to civilian-specification vehicles. There is also the Land Rover WMIK (weapon mounted <b>installation</b> <b>kit)</b> used by British Army. The WMIK consists of a driver, a raised gun, usually a Browning heavy machine gun or a grenade machine gun, this used for ground support, and a GPMG (general-purpose machine gunner) located next to the driver, this used for vehicle protection.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} Cortina Mk3 Savage, {{there was also}} the less {{well-known}} Cheetah version. This used the 2.5 L version of the Essex V6 and was a cheaper option.

5000|$|Jaguar {{first used}} the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type {{as well as}} other models. It was used through 1996 (Jaguar IRS Article). There are some {{differences}} in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the pinion shaft is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" [...] Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model {{through the use of a}} special <b>installation</b> <b>kit</b> which includes special shouldered bolts to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion bearing set to fit the standard pinion shaft to the IRS housing. Gear distributors with knowledge of the Jag IRS should be able to get the <b>installation</b> <b>kit.</b> US Dana 44 gears a slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears higher priced, but once the <b>installation</b> <b>kit</b> price is added to the lower US gear prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500 hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.|$|E

50|$|Shortly before Operation Barbarossa (the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union), the BT-7 underwent an up-armor program. In 1940, Mariupol Ilyich Iron and Steel Works produced 50 sets of hinged homogeneous armor for the BT-7M, which increased {{the weight of the}} test tank to 18 tons.

5000|$|Many older cars {{took the}} feeds for the trailer's lights {{directly}} from the towing vehicles rear light circuits. As bulb-check systems were introduced in the 1990s [...] "by-pass relays" [...] were introduced. These took a small signal from the rear lights to switch a relay which in turn powered the trailer's lights with its own power feed. Many towing electrical <b>installations,</b> including vehicle-specific <b>kits</b> incorporate some form of bypass relays.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in software management of a very large and complex project such as ATLAS is how to deploy the software on sites ranging from computing centers to laptops and including the computing elements of a computing grid organization. A set of tools based on both CMT- the ATLAS basic configuration management tool- and Pacman has been developed. The resulting mechanism now supports the systematic production of distribution kits for every ATLAS release, the automatic <b>installation</b> of <b>kits</b> and the running of test suites to validate the installed kits. This mechanism is meant to be fully compliant with the Grid requirements and has been tested in several grid contexts. Several remaining issues will be discussed. 1...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Winglet Technology, {{with the}} help of Cessna, began flight testing epoxy/graphite {{elliptical}} winglets on a Citation X. Flight testing was nearing completion in late 2008, with FAA supplemental type certification expected in 2009. The winglets increase range by 150 nm, lower fuel burn by 4-5%, improve hot and high performance as well as climb rate, permitting a climb to flight level 430 in 22 minutes, as opposed to 26 minutes without the modification. Climb to flight level 450 at maximum takeoff weight is possible without a step climb. Cruise speed at altitude is expected to increase by 15 knots, and maximum takeoff weight will increase by 1200 lbs (545 kg). Excluding <b>installation,</b> the <b>kit's</b> projected cost is $395,000.|$|R
