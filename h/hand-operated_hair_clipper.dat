50|$|Electric <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> have {{gradually}} displaced manual <b>hair</b> <b>clippers.</b> Today, electric <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> {{are used by}} {{the vast majority of}} barbers in industrialized countries.All of these companies offer electric <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> in differing grades from bargain consumer units to high-end professional units. Most consumer grade clippers are intended for personal use by individual consumers and are often sold in kits which include several accessories such as clipper guides (for adjusting the length of the cut). Professional units are intended for hair care professionals and often are sold without any accessories (which must be ordered separately). The quality difference between the consumer grade and professional grade electric clippers has narrowed significantly over the years. Today the primary difference between the two grades is usually added or enhanced insulating for internal electrical components to prevent the unit from heating up during periods of prolonged usage. Some companies, such as Conair and Andis, replace some plastic parts in consumer grade units with metal parts on their professional grade units to extend the durability and useful lifespan of the product. Some companies, such as Wahl Clipper, produce specialty clippers, such as the Trim n Vac, which are designed for ease of use at home.|$|R

5000|$|Nikola Bizumić, {{inventor}} of the manually operated <b>hair</b> <b>clipper,</b> was born in Neradin. A former barber, he had an idea to create a clipper which would shorten the time for haircutting.|$|R
5000|$|... 1919 — Leo J. Wahl {{patented}} a <b>hair</b> <b>clipper</b> {{with the}} {{drive in the}} hand rather than connected to a separate motor. In 1967 the Wahl Clipper Corp. designed the cordless/rechargeable battery-operated hair trimmer.|$|R
50|$|Electric <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> work in {{the same}} way as manual ones, but are driven by an {{electric}} motor which makes the blades oscillate from side to side. They have gradually displaced manual <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> in many countries. Three different motor types are used in clipper production: magnetic, rotary and pivot. Rotary style may be driven by direct current or alternating current electricity source. Both magnetic and pivot style clippers use magnetic forces derived from winding copper wire around steel. Alternating current creates a cycle attracting and relaxing to a spring to create the speed and torque to drive the clipper cutter across the combing blade.|$|R

50|$|The {{firm was}} begun in 1924 by John Oster, {{manufacturing}} manually powered <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> designed to cut men's hair. John Oster Manufacturing Company {{was established in}} the garage of John Oster in Racine, Wisconsin. In 1928, they introduced a motor-driven clipper.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded on the {{strength}} of Leo J. Wahl's patent for an electromagnetic <b>hair</b> <b>clipper</b> in 1919. In 1965 Wahl introduced the first vacuum clipper, which allowed a person's hair to be cut without use of a cape.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>clippers</b> are {{specialized}} implements used to cut human head hair. They work on {{the same}} principle as scissors, but are distinct from scissors themselves and razors. Similar but heavier-duty implements are used to shear sheep, but are called handpieces or machine shears.|$|R
50|$|Manual <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} by barbers in India to give short back and sides haircuts. Orthodox Jews tend to avoid clipping {{the side of}} their heads. Among Muslim men, it is haram to clip more than a fistful of the beard.|$|R
50|$|Fenwick {{was founded}} as an export company in 1862. Most of its trade {{was with the}} United States. A meeting in 1878 led to the import of American made <b>hair</b> <b>clippers.</b> These sold well and other imports such as bicycles, typewritters and lifting {{equipment}} followed.|$|R

50|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>clippers</b> are {{operated}} {{by a pair of}} handles which are alternately squeezed together and released. Barbers used them to cut hair close and fast. The hair was picked up in locks and the head was rapidly depilated. Such haircuts became popular among boys, mostly in schools, and young men in the military and in prisons.|$|R
50|$|Buzz cuts rose to {{popularity}} {{with the advent}} of manual <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> by the Serbian inventor, Nikola Bizumic, in the late 19th century. These clippers were widely used by barbers to chop hair close and fast. The <b>clipper</b> accumulates <b>hair</b> in locks to rapidly depilate your head. This type of haircut was normal where strict grooming conventions will be in effect.|$|R
50|$|Haircuts {{also occur}} in {{space at the}} International Space Station. During the various Expeditions astronauts use <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> {{attached}} to vacuum devices for grooming their colleagues so that the cut hair will not drift inside the weightless environment of the space station and become a nuisance to the astronauts or a hazard to the sensitive equipment installations inside the station.|$|R
50|$|Leo J. Wahl {{invented the}} first {{electric}} <b>hair</b> <b>clipper.</b> He first designed a hand-held massager for his uncle, Dr. Frank Wahl. Frank Wahl opened a manufacturing plant in Sterling, Illinois {{to produce and}} sell Leo’s massager. During this time, Leo would sell massagers to various barbers and noticed an opportunity to improve upon the tools barbers were using at the time.|$|R
50|$|Philishave was {{the brand}} name for the {{electric}} shavers manufactured by the Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care unit of Philips (in the U.S., the Norelco name is used instead). In recent years, Philips had extended the Philishave brand to include <b>hair</b> <b>clippers,</b> beard trimmers and beard shapers. Philips used the Philishave brand name for their shavers from 1939 to 2006.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967 Wahl {{produced}} the first cordless <b>hair</b> <b>clipper</b> using its own rechargeable battery technology. Four years later it started an electronics division with the world's first cordless and rechargeable soldering iron. In 1975 the company released {{a line of}} back and foot massagers utilizing the vibrating motor technology used in their hair trimmers. In 1984 Wahl invented the first cordless consumer beard and mustache trimmer.|$|R

50|$|There are {{a couple}} of pieces of {{equipment}} necessary for freeze branding. The first is a branding iron, which is made of a copper alloy because of its temperature holding capacity. The second is a set of sharp <b>hair</b> <b>clippers,</b> used to clip hair and expose bare skin. A liquid coolant, either dry ice or liquid nitrogen, will be used as well as a special container that can hold it and the irons.|$|R
50|$|Manual {{clippers}} {{were invented}} between 1850 and 1890 by Nikola Bizumic, a Serbian barber. While they were {{widely used in}} the distant past, the advent and reduction in cost of electric <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> has led to their largely replacing manual clippers. Some barbers in Western countries continue to use them for trimming. They are also used in the Russian army: when conscripts enter boot camp, they cut their hair close to the skin, sometimes using manual clippers.|$|R
2500|$|In a July 2010 {{interview}} with Forbes, Miller stated {{that because the}} fashion industry had changed, with celebrities supplanting models on magazine covers and in campaigns, supermodels have to become brands to be successful. For that reason, she shifted focus to consumer products reflective of her personality. In July 2008, Miller took her first step beyond modeling when her shoe line with skateboarder/surfer-oriented company Vans launched. Miller starred in a 2008 viral video on YouTube with All Star baseball player Ryan Braun for Remington's ShortCut <b>hair</b> <b>clippers</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Davis created {{over three}} hundred pieces {{of art in}} his {{lifetime}} including carved wooden figured, furniture pieces, and reliefs. He used unique sculpting and building materials such as shipyard lumber, pieces donated by his friends, or wood he bought at lumberyards. Davis almost never made preliminary drawings or models but reduced the mass with a hatchet or a bandsaw before refining the form with a chisel and knives. To add textural detail, he sometimes used tools of this barbering trade, such as the blade of his <b>hair</b> <b>clippers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sickle mowers, {{also called}} {{reciprocating}} mowers, bar mowers, sickle-bar mowers, or finger-bar mowers, {{have a long}} (typically six to {{seven and a half}} feet) bar on which are mounted fingers with stationary guardplates. In a channel on the bar there is a reciprocating sickle with very sharp sickle sections (triangular blades). The sickle bar is driven back and forth along the channel. The grass, or other plant matter, is cut between the sharp edges of the sickle sections and the finger-plates (this action can be likened to an electric <b>hair</b> <b>clipper).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ikari-Bomber (11): A prideful {{and arrogant}} hand grenade-based robot with a short-fused temper who detonates {{whenever}} someone makes him mad, causing {{an explosion of}} tremendous power before reforming himself. Sent to Aoyama City, Ikari-Bomber holds the city hostage and force them into slavery in the renamed Jamahl City. After learning {{the best way to}} defeat Ikari-Bomber is to take out the detonation/reconstruction chip in his head module, the B-Fighters set up a scheme to take out the chip with the experimental EIG ray gun while Daisaku distracts Ikari Bomber. Once the plan succeeds, the B-Fighters use the Red Gyro to carry Ikari-Bomber away from the city so he can be safely blown up by the Beetluder and Stagger Tank's guns. He is eventually rebuilt as Ikari-Bomber 2 (27), with a new orange-colored body and slightly different head. However, during a battle at a junkyard, Ikari-Bomber accidentally incorporated a <b>hair</b> <b>clipper</b> into his body, grafting onto his left hand. Overcome by the <b>hair</b> <b>clipper's</b> desire to cut hair and to grudge on hose who had discarded it when it was still usable, Ikari-Bomber goes on a head-shaving spree until the B-Fighters destroyed his component pieces one by one. He was rebuilt on Episode 30 as Ikari-Bomber 2, but was destroyed (off-screen). He was revived yet again as Ikari-Bomber 2 and absorbed by Jagul in the series finale.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>clippers</b> {{comprise}} {{a pair of}} sharpened comb-like blades in close contact one above the other and the side which slide sideways relative to each other, a mechanism which may be manual or electrical to make the blades oscillate from side to side, and a handle. The clipper is moved so that hair is positioned between {{the teeth of the}} comb, and cut with a scissor action when one blade slides sideways relative to the other. Friction between the blades needs to be as low as possible, which is attained by choice of material and finish, and frequent lubrication.|$|R
