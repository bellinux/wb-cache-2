40|$|North Sea {{fisheries}} {{are managed}} by the European Union (EU) through a system <b>of</b> annual <b>quota.</b> Due to uncertainty about future fish stocks, yearly revisions of these policies lead to fluctuation in quota, which in turn affects harvest and investment decisions <b>of</b> fishermen. <b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> requires high management costs in terms of obtaining information and negotiations between experts and policy makers. To reduce both quota fluctuation and management costs, the EU has proposed a system <b>of</b> multiannual <b>quota.</b> In this paper we study the effect <b>of</b> multiannual <b>quota</b> on quota volatility and resource rents, while accounting for management costs. We develop a bi-level stochastic dynamic programming model, where at level one, the EU determines the quota that maximizes resource rents. At level two, fishermen decide myopically on their harvest and investment levels, subject to the quota. Results show that policy makers can reduce quota volatility and improve resource rents from the fishery with multiannual quota. Important trade-offs {{are involved in the}} accomplishment of these objectives: fish stock and investments become more volatile, which leads to more overcapacity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Vendor {{selection}} and supply <b>quotas</b> <b>determination</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most important}} issues in the purchasing process in manufacturing. In many situations to solve this problem it is necessary to use the operations research methods. Objectives: This paper proposes a new methodology for vendor {{selection and}} <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> supplied <b>quotas.</b> The work investigates the problem of flour purchase by a company that manufactures bakery products. Methods/Approach: The problem is solved by using the model that combines a revised weighting method, and a multiple objective programming method based on game theory. The revised weighting method is used to determine the objective function coefficients, and a multiple objective programming method is used to select vendors and to determine supply quotas from the selected vendors. For selection <b>of</b> vendors and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> quantities supplied by individual vendors three complex criteria are used: (1) purchasing costs, (2) product quality, and (3) vendor reliability. Results: The proposed methodology has numerous strengths, such as an efficient reduction of complex criteria functions to simple ones and efficient using of a new multiple objective programming methods based on cooperative game theory. Conclusions: The main advantage of the proposed approach is its efficiency and simplicity...|$|R
40|$|Stabilization of {{greenhouse}} gases at sustainable levels is {{the objective of the}} FCCC. Strategies to achieve this aim have been the object of intense debate. This paper focuses on one emissions trading system under scrutiny, Joint Implementation (JI). The basic premise of JI is that one nation party can satisfy its obligations to control emissions by financing emission mitigation in another nation party. Such an approach can optimize access to least cost mitigation options, and predicts collective participation even in the absence <b>of</b> centralized <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> universal <b>quotas.</b> A key issue for JI is the concept of additionality. "Business as usual" trajectories provide a baseline against which additionality is measured. Accurate estimation of baselines needs to take into proper account institutional and organizational transaction costs. Hence, the implementation of a climate change system incorporating JI as a core element requires a greater understanding of the incentives and barriers that underlie the patterns of infrastructure development in rapidly growing economies. Readers should note that all of this paper's analyses and conclusions related to JI apply equally to the new clean development mechanism established by article 12 of the Kyoto protocol...|$|R
40|$|The {{rationale}} for writing this thesis {{was prompted by}} years of working with displaced people and refugees in Africa. Though the African people north of the equator are generally regarded as transient people, very few move {{beyond the boundaries of}} the continent of Africa. The instability of the political and socio-economic conditions on the continent has exacerbated the current volatile cycle of poverty and human instability. The effects of the political and socio-economic conditions have resulted in a huge displacement of people and the emergence of refugees. Few refugees are able to be identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for resettlement outside Africa, while others take the courageous step of fleeing and seeking refuge on another continent as asylum seekers. In 1960 New Zealand ascribed to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of refugees and actively participated in a refugee quota programme and allowed asylum seekers to apply for refugee status. In an endeavour to answer the question "why long-term welfare beneficiaries" in relation to African people, this thesis analysed the integration process of African people and sought to establish what domestic or public policies impact or influence the settlement and integration of refugees and asylum seekers in New Zealand. While there are many factors that influence successful integration, however this study identifies barriers to sustainable employment as one of the major contributors. The literature review and the outcome of the research undertaken showed that barriers to employment do exist for refugees and asylum seekers. The literature review analyses the legal aspect that defines a refugee and also outlines the process followed for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> refugees. The review further describes the journey of the study population to New Zealand. New Zealand has an established welfare system therefore the study traces the discourse within welfare history and policy that relate to the criteria and obligations under which benefits are granted to refugees and asylum seekers. It is argued that present jobseeker agreements and work test provisions when agreed upon does assist the development and work readiness of the refugee and asylum seeker and does not contribute to long-term welfare beneficiaries. It is concluded that the absence of an overarching national domestic or public policy on settlement and integration could contribute to long-term welfare beneficiaries (as defined in the welfare policy of the Ministry for Social Development). In conclusion, policy changes to certain aspects of the Social Security Act 1964, language training, organs of civil society intervention and employer interaction need to be addressed in relation to refugees from the Horn of Africa living in New Zealand to allow them to become employable in a shorter period of time...|$|R
30|$|Theoretical {{literature}} {{concentrates on}} endogenous <b>quotas</b> <b>of</b> migrants through a voting system which allows governments to implement immigration policies. Epstein and Nitzan (2005) analyze the endogenous <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> a migration <b>quota,</b> viewing {{it as an}} outcome of a two-stage political struggle between two interest groups: those in favor and those against the proposed migration <b>quota.</b> Theoretical effects <b>of</b> the government policy depend on whether there is lobbying between those natives who agree and those who disagree with the proposal <b>of</b> a <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> migrants. Mayrs (2010) derives a general equilibrium model with overlapping generations where natives require a compensating wage differential for working in one sector rather than in another. Price and wage effects of immigration are analyzed on natives: the young, working {{in one of two}} sectors, and the old. The outcome of a majority voting on immigration is determined by a given sector as well as the social optimum. The main findings are: i) the old determine any majority voting outcome of non-zero immigration into both sectors; ii) socially optimal immigration is smaller than or equal to the majority voting outcome; and iii) immigration is not necessarily a substitute for native mobility across sectors. Candau (2011) analyzes how trade liberalization and immigration can potentially affect the welfare of native skilled and unskilled workers and how this expected impact plays on immigration policy. The novelty resides in the attempt to set up endogenous immigration restrictions by integrating swing voters in a model of geographical economics with two kinds of immobile workers (skilled and unskilled). It is shown that trade liberalization can lead the winner candidate to increase the quota on immigration.|$|R

An optimisation model is developed to estimate the economic value <b>of</b> <b>quota.</b> Quota values are aggregated to derive supply and demand curves under two scenarios; first where quotas can trade nationally and second where the trade <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> is regionally restricted. Quota trade is simulated and the consequent effects on supplier structure are estimated. Through the derivation of sectoral cumulative cost curves {{it is possible to}} estimate the impact <b>of</b> regionalising <b>quota</b> trade on sector efficiency. The model is solved using National Farm Survey data from Ireland and the inefficiencies <b>of</b> regionalised <b>quota</b> trade in Ireland is estimated at€ 20 million. The model is also used to quantify the effect of policy uncertainty on quota trade. The implications of an early abolition or expansion of the EU milk quota on quota trade is quantified.

40|$|In this {{qualitative}} research project, researchers in three Canadian provinces explored {{the perceptions of}} many different actors involved in return-to-work (RTW) programs for injured workers, studying their views on successful RTW strategies and barriers to/facilitators of the RTW process, then analyzing the underlying dynamics driving their different experiences. Each research team recruited actors {{in a variety of}} different workplaces and key informants in the RTW system, and used a combination of in-depth, semi-structured interviews and focus groups to collect data, which were coded using an open coding system. Analysis took a social constructionist perspective. The roles and mandates of the different groups of actors (injured workers; other workplace actors; actors outside the workplace), while sometimes complementary, could also differ, leading to tension and conflict. Characteristics of injured workers described as influencing RTW success included personal and sociodemographic factors, beliefs and attitudes, and motivation. Human resources managers and health care professionals tended to attribute workers' motivation to their individual characteristics, whereas injured workers, worker representatives and health and safety managers described workplace culture {{and the degree to which}} workers' well-being was considered as having a strong influence on workers' motivation. Some supervisors experienced role conflict when responsible for both production quotas and RTW programs, but difficulties were alleviated by innovations such as consideration of RTW program responsibilities in the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> production <b>quotas</b> and in performance evaluations. RTW program success seemed related to labor-management relations and top management commitment to Health and Safety. Non-workplace issues included confusion stemming from the compensation system itself, communication difficulties with some treating physicians, and role conflict on the part of physicians wishing to advocate for patients whose problems were non-compensable. Several common themes emerged from the experiences related by the wide range of actors including the importance of trust, respect, communication and labor relations in the failure or success of RTW programs for injured workers.
