50|$|Under high densities {{the matter}} becomes a <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> when the {{electrons}} are all stripped from their parent atoms. In {{the core of}} a star, once hydrogen burning in nuclear fusion reactions stops, it becomes a collection of positively charged ions, largely helium and carbon nuclei, floating in a sea of electrons, which have been stripped from the nuclei. <b>Degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> is an almost perfect conductor of heat and does not obey the ordinary gas laws. White dwarfs are luminous not because they are generating any energy but rather because they have trapped a large amount of heat which is gradually radiated away. Normal gas exerts higher pressure when it is heated and expands, but the pressure in a <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> does not depend on the temperature. When gas becomes super-compressed, particles position right up against each other to produce <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> that behaves more like a solid. In degenerate gases the kinetic energies of electrons are quite high and the rate of collision between electrons and other particles is quite low, therefore degenerate electrons can travel great distances at velocities that approach the speed of light. Instead of temperature, the pressure in a <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> depends only on the speed of the degenerate particles; however, adding heat does not increase the speed. Pressure is only increased by the mass of the particles, which increases the gravitational force pulling the particles closer together. Therefore, the phenomenon is the opposite of that normally found in matter where if the mass of the matter is increased, the object becomes bigger. In <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas,</b> when the mass is increased, the pressure is increased, and the particles become spaced closer together, so the object becomes smaller. <b>Degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> can be compressed to very high densities, typical values being in the range of 10,000 kilograms per cubic centimeter.|$|E
50|$|Degenerate {{matter is}} also called a Fermi gas or a <b>{{degenerate}}</b> <b>gas.</b> A degenerate mass whose fermions have velocities {{close to the}} speed of light (particle energy larger than its rest mass energy) is called relativistic degenerate matter.|$|E
50|$|At densities {{greater than}} those {{supported}} by neutron degeneracy, quark matter is expected to occur. Several variations of this have been proposed that represent quark-degenerate states. Strange matter is a <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> of quarks that is often assumed to contain strange quarks {{in addition to the}} usual up and down quarks. Color superconductor materials are degenerate gases of quarks in which quarks pair up {{in a manner similar to}} Cooper pairing in electrical superconductors. The equations of state for the various proposed forms of quark-degenerate matter vary widely, and are usually also poorly defined, due to the difficulty of modeling strong force interactions.|$|E
40|$|<b>Degenerate</b> quantum <b>gases</b> of alkaline-earth-like {{elements}} {{open new}} opportunities in research areas ranging from molecular physics {{to the study}} of strongly correlated systems. These experiments exploit the rich electronic structure of these elements, which is markedly different from the one of other species for which quantum degeneracy has been attained. Specifically, alkaline-earth-like atoms, such as strontium, feature metastable triplet states, narrow intercombination lines, and a non-magnetic, closed-shell ground state. This review covers the creation of quantum <b>degenerate</b> <b>gases</b> of strontium and the first experiments performed with this new system. It focuses on laser-cooling and evaporation schemes, which enable the creation of Bose-Einstein condensates and <b>degenerate</b> Fermi <b>gases</b> of all strontium isotopes, and shows how they are used for the investigation of optical Feshbach resonances, the study of <b>degenerate</b> <b>gases</b> loaded into an optical lattice, as well as the coherent creation of Sr_ 2 molecules.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive an {{analytic}} approximation to {{the density of}} states for atoms in a combined optical lattice and harmonic trap potential as used in current experiments with quantum <b>degenerate</b> <b>gases.</b> We compare this analytic density of states to numerical solutions and demonstrate its validity regime. Our work explicitly considers the role of higher bands {{and when they are}} important in quantitative analysis of this system. Applying our density of states to a <b>degenerate</b> Fermi <b>gas</b> we consider how adiabatic loading from a harmonic trap into the combined harmonic-lattice potential affects the degeneracy temperature. Our results suggest that occupation of excited bands during loading should lead to more favourable conditions for realizing <b>degenerate</b> Fermi <b>gases</b> in optical lattices.

50|$|In 1997, Jin {{formed a}} group at JILA, the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics in Boulder, Colorado. Within two years, she {{developed}} {{the ability to}} create the first quantum <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> of fermionic atoms. The work was motivated by earlier studies of Bose-Einstein condensates and the ability to cool a dilute gas of atoms to 1 μK. The weak interactions between particles in a Bose-Einstein Condensate led to interesting physics. It was theorized that fermionic atoms would form an analogous state at low enough temperatures, with fermions pairing up in a phenomenon similar to the creation of Cooper pairs in superconducting materials.|$|E
50|$|Degenerate gases are gases {{composed}} of fermions such as electrons, protons, and neutrons rather than molecules of ordinary matter. The electron gas in ordinary metals {{and in the}} interior of white dwarf stars are two examples. Following the Pauli exclusion principle, there can be only one fermion occupying each quantum state. In a <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas,</b> all quantum states are filled up to the Fermi energy. Most stars are supported against their own gravitation by normal thermal gas pressure, while in white dwarf stars the supporting force comes from the degeneracy pressure of the electron gas in their interior. In neutron stars, the degenerate particles are neutrons.|$|E
50|$|Unlike a {{classical}} ideal gas, whose pressure {{is proportional to}} its temperature (P = nkT/V, where P is pressure, V is the volume, n {{is the number of}} particles—typically atoms or molecules—k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature), the pressure exerted by degenerate matter depends only weakly on its temperature. In particular, the pressure remains nonzero even at absolute zero temperature. At relatively low densities, the pressure of a fully <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> is given by P = K(n/V), where K depends on the properties of the particles making up the gas. At very high densities, where most of the particles are forced into quantum states with relativistic energies, the pressure is given by P = K′(n/V), where K′ again depends on the properties of the particles making up the gas.|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{efficiency}} of four-wave mixing in quantum <b>degenerate</b> <b>gases</b> of bosonic and fermionic atoms. It is shown that matter-wave gratings formed from either bosonic or fermionic atoms can in principle exhibit nearly identical Bragg-scattering, i. e. four-wave mixing, properties. This implies that effects such as coherent matter-wave amplification and superradiance can occur in <b>degenerate</b> fermi <b>gases.</b> While in the boson case the Bragg resonance is clearly due to `Bose enhancement', {{in the case of}} fermions the resonance is due to constructive many-particle quantum interference...|$|R

5000|$|The {{equation}} of state for a neutron star is still not known. It is assumed that it differs significantly {{from that of a}} white dwarf, whose {{equation of}} state is that of a <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> that can be described in close agreement with special relativity. However, with a neutron star the increased effects of general relativity can no longer be ignored. Several equations of state have been proposed (FPS, UU, APR, L, SLy, and others) and current research is still attempting to constrain the theories to make predictions of neutron star matter. This means that the relation between density and mass is not fully known, and this causes uncertainties in radius estimates. For example, a [...] neutron star could have a radius of 10.7, 11.1, 12.1 or 15.1 kilometers (for EOS FPS, UU, APR or L respectively).|$|E
50|$|Electron-degenerate {{matter is}} found inside white dwarf stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but {{are able to}} {{transfer}} to adjacent atoms. Neutron-degenerate matter is found in neutron stars. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay, resulting in a superdense conglomeration of neutrons. Normally free neutrons outside an atomic nucleus will decay with a half life of just under 15 minutes, but in a neutron star, the decay is overtaken by inverse decay. Cold degenerate matter is also present in planets such as Jupiter and in the even more massive brown dwarfs, which {{are expected to have}} a core with metallic hydrogen. Because of the degeneracy, more massive brown dwarfs are not significantly larger. In metals, the electrons can be modeled as a <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> moving in a lattice of non-degenerate positive ions.|$|E
40|$|An {{asymmetric}} multi-quantum state magnetic lattice {{is proposed}} to host excitons formed in a quantum <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> of ultracold fermionic atoms to simulate Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons. A Quasi-two dimensional <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> of excitons can be {{collected in the}} in-plane asymmetric magnetic bands created at {{the surface of the}} proposed magnetic lattice, where the ultracold fermions simulate separately direct and indirect confined electronhole pairs (spin up fermions-spin down fermions) rising to the statistically degenerate Bose gas and eventually through controlled tunnelling to BEC of excitons. The confinement of the coupled magnetic quantum well (CMQWs) system may significantly improve the condition for long lived exciton BEC. The exciton BEC, formed in CMQWs can be regarded as a suitable host for the multi-qubits (multipartite) systems to be used in quantum information processors.

40|$|We {{report on}} a general method for the rapid {{production}} of quantum <b>degenerate</b> <b>gases.</b> Using 174 Yb, we achieve an experimental cycle time as low as (1. 6 - 1. 8) s {{for the production of}} Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of (0. 5 - 1) x 10 ^ 5 atoms. While laser cooling to 30 proceeds in a standard way, evaporative cooling is highly optimized by performing it in an optical trap that is dynamically shaped by utilizing the time-averaged potential of a single laser beam moving rapidly in one dimension. We also produce large (> 10 ^ 6) atom number BECs and successfully model the evaporation dynamics over more than three orders of magnitude in phase space density.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{creating}} a quantum <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> of metastable alkaline-earth atoms.

Quantum degenerate samples prepared in the ^ 1 S_ 0 ground state can be rapidly transferred to either the ^ 3 P_ 2 or ^ 3 P_ 0 state via a coherent 3 -photon process. Numerical integration of the density matrix evolution for the fine structure of bosonic alkaline-earth atoms shows that transfer efficiencies of ≃ 90 % can be achieved with experimentally feasible laser parameters in both Sr and Yb. Importantly, the 3 -photon process can be set up such that it imparts no net momentum to the <b>degenerate</b> <b>gas</b> during the excitation, which will allow for studies of metastable samples outside the Lamb-Dicke regime.
