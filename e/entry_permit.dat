25|$|Until 2002, tourism was {{virtually}} non-existent {{because of the}} inaccessibility of the island to transport, the absence of guest accommodation {{and the need for}} a sponsor.

All visitors are required to obtain an <b>entry</b> <b>permit</b> before travelling. Sport fishing is the main attraction for many of the visitors. The island also boasts what is sometimes called the worst golf course in the world.|$|E

In January 2001, direct cargo and passenger shipping started between Matsu and Fujian Province of the PRC. Since 1 January 2015, tourists from mainland China could directly apply the Exit and <b>Entry</b> <b>Permit</b> upon arrival in Matsu Islands. This privilege also applies to Penghu and Kinmen as means to boost tourism in the outlying islands of Taiwan.|$|E
500|$|In his judgment, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray {{considered}} Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1968), {{decided by}} the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. He found that the procedural principles that govern the administration of Singapore's immigration laws {{were similar to those}} in the UK. In Schmidt it was decided that an alien has no right to enter the country except by leave and the Home Secretary can refuse leave without giving any reason; that if an alien is given leave to enter the country for a limited period he has no right to stay, and no legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay, for a day longer than the permitted period; and that an alien's application for an extension of his stay can be refused without reasons and without a hearing as the rules of natural justice do not apply. Furthermore, in Schmidt Lord Denning had espoused the obiter view that where an alien's permit to stay [...] "is revoked before the time limit expires, he ought... to be given the opportunity of making representations: for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for a permitted time". This argument was advanced by Siah's counsel to persuade the court that [...] "an alien who is in possession of an <b>entry</b> <b>permit</b> which has not yet expired is in the country lawfully until the date of expiry and, therefore, he has an interest during the unexpired portion that carries with it a public law right to a fair procedure, if and when the minister desires to terminate that leave to stay prematurely". The High Court judge considered this proposition and conceded that it was an [...] "attractive" [...] one. However, he ultimately dismissed the argument by saying that it had [...] "not been supported by any English authority", and that the position in Singapore is [...] "quite different". He stated that Parliament had already provided in the Immigration Act for appeals and the right to be heard has been given statutory recognition and protection in the Act, and the applicant had already availed herself of the right to appeal. The Minister was not required to give reasons for his rejection of the appeal under the common law or the Immigration Act.|$|E
