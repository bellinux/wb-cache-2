Unlike prior studies, we partition earnings reporting delay into two separate components: audit report lag and management discretionary lag. Using recent data, we find that less earnings management by late earnings reporters are attributable to auditors rather than management. After controlling for other factors, we show that auditors who lengthen their audit work are likely to permit less earnings management, possibly to minimize their litigation risk. This drives a negative association between total report lag and earnings management. However, no statistically significant association is found between management <b>discretionary</b> lag and <b>earnings</b> management. We find a positive association between management <b>discretionary</b> lag and <b>earnings</b> management only in the sub-sample where earnings were disclosed after the audit report date. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether firms expand accounting disclosures {{in response to}} perceived market undervaluation. Using a signalling theory framework, this paper predicts that managers will use disclosures to align the market's expectations about future earnings performance with their own. We predict that the market undervalues firms with positive (negative) abnormal earnings when {{the persistence of the}} abnormal earnings is higher (lower) than market expectations. Therefore, these firms will signal to the market by expanding their accounting disclosures. Furthermore, firms with positive and negative abnormal growth are expected to seek different types of disclosures to correct the perceived undervaluation. Our findings demonstrate that a relationship exists between the persistence of the earnings components and firms' changes in discretionary disclosures, suggesting that characteristics of corporate earnings are associated with changes in disclosure decisions. Therefore, any analysis of the benefits to expanded disclosures should also consider the characteristics of the reported <b>earnings.</b> <b>discretionary</b> disclosures; <b>earnings</b> characteristics; abnormal earnings; international accounting disclosures; signalling theory framework; market expectations; future earnings performance; abnormal growth; undervaluation; corporate earnings; disclosure decisions; expanded disclosures; reported earnings; finance. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} analysis {{presented in}} this paper provides further insight into the important issue of the association between corporate governance structures and the quality of reported company earnings. The analysis uses the measure of accrual quality developed by Dechow and Dichev (2002) which provides a direct measure of the quality of current accruals. We derive measures of the innate and discretionary components of accrual quality following Francis et al. (2005), and subsequently include these measures in regressions against corporate governance characteristics. The results show that sound governance structures have a positive association between the innate and discretionary components of accrual quality. Interestingly, we find the relation between sound governance structures and accrual quality is stronger for innate than discretionary accruals. This suggests that sound governance is more important in reducing environmental uncertainty and associated unintentional accrual estimation errors than in constraining <b>discretionary</b> <b>earnings</b> management...|$|E
40|$|This paper classifies {{institutional}} investors into transient or long-term by their investment horizons {{to examine the}} association between institutional investor type and firms' <b>discretionary</b> <b>earnings</b> management strategies in two mutually exclusive settings - firms that (do not) use accruals to meet/beat earnings targets. The results {{support the view that}} long-term {{institutional investors}} constrain accruals management among firms that manage earnings to meet/beat earnings benchmarks. This suggests long-term institutional investors can mitigate aggressive earnings management among these firms. Transient institutional ownership is not systematically associated with aggressive earnings management and is evident only among firms that manage earnings to meet/beat their earnings benchmarks. This indicates transient institution-associated managerial myopia may not be as prevalent as posited by critics.

Given that its objective is {{to improve the quality of}} financial reporting, we hypothesize that a change in the relation between bonus and <b>discretionary</b> <b>earnings</b> would indicate an altered compensation structure that changes the incentives for earnings management behavior. As the CEO and financial officers have primary responsibility for integrity of the financial statements, we examine a sample of these executives from 1996 through 2003. Our results suggest that, before Sarbanes-Oxley, these executives had financial incentives to manage earnings upward and small penalties for managing downward. After, while there is still a premium on income-increasing management, there is a greater reward for nondiscretionary earnings and a larger penalty is imposed on income-decreasing earnings management. In addition, we find that changes in the bonus compensation structure are associated with changes in earnings management behavior, consistent with the lack of reward fo...|$|E

40|$|Fair value {{accounting}} {{in banking}} {{has been criticized}} for the increased volatility that it generates in some accounting variables. One of its advantages, however, is that it reduces the possibility of <b>discretionary</b> <b>earnings</b> management, given that all gains and losses are immediately recognized. In this paper we qualify both considerations. The accounting regime of available-for-sale (AFS) securities allows for some degree of earnings and capital management: an AFS asset is reported at fair value but gains and losses over historical cost go into net income and measures of regulatory capital only when the asset is sold and the gain or loss realized. We use comprehensive data from US commercial banks and bank holding companies and provide evidence that fair value gains in AFS assets have consistently been used for earnings and capital management and that the holdings of AFS assets are related to the intensity of this activity. Our results show that the earnings management behavior is present both in listed and non-listed banks, suggesting that the motivations go beyond the incentives provided by capital markets. We also uncover significant differences in earnings management behavior over the years of the financial crisis...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relation between}} institutional investor type (specifically, transient and long-term oriented institutional investors) and the <b>discretionary</b> <b>earnings</b> management strategies of their portfolio firms. By focusing on accruals management, it extends current understanding {{of the relation between}} institutional investor type and earnings management beyond (a) earnings management through real investment decisions and (b) only firms with research and development activities (Bushee, 1998). The association between transient (long-term oriented) institutional investors and portfolio firms' accruals management is first examined without reference to portfolio firms' specific earnings targets. Then, the association is investigated conditional upon portfolio firms' non-discretionary earnings relative to earnings targets. Transient institutional investors' investments in portfolio firms are transitory and fluctuate over {{a short period of time}} (Bushee, 1998; Porter, 1992). These investors create incentives for portfolio firm managers to adopt aggressive earnings management strategies to avoid earnings disappointment, or to take a bath when earnings disappointment is unavoidable. In contrast, long-term oriented institutional investors invest for the long-term prospects of their portfolio firms rather than focus on the current earnings performance of portfolio firms (Bushee, 1998; Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). They actively participate in monitoring their portfolio firms and their presence is argued to constrain and limit portfolio firm managers' earnings management discretion (Rajgopal and Venkatachalam, 1998; Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Using a sample of US institutional investors and US portfolio firms, the results support the arguments that transient institutional ownership is associated with both larger income increasing and larger income decreasing discretionary accruals. This is consistent with transient institutional ownership encouragement of managerial myopia (Bushee, 1998). However, evidence supporting the managerial myopic effects of transient institutional investors is stronger when total institutional ownership is predominantly transient. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that transient institutional investors encourage "big bath" strategies, and only very limited evidence of an association between transient institutional ownership and portfolio firms' income smoothing strategies. Consistent with long-term oriented institutional investors constraining portfolio firm managers' accruals discretion, long-term oriented institutional ownership is found to be associated with smaller income increasing and smaller income decreasing discretionary accruals. The constraining effects of long-term oriented institutional investors remain evident among portfolio firms that have exercised their accrual discretion to meet their earnings targets. For firms that fail to meet their earnings targets, long-term oriented institutional ownership is negatively associated with discretionary accruals. That is, inconsistent with their long-term orientation, longterm oriented institutional investors appear to encourage "reverse" myopic accrual management behaviour among portfolio firms. There is no evidence supporting arguments that long-term oriented institutional investors create incentives for portfolio firms to adopt income smoothing strategies. These results highlight the importance of examining different types of institutional ownership separately when investigating the effects of institutional ownership on firms' earnings management. The study also provides evidence indicating alternative effects of institutional ownership types on firms' discretionary accruals, conditional upon the position of firms' non-discretionary earnings relative to their earnings targets. The overall results provide evidence indicating the complexities of institutional ownership type effects on portfolio firms' accrual management strategies. The insights provided in this thesis are valuable to academic researchers, analysts, investors and regulators who seek an understanding of the influences and implications of institutional investor type on corporate financial reporting...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} accrual accounting in the asymmetrically timely recognition (incorporation in reported earnings) of gains and losses. Timely recognition requires accruals when it precedes complete realization of the gains and losses in cash. We show that nonlinear accruals models incorporating the asymmetry in gain and loss recognition (timelier loss recognition, or conditional conservatism) offer a substantial specification improvement, explaining substantially more variation in accruals than equivalent linear specifications. Conversely, conventional linear accruals models, by omitting the loss recognition asymmetry, exhibit substantial attenuation bias and offer a comparatively poor specification of the accounting accrual process. Linear specifications also understate the ability of current earnings to predict future cash flows. These findings have implications for our understanding of accrual accounting and conservatism, {{as well as for}} researchers estimating <b>discretionary</b> accruals, <b>earnings</b> management, and earnings quality.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the hypothesis that}} the timing of lockup expiration is crucial to earnings management (EM) behavior in the period after an initial public offering (IPO). Taiwan's unique two-stage lockup regulations make the Taiwanese sample an excellent candidate for examining this hypothesis. Three main results are reached. First, we find positive discretionary accruals (DAs) from the IPO quarter to the quarter after the expiration of the first-stage lockup. The DA in the quarter of the second-stage lockup expiration is significantly positive. The evidence shows that the lockup provision is key in the findings of significant EM in the IPO year and the following year. We also find a positive association between DAs in first-stage lockups and subsequent insider selling activity, indicating that insiders' selling after lockup expiration accounts for EM in the lockup period. Third, the extent of EM in first-stage lockup is negatively related to that around the IPO, consistent with the reversal nature of DAs. <b>discretionary</b> accruals, <b>earnings</b> management, insider trading, lockup,...|$|R

The result is robust to using five proxies for the quality of firm financial reporting: the variation in discretionary accruals, the absolute level of <b>discretionary</b> accruals, <b>earnings</b> persistence, absolute total accruals, and earnings volatility. Further, we document that better earnings forecasters {{are more likely to}} issue revenue estimates.

Using a sample of 9, 442 US banks in the period 1999 - 2008, this paper shows that bank managers tend to use provisions as a smoothing devise when earnings are substantial ('cookie-jar' strategies), engage in earnings-decreasing strategies when losses are relatively large ('big-bath' accounting) and, most of the time, use provisions as an earnings-increasing tool.
