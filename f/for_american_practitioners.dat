In Craig Burgdoff's ethnographic research of Ohio practitioners, he found that 85–90% were Chinese graduate students or their family members. Similar results <b>for</b> North <b>American</b> <b>practitioners</b> were borne out by Scott Lowe, a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. In a 2003 Internet survey, Lowe found that the Chinese respondents living in Western nations were [...] "uniformly well educated, clearly representing the expatriate elite", with all respondents holding a master's degree or higher.

5000|$|In 1892, Lynk {{published}} {{the first national}} medical journal published <b>for</b> African <b>American</b> <b>practitioners.</b> The Medical and Surgical Observer was stamped and labeled by the Library of the Surgeon General's Office in Washington, D.C., as the [...] "Only Negro M.J. in America." [...] The journal connected the isolated African <b>American</b> medical <b>practitioners</b> across the United States. Although the MSO was published for only about a year, it served as a forum for black medical professionals, who were typically not welcomed in white society and medical conversations at the time. Its content informed African American physicians of news and practical ideas throughout the world of medicine {{that they had not}} been informed of in the past. Since the journal existed during a time of racial segregation, its readers found this was another way to find information in order to compete with white medical practitioners.|$|R

40|$|Background: In 2004 a {{consensus}} was reached through {{a vote of}} membership of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing to move Nurse Practitioner education from the masters to the doctoral level by 2015. Aim: To determine progress to meet the goal of moving towards doctoral level education <b>for</b> <b>American</b> Nurse <b>Practitioners</b> and identify the associated discourse. Method: A scoping review was undertaken to dertermine the progress towards {{the goal of the}} of moving from the Master of Science Nursing to the Doctor of Nursing Practice degree as the pointfrom which Nurse Practitioner certification and licensure can be applied for in the USA, the reported outcomes resulting from the introduction of the Doctor of Nursing Practice and the evolution of the discourse re the design and intent and of the Doctor of Nursing Practice. Findings: There has been ongoing evolution in the vision of the Doctor of Nursing Practice degree since 2004. Whilst there have been challenges, support for continued development and implementation of the Doctor of Nursing Practice is strong. Discussion: These findings are considered with regard to informing potential future directions for Nurse Practitioner education in Australia. Conclusion: It is timely in Australia to consider development of a post endorsement bespoke Professional Doctorate for Nurse Practitioners. To address the issue of course load in Nurse Practitioner Masters Programmes the discipline should work towards being recognized as able to offer an extended masters degree for Nurse Practitioners. Australian Nurse Practitioner faculty should come together as a group to consult on development of Nurse Practitioner education in Australia...|$|R
