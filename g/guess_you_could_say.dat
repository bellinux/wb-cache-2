500|$|In the 21st century, {{the song}} {{continued}} to draw commentary from listeners. [...] By now Kaukonen was offering {{the view that}} the [...] "blood-stained banders" [...] of the lyric was an allusion to the Ku Klux Klan. He continued to find meaning in performing [...] "Good Shepherd" [...] and other songs like it that celebrated religion in one context or another without preaching, saying such material gave him a doorway into scripture: [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I loved the Bible without even knowing it. The spiritual message is always uplifting – it's a good thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Levy {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a romantic suspense story that only uses two principals. I <b>guess</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that, through {{the basis of a}} passive love story, we learn how a crime of passion was committed." ...|$|R

500|$|Drummer Sherman Ferguson said of Ibn Ali, [...] "he was a {{prime example}} of {{somebody}} that was very avant-garde in some ways, but he was always musical. So people of all ages liked his music, even when he played out. [...] had that thing, where he had a natural feeling. He got to the thing where it swung no matter what he was doing." [...] Saxophonist Benny Golson commented that Ibn Ali [...] "became very skilled at the modern sounds, and then went right past them into something very esoteric. He went way out there.

2500|$|Don Henley {{has given}} a number of {{explanations}} about the song, ranging from [...] "a journey from innocence to experience" [...] to [...] "a sociopolitical statement".

5000|$|Remarked Roger Ebert, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{laugh at}} this. You {{would have to}} be seriously alienated from normal human values and be nursing a {{deep-seated}} anger against movies that make you think even a little, but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> laugh." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gibson was {{initially}} reluctant {{to accept the}} role of Guy Hamilton. [...] "I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way." [...] Gibson saw some similarities {{between himself and the}} character of Guy. [...] "He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> the same for me."

5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{less than a}} week before the Falling Down's release, screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith gave his interpretation of what the movie was about. [...] "To me, even though the movie deals with complicated urban issues, it really is just about one basic thing: The main character represents the old power structure of the U.S. that has now become archaic, and hopelessly lost. And that way, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> D-FENS is like Los Angeles. For both of them, it's adjust-or-die time..." ...|$|E
