500|$|When first {{published}} in 1945, The North Ship received just one review, in the Coventry Evening Telegraph, which concluded [...] "Mr Larkin has an inner vision that must be sought for with care. His recondite imagery is couched in phrases that make up {{in a kind of}} wistful hinted beauty what they lack in lucidity. Mr Larkin's readers must at present be confined to a small circle. Perhaps his work will gain wider appeal as his genius becomes more mature?" [...] A few years later, though, the poet and critic Charles Madge came across the book and wrote to Larkin with his compliments. When the collection was reissued in 1966 it was presented as a work of juvenilia, and the reviews were gentle and respectful; the most forthright praise came from Elizabeth Jennings in The Spectator: [...] "few will question the intrinsic value of The North Ship or the importance of its being reprinted now. It is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Larkin could write so well when still so young." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} second race, Kenseth {{drove to the}} victory lane; earning $56,726 for the victory. Kenseth's victory gave his team Roush Fenway Racing its first win in the Gatorade Duels. Kenseth said, [...] "Jimmie Johnson gave me a huge push there and really worked nice for me the whole race. Without that push it never would've got there. Greg lost his {{drafting}} partner. We were able to separate him and the #78 [...] and we had such a big run that Greg {{was kind of a}} sitting duck."

[...] Johnson, who finished third, said, [...] "It was an awesome race. We really had a shot to win that one. It was unfortunate there at the end that there were some lapped cars that were kind of mixed in with the leaders. It would have been nice if they would have let us race there; at least from the white flag on." [...] It took 46 minutes and 23 seconds to complete the second race, and the margin of victory was 0.209 seconds.|$|E

On July 15, 2005, {{the school was}} awarded a $60,000 federal fund for energy efficiency 39% below the national energy threshold; this would save the New Brunswick government $115,193 per year, or an eventual $2 million over 20 years. The province's educational minister, Madelaine Dubé, said: [...] "It is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> our schools can also contribute to protecting our environment." [...] The school held its inauguration ceremony with Bernard Lord present on September 30, 2005, despite its delayed opening {{a few days after}} the beginning of the 200506 school year. Lord spoke of his government's intention to add schools to the growing number of Francophone institutions in New Brunswick, as well as advancing the state of the province's education. [...] "Today's inauguration represents an historic moment for Moncton's Francophone community," [...] he said in his speech. [...] "Parents, students and teaching staff now have modern, state of the art facilities. I feel very proud about this project and I am delighted that it is now a reality."

500|$|On 20 May, two {{flights of}} F-86 Sabres {{encountered}} multiple MiG-15s in MiG Alley, and through radio communications, two additional flights of F-86 Sabres joined the battle, including Jabara. In {{preparation for the}} oncoming battle, Jabara and the other F-86 Sabre pilots were ordered to jettison their auxiliary fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability. Jabara's fuel tank failed to separate from his wing, and protocol required he return to base as the aircraft would be impeded by the extra weight and imbalance, and limit his potential to match off with a MiG. However, Jabara decided to continue to the air battle, where {{he was able to}} still handle his aircraft well enough to be credited with shooting down two MiG-15s with [...]50 caliber machine gun fire. The first was in a group of three MiGs and the other was the last in a six-plane group. Jabara was able to see the first aircraft explode from his gunfire, but he only saw his second victory go into a tailspin as he was avoiding being targeted by another MiG. His fifth and sixth victories made Jabara the first American in history to use jet aircraft to become an ace. The Americans said the 20-minute air battle had included 36 F-86 Sabres against nearly 50 MiG-15s (Russian data shows 30 MiGs), and the American pilots recorded Jabara's two victories and another pilot's [...] "probable". While returning to base, Jabara's F-86 Sabre was so low on fuel, he turned off the engine and glided towards the base before turning it on prior to landing. Data-matching with Soviet records made available {{since the end of the}} Cold War has since shown that only one MiG was lost in the combat, and that Jabara's jet-versus-jet tally was four at best. Nevertheless, American military forces claimed that Jabara was the first jet-versus-jet ace. Jabara later stated in an interview, [...] "That was my bag for the day, and it made me feel pretty <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I was the first jet ace in the history of aerial warfare." [...] The mission was his 63rd Korean mission of an eventual 163; he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest decoration.|$|E
500|$|Mark Schilling of The Japan Times {{rated the}} film 5 out of 5 stars and {{observed}} that Summer Wars [...] "may contain familiar elements, beginning with its bashful, moonstruck young hero, but it combines them in ways fresh, contemporary and dazzlingly imaginative". He {{also said that}} the film provides a social commentary on the differences between an [...] "analog world" [...] and a [...] "realm of digital devices". Schilling titled his article [...] "The future king of Japanese animation may be with us; Hosoda steps out of Miyazaki's shadow with dazzling new film". He praised Sadamoto, Aoyama and Nishida for producing [...] "scenes of animated spectacle that, in their dazzling fluency of motion and untethered brilliance of invention, makes the usual SF/fantasy anime look childish and dull". Twitch Film published a review by Guillem Rosset who also referenced Miyazaki noting that following The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [...] "cries went out immediately hailing him [...] as the heir apparent". He claimed that with Summer Wars, [...] "Hosoda is the new king, the best story teller working within the animated medium in Japan and– quite possibly– the world." [...] Rosset praised the film itself as [...] "richly detailed and beautifully written...gorgeous to look at." [...] and [...] "blessed with an extensive cast of stunningly detailed and authentic characters." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "Hosoda has perfectly balanced the need to entertain via the visuals with the rich and satisfying character work that separates him from the massive pack of quality technicians to establish himself as truly a master story teller." [...] He also noted that [...] "The wonderful cast of characters is one of the film's greatest strengths" [...] while also highlighting that, of the virtual world of OZ, [...] "Here the creative minds of Madhouse can let their imagination run wild." [...] With regards to the technical aspects, Rosset called the film [...] "a top class audiovisual show." [...] He concluded by writing [...] "Mamoru Hosada deserves a place {{as one of the top}} contemporary Japanese animators. And it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> once the time comes for Miyazaki to retire (not too soon I hope!) there's people capable of following his steps." [...] The Korean newspaper Herald Business saw the film's fantasy theme and gorgeous animation as a differentiator from works produced by Hollywood studios.|$|E

2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy.
