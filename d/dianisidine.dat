40|$|Many animal–bacteria {{cooperative}} associations {{occur in}} highly modified host organs {{that create a}} unique environment for housing and maintaining the symbionts. It has been assumed that these specialized organs develop through a program of symbiosis-specific or -enhanced gene expression in one or both partners, but a clear example of this process has been lacking. In this study, we provide evidence for the enhanced production of an enzyme in the symbiotic organ of the squid Euprymna scolopes, which harbors a culture of the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Our data show that this enzyme has a striking biochemical similarity to mammalian myeloperoxidase (MPO; EC 1. 11. 17), an antimicrobial <b>dianisidine</b> peroxidase that occurs in neutrophils. MPO and the squid peroxidase catalyze the same reaction, have similar apparent subunit molecular masses, and a polyclonal antibody to native human MPO specifically localized a peroxidase-like protein to the bacteria-containing regions of the symbiotic organ. We also provide evidence that a previously described squid cDNA encodes the protein (LO 4) {{that is responsible for}} the observed <b>dianisidine</b> peroxidase activity. An antibody made against a fragment of LO 4 immunoprecipitated <b>dianisidine</b> peroxidase activity from extracts of the symbiotic organ, and reacted against these extracts and human MPO in Western blot analysis. These data suggest that related biochemical mechanisms for the control of bacterial number and growth operate in associations that are as functionally diverse as pathogenesis and mutualism, and as phylogenetically distant as molluscs and mammals...|$|E

40|$|Candida albicans is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} yeast pathogen in humans, and recently {{it has become increasingly}} resistant to the current antifungal agents. In this study we investigated C. albicans dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH, EC 1. 3. 99. 11), which catalyzes the fourth step of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, as a new target for controlling infection. We propose that the enzyme {{is a member of the}} DHODH family 2, which comprises mitochondrially bound enzymes, with quinone as the direct electron acceptor and oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Full-length DHODH and N-terminally truncated DHODH, which lacks the targeting sequence and the transmembrane domain, were subcloned from C. albicans, recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized for their kinetics and substrate specificity. An inhibitor screening with 28 selected compounds was performed. Only the <b>dianisidine</b> derivative, redoxal, and the biphenyl quinoline-carboxylic acid derivative, brequinar sodium, which are known to be potent inhibitors of mammalian DHODH, markedly reduced C. albicans DHODH activity.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{carcinogenesis}} is most advanced in bladder cancer through {{the study of}} what is called aniline bladder cancer. Bladder cancer has also {{played a key role in}} introducing the concept of 'occupational' cancer. Industrial Safety and Health Law defines various chemical substances as carcinogens of 'occupational' cancer, many of which are related to the urinary tract tumor, including benzidine, beta-naphthylamine, alpha-naphthylamine, 4 -aminodiphenyl, 4 -netrodiphenyl, auramine, magenta, orthotolidine, <b>dianisidine,</b> dichlorobenzidine and paradimethylaminoazobenzene. When a patient has been exposed to any of these substances, a diagnosis of 'occupational' cancer is made after consultation in the Central Labor Standards Council. Few bladder cancer patients are acknowledged as victims of 'occupational' cancer. In most cases the cause of bladder cancer remains unknown. However, cases of cancer caused by chemical substances are increasing, and many other chemical substances are probably carcinogenic. Although regulations on 'occupational' cancer have been completed, there are many cases of inconvenience in practice.

The subject {{of this paper is}} determination of catalase and peroxidase levels, components of the antioxidant defense mechanism, in various types of woody plants in order to study the effect of pollution by sulphur and copper exploitation in mining areas on the antioxidant enzymes activity in the leaf material taken from different Gymnosperm species as Picea abies L. Karst., Larix decidua Mill. and Angyosperms like Salix ssp alba L., Populus tremula, Betula verrucosa Ehrh. şi Fagus sylvatica L. For this purpose, the measurement of catalase activity was performed using the Sinha method (Artenie Vl. et al., 2008), the determination of peroxidase level was carried out on the basis of ortho- <b>dianisidine</b> method (Cojocaru D. C., 2009) and the determination of soluble proteins on Bradford method (Cojocaru et al., 2009).

40|$|A new thermoalkaliphilic {{bacterium}} {{was isolated}} from a textile wastewater drain and {{identified as a}} new Bacillus sp. (Bacillus SF). Because of its high pH stability and thermostability, a catalase-peroxidase (CP) from this strain has potential {{for the treatment of}} textile bleaching effluents. The CP from Bacillus SF was purified to more than 70. 3 -fold homogeneity using fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction, and anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The native CP had a molecular mass of 165 kDa and was composed of two identical subunits. The isoelectric point of the protein was at pH 6. 0. Peptide mass mapping using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry showed a homology between the CP from Bacillus SF and the CP from Bacillus stearothermophilus. The apparent K-m value of the catalase activity for H 2 O 2 was 2. 6 mM and the k(cat) value was 11, 475 s(- 1).

40|$|Any {{chemical}} substance containing {{two or more}} isocyanate (-N=C=O) functional groups (described below) is classified {{as a member of}} Isocyanates Category under EPA’s New Chemicals Program (TSCA Section 5). Within this category, chemicals containing two isocyanate functional groups are commonly known as diisocyanates. R- (N=C=O) > 2 EPA has concerns with new isocyanate monomers as well as new oligomers, polymers, prepolymers, or reaction products of existing isocyanate monomers (such as methylenebis(phenyleneisocyanate) (MDI), toluene diisocyanate (TDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI)). They can be classified into two subgroups: the aromatic isocyanates, and the aliphatic isocyanates, respectively. Hazard Concerns Isocyanates are of concern for potential dermal and pulmonary sensitization, and other lung effects. The aromatic isocyanates may be potential carcinogens based on analogy to TDI or 3, 3 ' dimethoxybenzidine- 4, 4 '-diisocyanate (<b>dianisidine</b> diisocyanate, DADI). New Chemical Program Review Boundaries The Agency has developed guidelines for the review of new chemicals under the New Chemical Program (TSCA Section 5). For isocyanates, chemicals with an isocyanate functional group equivalent weight (FGEW) equal to or greater than 5, 000 dalton are presumed not to pose a hazard under any conditions. Typically, concerns are confined to those species with molecular weights less than 1, 000 dalton. The Agency has thus far been concerned only with those isocyanates having potentially significant inhalation exposure. ...|$|E
40|$|Legionella pneumophila, the causative {{organism}} of Legionnaires' pneumonia, contains two enzymes with catalatic and peroxidatic activity, KatA and KatB. To {{address the issue}} of redundant, overlapping, or discrete in vivo functions of highly homologous catalase-peroxidases, the gene for katA was cloned and its function was studied in L. pneumophila and Escherichia coli and compared with prior studies of katB in this laboratory. katA is induced during exponential growth and is the predominant peroxidase in stationary phase. When katA is inactivated, L. pneumophila is more sensitive to exogenous hydrogen peroxide and less virulent in the THP- 1 macrophage cell line, similar to katB. Catalatic-peroxidatic activity with different peroxidatic cosubstrates is comparable for KatA and KatB, but KatA is five times more active towards <b>dianisidine.</b> In contrast with these examples of redundant or overlapping function, stationary-phase survival is decreased by 100 - to 10, 000 -fold when katA is inactivated, while no change from wild type is seen for the katB null. The principal clue for understanding this discrete in vivo function was the demonstration that KatA is periplasmic and KatB is cytosolic. This stationary-phase phenotype suggests that targets sensitive to hydrogen peroxide are present outside the cytosol in stationary phase or that the peroxidatic activity of KatA is critical for stationary-phase redox reactions in the periplasm, perhaps disulfide bond formation. Since starvation-induced stationary phase is a prerequisite to acquisition of virulence by L. pneumophila, further studies on the function and regulation of katA in stationary phase may give insights on the mechanisms of infectivity of this pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Clinical and {{statistical}} observations {{were made on}} a group of 438 persons who had worked with aromatic amines (benzidine, 2 -naphthylamine, 1 -naphthylamine and <b>dianisidine)</b> with reference to their carcinogenic properties in the urinary tract. Urinary tract tumors developed in 68 (15. 5 %), with an average latent period of 22 years and 11 months. In these 68 cases, upper urinary tract tumors were found in 16 cases, 8 of which had bilateral lesions. The average age of onset was 48. 1 ranging from 24 to 79. The incidence of tumors increased with the length of exposure to the amines. There was no finding that smoking habit increased the incidence of tumors in this group. Of the 49 new patients with bladder tumor, urine cytology was positive in 24 (49. 0 %) and suspicious of malignancy in 10 (20. 4 %), respectively. This indicated that it could be a useful screening test. Transurethral surgery was most frequently performed as an initial treatment. Recurrence occurred in 50 cases (73. 5 %), but 5 -, 10 - and 20 -year-survival rates were 89. 0 79. 3 and 64. 7 %, respectively, showing a good prognosis. Malignant tumors in other organs developed in 18 (4. 1 %) of the 438 workers. The incidence of such malignant tumors was significantly higher in the workers who had been exposed to 2 -naphthylamine than in others. Our data indicate that close observation is still necessary for early detection of patient with new or recurrent urothelial carcinoma in this group...|$|E
40|$|Freshness is an {{important}} palatability characteristic of rice grains. However, this characteristic deteriorates rapidly during dry storage. In the present study we have developed an indirect method to examine the freshness of rice grains harvested in different crop seasons or stored under conditions known to accelerate deterioration. Bulk samples of intact brown rice grains were soaked in <b>dianisidine</b> solution containing guaiacol and H 2 O 2, and the optical absorbance of the incubation solution was determined colorimetrically. Alternatively, intact brown rice grains were incubated in a similar solution in the wells of a 96 -well microplate, with one grain per well, and the optical absorbance of the incubation solution was measured by a microplate reader. The results indicated that cultivar, storage duration and temperature significantly affected the activities of grain peroxidase. Marked differences {{in the development of}} purple colour in the incubation solutions and in vitro peroxidase activity were also found among the brown rice grains sampled in different seasons. The changes in colour of the incubation solutions measured by either of the above methods paralleled the changes in grain activity of peroxidase assayed using an in vitro method. The proposed method can differentiate brown rice grains harvested in different seasons. Moreover, this method, if combined with suitable statistical clustering procedures, can detect the blending status of fresh/old brown grains in a sample. The advantages of this test method using A(385) over the conventional enzyme activity assay are the rapidity and simplicity with which A(385) can estimate the in vitro determination of peroxidase activity of tested rice grains.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} MPO activity in the synovia of joints affected by os-teoarthritis (OA), in the synovia of their respective contralateral joints, and in the serum of dogs. Furthermore, serum CRP concentrations were to be measured. 75 dogs undergoing surgery at the Klinik und Poliklinik der Freien Universitaet Berlin be-cause of a joint disease which leads to OA were assessed. In addition, synovia of 8 OA-free dogs was collected and analyzed. Samples analyses were performed at the Institute of Vet-erinary Biochemistry at the Freie Universitaet Berlin. The duration of lameness, possible prior treatment, degree of lameness, painfulness, degree of joint effusion, and x-ray findings were documented. Synovia was collected from the affected and contralateral joint; MPO activity was determined using an o- <b>dianisidine</b> assay. In addition, MPO serum activity was measured. Moreover, CRP serum concentration was determined using an ELISA test kit (Tridelta®). Clinical findings varied markedly among the various animals studied. The duration of lame-ness ranged from two days to four years. While no X-ray changes were observed in some animals, high-grade changes were revealed in others. MPO activity in the synovia of affected joints ranged from 0 to 13. 94 mU/L, with a median (M) of 1. 007, compared to a median of 0. 34 (range, 0  3. 66) for healthy joints. This difference was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Controls also showed a low synovial activity (M= 0. 75). Serum activity was higher in affected animals (M= 1. 75) than in controls (M= 0. 075); however, no correlation to synovial activity was found. Furthermore, there was no association between synovial and serum MPO activity and serum CRP concentration. Likewise, parameters assessed by clinical examination and synovial and serum MPO activi-ties, as well as CRP concentrations appeared to be unrelated. Further studies with longer observation periods may result in a better understanding of MPO activity in OA...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} high altitude gastrointestinal mucosal barrier injury and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome(MODS) by observing SD rats with damage of gastrointestinal mucosal barrier,and explore the protective effect of glutamine(Gln) under the simulated high altitude exposure environment. Methods Thirty adult male SD rats were randomly divided into plain control group(group C),high altitude hypoxia group(group H) and Gln protection group(group HG) (10 each). Rats in group H and group HG were allowed {{to live in a}} low-pressure chamber(simulated altitude 7000 m) for 72 hours,and in group C in plain environment for a same period. Small intestinal mucosa tissue pathology,intestinal epithelium cell apoptosis and intestinal bacterial translocation were observed by light and electron microscopy. The diamine oxidase(DAO) activity in serum and small intestinal mucosa was detected with <b>dianisidine</b> developer,the serum malondialdehyde(MDA) content was detected with thiobarbituric acid(TBA) reagent,and the serum superoxide dismutase(SOD) activity,nitric oxide(NO) and glutamine(Gln) contents were detected with enzymatic method. Results The intestinal mucous had been seriously injured in group H and group HG,the junction gap widened,and the lanthanum nitrate tracing indicated that lanthanide entered into epithelial cells’ junction gap and the gaps or cells in peripheral basement membrane tissue. In H group,the bacterial translocation was observed in mesenteric lymph node(MLN) and spleen with translocation number of 0. 47 ± 0. 83 CFU/g;while the translocation number in HG group reduced to 0. 22 ± 0. 42 CFU/g(P < 0. 05). Under terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling(TUNEL) observation,the apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells increased significantly with an apoptosis index of 16. 2 %± 2. 2 %(P < 0. 05) in H group,while the injury was abated obviously in HG group,with an apoptosis index of 13. 3 %± 4. 6 %(P < 0. 05),since the Gln protection. Compared with the C group(serum endotoxin 0. 032 ± 0. 003 kEU/L,serum DAO 0. 861 ± 0. 359 kU/L,serum Gln 3. 083 ± 0. 186 mmol/L,small intestine DAO 0. 516 ± 0. 062 kU/L,small intestine Gln 0. 573 ± 0. 032 mmol/L),the serum endotoxin(0. 277 ± 0. 053 kEU/L) and serum DAO(3. 533 ± 0. 584 kU/L) increased significantly,and serum Gln(1. 472 ± 0. 079 mmol/L),intestinal DAO(0. 325 ± 0. 053 kU/L) and Gln(0. 377 ± 0. 010 mmol/L) decreased significantly in H group(P < 0. 05 or P < 0. 01);Compared with H group,the levels of serum endotoxin(0. 113 ± 0. 015 kEU/L) and DAO(1. 810 ± 0. 450 kU/L) decreased significantly,serum Gln(1. 951 ± 0. 070 mmol/L),small intestine DAO(0. 431 ± 0. 049 kU/L) and Gln(0. 448 ± 0. 021 mmol/L) increased obviously(P < 0. 05) in HG group. Conclusions Hypoxia may induce severe primary intestinal barrier dysfunction,promote bacterial and endotoxic translocation,cause systemic inflammatory response,and is the major factor causing high altitude MODS. Gln may provide a protection against intestinal mucosa injury in high altitude,attenuate the intestinal mucosal permeability,and reduce bacterial translocation and systemic inflammatory response...|$|E
