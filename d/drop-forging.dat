5000|$|H. D. Smith {{was one of}} the originators of the <b>drop-forging</b> process, and was {{described}} by The New York Times as being one of the pioneers of the carriage Hardware industry.|$|E
50|$|The Blakeslee Forging Company {{was founded}} in 1877 and {{incorporated}} in 1896 by Sherman Blakeslee, and first operated in mainly wood-frame buildings built on this site by the Plantsville Manufacturing Company. The company manufactured parts for carriages, and provided custom <b>drop-forging</b> services. Most of the buildings in this complex date to 1912-14, when the older buildings were torn down.|$|E
50|$|The Rhode Island Tool Company is a {{historic}} industrial property at 146-148 West River Street in Providence, Rhode Island. It is a 5 acre parcel located between West River Street and the channelized West River, on which stand two historic buildings. The main building of the complex is a sprawling agglomeration of attached structures, whose construction began in 1853, and whose surviving elements include six parts that predate the American Civil War. Construction of the complex was begun by the Providence Forge & Nut Company, which purchased the Providence Tool Company, and was the largest employer in Providence in the 1870s. The complex represents the best-preserved period metal-processing facility in Providence, and was the only <b>drop-forging</b> operation the state when it closed in 2003.|$|E

50|$|In 1902 Margarete, née Schmidt (August 25, 1880, in Nuremberg), and Heinrich Diehl (born August 3, 1878, in Kölschhausen, died in Nuremberg) {{established}} an art foundry in Nuremberg. In 1914 they began producing rods and <b>drop-forged</b> parts which were launched at the Geuderstrasse site in Nuremberg.|$|R
50|$|In 1868, {{while at}} the Roper Repeating Arms Company in Amherst, Massachusetts, he worked with Charles E. Billings, and Sylvester H. Roper. After Roper's {{firearms}} company failed, and the following year, 1869, the Billings and Spencer founded a partnership in Hartford, Connecticut called Billings & Spencer, which would manufacture sewing machines, <b>drop-forged</b> hand tools, and machine tools.|$|R
50|$|Martin F Christensen {{was born}} in Denmark on March 26, 1849. He immigrated to the United States in 1867 {{at the age of}} 18. After his arrival in America, he began working in the <b>drop-forge</b> steel {{industry}} making various items such as tools and knives. In 1880, he settled in Akron, Ohio with his wife Catherine.|$|R
5000|$|The {{handle and}} shaft of {{screwdrivers}} have changed considerably over time. The design {{is influenced by}} both purpose and manufacturing requirements. The [...] "Perfect Pattern Handle" [...] screwdriver was first manufactured by HD Smith & Company, which operated from 1850 to 1900. Many manufacturers adopted this handle design. The [...] "flat bladed" [...] screwdriver was another design composed of <b>drop-forged</b> steel with riveted wood handles.|$|R
5000|$|In 1882, James Harvey Williams and Matthew Diamond founded Williams & Diamond in Flushing, Queens, a {{drop forging}} {{business}}. The business was relocated to Brooklyn in 1884 {{and took the}} name J.H. Williams & Co in 1887. The company {{was one of the}} first to offer mass-produced <b>drop-forged</b> hand tools. [...] A second factory was opened in Buffalo, New York in 1914 (now the site of General Motors' Tonawanda Engine plant).|$|R
50|$|In 1868, {{while at}} the Roper Repeating Arms Company in Amherst, Massachusetts, he worked with Christopher M. Spencer. Roper failed, and the {{following}} year, 1869, the two founded a partnership (in Hartford, Connecticut) called Billings & Spencer, which would manufacture sewing machines, <b>drop-forged</b> hand tools, and machine tools. Billings perfected a drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator - central to the operation of electrical generators and motors.|$|R
40|$|In drop forging, {{the main}} {{requirements}} consist {{in the production}} of workpieces with pronounced straight or curved main axis while simultaneously maintaining a large variety of forms. The main customer of these <b>drop-forged</b> pieces is the vehicle manufacturing industry with dynamically high-stressed parts used for drives and undercarriages. The optimization of processes and systems for continuous forging process sequences for oblong workpieces with high dimensional and weight accuracies is represented in the form of realized process solutions. Focus is placed on the possible linking of cross-rolling on round- and flat-jaw cross-rolling machines as preforming and finished forming during the production of <b>drop-forged</b> parts and in the optimization of tool technology for the processing steps of drop forging on hammers and presses. Selected application cases are the production of vehicle gear shafts by cross-rolling, the low-flash drop forging of accurately weighted connecting rods and the opt imization of intermediate forms for drop forging light metals by means of cross-rolling. In addition, control optimization of tool-forming machine-systems in the process step of finish forming, the use of prestressed split dies and the use of optimized system solutions for high speed tool changes all represent possibilities for increasing finished form accuracy of forged parts...|$|R
5000|$|The Pan Motor Company's {{infusion}} {{of capital and}} industry was well-remembered by residents of the time. Pandolfo threw a Fourth of July picnic in 1917 where 15,434 pounds of beef were barbecued for the crowd. Part {{of the city was}} dubbed [...] "Pantown" [...] where 58 first-class homes were erected for the company's growing labor force. [...] The company began production of his Pan-Model 250, the first model produced by his new factory that covered 22 acre of land, and included the biggest <b>drop-forge</b> plant in the U.S. west of Chicago.|$|R
50|$|Axles {{were made}} of <b>drop-forged</b> H girder sections, so forging their upswept ends was a simple addition. To avoid {{creating}} stress risers, the drop was formed as smooth curves, not as sharp corners. Bugatti famously used a round bar for their axles, with the spring passing through holes within it and avoiding the U bolts that il patron found so ungainly. For further lowering, {{at the cost of}} reduced suspension travel, some axles were also prepared for racing by being mounted above the leafsprings, rather than below, although this was more common for straight rear axles than dropped front axles.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>drop-forged</b> steel six-throw {{crankshaft}} runs {{in seven}} main bearings; unlike {{the majority of}} wide angle V6 engines which have only four main bearings. [...] The connecting rod bearing journals are offset 22° to one another. [...] Two overhead camshafts (OHCs) operate the automatic hydraulic valve lifters which, in turn, open and close the 39.0 mm intake and 34.3 mm exhaust valves. Since the two 'rows' of pistons and cylinders share a single cylinder head and head gasket, the piston crown (or top surface) is tilted. Intake and exhaust valves need different camshafts to vary valve overlap (they may be coaxial like in some 90° V8).|$|R
50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's <b>drop-forged</b> single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, <b>drop-forged</b> steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is a {{monographic}} presentation, based on investigations connected with the elaboration of new kinds of microalloy steels and a technique of heat and thermo-mechanical treatment {{in the production of}} a selected group of metallurgical products. Design/methodology/approach: The influence of the chemical composition and metallurgical purity on the homogenisation of austenite was analysed, as well as thermally activated processes and phase transformations in the course of deformation and controlled cooling conditions, concerning micradditives Nb, V, Ti, B and metallurgical products. Findings: The chemical composition of the obtained constructional steels with microadditives was quoted, as well as the technological conditions of forging and rolled products required for industrial purposes. Research limitations/implications: The results of investigations concerning the structure and mechanical properties have been presented, as well as the resistance to fracture, mainly of thick plates and hand-forged and <b>drop-forged</b> products and also elements of sheet structures for the automotive industry, made of AHSS steels. Practical implications: The results of the author’s own investigations concerning microalloy steels indicate the actual possibility of their application in practice in many steelworks, particularly in plants producing semi products and final metallurgical products, among others in hot rolling plants and forging shops, first of all in machine building and automotive industry. Originality/value: The application of modern metallurgical technologies and metalforming has been suggested for selected metallurgical products of microalloy steels of the type HSLA with a ferrite-bainite, bainite or tempered martensite structure and also of HSS steels and UHSS steel {{with a wide range of}} mechanical properties and technological formability, which is essential in the case of products of the automotive industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{of studies}} performed {{to assess the}} effect of rheological behavior on the near-net shape forming of an Al– 20 vol% SiC composite of Duralcan F 3 A. 20 S and of the mother aluminum alloy A 356 for comparison. Isothermal experiments were conducted using results of a parallel-plate <b>drop-forge</b> viscometer in a temperature range from 849 K (576 ℃) to 862 K (590 ℃). Each experiment indicated that the viscosity decreased in the early increasing shear rate stage and　subsequently increased with decreasing shear rate. The overall relationship between the viscosity, μ [Pa・s], and the shear rate, γ [s_- 1], can be described by a power-law model of μ = 3. 2 × 10 ^ 7 μ^ 1. 5 for Duralcan and μ = 1. 6 × 10 ^ 7 μ^ 1. 5 for A 356. The power-law　index was the same for both materials, whereas the power-law constant of Duralcan was two times {{greater than that of}} the A 356 mother alloy because of the distribution of 20 vol% SiC particles. The decrease in the viscosity that accompanied an increase in　the shear rate depended on both the temperature and the applied force. The viscosities of 32 kPa・s for both Duralcan and A 356 at the maximum effective duration of deformation, which obtained from the plot {{as a function of the}} viscosity, appeared to be the points at which the dominant factor governing the visco-plastic flow process transitions from plastic forming to casting. The viscosity must also represent optimum semi-solid forming conditions, as indicated by the achievement of both a moderate working time and an adequate deformation. The optimum operating temperature for both materials can be ranged from 855 K (582 ℃) to 857 K (584 ℃), which is just above the melting point. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} is {{a single}} cast piece, the <b>drop-forged</b> crankshaft with counter weights screwed on is supported in bearings made of steel-lead-bronze. The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|R
