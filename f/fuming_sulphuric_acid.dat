Precise determination of <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration is crucial factor for prediction of nucleation rates and subsequent growth. In our study, we have noticed a substantial discrepancy between <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> monomer and total sulphate concentrations measured from the same source of <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> vapour. The discrepancy of about one to two orders of magnitude was found with similar formation rates. The reason for this difference is not yet clear and it can have great impact on predicting atmospheric nucleation rates as well as growth rates. To investigate this discrepancy and its effect on nucleation, a method of thermally controlled saturator filled with pure <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> (~ 97 %) for production of <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> vapour is introduced and tested. Sulphuric acid-water nucleation experiment was done using a laminar flow tube.

40|$|<b>Sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} in atmospheric new particle formation. However, <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> alone does not form stable enough clusters to initiate particle formation in atmospheric conditions. Strong bases, such as amines, have been suggested to stabilize <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> clusters and thus participate in particle formation. We modelled the formation rate of clusters with two <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> and two amine molecules (JA 2 B 2 ) at varying atmospherically relevant conditions with respect to concentrations of <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> ([H 2 SO 4 ]), dimethylamine ([DMA]) and trimethylamine ([TMA]), temperature and relative humidity (RH). The modelled formation rates JA 2 B 2 were functions of <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration with close to quadratic dependence, which is in good agreement with atmospheric observations {{of the connection between}} the particle formation rate and <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration. The coefficients KA 2 B 2 connecting the cluster formation rate and <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations as JA 2 B 2 = KA 2 B 2 [H 2 SO 4 ] 2 turned out to depend also on amine concentrations, temperature and relative humidity. We tested how the model results change if the clusters with two <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> and two amine molecules are assumed to act as seeds for heterogeneous nucleation of organic vapours (other than amines) with higher atmospheric concentrations than <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid.</b> We also compared the modelled coefficients KA 2 B 2 with the corresponding coefficients calculated from the atmospheric observations (Kobs) from environments with varying temperatures and levels of anthropogenic influence. By taking into account the modelled behaviour of JA 2 B 2 as a function of [H 2 SO 4 ], temperature and RH, the atmospheric particle formation rate was reproduced more closely than with the traditional semi-empirical formulae based on <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration only. The formation rates of clusters with two <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> and two amine molecules with different amine compositions (DMA or TMA or one of both) had different responses to varying meteorological conditions and concentrations of vapours participating to particle formation. The observed inverse proportionality of the coefficient Kobs with RH and temperature agreed best with the modelled coefficient KA 2 B 2 related to formation of a~cluster with two H 2 SO 4 and one or two TMA molecules, assuming that these clusters can grow in collisions with abundant organic vapour molecules. In case this assumption is valid, our results suggest that the formation rate of clusters with at least two of both <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> and amine molecules might be the rate-limiting step for atmospheric particle formation. More generally, our analysis elucidates the sensitivity of the atmospheric particle formation rate to meteorological variables and concentrations of vapours participating in particle formation (also other than H 2 SO 4 ) ...|$|R
