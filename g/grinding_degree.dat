Physical properties determination is {{an important}} factor for formulation of machinery projects and sizing of post-harvest operations, which may impact considerably on the products quality, influencing directly the operation cost and company profit. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate and determinate some physical properties (repose angle, unit and bulk density, porosity and color coordinates, particle size, moisture content, water activity, angle of internal friction and effective angle of internal friction) of coffee, such as to evaluate the influence of different roast and <b>grinding</b> <b>degrees</b> over these properties. Crude grain coffee (Coffea canephora and Coffea arabica), dehulled and dried were used. These were roasted at two levels: medium light and medium-dark brown, which Agtron numbers are, respectively, SCAA# 65 and SCAA# 45. After roasting process, grains were grinded at three particle sizes (thin, medium and thick). Both particle size and roast degree significantly affected physical properties of coffee. Coffee samples roasted at medium dark level obtained lower values of moisture content, water activity, repose angle, bulk and real density. Coffee samples grinded at level thin presented an increase of angle of internal friction and effective angle of internal friction, repose angle, bulk and real density, porosity and decrease of water activity values. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} effects of a concentrate consisting of two types of corn: flint and dent, with three different grinding degrees (1, 3 and 5 mm), as a function of intake, performance and digestibility of three crossbred dairy suckling heifers. A randomized block design involving 54 crossbred heifers in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement was used to assess intake and performance patterns. In order to assess digestibility, the experimental design was completely randomized, consisting of 24 crossbred heifers. Weighting and measurements of height at withers and thoracic perimeter were performed. There was no significant interaction between <b>grinding</b> <b>degree</b> and corn type for any of the studied variables. The daily intake of concentrate dry matter was higher for flint corn (243 g/day) as compared with dent corn (160 g/day). The <b>grinding</b> <b>degree</b> caused difference in the dry matter, crude protein and ether extract intake, with higher intake when 3 and 5 mm sieves were used in the process. There was no difference regarding average daily gain and increased withers, croup and thoracic perimeter. Likewise, feed conversion did not differ. Regarding dry matter digestibility, there was an effect resulting from the hardness of corn (78. 9 % for dent, and 84. 3 % and for flint corn). As for the <b>grinding</b> <b>degree,</b> the highest value of dry matter digestibility was found when using 5 mm sieves (84. 2 %), whereas the percentage values found for 1 mm and 3 mm mesh sieves were 79. 1 % and 78. 1 %, respectively.

It {{was determined that}} pozzolanic mineral additives (e. g. opoca) eliminate this harmful influence of extractives. Fresh sawdust extracts of Lithuanian wood’s species (the fir, the alder, the asp, the hornbeam and the birch) have been analyzed in the article. Alkali medium dissolves much more wood’s extractives, than water. The influence of extractives ’ additive on binding material (pure cement and cement with opoca additive) was estimated according to the setting time of binding material paste, chemically combined water changes, cement stone strength and X-ray diffraction of hardened cement stone. The efficiency of mineral additives depends on its pozzolanic activity.

The task of the {{research is}} to find the optimal fineness of glass particles, which can improve packing of microparticles in cement matrix to increase the strength properties of concrete. Previous research as well as chemical composition of glass proved that ground glass can be used as an effective concrete component. Borosilicate glass micro-fillers with different <b>grinding</b> <b>degree</b> were used in experiments. Particle grading was determined by using the laser diffraction method. The morphology of microparticles was investigated. The effect of glass powder on cement setting time was checked. It was determined that fine glass particles powder produces a long-term hardening effect. Experimental work includes preparation of samples from standard concrete and concrete with borosilicate glass micro-filler (with particles of different sizes and mixed in different proportions) and testing after the ageing period of 7 and 28 days. The long-term hardened samples were also tested. The compressive strength of concrete samples is decreasing when rough glass powder is used as cement replacement. At the same time fine glass filler with particle size up to 0. 1 – 10 μm allows improvement in mechanical properties of concrete and makes it possible to replace up to 25 % of the cement without impairing the strength characteristics of concrete. As a result, concrete with improved water resistance and durability was obtained...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} evaluated corn grains with flint and dent texture (ensiled high-moisture or dried), {{submitted to}} <b>grinding</b> <b>degrees,</b> using the in situ ruminal degradation technique. Three rumen canulated adult sheeps {{were used in}} a complete randomized design, using a factorial outline 2 x 2 x 3, with two corn hybrids (flint and dent texture), two conservation methods (ensiled high-moisture and dry) and three grinding degress (whole, coarsely and finely ground, corresponding to the sieve of 12; 10 and 8 mm). Starch soluble fraction (A) of the dent hybrid ensiled corn grains was greater comparing to the dry materials and in both conservation forms this fraction was reduced in the flint texture hybrid, while the insoluble fraction potentially degradable (B) the opposite occurred. The degradation potential was higher in grains ensiled in two textures. The ensiled allowed more starch effective degradation in relation to dry grain in two textures and the grains dent texture hybrid also increased such degradation in both conservation methods. The dent texture and the ensiled high-moisture grains proved the best option considering the starch degradability. Regardless of the conservation forms, the grains of corn hybrid flint texture should be finely ground, for providing higher ruminal degradation, while for the dent texture hybrid, the coarsely and whole grinding are the most suitable for ensiled and dry grain, respectively...|$|R

The complete void volume is filled with the grinding stock if Φ GS, rel =  1. Results show that the change in the heat up curve occurs if Φ GS, rel is approximately at this value. The milling beakers warm up significantly slower for Φ GS, rel > 1 (see Online resource 1). The grinding stock overfills the void volume, the velocity of the milling balls is reduced and thus less heat is generated.|$|R

It has been found that the efficiency of the grinding process (in this type of milling device) depends primarily on the milling time and the share of grinding aids and - to a lesser extent - on their polydispersity.

30|$|The {{temperature}} {{that was}} measured after 90  min milling strongly {{depends on the}} loaded material. The highest temperature was measured without any grinding stock (compare section <b>grinding</b> stock filling <b>degree,</b> Fig.  3). The addition of powder led to lower temperatures in every case. The temperature ranges between 40 and 63  °C for quartz sand and vanillin, respectively (Online resource 1). The material influence on the temperature {{seems to be a}} complicated interaction of material properties like Young´s modulus and hardness [13]. The kind of material influences the elasticity of the collision and the motion of the balls, as shown for planetary ball mills [32]. Thus, it acts on the temperature progression and on the heat transfer from the balls to the wall of the beaker [13]. Young´s modulus for example is insufficient to describe the increase of temperature. For example, with MgF 2 and CaF 2 as grinding stocks, final temperatures of 51  °C were measured, although Young’s modulus is considerably different with 139 and 76  GPa, respectively [33]. In addition to the material properties of the grinding stock, physical phenomena like the compaction of the material on the milling wall influence T milling bed. If the grinding stock material adheres to the wall, less material is trapped when the balls collide. Furthermore, the compact layers reduce the free space for acceleration of the balls.|$|R

In the present investigation, basic studies were conducted using inclined pin-on-plate sliding tester {{to understand the}} effect of directionality of surface grinding marks of hard material on friction and transfer layer formation during sliding against soft materials. 080 M 40 steel plates were ground to attain different surface roughness with unidirectional grinding marks. Then pins made of soft materials such as pure Al, pure Mg and Al-Mg alloy were slid against the prepared steel plates. Grinding angle (i. e., the angle between direction of sliding and grinding marks) was varied between 0 degrees and 90 degrees in the tests. Experiments were conducted under both dry and lubricated conditions on each plate in ambient environment. It was observed that the transfer layer formation and the coefficient of friction, which has two components adhesion and plowing - depend primarily on the directionality of grinding marks of the harder mating surface, and independent of surface roughness of the harder mating surface. For the case of pure Mg, stick-slip phenomenon was observed under dry condition for all grinding angles and it was absent upto 20 <b>degrees</b> <b>grinding</b> angles under lubricated condition. However, for the case of Al, it was observed only under lubricated conditions for angles exceeding 20 degrees. As regards the alloy, namely, Al-Mg alloy, it, was absent in both conditions. For the case of pure Mg and Al, {{it was observed that}} the amplitude of stick-slip motion primarily depends on plowing component of friction. The grinding angle effect on coefficient of friction was attributed to the variation of plowing component of friction with grinding angle...|$|R
40|$|Espresso {{coffee is}} the most popular choice for Italian coffee consumers. It has been {{estimated}} that every day, in the world, over of 50 million of Espresso cups are taken. As a consequence of this success, a large number of devices to make Espresso have been developed. In this scenario, a new device has been recently developed and patented (Eu. Patent 06 023 798. 9; US 2010 / 0034942 A 1). This brew method, named “Caffè Firenze”, uses a sealed extraction chamber, where water and gas provides pressure higher than the other extraction methods. Three main parts compose the apparatus: the gas source, the extraction chamber and the heat exchanger. The gas source provides the pressured gas required to raise the pressure of the system. The extraction chamber is made with chrome-brass and accessorized with two heating glow plugs. Many are the factors affecting Espresso quality: it is known that, coffee type, roasting conditions and <b>degree,</b> <b>grinding</b> and storage strongly affect the obtained brew. Also, several studies have been carried out on the effect of the setting parameters on quality, for example water pressure, water temperature, and brew time. Among the characteristics that determine Espresso quality, the main attribute for the visual analysis is, without doubts, the foam, also called “crema”. Indeed, height, aspect, and persistency of foam are features much appreciates by consumers. Two distinguish Espresso foam parameters are the persistency and foam index. Equipping a commercial bar machine with the new designed extraction chamber makes feasible the comparison between the traditional way to brew Espresso and the new device. The comparison was made holding the previous mentioned conditions, and differences were evaluated in terms of physical parameters and aromatic profiles. Caffè Firenze shows pronounced differences compared with traditional Espresso in term of foam-related parameters. Also, the new extraction device produces coffees with higher values of body-related parameters, such density and viscosity. The two kinds of Espressos are perceived different at visual analysis and taste by a panel test...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{process route}} for the {{production}} of base and platinum-group metals from natural sulfide ores commonly requires the conversion of high-iron furnace matte into an iron-lean converter matte. This is followed by pre-treatment through cooling of the iron-lean molten matte, physical processing of the solidified matte and hydrometallurgical metal extraction. Lonmin is the third largest producer of platinum-group metals in the world and utilizes Peirce-Smith converters for blowing high-iron furnace matte with air to a final iron concentration or endpoint. The molten matte is water granulated and solidification occurs via fast-cooling. The solidified matte is ground in a closed circuit ball mill with hydrocyclone classification and subjected to first stage atmospheric leaching. The specification of an ideal or desirable converter iron endpoint requires careful consideration. Most importantly, it must ensure the crystallization of converter matte with mineralogical qualities that are within the setpoints of the downstream unit processes and techniques. An additional consideration is for the final blown converter matte to achieve an optimum bulk concentration of the base metals Ni and Cu and platinum-group metals Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru and Ir. Mattes characteristic of variable iron endpoints were regularly produced at the Lonmin converter plant section. Uncertainty by plant metallurgists in knowing the desirable iron endpoint, particularly {{within the context of the}} Lonmin base metal refinery, and poor control has had detrimental effects on the mineralogical quality of the final matte and hence on the processing characteristics of the solidified matte particles downstream. A desirable iron endpoint required investigation, selection and implementation at Lonmin. The primary focus of this study was therefore to quantify the effect of a specific iron endpoint on the mineralogy and mineral chemistry of solidified converter matte. A fundamental examination of the solidification process upon cooling was regarded as critical to an in-depth understanding of the attained mineralogy and mineral chemistry as a function of a specific iron endpoint. It became equally important to quantify the effect of the resultant mineralogy, and hence iron endpoint, on the physical property of mineral structures in relation to downstream grinding, liberation and leaching characteristics. Despite considerable industry context, limited in-depth and coherent studies on the effect of a specific iron endpoint on fast-cooled converter matte systems were found in both industrial and scholarly literature. Previous findings in literature offered a limited quantitative understanding of the effect on mineralogy and mineral chemistry. Phase and cooling equilibria of multi-component, iron endpoint specific Ni-Cu-S matte systems were also not fully available. These would have been particularly useful in understanding the complexities of converter matte solidification as a function of iron endpoint. Physical property knowledge of converter matte mineral structures was hardly available and even less so in relation to grinding, liberation and leaching processes. A comprehensive investigation was therefore required to address these extensive knowledge gaps with respect to fastcooled converter matte systems in an industrial framework. Three Peirce-Smith converter production samples, representative of the extent in variability of iron endpoints attained at the converter plant, were used in a systematic investigation coupled to a novel combination of modern analytical techniques, computational thermochemistry and metallurgical testwork. The modern analytical techniques included the application of high resolution transmission electron microscopy and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy tomography. Computational thermochemistry was applied through the use of MTDATA phase diagram software. Metallurgical testwork involved laboratory batch grinding at various specific energies. Closely associated leach experiments were also considered relevant to this wide-ranging investigation. The Peirce-Smith converter samples investigated were indicative of mattes that attained specific endpoints of 5. 17 %, 0. 99 % and 0. 15 weight% Fe. The highest combined bulk concentration of the important base and platinum-group metals was achieved in the matte which attained a specific iron endpoint of 0. 99 %. The mineralogy of all three converter mattes was dominated by nickel sulfide mineral structures matched to the natural mineral of heazlewoodite. Mineral structures of copper sulfide, NiCu-alloy, spinel and OsRu-alloy were also constituents of the different converter mattes. The attainment of a specific iron endpoint was found to result in measurable mineralogical differences with respect to relative mineral abundances, external morphological characteristics and mineral chemistry. The mineralogical differences were particularly distinct between mineral structures of the high (5. 17 %) and low (0. 99 % and 0. 15 %) iron mattes. Subtle mineralogical differences were evident between mineral structures of the low iron mattes. The 0. 99 % Fe matte was characteristic of a significantly higher NiCu-alloy relative abundance, compared to the 5. 17 % Fe matte. The NiCu-alloy structures were found to act as the primary collectors of the economically significant platinum-group metals. Mineralogical observations were used to develop an understanding of the underlying mineralization mechanism of NiCu-alloy structures. High-fidelity color and grayscale 3 D reconstructions were produced of the resultant mineralized structures. It was shown theoretically that variations in iron endpoint specific starting compositions of oxygen-free liquid matte systems alter the solidification pathway towards the eutectic. Moreover, a quantitative understanding of liquid phase solidification of the high and low iron matte systems, including oxygen, was developed to within ± 2. 5 oC. Most of the specific energy available for grinding was expended breaking the nickel sulfide matrix, particularly of the high iron matte. The breakage rates of copper sulfide mineral structures in the 5. 17 % Fe matte were calculated to be higher than in the 0. 15 % Fe matte at 25 kWh/t specific energy. The degree of copper sulfide liberation was shown to be higher for the 5. 17 % Fe matte than for the 0. 15 % Fe matte at the same specific energy of <b>grinding.</b> A higher <b>degree</b> of Ni extraction and Cu cementation could be achieved when leaching low iron matte particles. The production of converter matte attaining a specific iron endpoint of 0. 99 % was found to be the most suitable with respect to endpoint selection criteria. A practical iron endpoint range of 1. 6 % to 1. 0 % was recommended {{for the production}} of converter matte with a resultant mineralogical quality within the constraints of the Lonmin base metal refinery. This study offers an integrated understanding of base and platinum-group metals production as a function of a desirable iron endpoint at Lonmin. This was not previously available in metal production literature. New technology for the monitoring and consistent control of such a practical iron endpoint range can subsequently be implemented. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die prosesroete vir die produksie van onedel en platinumgroepmetale uit natuurlike swawelertse vereis gewoonlik die omsetting van ’n ysterryke hoogoondmat in ’n ysterarm omsettermat. Hierna volg voorbehandeling deur die afkoeling van die ysterarm gesmelte mat, fisiese verwerking van die soliede mat, en hidrometallurgiese metaalekstraksie. Lonmin is die derde grootste produsent van platinumgroepmetale ter wêreld en gebruik Peirce-Smith-omsetters om ysterryke hoogoondmat met lug te blaas totdat dit ’n finale ysterkonsentrasie- of ystereindpunt bereik. Die gesmelte mat word met water granuleer, en solidifikasie vind deur middel van snelafkoeling plaas. Die soliede mat word in ’n geslotekringbalmeul met hidrosikloonklassifikasie gemaal en aan eerstestadium- atmosferiese loging onderwerp. Die spesifikasie van ’n ideale of gewenste ystereindpunt verg deeglike oorweging. Bowenal moet dit verseker dat die omsettermat kristalliseer met mineralogiese eienskappe wat binne die setpunte van die eenheidsprosesse en - tegnieke verder af in die prosesstroom val. ’n Bykomende oorweging is dat die uiteindelike geblaasde omsettermat ’n optimale massakonsentrasie van die onedel metale Ni en Cu en die platinumgroepmetale Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru en Ir moet bevat. Matte met die kenmerke van wisselende ystereindpunte is gereeld by die Lonminomsetteraanleg geproduseer. Die onsekerheid van metallurge by die aanleg oor die gewenste ystereindpunt – veral binne die konteks van die Lonmin-raffinadery vir onedel metale – sowel as swak beheer het ’n nadelige uitwerking gehad op die mineralogiese gehalte van die uiteindelike mat, en dus ook op die verwerkingskenmerke van die soliede matdeeltjies verder af in die prosesstroom. Die bepaling van die gewenste ystereindpunt het sorgvuldige ondersoek, seleksie en toepassing deur Lonmin vereis. Hierdie studie is dus hoofsaaklik uitgevoer om die uitwerking van ’n spesifieke ystereindpunt op die mineralogie en minerale chemie van soliede omsettermat te kwantifiseer. ’n Grondliggende ondersoek na die solidifikasieproses by afkoeling is as noodsaaklik beskou vir ’n diepgaande begrip van die verworwe mineralogie en minerale chemie as ’n funksie van ’n spesifieke ystereindpunt. Mettertyd het dit egter ewe belangrik geword om die uitwerking van die gevolglike mineralogie, en dus die ystereindpunt, op die fisiese eienskappe van minerale strukture met betrekking tot maling-, vrystellings- en loogprosesse verder af in die prosesstroom te kwantifiseer. Ondanks heelwat bedryfskonteks, het nóg bedryfs- nóg vakkundige literatuur veel diepte- en samehangende studies oor die uitwerking van ’n spesifieke ystereindpunt op snelafgekoelde omsettermatstelsels opgelewer. Vorige bevindinge in die literatuur het boonop ’n beperkte kwantitatiewe begrip van die uitwerking op mineralogie en minerale chemie getoon. Die fase- en afkoelingsekwilibriums van ystereindpuntspesifieke Ni-Cu-S-matstelsels met veelvuldige komponente was ook nie ten volle beskikbaar nie. Dít sou veral goed te pas gekom het om die kompleksiteite van omsettermatsolidifikasie as ’n funksie van ystereindpunt te verstaan. Kennis van die fisiese eienskappe van die minerale strukture van omsettermat was kwalik beskikbaar, terwyl selfs minder inligting oor maling-, vrystellings- en loogprosesse opgespoor kon word. Daarom was ’n omvattende ondersoek nodig om hierdie beduidende kennisleemtes met betrekking tot snelafgekoelde omsettermatstelsels in ’n nywerheidsraamwerk aan te vul. Drie Peirce-Smith-omsetterproduksiemonsters wat die wisselende bestek van ystereindpunte by die omsetteraanleg verteenwoordig, is in ’n stelselmatige ondersoek gebruik, tesame met ’n vernuwende kombinasie van moderne ontledingstegnieke, gerekenariseerde termochemiese bewerkings en metallurgiese toetswerk. Die moderne ontledingstegnieke sluit onder andere in hoëresolusie-transmissie-elektronmikroskopie (HRTEM) en gefokusdeioonstraalskandering-elektron-mikroskopie (FIB SEM) tomografie. Die gerekenariseerde termochemiese bewerkings is met behulp van MTDATAfasediagramsagteware uitgevoer. Metallurgiese toetswerk het die maling van laboratoriumlotte teen verskillende spesifieke energieë behels. Nou verwante loogproefnemings is ook as relevant vir hierdie omvattende studie beskou. Die bestudeerde Peirce-Smith-omsettermonsters het op matte met spesifieke eindpunte van 5. 17 %, 0. 99 % en 0. 15 gewig% Fe gedui. Die hoogste gekombineerde massakonsentrasie van die belangrike onedel en platinumgroepmetale is in die mat met ’n spesifieke ystereindpunt van 0. 99 % gevind. Die mineralogie van ál drie omsettermatte is oorheers deur die minerale strukture van nikkelsulfied, wat met die natuurlike mineraal heazlewoodiet ooreenstem. Die verskillende omsettermatte het ook die minerale strukture van kopersulfied, NiCu-allooi, spinel en OsRu-allooi bevat. Daar is bevind dat die verkryging van ’n spesifieke ystereindpunt tot meetbare mineralogiese verskille in die relatiewe volopheid van minerale, die eksterne morfologiese kenmerke sowel as minerale chemie lei. Die mineralogiese verskille was veral duidelik te sien tussen die minerale strukture van die ysterryke (5. 17 % Fe) en ysterarm (0. 99 % en 0. 15 % Fe) matte. Fyn mineralogiese verskille is ook tussen die minerale strukture van die ysterarm matte bespeur. Die 0. 99 % Fe-mat het tipies beduidend meer NiCu-allooi as die 5. 17 % Fe-mat bevat. Die NiCu-allooistrukture tree oënskynlik op as die hoofversamelaars van die ekonomies belangrike platinumgroepmetale. Mineralogiese waarnemings is gebruik om ’n begrip te ontwikkel van die onderliggende mineralisasiemeganisme van NiCuallooistrukture. Die gevolglike gemineraliseerde strukture is met behulp van driedimensionele rekonstruksies met hoë kleurgetrouheid sowel as in grysskaal voorgestel. Daar is teoreties aangetoon dat variasies in ystereindpuntspesifieke beginsamestellings van suurstofvrye vloeibare matstelsels die solidifikasieroete na die eutetikum wysig. Daarbenewens is die vloeifasesolidifikasie van die ysterryke en ysterarm matstelsels, wat suurstof insluit, op sowat ± 2. 5 oC gekwantifiseer. Die meeste van die spesifieke energie wat vir maling beskikbaar was, is gebruik om die nikkelsulfiedmatriks te breek, veral vir die ysterryke mat. Berekeninge toon dat die breektempo’s van die minerale strukture van kopersulfied by die 5. 17 % Fe-mat hoër was as by die 0. 15 % Fe-mat teen ’n spesifieke energie van 25 kWh/t. Die mate van kopersulfiedvrystelling was hoër by die 5. 17 % Fe-mat as by die 0. 15 % Fe-mat by dieselfde spesifieke energie vir maling. ’n Hoër mate van Ni-ekstraksie en Cu-sementasie is verkry toe ysterarm matdeeltjies geloog is. Wat eindpuntseleksiemaatstawwe betref, is die produksie van ’n omsettermat met ’n spesifieke ystereindpunt van 0, 99 % as die mees geskikte aangewys. ’n Praktiese ystereindpuntbestek van 1. 6 % tot 1. 0 % word aanbeveel vir die produksie van ’n omsettermat met ’n gevolglike mineralogiese gehalte wat binne die perke van die Lonmin-raffinadery vir onedel metale val. Hierdie studie bied ’n geïntegreerde begrip van die produksie van onedel en platinumgroepmetale as ’n funksie van ’n gewenste ystereindpunt by Lonmin. Hierdie inligting was nie voorheen in literatuur oor metaalproduksie beskikbaar nie. Nuwe tegnologie vir die monitering en konsekwente beheer van so ’n praktiese ystereindpuntbestek kan dus op grond hiervan in werking gestel word...|$|R
