500|$|Sometime around June 1737 Turpin boarded at the Ferry Inn at Brough, {{under the}} alias of John Palmer (or Parmen). [...] Travelling across the River Humber between the {{historic}} counties of the East Riding of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, he posed {{as a horse}} trader, and often hunted alongside local gentlemen. [...] On 2October 1738 Turpin shot another man's <b>game</b> <b>cock</b> in the street. [...] While being rebuked by John Robinson, he then threatened to shoot him also. [...] Three East Riding justices (JP), George Crowle (Member of Parliament for Hull), Hugh Bethell, and Marmaduke Constable, travelled to Brough and took written depositions about the incident. [...] They threatened to bind him over, but Turpin refused to pay the required surety, and was committed to the House of Correction at Beverley. [...] Turpin was escorted to Beverley by the parish constable, Carey Gill. [...] He made no attempt at escape; It {{has been suggested that}} Turpin may have been depressed about failures in his life.|$|E
500|$|Ainsworth's tale of Turpin's {{overnight}} {{journey from}} London to York on his mare Black Bess has {{its origins in}} an episode recorded by Daniel Defoe, in his 1727 work A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain. [...] After committing a robbery in Kent in 1676, William Nevison apparently rode to York to establish an alibi, and Defoe's account of that journey became part of folk legend. [...] A similar ride was attributed to Turpin as early as 1808, and was being performed on stage by 1819, but the feat as imagined by Ainsworth (about 200miles {{in less than a}} day) is impossible. [...] Nevertheless, Ainsworth's legend of Black Bess was repeated in works such as Black Bess or the Knight of the Road, a 254-part penny dreadful published in 1867–68. [...] In these tales, Turpin was the hero, accompanied by his trusty colleagues Claude Duval, Tom King, and Jack Rann. [...] These narratives, which transformed Turpin from a pockmarked thug and murderer into [...] "a gentleman of the road [...] a protector of the weak", followed a popular cultural tradition of romanticising English criminals. [...] This practice is reflected in the ballads written about Turpin, the earliest of which, Dick Turpin, would appear to have been published in 1737. [...] Later ballads presented Turpin as an 18th-century Robin Hood figure: [...] "Turpin was caught and his trial was passed, and for a <b>game</b> <b>cock</b> he died at last. [...] Five hundred pounds he gave so free, all to Jack Ketch as a small legacy." ...|$|E

60|$|Seven is {{the normal}} number of true ribs, but in two skeletons of the Sultan fowl (in which the fourteenth {{cervical}} vertebra was not furnished with little ribs) {{there were eight}} pairs; the eighth pair seemed to be developed on a vertebra corresponding with the first lumbar in G. bankiva; the sternal portion of both the seventh and eighth ribs did not reach the sternum. In four skeletons in which ribs were developed on the fourteenth cervical vertebra, there were, when these cervical ribs are included, eight pairs; but in one <b>Game</b> <b>cock,</b> in which the fourteenth cervical was furnished with ribs, there were only six pairs of true dorsal ribs; the sixth pair in this case did not have processes, and thus resembled the seventh pair in other skeletons; in this <b>Game</b> <b>cock,</b> as far as could be judged from {{the appearance of the}} lumbar vertebrae, a whole dorsal vertebra with its ribs was missing. We thus see that the ribs (whether or not the little pair attached to the fourteenth cervical vertebra be counted) vary from six to eight pair. The sixth pair is frequently not furnished with processes. The sternal portion of the seventh pair is extremely broad in Cochins, and is completely ossified. As previously stated, it is scarcely possible to count the lumbo-sacral vertebrae; but they certainly do not correspond in shape or number in the several skeletons. The caudal vertebrae are closely similar in all the skeletons, the only difference being whether or not the basal one is anchylosed to the pelvis; they hardly vary even in length, not being shorter in Cochins, with their short tail-feathers, than in other breeds; in a Spanish cock, however, the caudal vertebrae were a little elongated. In three rumpless fowls the caudal vertebrae were few in number, and anchylosed together into a misformed mass.|$|E

5000|$|The division's emblem depicts two roosters confronting each other.

In the wild Gallus bankiva and in our domestic fowls, the barbs which arise from {{each side of the}} extremities of the hackles are naked or not clothed with barbules, so that they resemble bristles; but Mr. Brent sent me some scapular hackles from a young Birchen Duckwing <b>Game</b> <b>cock,</b> in which the naked barbs became densely re-clothed with barbules towards their tips; so that these tips, which were dark coloured with a metallic lustre, were separated from the lower parts by a symmetrically-shaped transparent zone formed of the naked portions of the barbs. Hence the coloured tips appeared like little separate metallic discs.|$|E

And when his lordship took leave of the University, Hugby presented him with a copy of his 'Sermons to a Nobleman's Family' (Hugby was once private tutor to the Sons of the Earl of Muffborough), which Glenlivat presented in return to Mr. William Ramm, known to the fancy as the Tutbury Pet, and the sermons now figure on the boudoir-table of Mrs. Ramm, behind the bar of her house of entertainment, 'The <b>Game</b> <b>Cock</b> and Spurs,' near Woodstock, Oxon.|$|E

50|$|Cock's {{first season}} with the Stamford Bridge club proved to be his most successful, and {{thereafter}} his goalscoring record was never as prolific, though he was still top scorer at the club in 1920-21 and 1921-22. After scoring one goal in 11 appearances in 1922-23, he was transferred to Everton in February 1923. He ended his Chelsea career with a nonetheless impressive 53 goals from 110 <b>games.</b> <b>Cock</b> remained on Merseyside for two years, before signing for Plymouth Argyle in March 1925, where he scored 72 League goals in just 90 games, including a club record 32 goals in 39 League games in 1926-27. However, the club finished 2nd in the Third Division South {{in each of his}} three seasons there and thus missed out on promotion. His playing career ended on a high note, though, when he moved to Millwall and scored 92 goals in 135 appearances, helping the club win the Division Three South title in 1927-28. His 77 League goals there remained a club record until 1973. He is currently Millwall's fourth all-time leading scorer, with 83 goals in all competitions.|$|R
60|$|The {{prospect}} of such {{aid from the}} North reanimated the Southern patriots. One of the most eminent of these was Thomas Sumter, whom the Carolinians had surnamed the <b>Game</b> <b>Cock.</b> [He was now between forty and fifty years of age, brave, hardy and vigorous. He had seen service against the Indians, and in the French war, and had held the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Continental line. After the fall of Charleston he had sought refuge {{with his family in}} one of the open savannahs that lie concealed amid the swamps with which the lower part of South Carolina abounds. In one of his temporary absences his retreat had been invaded, his house burnt to the ground, and his wife and children driven forth without shelter.] Private injury had thus been added to the incentives of patriotism. Emerging from his hiding-place, he had thrown himself among a handful of his fellow-sufferers who had taken refuge in North Carolina. They chose him at once as a leader, and resolved on a desperate struggle for the deliverance of their native State. Destitute of regular weapons, they forged rude substitutes out of the implements of husbandry. Old mill-saws were converted into broad-swords; knives at the ends of poles served for lances; while the country housewives gladly gave up their pewter dishes and other utensils, to be melted down and cast into bullets for such as had fire-arms.|$|E
6000|$|It is a {{singular}} {{fact that the}} males in certain sub-breeds have lost some of their secondary masculine characters, and from their close resemblance in plumage to the females, are often called hennies. There is much diversity of opinion whether these males are in any degree sterile; that they sometimes are partially sterile seems clear (7/46. Mr. Hewitt in Tegetmeier 'Poultry Book' 1866 pages 246 and 156. For hen-tailed game-cocks see page 131.), but {{this may have been}} caused by too close interbreeding. That they are not quite sterile, and that the whole case is widely different from that of old females assuming masculine characters, is evident from several of these hen-like sub-breeds having been long propagated. The males and females of gold and silver-laced Sebright Bantams can be barely distinguished from each other, except by their combs, wattles, and spurs, for they are coloured alike, and the males have not hackles, nor the flowing sickle-like tail-feathers. A hen-tailed sub-breed of Hamburghs was recently much esteemed. There is also a breed of Game- fowls, in which the males and females resemble each other so closely that the cocks have often mistaken their hen-feathered opponents in the cock-pit for real hens, and by the mistake have lost their lives. (7/47. 'The Field' April 20, 1861. The writer says he has seen half-a-dozen cocks thus sacrificed.) The cocks, though dressed in the feathers of the hen, [...] "are high-spirited birds, and their courage has been often proved:" [...] an engraving even has been published of one celebrated hen-tailed victor. Mr. Tegetmeier (7/48. 'Proceedings of Zoolog. Soc.' March 1861 page 102. The engraving of the hen-tailed cock just alluded to was exhibited before the Society.) has recorded the remarkable case of a brown-breasted red <b>Game</b> <b>cock</b> which, after assuming its perfect masculine plumage, became hen-feathered in the autumn of the following year; but he did not lose voice, spurs, strength, nor productiveness. This bird has now retained the same character during five seasons, and has begot both hen-feathered and male-feathered offspring. Mr. Grantley F. Berkeley relates the still more singular case of a celebrated strain of [...] "polecat Game fowls," [...] which produced in nearly every brood a single hen-cock. [...] "The great peculiarity in one of these birds was that he, as the seasons succeeded each other, was not always a hen-cock, and not always of the colour called the polecat, which is black. From the polecat and hen-cock feather in one season he moulted to a full male-plumaged black-breasted red, and in the following year he returned to the former feather." [...] (7/49. 'The Field' April 20, 1861.) ...|$|E

Inside and out, dear Miss Emily, our house is just a little dull. I say our house, and why not--when the management of it is all thrown on me. We are built of stone; and we are much too long, and are not half high enough. Our situation is on the coldest side of the county, away in the west. We are close to the Cheviot hills; and if you fancy there is anything to see when you look out of window, except sheep, you will find yourself woefully mistaken. As for walks, if you go out {{on one side of the}} house you may, or may not, be gored by cattle. On the other side, if the darkness overtakes you, you may, or may not, tumble down a deserted lead mine. But the company, inside the house, makes amends for it all," [...] Mrs. Rook proceeded, enjoying the expression of dismay which was beginning to show itself on Emily's face. [...] "Plenty of excitement for you, my dear, in our small family. Sir Jervis will introduce you to plaster casts of hideous Indian idols; he will keep you writing for him, without mercy, from morning to night; and when he does let you go, old Miss Redwood will find she can't sleep, and will send for the pretty young lady-secretary to read to her. My husband I am sure you will like. He is a respectable man, and bears the highest character. Next to the idols, he's the most hideous object in the house. If you are good enough to encourage him, I don't say that he won't amuse you; he will tell you, for instance, he never in his life hated any human being as he hates his wife. By the way, I must not forget--in the interests of truth, you know--to mention one drawback that does exist in our domestic circle. One of these days we shall have our brains blown out or our throats cut. Sir Jervis's mother left him ten thousand pounds' worth of precious stones all contained in a little cabinet with drawers. He won't let the banker take care of his jewels; he won't sell them; he won't even wear one of the rings on his finger, or one of the pins at his breast. He keeps his cabinet on his dressing-room table; and he says, 'I like to gloat over my jewels, every night, before I go to bed.' Ten thousand pounds' worth of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and what not--at the mercy of the first robber who happens to hear of them. Oh, my dear, he would have no choice, I do assure you, but to use his pistols. We shouldn't quietly submit to be robbed. Sir Jervis inherits the spirit of his ancestors.

60|$|The sickle-feathers in the tail, {{of which}} there are three pair, and which are eminently {{characteristic}} of the male sex, differ much in the various breeds. They are scimitar-shaped in some Hamburghs, instead of being long and flowing as in the typical breeds. They are extremely short in Cochins, and are not at all developed in Hennies. They are carried, together with the whole tail, erect in Dorkings and Gaines; but droop much in Malays and in some Cochins. Sultans are characterised by an additional number of lateral sickle-feathers. The spurs vary much, being placed higher or lower on the shank; being extremely long and sharp in Games, and blunt and short in Cochins. These latter birds seem aware that their spurs are not efficient weapons; for though they occasionally use them, they more frequently fight, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, by seizing and shaking each other with their beaks. In some Indian <b>Game</b> <b>cocks,</b> received by Mr. Brent from Germany, there are, as he informs me, three, four, or even five spurs on each leg. Some Dorkings also have two spurs on each leg (7/53. 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 1 page 595. Mr. Brent has informed me of the same fact. With respect to the position of the spurs in Dorkings see 'Cottage Gardener' September 18, 1860 page 380.); and in birds of this breed the spur is often placed almost {{on the outside of the}} leg. Double spurs are mentioned in an ancient Chinese Encyclopaedia. Their occurrence may be considered as a case of analogous variation, for some wild gallinaceous birds, for instance, the Polyplectron, have double spurs.|$|R
