50|$|Psoralen is {{difficult}} to synthesize due the fact that umbelliferone undergoes substitution at the 8-position {{rather than at the}} desired 6 position. Benzofuran reacts preferentially in the <b>furan</b> <b>ring</b> rather than in the benzene ring. However, the 7-hydroxy derivative of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (also called coumaran) does undergo substitution at the desired 6-position allowing the following synthesis of the coumarin system via a Gattermann-Koch reaction followed by a Perkin condensation using acetic anhydride. The synthesis is then completed by dehydrogenation of the five-membered ring to produce the <b>furan</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E

50|$|Metabolic {{activation}} of 4-IPO occurs {{by one of}} the enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily. The oxidation of the <b>furan</b> <b>ring</b> leads to the formation of an unstable epoxide (cyclic ester with a three-atom ring), so an alkylating intermediate species, 4-IPO enedial, is formed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} with these findings of in vivo studies, several other pathways for biotransformation of 4-IPO {{are found in}} vitro. [...] Next to oxidation of the <b>furan</b> <b>ring</b> of 4-IPO, so that the 4-IPO enedial is formed, the hydroxyl group of 4-IPO can be oxidized. Oxidation of this functional group leads to ketone formation, so IPN is formed. IPN can undergo oxidation of the <b>furan</b> <b>ring</b> by CYPs, like 4-IPO. After this bioactivation reaction, the product can be conjugated to glutathione (GSH) by glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Furthermore, 4-IPO can be reduced and DIOL {{is the product of}} this biotransformation. Finally, 4-IPO can interact with NADP+, forming a molecule which contains 4-IPO and NADPH. Of these four pathways described, the oxidation to IPN and the reduction to DIOL are the major processes.|$|E
