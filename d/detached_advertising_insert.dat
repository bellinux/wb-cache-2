In four-color rotogravure printing, long rolls of newsprint are fed to the press four separate times, one for each color. The ability to align the feeds longitudinally and laterally is critical to quality control, as any misalignment results in color gaps, or colors bleeding to spaces they were not intended to cover.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} pre-printed <b>advertising</b> <b>inserts</b> in {{newspapers}} has increased dramatically. Pre-printed inserts allow advertisers to deliver colorful, high-quality marketing material to targeted groups of consumers within the newspaper's delivery zone structure. To accommodate the increased workload associated with pre-printed inserts without negatively impacting the news deadline or delivery schedules, many newspaper companies face increasingly complex post-press scheduling decisions. This paper presents a spreadsheet model developed to represent the pre-printed insert scheduling problem in {{a case study of}} an actual medium-size newspaper company. The performance of two commercial genetic algorithm (GA) optimizers is compared on this problem.

The providers also handle the sale of <b>advertising</b> <b>inserted</b> at the local level during national programming, in which case the broadcaster and the cable/satellite provider may share revenue. Networks that maintain a home shopping or infomercial format may instead pay the station or cable/satellite provider, in a brokered carriage deal. This is especially common with low-power television stations, and in recent years, even more so for stations that used this revenue stream to finance their conversion to digital broadcasts, which in turn provides them with several additional channels to transmit different programming sources.|$|R

In September 1997, the interactive fiction game Captain Pronin: One Against All was released for the PC, and later unofficially ported to PlayStation. The adventure quest has 400 endings and 200 animated scenes, its graphics has the similar style as the cartoon series, and the text contains humour, jokes and allusions to various foreign and domestic pop culture references. The game holds a 33% audience rating at Absolute Games.|$|R
40|$|Research {{performed}} {{in this thesis}} studies the growth and evolution of advertising investment in digital media compared to traditional printed media, in particular daily newspapers. By means of <b>advertising</b> <b>inserts</b> in printed newspaper and online newspapers, the study’s objective was to confirm that digital media consolidate as an advertising platform. Throughout this study we used different quantitative and qualitative tools to demonstrate the starting hypothesis of this thesis. We used a combined methodology that included: a) joint analysis of printed newspaper “El Mundo” and online newspaper “elmundo. es” advertising content; b) analysis of advertising investment state-of-the-art; c) deep interviews to different media professionals, including advertisers, publicists, media planning, and researchers. A comparative study between the printed newspaper “El Mundo” and the online newspaper “elmundo. es” supported the analysis of contents in a realistic situation. Therefore a deep study of <b>advertising</b> <b>inserts</b> in both the printed and online version of “El Mundo” was performed. The main goal of this work was to show how advertising invesment is moving from traditional printed media to digital media The {{results of this study}} reveal that investment in digital media increases, meanwhile investment reduces in traditional media. At the same time, new reading habits along with technological innovation attracts readers to digital platforms. As a consequence, traditional printed newspapers have the immediate need to somehow engage online-newspaper readers into printed platforms. Hence, many advertisers already invest large sums of money in digital media, with marketing strategies and plans focused to online advertising campaigns in Internet. It is also true that in recent years printed and online media stopped “fighting”, which lead to the possibility of joint marketing and communication strategies between the aforementioned digital and online media. This research has different implications, one of them is that printed media seems to be a bussiness model which needs to be reinvented to adapt itself to the media’s current situation in order to be profitable and not to disappear. On the other hand, digital media must have a well-defined strategy with concrete and viable goals in online investment. Finally, it is important that new readers are taken into account by newspapers, this is: new readers mostly use digital platforms, thus interaction between readers and newspapers is much different than {{what it used to be}} when only printed newspapers existed. Media must go and be where the new reader is...|$|R
40|$|The Medical Monographs {{collection}} Monografies Mèdiques (Monografies hereafter), {{a series}} published in Barcelona between 1926 and 1937, provides the optimum conditions {{for studying the}} relationship between science, in this case medicine, and its public {{within the context of}} Catalonia, which, in the intenvar period, might be considered on the periphery of European science. In the first place, in its pages the creator and editor of the collection, the physician and politician Jaume Aiguader i Miró (1882 - 1943), explicitly articulated countless thoughts on the process of popularizing medicine in general, as well as his interest in winning over physicians as the primary target for the Monografies popularization efforts. While we also find expressions of his interest in offering Monografies to the 'educated public' (that is; non-physicÍans), our hypothesis is that Aiguader's contributions championing access to wider audiences - upheld, as we shall see, by some contemporary Monografies reviewers in the press of that time- were merely rhetorical. Not only was the definition of that other audience poorly defined, but its access to Monografies was also problematic given the technical medical matters covered in every issue, the way they were addressed and the <b>advertising</b> <b>inserted</b> in its pages.

5000|$|Canadian {{broadcast}} {{rights to}} Super Bowl LI {{were subject to}} a still-ongoing legal dispute; although U.S. network affiliates are carried by pay TV providers in the country, Canadian law grants domestic broadcast stations the right to require that these signals be substituted with their own if they are carrying the same program in simulcast with a U.S. station ("simsub"). This policy is intended to help protect Canadian advertising revenue from being lost to viewers watching via U.S. feeds of a program. In 2016, {{as part of a}} larger series of regulatory reforms, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) banned the Super Bowl from being substituted under these circumstances, meaning that the telecast on CTV—a simulcast of the U.S. telecast with Canadian <b>advertising</b> <b>inserted,</b> would co-exist with feeds of the game from U.S. network affiliates. The CRTC cited dissatisfaction surrounding the practice from Canadian viewers—particularly the unavailability of the U.S. commercials, which the CRTC cited as being an [...] "integral part" [...] of the game based on this reception, but also other technical problems caused by poorly implemented simsubs (such as reduced quality and missing content due to mistimed transitions back into the U.S. program feed).|$|R

40|$|Young {{people today}} {{live in a}} media culture where the content they access and {{circulate}} through by means of different audiovisual technological devices {{is part of their}} informal education. In this context, the traditional <b>advertising</b> <b>inserted</b> into these media is giving way to new strategies through which advertising is masked within other content consumed by young people. They believe they are sufficiently well-informed to consider advertising’s influence on them to be relative, and claim to be equipped with effective strategies that immunize them against it. However, as argued in this article, current advertising is implementing new persuasive forms that go unnoticed. We present an empirical investigation involving 154 students. Through an interactive computing device, the students processed a total of 223 stimuli corresponding to a graphic communication medium. The dependent variables include the degree of success in identifying the presence of advertising in the stimuli and reaction time. The results show how new masking strategies in advertising hinder young people’s awareness that they are eceiving advertising messages. This facilitates a failure to create counter-arguments. The results of this work open up the discussion of whether it is relevant to make known to young people, as part of their education and training, these current effective advertising strategies deriving from informal education systems...|$|R

30|$|A self-developed {{questionnaire}} was prepared; it included respondents’ demographic information, such as gender and age, the purchase and utilization of OTCs, {{and the following}} questions: (1) Among the information providers below, which do you usually use to obtain information on OTCs? (2) Among the information channels below, which do you usually use to obtain information on OTCs? and (3) Among the information characteristics below, which do you consider valuable for information on OTCs? In this questionnaire, “information” was particularly limited to the efficacy and safety of OTCs. Thirteen information sources and 10 information channels were investigated. The information sources were OTC manufacturers, public organizations (e.g. MHLW, local health authorities), ordinary users of OTCs, family or friends using OTCs, mass communications, OTC experts, people of learning and experience (e.g. professors, academic researchers), medical doctors, pharmacists, registered distributors, nurses, public health nurses, and salespersons. The information channels were customer services of OTC manufacturers, consultation services of public organizations, consultation at pharmacies, the Internet, consultation at medical institutions, TV or radio, newspapers or <b>advertising</b> <b>inserts,</b> books or magazines, packages or package leaflets, and family or friends. For information characteristics, 6 properties were defined: “specialty” (specialized information about OTCs, including scientific knowledge such as action mechanisms of active ingredients), “objectivity” (fact-based scientific and objective information furnished by non-stakeholders), “concreteness” (concrete features of OTCs based on users’ real-life experience), “comprehensiveness” (information that covers {{a wide range of}} knowledge of every OTC product), “individuality” (information tailored to consumers’ individual conditions, constitution, lifestyles and so on), and “availability” (information easily obtained at any time and place).|$|R
