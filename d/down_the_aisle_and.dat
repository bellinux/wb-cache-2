5|$|In this 6-minute short film, he entire kingdom is {{preparing}} for Rapunzel's marriage to Eugene. Several guests are in attendance, including Rapunzel's birth parents, the King and Queen, the pub thugs and the Stabbington Brothers, while their animal friends Pascal, a chameleon, and Maximus, a horse, serve as the Flower boy and ring bearer respectively. Just as a brown-haired Rapunzel, accompanied by her father, completes her journey down the aisle to unite with Eugene, Maximus, who is carrying the wedding rings on a pillow in his mouth, has a reaction to one of Pascal's flower petals and sneezes, expelling the rings <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> out onto the city streets.|$|E
5|$|They {{meet with}} the Valtian ambassador, Chancellor Alrik (Mickey Cottrell), who is uninterested in the {{marriage}} and wants to pursue trade agreements. With the arrangements made, Picard visits Kamala to say goodbye; she tells him that she has permanently bonded with him instead of Alrik. Kamala explains that he has changed her for the better, and will continue in her duty for her people to marry Alrik. At the wedding ceremony, Picard escorts Kamala <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> watches as she marries another. After the newlyweds {{have returned to the}} planet, Picard says goodbye to Briam in the transporter room. When asked how he resisted Kamala, the expression on Picard's face reveals how much of a struggle it has been and how much he feels he has lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E
50|$|They {{were served}} in pottles, which {{typically}} weigh 160 grams. The unique packaging of Tangy Fruits was considered perfect for cinemas, {{as there was}} no disturbing rustling when one reached for a second helping. In addition, they rolled well <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> were perfect for throwing.|$|R
50|$|In an {{hour the}} church had been {{practically}} cleared. The sight which greeted those {{who had come to}} aid the injured was sickening. <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> along <b>the</b> outside of the pews the dead bodies of men and women were strewn, and the crippled uttered heartrending cries. The work of removing the bodies was begun at once.|$|R
5000|$|The finale, [...] "We're On Our Way to France," [...] was the {{replacement}} for [...] "God Bless America." [...] During this act, the whole company wore their full gear, and marched out of <b>the</b> theater, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> out to <b>the</b> street. During the Century Theatre run, the [...] "performers" [...] stayed at an armory downtown, and would usually march {{right back to}} the armory after the evening show.|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E
25|$|Robert {{returns from}} Switzerland after his colon cancer's gone into remission, right before Christmas. Anna returns from a mission {{around the same}} time. This time, Robert walks his {{daughter}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> Robin asks Anna to be her maid of honor (as opposed to Maxie who had the honors the first time). Patrick asks his brother, Dr. Matt Hunter, to be his best man (in place of Coleman who stood up for him last time). On December 26, the wedding goes off without a hitch. No shootings, no delays, no drama. Just love and romance and happiness.|$|E

50|$|The Legion organises 'The Festival of Remembrance' in Royal Albert Hall, London on the Saturday before Remembrance Sunday. Originally {{featuring}} composer John Foulds's World Requiem it {{now includes}} military displays by current {{members of the}} armed forces, choral works, and prayers. The festival is awash with the finest of British pomp and pageantry. It culminates with Servicemen and Women, with representatives from youth uniformed organizations and uniformed public security services of the City of London, parading <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> onto <b>the</b> floor of the hall. There is a release of poppy petals {{from the roof of}} the hall.|$|R

Peter {{has been asked}} to walk Jillian <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> <b>and</b> the others are invited except for Brian. Feeling like he is being excluded, Brian goes to a local bar to drown his sorrows. In a drunken stupor, he meets up with Lauren Conrad, the star of The Hills. However, he does not {{recognize}} her until they wake up in the same bed the next morning.|$|E

2500|$|Greenlee reveals {{herself to}} Jack. Jack cannot believe {{his eyes when}} Greenlee appears before him. After {{explaining}} how David hid her away for a year, Greenlee threatens to disappear from Jack's life again if he presses charges against David. Greenlee demands that Jack not tell anyone, especially Ryan, that she is alive. On Valentine's Day, David walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> is joined by his heavily veiled bride, whose face is obscured. Just as Jack, Erica and Ryan walk in, Greenlee reveals herself as the bride. Greenlee's sudden [...] "return from the dead" [...] sends shock waves through the assembled guests, who soon take their leave {{with the exception of}} Ryan (but not before everyone tells Greenlee it is a dumb idea to marry David). Ryan's speechless over Greenlee's intention to marry David, let alone on Valentine's Day of all days. Ryan tells Greenlee he never stopped loving her and is dismayed she kept her survival a secret from him. Greenlee defends David, insisting {{he is the one who}} is going to take care of her now. Despite her insistence that Ryan stay away, it is obvious that she still cares for him. Annie crashes the now non-wedding and is stunned to see Greenlee. Ryan lets Greenlee go but remains confident they will get back together one day. Greenlee explains to David why it is so important to her that they get married: It will protect her from falling back in love with Ryan. David and Greenlee's wedding gets underway.|$|E

60|$|Profound silence; silence so {{deep that}} even their breathings were {{conspicuous}} in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> empty <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.|$|R

6000|$|The {{minister}} looked perplexed, {{but remained}} motionless, {{with the book}} in his hands. Bones arose, walked halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> <b>and</b> vanished like a yellow flash! ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Lucy Rose {{had brought}} the basket. She smiled at Aunt Cyrilla as she lugged it <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> Aunt Cyrilla smiled back. Lucy Rose had never touched that basket of her own accord before.|$|E
60|$|So {{they went}} out, {{and finding the}} verger at the Cathedral door, he being a great friend of Miss Stanbury's, they walked up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> <b>and</b> Dorothy was {{instructed}} as to what would be expected from her {{in regard to the}} outward forms of religion. She was to go to the Cathedral service on the morning of every week-day, and on Sundays in the afternoon. On Sunday mornings she was to attend the little church of St. Margaret. On Sunday evenings it was the practice of Miss Stanbury to read a sermon in the dining-room to all of whom her household consisted. Did Dorothy like daily services? Dorothy, who was more patient than her brother, and whose life had been much less energetic, said that she had no objection to going to church every day when there was not too much to do.|$|R
60|$|The legend now {{crosses the}} Atlantic, and {{comes down to}} our own {{immediate}} time. In a certain church of our city, not many evenings ago, there was a contribution for a charitable object. A fervid preacher had poured out his whole soul in a rich and tender discourse, which had at least excited the tears, and perhaps the more effectual sympathy, of a numerous audience. While the choristers sang sweetly, and the organ poured forth its melodious thunder, the deacons passed up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> <b>and</b> along <b>the</b> galleries, presenting their mahogany boxes, in which each person deposited whatever sum he deemed it safe to lend to the Lord, in aid of human wretchedness. Charity became audible,--chink, chink, chink,--as it fell, drop by drop, into the common receptacle. There was a hum,--a stir,--the subdued bustle of people putting their hands into their pockets; while, ever and anon, a vagrant coin fell upon the floor, and rolled away, with long reverberation, into some inscrutable corner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ten more'n a quorum!" [...] ejaculated Mr. Bixby, in a {{voice of}} thanksgiving, as the turmoil below began again. It seemed as though every man in the {{opposition}} {{was on his feet}} and yelling at the chair: some to adjourn; some to indefinitely postpone; some demanding roll-calls; others swearing at these--for a division vote would have opened the doors. Others tried to get out, <b>and</b> then ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> called fiercely on the Speaker to open the doors, and threatened him. But the Honorable Heth Sutton did not lose his head, and it may be doubted whether he ever appeared to better advantage than at that moment. He had a voice like one of the Clovelly bulls that fed in his own pastures in the valley, and by sheer bellowing he got silence, or something approaching it,--the protests dying down to a hum; had recognised another friend of the bill, and was putting another question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] drawled Nat Poole. He {{turned and}} {{caught sight of}} Dave and Ben. [...] "Humph!" [...] he muttered, and without saying more {{continued}} on his way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> through to the next car of the train.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, then, suit yourself. If {{you want}} to cotton to such a fellow as Doring, you can do so, but"--he lowered his voice--"I reckon you are making a mistake." [...] And then, before either Walter or Si could answer, he bounced up, and strode <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> into the smoker.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{something}} {{took place}} that is talked of in Carmody to this day, and even fiercely wrangled over, so many and conflicting are the opinions on the subject.

2500|$|When {{the film}} was finished, a showing was planned at the Museum of Modern Art. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) {{surrounded}} the building, in a protest led by Elaine Parker. Gregg Kilday of the Los Angeles Times interviewed Larry Kardish, a museum staff member, and Kardish recalled that [...] "About halfway into the film about ten members of CORE showed up. They walked up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> were very belligerent. In my estimation they were determined not to like the film. Apparently some of their friends had read the script of the movie and in their belief it was detrimental {{to the image of}} blacks [...] The question-and-answer session with Bakshi that followed quickly collapsed into the chaos of a shouting match." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck did not recall any disturbance during the screening, but said there were racist catcalls during the question-and-answer session, and Bakshi's talk was cut short. [...] "It wasn't much of a madhouse, but it was kind of wild for the Museum of Modern Art." ...|$|R
60|$|The Monday-night session came at last, that sensational {{hour when}} the Speaker makes those {{decisions}} {{to which he}} is supposed to have given birth over Sunday in the seclusion of his country home at Hale. Monday-night sessions are, as a rule, confined in attendance to the Honourable Brush Bascom and Mr. Ridout and a few other conscientious members who do not believe in cheating the State, but to-night all is bustle and confusion, and at least four hundred members are pushing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>and</b> squeezing past each other into the narrow seats, and reading the State Tribune or the ringing words of the governor's inaugural which they find in the racks {{on the back of the}} seats before them. Speaker Doby, who has been apparently deep in conference with the most important members (among them Mr. Crewe, to whom he has whispered that a violent snow-storm is raging in Hale), raps for order; and after a few preliminaries hands to Mr. Utter, the clerk, amidst a breathless silence, the paper on which the parliamentary career of so many ambitious statesmen depends.|$|R
60|$|It is {{possible}} that, lacking {{the initiative to}} make his way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> find a table for himself, he might have stood there indefinitely, but for the restless activity of Adams, the head steward. It was Adams' mission in life to flit to and fro, hauling would-be lunchers to their destinations, as a St. Bernard dog hauls travelers out of Alpine snowdrifts. He sighted Lord Emsworth and secured him with a genteel pounce.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! well!" [...] {{cried the}} {{commercial}} drummer. [...] "To be sure I met that fellow. The way I noticed him {{was because he}} acted so queer.

60|$|Next came rumours {{that even}} the Nunnery itself was haunted, {{especially}} the chapel. Here voices were heard talking, and Emlyn Stower, who was praying there, came out vowing {{that she had seen}} a ball of fire which rolled up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> <b>and</b> in the centre of it a man's head, that seemed to try to talk to her, but could not.|$|E
60|$|It {{may have}} been towards the third hour of night when at last I {{staggered}} up--stiff and cramped from my long kneeling on the cold stone. Slowly, in a half-dazed condition, I move <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> <b>and</b> gained {{the door of the}} church. I essayed to open it. It resisted my efforts, and then I realised that it was locked for the night.|$|E
500|$|After {{shooting}} all six shotgun rounds, Kazmierczak {{fired on}} the room's remaining occupants with the 9mm Glock pistol, firing {{a total of}} approximately 50 rounds.
