25|$|It is {{dated to}} the early 11th century, {{because that was the}} time when the ordeal by boiling water made its {{appearance}} in Scandinavia and the poet speaks of it as a practice of foreign origin.

All these actions should be done in agreement with Jordan and the Palestinian population.

500|$|The kakapo was {{originally}} described by English ornithologist George Robert Gray in 1845. The name [...] "kakapo" [...] is the English transliteration of [...] "kākāpō" [...] which {{is derived from}} the Māori terms kākā ("parrot") + pō ("night"). Its generic name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek strix, genitive strigos [...] "owl", and ops [...] "face", while its specific epithet comes from habros [...] "soft", and ptilon [...] "feather". <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>so</b> many unusual features that it was initially placed in its own tribe, Strigopini. Recent phylogenetic studies have confirmed the unique position of this genus as well as the closeness to the kākā and the kea, both belonging to the New Zealand parrot genus Nestor. Together, they are now considered a separate superfamily within the parrots, Strigopoidea. Within the Strigopoidea, the kakapo is placed in its own family, Strigopidae. The common ancestor of the kakapo and the genus Nestor became isolated from the remaining parrot species when New Zealand broke off from Gondwana, around 82 million years ago. Around 70million years ago, the kakapo diverged from the genus Nestor.|$|E
