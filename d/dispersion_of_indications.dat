40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine whether characteristics of recording responses on rating scales generalize across stimulus domains and if this {{could account for the}} apparent tendency to displace interpretations of attitude-relevant communications either toward or away from one's own attitude. Two characteristics were investigated: the standard deviation of responses and their index <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> (an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the degree to which response categories are used with equal frequency). These characteristics were measured in three domains: judgements of general personality trait adjectives, own attitude toward Negroes, and the estimated favourableness of other persons' attitudes toward Negroes as inferred from statements attributed to them. Subjects whose ratings of trait adjectives had a low index <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> and a high standard deviation appeared to have more favourable attitudes toward Negroes, and also tended to interpret pro-Negro and anti-Negro statements as relatively more extreme. Further analyses supported the contention that the effects of own attitude on the interpretation of attitude relevant messages (cf. Manis, 1961) may be attributable to the generalization of response style characteristics across content domains and do not necessarily result from an attempt to reduce pressure to change one's own view by distorting the meaning of messages discrepant from this view...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a dynamic search-and-matching {{problem of a}} firm with its intermediate input supplier. In our model, a headquarter currently matched with a supplier, has an interest to find and collaborate with a more efficient partner. However, supplier switching through search and re-matching is costly. Given this trade-off between the fixed costs and the expected gains from continued search, the process will stop whenever the headquarter has found a sufficiently efficient supplier. Using firm-product-level data of fresh Chinese exporters to the United States, we obtain empirical evidence {{in line with the}} predictions of our theory. In particular, we find that the share of short-term collaborations is higher in industries with more supplier-cost <b>dispersion,</b> an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> higher expected search opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Static {{mechanical}} properties (e. g. elastic modulus) and fatigue properties of a material all have dispersions.

In this paper, according to theoretical derivation and preliminary experiments verification, the following relationships between <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> fatigue properties and <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> static {{mechanical properties}} of a material are obtained: the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> fatigue life is n (the fatigue index) times of the sum <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> elastic modulus and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the load.

40|$|To {{study the}} role <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> atrial repolarization (DAR) in {{the genesis of}} atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), monophasic action potentials (MAP) were recorded simultaneously from a catheter at the high lateral right atrium (HLRA) and a catheter moving around the high, middle and low lateral right atrium (RA) the high, anterior and posterior septal RA and the RA appendage in 15 patients with paroxysmal AF and 15 patients with atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) or concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) without history of AF. After recordings during sinus rhythm (SR), MAPs were recorded during programmed stimulation (PS) via the HLRA catheter at a drive cycle length (CL) of 500 ms. Thus, MAPs were recorded simultaneously from 2 sites {{at a time and}} sequentially from 4 to 12 sites during SR, drive pacing and PS. Taking the MAP at the HLRA as reference, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization time (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT) and its two components, the <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> activation time (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT) and MAP duration (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration) among the 4 to 12 sites were calculated and taken as parameters of DAR. RESULTS: During SR and PS, the maximal <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT was significantly greater in AF than in control patients, 113 +/- 49 ms vs 50 +/- 28 ms (P< 0. 001) and 114 +/- 56 vs 70 +/- 43 ms (P< 0. 05) respectively. The increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT in the AF group was caused by increases in both <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{tested the}} {{correlation}} of QT and JT dispersion and other potentially useful electrocardiographic (ECG) indexes with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization and recovery time. Background. <b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization is currently being assessed noninvasively from the surface ECG by means of QT and JT dispersion, although their correlation with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization as measured directly from the myocardium is not well established. Methods. Multiple monophasic action potentials were recorded simultaneously with a 12 -lead ECG from isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The QT and JT dispersion was compared with the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> monophasic action potential duration at 90 % repolarization (APD 90) and with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> recovery time. As new ECG indexes, total T wave area, T wave area after the peak (late T wave area) and T peak to T end interval were also tested. Results. The QT and JT dispersion showed a significant correlation with the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> APD 90 and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> recovery time (r values between 0. 58 and 0. 64, respectively, p < 0. 001). However, total T wave area showed better correlation, respectively, with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> APD 90 and recovery time (r = 0. 79 and r = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001), as did late T wave area (r = 0. 81 and r = 0. 81, p < 0. 0001) and T peak to T end interval (r = 0. 81 and r = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001).

The time difference between {{the ends of the}} two monophasic action potentials were used as a measure <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization, which consists of the activation time difference and the monophasic action potential duration difference. During double and triple programmed stimulation, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization increased significantly with the shortening of the coupling interval but decreased slightly with the shortening of the preceding interval. The induction of the ventricular arrhythmias in these patients was invariably associated with a marked increase in the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization.

To {{establish}} {{a set of}} reference values for regional <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization of the right atrium in the in situ heart of pigs and {{to see if the}} global <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization could be estimated from regional mapping. Design. Monophasic action potential (MAP) were sequentially recorded from 28 Â± 3 sites in seven different regional areas of the right atrium: lateral, anterior and posterior wall, septum, sinoatrial node (SAN), appendage, and near the tricuspid annulus (TA) in 10 healthy pigs using the CARTO mapping system. Results. The activation time (AT), MAP duration (MAPd) and end of repolarization time (EOR) of the whole right atrium were 68 Â± 7, 239 Â± 20 and 270 Â± 23 ms, respectively. There were no significant differences on MAPd and EOR among the seven regional areas, nor between each of the regional and global values. The global <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> the MAPd and EOR were 75 Â± 19 and 103 Â± 13 ms, which were significantly greater than those obtained from any of the seven regional areas and those between two remote regions, SAN vs. TA and SAN vs. appendage regions.
