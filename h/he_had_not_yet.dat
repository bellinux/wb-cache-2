5|$|Whereas the {{original}} version had included Sheikh Patrash Pasha showing Tintin a copy of Tintin in America, in the 1955 version this was changed to the earlier Tintin in the Congo, and Hergé would change it again for subsequent printings, this time to Destination Moon (1953), an Adventure set chronologically after Cigars. Benoît Peeters exclaimed that with this scene, the reader can imagine Tintin's surprise at encountering an adventure <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> had and which included the characters of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> met. Another anachronism in this version appears when Snowy refers to Marlinspike Hall, the ancestral home of Captain Haddock, from the much later volumes of the series. Harry Thompson opined {{that the most important}} changes to the book were artistic, for in the late 1950s Hergé was {{at the peak of his}} artistic ability.|$|E

Colbert staunchly refused to confirm or deny his candidacy, stating <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.|$|E

Beauchamp was released, but agreed to stay in Frankfort for ten days to allow the court to finish its investigation. During this time, Beauchamp wrote letters to John J. Crittenden and George M. Bibb requesting their legal aid in the matter. Neither letter was answered. Meanwhile, Beauchamp's uncle, a state senator, gathered a defense team that included former U.S. Senator John Pope.|$|E
5|$|McElhenny was {{a first-round}} {{pick of the}} San Francisco 49ers in the 1952 NFL Draft, ninth overall, and made an {{immediate}} impression as a rookie. His first play as a professional was a 40-yard touchdown run which had been drawn in the dirt because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> learned the team's playbook. He recorded the season's longest run from scrimmage (89 yards), the longest punt return (94 yards), and the top rushing average (7.0 yards per carry). He was unanimously recognized as the season's top rookie.|$|E

5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} {{pursuing}} the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> made a decision when his leading battleships encountered {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E

Over the next few years he explored much of the river and its northern tributaries. In 1811 he traveled down the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean, arriving at the mouth just after John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company had founded Astoria. On his return to the north, Thompson explored the one remaining part of the river <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> seen, becoming the first European-American to travel {{the entire length of the}} river.|$|E
5|$|Five {{references}} in Eusebius' Historia Ecclesiastica speak to Philip's Christianity; three directly, two by implication. At 6.34, he describes Philip visiting a church on Easter Eve and being denied entry by the presiding bishop because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> confessed his sins. The bishop goes unnamed. At 6.36.3, he writes {{of letters from}} the Christian theologian Origen to Philip and to Philip's wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa. At 6.39, Eusebius writes that Decius persecuted Christians because he hated Philip. The remaining two references are quotations or paraphrases of Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, a contemporary of Philip (he held the patriarchate from 247 to 265). At 6.41.9, Dionysius contrasts the tolerant Philip's rule with the intolerant Decius'. At 7.10.3, Dionysius implies that Alexander Severus (emperor from 222 to 235) and Philip were both openly Christian.|$|E

She would frequently play catch and even work on pitching with him. He labels her {{as one of his}} biggest inspirations. He was married on January 9, 2010, to Rachel Lackey, whom he had met while they were students at San Diego State. On June 24, 2014, Strasburg stated {{in an interview that he}} was going to stop chewing tobacco in the wake of his college coach Tony Gwynn's death, although he admitted to The Washington Post two years later that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> completely kicked the habit.|$|E
5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks {{throughout the city}} but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder {{case in which the}} dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E
5|$|Pleydell's initial {{entrance}} to the Parliament of England in March 1553 as a member for the market town of Wootton Bassett was, at least in part, made possible by {{his status as a}} wealthy landholder. Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> inherited the lease on the family estate of Midgehall, his purchases of land and property surrounding the manor (one mile from the constituency) in 1561 and 1562 suggest that his assets facilitated a seat in the House of Commons. The constituency was eventually abolished by the Reform Act 1832. Surviving records note Pleydell's returning to Parliament solely by his Christian name, deemed sufficiently unusual to identify him outright. Succeeding members John Seymour and Robert Huick from the 1547–52 session, Pleydell served with William Garrard for just 30 days in March until a dissolution of Parliament. They were replaced in October by Henry Poole and John Throckmorton.|$|E

5|$|Seymour {{arrived in}} Los Angeles on February 22, 1906, and {{within two days}} was preaching at Julia Hutchins' church {{at the corner of}} Ninth Street and Santa Fe Avenue. During his first sermon, he preached that {{speaking}} in tongues was the first biblical evidence of the inevitable infilling in the Holy Spirit. On the following Sunday, March 4, he returned to the church and found that Hutchins had padlocked the door. Elders of the church rejected Seymour's teaching, primarily because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> experienced the blessing about which he was preaching. Condemnation of his message also came from the Holiness Church Association of Southern California with which the church had affiliation. However, not all members of Hutchins' church rejected Seymour's preaching. He was invited to stay in the home of congregation member Edward S. Lee, and he began to hold Bible studies and prayer meetings there.|$|E
5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers {{thought it best}} {{to wait until the}} harbor had frozen over. In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|As archbishop, William {{undertook}} {{a number of}} ecclesiastical reforms, and became popular {{with the people of}} York. However, he still needed a pallium, the sign of an archbishop's authority from the pope, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> received. The Cistercians, who were still adamantly opposed to his being archbishop, were determined to prevent his receiving it. William travelled to Rome in an attempt to obtain the pallium. The election of Pope Eugene III, a Cistercian, in 1145, was a setback for his cause. Bernard of Clairvaux, the famous Cistercian abbot and religious leader, exerted all his influence to ensure William's suspension, sending a series of complaints to the new pope that William had been intruded by secular powers into the see, that he was oppressing the Cistercian monasteries and that he had irregularly appointed William of St. Barbara as Dean of York. In the winter of 1145–46 Eugene re-examined the case, declared that William had not been validly consecrated, and suspended him from office. William was required to obtain an in-person refutation of the old charges by William of St. Barbara, who was now the Bishop of Durham.|$|E
