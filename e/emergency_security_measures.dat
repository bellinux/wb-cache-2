40|$|Financial {{security}} {{is an important}} means for implementing quality preparation for the crisis and consequent solutions. The basic component of the municipal budget consists of funding from the State, where the municipalities further funds apportioned {{on the part of}} the sectoral into groups, sections, subsections and paragraphs. Funding for emergency measures to protect the population constitutes Section five national security and legal protection. The main instrument of financial security and the preparation of budget expenditures in the group of five is a law on crisis management, law on IRS and the law on budgetary composition. Current legislation talks about financial security crisis measures and financial reserves. The amount of funding is not provided by law. The funds are intended to ensure that preparations crisis situations, respond to and remediate according to the emergency act and tasks set by law on integrated rescue systém. The aim of work is to analyze the practical part of any revenues of municipalities. Further analyze budgetary expenditures, which are intended to provide emergency measures, including protection of the population. The aim is to that under the current legislation municipalities spend funds according to budget chapters on crisis measures and whether the financial reserve is sufficient. The research question was posed subsequently: "Do municipalities create a reserve funds for <b>emergency</b> <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> determined to them by the legislation of the Czech republic?". The research sample is consisted of three municipalities of the cadastral area Tabor. Municipalities are similar in size and population. The municipality Planá nad Lužnicí is different in geographic positioning, where on the edge of the village flows the river Lužnice. The crisis plan of Tábor is not publicly publishable, but a general knowledge may arise following crisis situation: flooding in large scale, epidemics, radiation accidents, disruption of gas and heat supplies, and other natural disasters. This is a risk or potential incident, which can initiate an emergency situation. Each municipality is the promoter JPO 3 and in the village is a unit of volunteer firefighters. The potential risk and rise crisis situation can affect all three municipalities surveyed. When comparing expenditures to a group of five national security, a comparison was made including subsection 531, which is according the budgetary rules led to the municipal police, CCTV (closed-circuit television) etc. Furthermore, municipal expenditures were compared separately to section 52 and section 55. In Section 52, the amount of funds according to the surveyed year was for example, 0 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 4 %, 2. 9 %. Section 55 was significantly different and the amount of funds was for example 82 %, 97 %, 100 %. The exception is 2013, when all three municipalities have significantly increased funding in Section 52. These funds reached 12. 2 %, 17. 4 % and 47. 5 % of the expenditure of sector part. A more detailed research showed that communities do not always have budgeted expenditure for emergency measures as required by law. Often in the budgetary composition in the expenditure of section 5 is not a subsection protection of population, subsection crisis management or other components and operation of the integrated rescue system. Subsection 521 protection of the population was only in village Mladá Vožice in all four surveyed financial years. Other municipalities in the mentioned subsections did not have any funds. The analysis carried out in the sectoral budgetary expenditure of the group of five - national security can be evaluated that municipalities do not create a financial reserve funds as imposed by current legislation. The results will be made available to municipalities and regional authorities. The work will be provided to crisis managers, schools with a similar field, to improve the educational process...|$|E

40|$|<b>Security</b> <b>measure</b> is {{of great}} {{importance}} in both steganography and steganalysis. Considering that statistical feature perturbations caused by steganography in an image are always nondeterministic and that an image is considered nonstationary, in this paper, the steganography {{is regarded as a}} fuzzy process. Here a steganographic <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> is proposed. This <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> evaluates the similarity between two vague sets of cover images and stego images in terms of n-order Markov chain to capture the interpixel correlation. The new <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> has proven to have the properties of boundedness, commutativity, and unity. Furthermore, the <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> of zero order, first order, second order, third order, and so forth are obtained by adjusting the order value of n-order Markov chain. Experimental results indicate that the larger n is, the better the measuring ability of the proposed <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> will be. The proposed <b>security</b> <b>measure</b> is more sensitive than other <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> defined under a deterministic distribution model, when the embedding is low.

40|$|Satellite-based navigation, {{positioning}} {{and accurate}} timing information is increasingly significant in many sectors of commercial activity – airlines, transport operators on land, sea and air, emergency services, agriculture and fiskeries, tourism, telecommunications networks. The market potential is huge. Galileo {{is the new}} European navigation satellite system for a global satellite-based network for precise positioning and timing information. It will offer many levels of service to satisfy all user requirements, and will consist of 30 spacecraft in medium Earth orbit, providing excellent worldwide cover, and associated ground infrastructure. The system {{is expected to be}} fully operational by 2010. The first satellite navigation system managed and operated by civilian authorities, Galileo will be complementary to the existing US GPS system, in that it will be fully interoperable with GPS while remaining independent. Crucially, it will deliver guaranteed and certified quality and reliability for safety–critical applications (civil aviation, <b>emergency</b> service, <b>security</b> <b>measures).</b> In January 2006 the so called In Orbit Validation (IOV) Phase was started, consisting of four satellites and the corresponding ground segment. After successful completion of IOV in 2008, the whole satellite segment will be deployed. Presently, the first test satellite (GIOVE A) is in operation. Galileo is a truly “enabling technology” and innovative driver for user – and customer-oriented solutions, which should create many jobs across the would. The DLR Institute of Communications and Navigation (IKN) has a long experience in the field of satellite navigation, with an impressive range of contributions and innovations. Already in 1985 IKN performed successfully the so called NAVEX experiment on a Space Shuttle / Spacelab mission including all fundamental experiments concerning positioning and time synchronisation/distribution. Also at this time an augmentation system for GPS was proposed and patented; {{it is one of the}} main roots of EGNOS. For the experiments the first GPS time receiver was developed at IKN. After a brief description of the “Missions and Visions” of the Navigation Department (IKN-NA) the main features of Galileo will be explained. Next, information with respect to the actual research and development topics of IKN-NA will be given. The third part deals with advanced Galileo applications. Finally, the R&D infrastructure and tools of the Navigation Department are presented. ]...|$|R

Thereby, some IT <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> target specific critical components in the information network, in particular structural IT <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> such as redundancies through backup systems. In contrast, other IT <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> have a more holistic effect on the information network such as process-related IT <b>security</b> <b>measures,</b> e.g., reduced damage potentials through improved recovery measures. Here, our structured approach serves as guidance in the derivation of an appropriate IT security strategy.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the terrible shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, our nation has turned its {{attention}} to school security. For example, several states have passed or are considering passing legislation that will provide new funding to schools for security equipment and law enforcement officers. Strict <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> in schools are certainly not new. In response to prior acts of school violence, many public schools for years have relied on metal detectors, random sweeps, locked gates, surveillance cameras, and law enforcement officers to promote school safety. Before policymakers and school officials invest more money in strict <b>security</b> <b>measures,</b> this Article provides additional factors that should be considered. First, drawing on recent, restricted data from the U. S. Department of Education, this Article presents an original empirical analysis revealing that low-income students and minority students {{are much more likely to}} experience intense security conditions in their schools than other students, even when taking into account neighborhood crime, school crime, and school disorder. These findings raise concerns that such inequalities may continue or worsen as policymakers provide additional funding for <b>security</b> <b>measures.</b> Second, this Article argues that strict <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> do not support long-term solutions needed to effectively prevent school violence. Indeed, strict <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> exacerbate the underlying problems by creating barriers of adversity and mistrust between students and educators. In addition, this Article offers recommendations to address the disproportionate use of <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> on low-income and minority students and to curb violence more effectively. It urges school officials and policymakers to support programs that build trust and collective responsibility instead of providing grants for strict <b>security</b> <b>measures.</b> Further, it recommends that the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights play a more active role in addressing the disproportionate use of strict <b>security</b> <b>measures</b> on minority students...|$|R
