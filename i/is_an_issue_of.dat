In some cases there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> whether both the Welsh and English names should be used, or only one, and which should be given priority. In other cases it is because usage and style have changed over the years, and there is debate over which form or {{spelling}} of a placename should be used. Both the Welsh Government and the Ordnance Survey have policies on standardising placenames, drawing on advice from the Welsh Language Commissioner and the Place-name Research Centre at the University of Wales, Bangor.|$|E
500|$|Whether {{destruction}} {{or damage}} has occurred <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> fact and degree {{in each case}} and case law suggests that damage must be more than de minimis. In A (a juvenile) v. R (1978), the defendant spat on a police officer's raincoat, which was easily wiped clean; it was held that this did not amount to damage within the 1971 Act. Similarly, in Morphitis v. Salmon (1990), a scratch to a scaffolding pole did not affect its value or usefulness and thus damage had not been proved. The court said: ...|$|E

In an interview with CNBC on February 2, Paul clarified this statement, commenting [...] "I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, and it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> freedom." [...] On February 3, he posted a photograph to Twitter of himself being vaccinated.|$|E

A Sacagawea dollar is a United States dollar coin which has been minted since 2000. After he is thrown out of Moe's Tavern, Comic Book Guy says the word [...] "loneliness" [...] in Klingon, a language used by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek universe. While arguing with Agnes, Comic Book Guy says [...] "Now I know what ever happened to Baby Jane." [...] The line is a reference to the 1960 suspense novel What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. Martin's mother tries to sell Comic Book Guy several items relating to the Star Wars film series including Carrie Fisher's [...] "anti-jiggle breast tape", George Lucas' handwritten original script of [...] and a film of a supposed alternate ending for the series where it is revealed that [...] "Luke's father is Chewbacca." ...|$|E

She said that Cosby [...] "complains about racial bias but what about the African American women whom I represent who accuse him of sexual assault or rape and who refuse to remain silent about what they say they have suffered?"

2500|$|According to Sunnis, Muhammad didn't gift Fadak to his daughter. All the narrations {{regarding}} this are weak. As {{far as the}} claim of Shias is concerned, that when the verse of Holy Quran, [...] "And give the relative his right", was revealed, the Prophet gave Fadak to his daughter, then this argument is weak. First of all, this narration is weak because of the narrator Atiyah al-Awfi. Secondly, this verse was revealed in Makkah, and Fadak was conquered when Muslims were in Madinah. It is not possible that the verse regarding Fadak was revealed {{at a time when}} Fadak was not {{in the hands of the}} Muslims. This is not the case of the applicability of a law, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the invalidity of a gift before it comes in the hands of a person. Moreover, Muhammad did not gave worldly things to his daughter. He even refused to give her a maid, hence it is not possible that he could give her a huge piece of land.|$|E
2500|$|Oversight of U.S. Airline Customer Service: May 2, 2017. [...] The Congresswoman posed {{questions}} to the witnesses, including Oscar Munoz,, after the Committee Chairman Bill Shuster left his chair. Napolitano's questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J. McGee, the country’s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was “an excellent question because… {{right now we have}} a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations. Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but we have asked them to be bouncers, and police officers, and all kinds of other things, so {{there is no question that}} there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> training as well.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Volenti non fit injuria is Latin for [...] "to the willing, no {{injury is}} done". It {{operates}} when the claimant either expressly or implicitly consents {{to the risk}} of loss or damage. For example, if a regular spectator at an ice hockey match is injured when a player strikes the puck in the ordinary course of play, causing it to fly out of the rink and hit him or her, this is a foreseeable event and regular spectators are assumed to accept that risk of injury when buying a ticket. A slightly more limited defence may arise where the defendant has been given a warning, whether expressly to the plaintiff/claimant or by a public notice, sign or otherwise, that there is a danger of injury. The extent to which defendants can rely on notices to exclude or limit liability varies from country to country. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> policy as to whether defendants should not only warn of a known danger, but also take active steps to fence the site and take other reasonable precautions to prevent the known danger from befalling those foreseen to be at risk.|$|E
2500|$|This is in {{accordance}} with the principle of the two-state solution, first proposed in the 1980s. The mainstream within the PLO have taken the concept of territorial and diplomatic compromise seriously and have showed serious interest in this. During the 2010 talks, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said that the Palestinians and Israel have agreed on the principle of a land swap, but Israel has yet to confirm. The issue of the ratio of land Israel would give to the Palestinians in exchange for keeping settlement blocs <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> dispute, with the Palestinians demanding that the ratio be 1:1, and Israel offering less. In April 2012, Mahmoud Abbas sent a letter to Benjamin Netanyahu reiterating that for peace talks to resume, Israel must stop settlement building in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and accept the 1967 borders as a basis for a two-state solution. In May 2012, Abbas reiterated his readiness to engage with the Israelis if they propose [...] "anything promising or positive". Netanyahu replied to Abbas' April letter less than a week later and, for the first time, officially recognised the right for Palestinians to have their own state, though as before he declared {{it would have to be}} demilitarised, and said his new national unity government furnished a new opportunity to renew negotiations and move forward.|$|E
