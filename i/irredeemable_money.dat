6000|$|Although the State may not {{promise to}} pay a dollar, yet, {{wherever}} [...] such paper money carries any purchasing power with it (which has [...] very seldom happened, and then only for short periods), it will be [...] found {{that there is a}} vague popular understanding that the State [...] intends, at some time or other, to redeem the notes with value in [...] coin to some amount. In the early cases of <b>irredeemable</b> <b>money</b> in [...] our colonies, the income of taxes, or similar resources, were [...] promised as a means of redemption. To some—although a [...] slight—extent, the idea of value was associated with such paper. [...] The actual quantity issued did not measure the depreciation. The [...] paper did depreciate with increased issues. But only in so far as [...] the increased issues proved to the community that there was less [...] and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they [...] depreciate. In other words, we come to the familiar experience, [...] known to many, of a paper money depending for its value on the [...] opinions of men in the country. This was partially true, even of [...] our own greenbacks, which were not fiat money, but promises to [...] pay (although not then redeemable), as may be seen by the movement [...] of the line in Chart XII (p. 359), which represents the [...] fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war. The upward [...] movement of the line, which indicates the premium on gold during [...] our late war, of course represents correspondingly the [...] depreciation of the paper. Every victory or defeat of the Union [...] arms raised or lowered the premium on gold; it was the register of [...] the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with [...] the paper. The second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks [...] were regarded as confessions of financial distress; it was this [...] which produced the effect on their value. It was not only the [...] quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity. It [...] is, of course, clear that the value of a paper money like the [...] greenbacks, which were the promises to pay of a rich country, [...] would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued; and [...] this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on [...] the chart, showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the [...] issues increased. But the thing which weighed largely in people’s [...] minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption; and the premium [...] on gold was practically a register of the “betting” on this [...] possibility. In 1878, when Secretary Sherman’s reserve was seen to [...] be increasing to an effective amount, and when it became evident [...] that he would have the means (i.e., the value represented by all [...] the paper that was likely to be presented) to resume on the day [...] set, January 1, 1879, the premium gradually faded away. The [...] general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later [...] period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding, [...] because the contraction had been stopped in 1868, and that [...] consequent on the resumption act in May, 1878.|$|E
50|$|The {{individual}} Confederate {{states and}} other political bodies copied this policy of issuing <b>irredeemable</b> paper <b>money.</b> Alabama began by issuing $1,000,000 in notes in February 1861, and added to this amount during each subsequent session of the state legislature. The other states followed suit. Cities also sought to replenish their treasuries in the same way. Corporations and other business concerns tried to meet {{the rising tide of}} prices with the issue of their individual promissory notes intended to circulate from hand to hand.|$|R
40|$|The Paper {{provides}} a formalization of the monetary economics folk proposition that government fiat money is an asset of the holder (the private sector) {{but not a}} liability of the issuer (the state). Money is 'net wealth' in the limited sense that, after consolidation of the intertemporal budget constraints of {{the private and public}} sectors, the present value of the terminal money stock remains a component of comprehensive household wealth. The issuance of <b>irredeemable</b> fiat <b>money</b> can therefore affect consumption demand through a weak 'real balance or Pigou effect', if it can alter the present value of the terminal stock of <b>money.</b> With <b>irredeemable</b> fiat <b>money,</b> weak restrictions on the monetary policy rule suffice to rule out liquidity trap equilibria (that is, equilibria in which all current and future short nominal interest rates are at their lower bound) that are also rational expectations equilibria. Liquidity trap equilibria that are not (long run) rational expectations equilibria can exist if and {{for as long as the}} private sector has incorrect but irrefutable expectations that the monetary authorities will ultimately reverse, in present value, any current expansion of the monetary base. If 'quantitative easing' is never reversed, in present value terms, and never expected to be reversed, liquidity trap equilibria cannot occur. helicopter <b>money</b> drop; <b>irredeemable</b> money; liquidity trap; monetary policy effectiveness; zero bound...|$|R
50|$|A {{perpetuity}} is an annuity {{in which}} the periodic payments begin on a fixed date and continue indefinitely. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} a perpetual annuity. Fixed coupon payments on permanently invested (<b>irredeemable)</b> sums of <b>money</b> are prime examples of perpetuities. Scholarships paid perpetually from an endowment fit the definition of perpetuity.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} no {{estimates}} {{of the cost of}} the American war to Britain, but it did add some £25 million to the national debt. In the U.S., the cost was $105 million, about the same as the cost to Britain. The national debt rose from $45 million in 1812 to $127 million by the end of 1815, although by selling bonds and treasury notes at deep discounts—and often for <b>irredeemable</b> paper <b>money</b> due to the suspension of specie payment in 1814—the government received only $34 million worth of specie. Stephen Girard, the richest man in America at the time, personally funded the United States government involvement in the war.|$|R
