5|$|Following the {{expulsion}} of the Fatimids from Egypt, al-Ikhshid had his troops occupy all of Syria up to Aleppo, allying himself, as Ibn Tulun had done, with the local tribe of Banu Kilab to strengthen his hold over northern Syria.

Thus in 936/7 or 937/8 (most likely <b>in</b> <b>autumn</b> 937) he received an embassy from the Byzantine emperor, Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944), to organize a prisoner exchange.

The exchange took place <b>in</b> <b>autumn</b> 938, resulting in the release of 6,300 Muslims for an equivalent number of Byzantine captives.
