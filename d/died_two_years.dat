Storey <b>died</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later, three months after his eldest son Fred, and the chairmanship passed to another Samuel—Fred's elder son. In the same year, plans were laid to improve the Bridge Street premises. The work included enlarging the printing works and was completed {{by the end of}} the 1920s.|$|E
