The importance of collective bargaining can be explained by the fact that it has value for employers as well as workers - for employers, as a means of maintaining 'industrial peace'; for workers, primarily as a means of maintaining 'certain standards of distribution of work, of rewards and of stability of employment'. The qualifier 'primarily' is important: power built up in the bargaining arena enables trade unions also to engage with broader issues and exert political pressure.
