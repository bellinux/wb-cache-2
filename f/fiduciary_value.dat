40|$|The Jack Wills brand {{claims to}} be Outfitters to the Gentry. This article argues that Jack Wills’ {{marketing}} ethos institutes a means to achieve this promise. This promise is investigated as instituting a form of heraldry through its corporate program of Seasonnaires and monopolising the spaces and symbols of elite social standing for their branded products. Heraldry is concerned with making the symbols of the peers of the realm distinctive and within an exclusive set. I call this enterprise ‘fiduciary’ as the heralds are persons trusted to preserve the symbols’ sanctity. Overall I claim that the Jack Wills brand seeks this through its corporate program. Imitation-heraldry is a means to create {{the value of the}} brand as ‘fiduciary value’, community trust in the products and its worth. The ethic and politics that accompany the brand-ethos is concerned with making the name ‘Jack Wills’ come to stand as an eponymous character that embodies the social actions and unity of the social group the brand outfits. Jack Wills institutes an ethical economy that allocates the branded goods to those within the Seasonnaire economy of distribution, an economy that centres upon upholding <b>fiduciary</b> <b>value...</b>|$|E

The thesis comprises of 5 chapters. The first chapter introduces the general term of responsibility and legal liability. Second chapter focuses on liability in labor law and third chapter is already adressing liability for damage. Liability of the employee {{will be discussed in}} fourth chapter with a focus on the deficit on <b>fiduciary</b> <b>values</b> that the employee is required to bill. Based on the jurisprudence and professional articles, I will will study to which extent is right to require a liability after an employee and how and under which circumstances can be an employee released from it. In order to fulfill my aims I also analysed the chosen court judgment of the High Court of the Czech republic...|$|R
40|$|This minithesis {{entitled}} {{the implementation of}} fulfillment of creditors’ rights to the <b>fiduciary</b> guarantee <b>value</b> under the credit value in PT. BPR Berlian Bumi Arta Sleman. The purpose was to know the implementation of fulfillment of creditors’ rights to the <b>fiduciary</b> guarantee <b>value</b> that have capability to conduct it through the loaning agreement between the creditor {{in one hand and}} debtor in other hand. After the agreement was agreed, thus it established an obligation to creditor, i. e. submitting the money agreed to the debtor by rights to reaccept the money from the debtor in time. During both parties conduct their rights and obligation appropriately to the agreement, thus there will not be any case. Ordinarily, a case emerges if the debtor neglects to repay the debt in determined time. It means the debtor in a loaning agreement needs credit in the shape of property, i. e. fiduciary guarantee. Based on the aforementioned above explanation, thus it can be formulated a problem, i. e. how is the implementation of fulfillment of creditors’ right to <b>fiduciary</b> guarantee <b>value</b> of debtor under the credit value in PT. BPR Berlian Bumi Arta Sleman. The type of research was empirical research, i. e. a research focusing on the social attitude and this research needed primary data as main data as well secondary data. The method of analysis used was qualitative analysis, i. e. a research process that results analytical descriptive data, i. e. what had been stated by respondent in writing or orally and also the significant attitude being studied and investigated as whole. Based on the result of conducted research, the conclusion gained is the efforts conducted by the part of PT. BPR Berlian Bumi Arta always prioritize the familial method, e. g. requiring other guarantee as additional or the substitution on the lack of fulfillment of debtors’ obligation to PT. BPR Berlian Bumi Arta in Sleman to administratively conduct repetitive credit agreement (rescheduling, reconditioning, or restructuring) by keep on conducting re-analysis to know the debtors’ capability in order in future it can be conducted fluently appropriate to the plan in order to repay credit without bear burden to the debtor...|$|R
40|$|The virial theorem in tensor {{form for}} {{subsystems}} {{is used to}} determine equilibrium configurations of two-component, concentric and copolar, homogeneous spheroids, one completely lying within the other. Then the related total energy and angular momenta are expressed explicitly as functions of the mass ratio, m, the equatorial axis ratio, y, the polar to equatorial axis ratios, epsilonU, the rotation parameters, zetarot U, and the anisotropy parameters, zetapcc U. With assigned masses, angular momenta, total energy, rotation parameters, and anisotropy parameters, there remain three independent equations and four unknowns, i. e. equatorial semiaxes and (polar to equatorial) axis ratios. To get a unique solution, and then describe the quasi-static collapse (via energy dissipation) of the inner subsystem within the 'halo', a number of alternative additional conditions are taken into consideration. It is also argued that the true situation, involving neither homogeneous nor spheroidal halos, lies between two extreme cases. Starting from systems with coinciding boundaries and specific angular momenta, the related evolutionary sequences are derived by substantial improvement of previous attempts. Some limiting situations are also considered. An application of the theory to systems of galactic mass and plausible other parameters shows that (1) initial configurations depend on the total mass and final (with a flat inner component) configurations depend on {{the mass of the}} collapsing visible body; (2) quasi-static collapse depends mainly on the mass ratio, m, for given total masses and angular momenta, while the action of different additional conditions is negligible; (3) halos as massive as about ten visible bodies depart from the initial configuration by {{no more than a few}} percents, using different additional conditions, and yield (for <b>fiduciary</b> <b>values</b> related to the Galaxy, i. e. total mass approximately equals 1012 solar mass, total angular momentum approximately equals 1075 g sq cm per sec) final configurations related to flat visible bodies with equatorial semiaxes of about 15 kpc, close to observations...|$|R
40|$|This Article, which {{explores the}} nature of {{fiduciary}} relationships, demonstrates that these relationships arise and function {{in ways that are}} alien to contractualist thought. While the relationships may, like marriage relationships, be part of the same genus, they are indeed members of a different species. Fiduciary relationships differ both in doctrinal structure and ethical basis. However, some contractualist writing denies {{one or the other of}} these two propostitions. This Article, therefore, aims to establish that both are in fact true. The author presents that <b>fiduciary</b> relationships have <b>value</b> and serve purposes that are largely unknown to contractualists. Furthermore, these relationships facilitate the doing of justice, promote virtue, and enhance freedom in a distinctive way...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss a complex and yet not taken in consideration global public good: money. Money is a social convention created and accepted by people in order to facilitate economic transactions, being a symbol, without an intrinsic <b>value</b> (<b>fiduciary</b> money). It is universally used and it has value only in connection with the products and services that can be acquired, based on people’s consent and their psychological acceptance. In other words, its value lies in the purchasing power given by the quantity of commodities and services that can be bought with money. The authority that warrants the value of money is the central bank by supervising the money in the economy. Moreover, money can be regarded as a continuum, a constant throughout history: changeable over time and yet the same, of vital importance in people’s lives. Key words: money, global public good, social and psychological valu...|$|R
40|$|This project initiates a {{conversation}} about patient negligence and trust in the medical setting and offers a test to determine whether patient negligence {{should be considered in}} litigation. The project examines the line at which a physician’s impermissible conduct should become reasonably obvious to a patient and therefore trigger a reasonable response. Absent a reasonable response by patients, this project considers whether comparative negligence attaches. Goodwin and Richardson argue due diligence, an aspect of loyalty, is treated as a <b>value</b> <b>fiduciaries</b> owe their clients, rather than a reasonable step that clients owe themselves. In this collaboration, the authors imagine and unpack a new theory of trust; one which is animated by tort theory, and reads reasonableness and bi-directionality into the trust relationship. In setting the tone of the paper, the authors offer a brief background in tort law’s comparative negligence regime and offer an analysis of medical trust in the United States, locating contemporary reproductive monitoring in a historical context. Goodwin and Richardson consider whether the goals of established trust discourse properly and realistically align with contemporary medical problems. In this thought experiment, they begin to articulate the appropriate ex post inquiries for determining whether a patient acted reasonably in trusting her medical provider. Here, the authors propose a test that considers the patient’s competence, knowledge, prior experience, access to information, and resources to investigate. The authors argue that this test provides a more nuanced approach for ascertaining the circumstances under which it might be reasonable or unreasonable for a patient to rely on a physician’s diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss a complex and yet not taken in consideration global public good: money. Money is a social convention created and accepted by people in order to facilitate economic transactions, being a symbol, without an intrinsic <b>value</b> (<b>fiduciary</b> money). It is universally used and it has value only in connection with the products and services that can be acquired, based on people’s consent and their psychological acceptance. In other words, its value lies in the purchasing power given by the quantity of commodities and services that can be bought with money. During history, as people began to become fully aware of the importance of money for their own survival, economic growth and development, institutions were created to manage and pass the necessary rules and regulations to grant stability to the financial intermediation process. The entire process was possible because money were always perceived as a particular “asset”: to society as a whole and to each individual as well. The strength of each currency reflects the strength of the public authorities that contribute to its creation (central banks, government, and society) as well as the strength of the economy it reflects. Besides its social value, money bear psychological value for each individual, as they serve in facilitating the fulfilment of necessities, dreams, of all people could ever want or need in their lives. Moreover, money can be regarded as a constant throughout history: changeable over time and yet the same, of vital importance in people’s lives. money, global public good, social and psychological value...|$|R
