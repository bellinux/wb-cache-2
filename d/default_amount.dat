In a field experiment that was conducted on a large platform for making charitable donations over the web, we exogenously vary the default options in two distinct choice dimensions. The first pertains to the primary donation decision, namely, how much to contribute to the charitable cause. The second relates to an "add-on" decision of how much to contribute to supporting the online platform itself. We find a strong impact of defaults on individual behavior: in each of our treatments, the modal positive contributions in both choice dimensions invariably correspond to the speci ed <b>default</b> <b>amounts.</b> <b>Defaults,</b> nevertheless, have no impact on aggregate donations. This is because defaults in the donation domain induce some people to donate more and others to donate less than they otherwise would have.

40|$|Abstract. This study investigates numerically the NOx {{reduction}} by SNCR in a CO boiler. The combustion {{and fluid}} {{flow in the}} FPC CO boiler is examined with emphasis {{on the influence of}} the injection position of reducing agent on NOx reduction. Simulation results indicate that NOx is formed mainly in the high temperature region near the boiler inlet where the mixing caused by swirler is strong. Among the reducing agent injection positions investigated, the boiler inlet has the best NOx reduction efficiency, while 0. 5 m behind the boiler inlet is the worst. When reducing agent is injected from the boiler inlet, a NOx reduction efficiency of 51 % is achieved if <b>default</b> <b>amount</b> of reducing agent is injected. When reducing agent is injected from 3. 6 m behind the boiler inlet, the NOx reduction efficiency is 14 % for <b>default</b> <b>amount</b> of reducing agent. The injection position of reducing agent has a siginificant influence on the NOx reduction efficiency. Better injection positions for NOx reduction should be where reducing agent can pass through a region where temperature is suitable for the SNCR reaction or residence time of reducing agent in the SNCR reaction region can be longer, e. g., the boiler inlet or the downstream region of the oxidizer lower portion where recirculation exists...|$|E

Until now nothing in this process was done automatically so this had to change. The application is mainly focussed on managing orders and payments. The {{first part of the}} program is the orders. Here the order manager can see an overview of all the orders and their state. The user can add new orders or edit them here as well. There are two different types of orders. There are singular orders and contracts. Singular orders are simple orders that do not recur. Contracts are a bit more complex. It is possible to have a contract with the water company, for example. In this example It is known they have to be paid every month but not the exact amount. The user can select a <b>default</b> <b>amount,</b> the length of the contract and the time between payments. The program will then automatically make all the payment commitments for the time of the contract (in this example every month {{until the end of the}} contract). The contract can also be with a hotel. In this case the user has to enter all the payment commitments himself because this cannot be done automatically. The second part is the payments. Here you get an overview of all the payment commitments and when they have to be paid. Here you can add or edit a payment of a commitment. A notification system is implemented in the project as well. When an order or a payment commitment is made, the payment manager gets an email informing him/her there is something that has to be paid. It is also possible to add custom notifications. The program has to be able to store four types of documents on a server, namely an invoice, a proof of payment from the bank, a receipt from the supplier and a general proof from the entire order (if necessary). These files are transferred to the server with a WCF service. The program also has to check the privileges of the user to see what rights he has within the program. It is possible that a user is allowed to edit but not delete an order. Every action is logged and can be viewed by an admin. The admin can also change a user 2 ̆ 7 s privileges, view all documents and change the settings for the notifications...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{results and}} discussion of the investment performance of those bonds and bank loans that have defaulted on their scheduled payments to creditors and continue trading while the issuing firm attempts a financial reorganization. Monthly total return measures are compiled based on the Altman-NYU Salomon Center Indexes of Defaulted Bonds and Defaulted Banks Loans, {{as well as an}} index that combines bonds and loans. These returns are compared to the total returns of common stocks and high yield corporate bonds. Returns are based on our market-weighted indexes and presented for the past year (1999), {{as well as for the}} last 13 years (for bonds) and four years for bank loans. We also estimate the expected supply of new defaulted debt in the United States for the coming three years. Nineteen ninety-nine was a mixed year for investors in distressed debt securities. Although the Defaulted Public Bond Index increased by a respectable 11. 34 % in 1999, the positive rate of increase was mainly a function of the excellent performance over a threemonth period in the earlier part of the year (February, March and April) when the size of the index was comprised of a relatively small number of securities and when the movement of a few issues had a significant influence on the Index. Still, the positive annual performance reversed the negative annual returns that we had observed in the prior two years. On a comparative note, our Defaulted Public Bond Index’s return of 11. 34 % was slightly higher than Salomon Smith Barney’s Bankrupt Bond Index return of 8. 42 %. Defaulted bank loans did not fare as well, recording a slight increase for the year of 0. 65 %. Except for the initial year (1996) of our Bank Loan Index, performance has been lackluster in the past three years. Finally, the Combined Public Bond and Private Bank Loan Index recorded a positive annual return in 1999 of 4. 45 %, resulting in a basically flat performance over the four years of the combined index calculation period. Comparative returns for the thirteen-year period (1987 - 1999), show that common stocks strengthened its number one asset class return/risk position. High yield bonds, while performing relatively poorly in 1999 (+ 1. 7 %), maintained a slight average annual return advantage over defaulted bonds. The two “bright” or positive factors related to the defaulted bond and bank loan markets in 1999 were the enormous increase in the supply of new defaulted issues and the record low average market value to face value ratio of the Index at the end of the year. The size of the Index more than doubled in number of issues and tripled in face and market values over the past twelve months as the <b>default</b> <b>amount</b> of high yield bonds reached a record high level in 1999 and the default rate went from 1. 6 % to over 4. 0 % (see our companion report on Defaults and Returns in the High Yield Bond Market). Based on our forecast of future defaults, we expect the number and amounts of the issues in both the Bond and Bank Loan indexes to continue to grow, albeit at a lower rate, in the next three years. Going forward, we suggest that this increased supply, and the relatively low marketto-face value ratio of defaulted bonds at the end of 1999, may present significant investment opportunities. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{growth in}} the {{aviation}} industry means that with existing constraints, operational efficiency has to be improved {{in order to be}} sustainable. The bottlenecks at airports are usually the runways and consequently, the routing and scheduling decisions from the ATC pertaining to the route and order of the incoming and outgoing flights are of paramount importance. The objective of this research was to evaluate an advanced optimisation algorithm at Schiphol using publicly sourced data on different aspects, which were dual in nature, one was performance as compared to the incumbent practises and the other was fairness which dealt with the fair distribution of the decisions from the ATC for different airlines depending on cost incurred by each airline. The advanced algorithm was devised by drawing an analogy to job shop scheduling problem and solving the same using graph theory and associated (Meta) heuristics. The financial and fairness analysis was carried out through analogising game theory. The experimental design was set up through running the data through an optimisation model followed by financial analysis. The data consisted of schematics of Schiphol, so as to determine the time to traverse resources like approach air segment, glide path and runways, details of the aircraft and time of entry into the terminal control area of Schiphol along with expected time at gates. In total 49 data sets were evaluated through the model in different configurations. The configurations were as follows, 1. First Come First Serve (Incumbent) 2. Solver Scheduling 3. Solver Routing and Scheduling – the proposed algorithm 4. Equity 1 (Priority KLM) – proposed algorithm being partisan to KLM 5. Equity 2 (Priority Non- KLM) – proposed algorithm being partisan to non-KLM airlines The output was in the form of delay for individual aircraft which were then consolidated to delays for airlines. The delay(s) were the result of the decision which was based on the configuration used; this aspect was used to compare the performance of the various algorithms. Furthermore, the delay(s) for different airlines was used to analyse whether decisions which resulted in the delays are commensurate with the payments made by the airlines. The findings were quite consistent with the expected outcome of the experimental set-up. The proposed algorithm, in its normal and original state, performed the best amongst all other configurations. In all the data sets, there was improvement in the performance, by using the proposed algorithm, at a global level i. e. for the whole system as a whole. The factor of improvement from the incumbent practise depended on the initial status of the system. Having established the superior performance of the algorithm, the distribution of decision amongst airlines was analysed to establish fairness. The delays for the airlines were monetised using the value of time specific to aviation operation and the situation was analysed using a cooperative game theory approach, where airlines could agree to implement the proposed algorithm by forming a grand coalition or not agreeing thereby reverting back to the incumbent system for all. Only taking the operational cost incurred by the airlines and performance analysis conducted previously, the Shapley Value gave the fair distribution of the costs based on the marginal improvement each airline brought to the system. For all data sets, the Shapley Value was consistent and comparable to the actual costs albeit with minor inconsistencies; in some cases a few airlines paid more than what they should pay and in some cases they paid less than what they should pay. To tackle the inconsistencies a financial redistribution framework was proposed. The airlines paying less than what they should pay, contribute the <b>default</b> <b>amount</b> to a common fund and then, the money from the fund is redistributed amongst the airlines paying too much according to their Shapley Value ratio to minimise their loss. This system created a system wherein no outside interference is required and by transferring money internally, a sense of fairness could be introduced into the system. Also, this system took care of the local optimal after a global optimal had been established and in fact improved upon the global optimal. In all the data sets, the number of times an airline paid {{too much or too little}} was evenly distributed. Also, the grand coalition, wherein all the airlines agree to implement the new algorithm, was inherently stable due the game being inherently convex and the Shapley Value being present in the core. However, owing to the scale of operation of KLM, KLM could impact the performance of the whole system and actually benefitted the most from the proposed algorithm. To summarise, the proposed algorithm can be implemented to give a superior performance in terms of minimising the delay experienced by the whole airport. However, a further detailed study of the financial agreements between the airlines and Schiphol is required so as to align the actual financial transactions with that of the ideal or the fair financial transactions. Also, for any financial framework or agreement between Schiphol and various other airlines, the interests of KLM should always be taken into account since KLM is a dominant player whose individual (local) performance affects the global performance. Hence, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm is definitely an improvement over the existing system and also a sense of fairness can be introduced in the decision support system to ensure participation of all the airlines.

40|$|One {{approach}} to modelling Loss Given Default (LGD), {{the percentage of}} the <b>defaulted</b> <b>amount</b> of a loan that a lender will eventually lose is to model the collections process. This is particularly relevant for unsecured consumer loans where LGD depends both on a defaulter's ability and willingness to repay and the lender's collection strategy. When repaying such defaulted loans, defaulters tend to oscillate between repayment sequences where the borrower is repaying every period and non-repayment sequences where the borrower is not repaying in any period. This paper develops two models – one a Markov chain approach and the other a hazard rate {{approach to}} model such payment patterns of debtors. It also looks at simplifications of the models where one assumes that after a few repayment and non-repayment sequences the parameters of the model are fixed for the remaining payment and non-payment sequences. One advantage of these approaches is that they show the impact of different write-off strategies. The models are applied to a real case study and the LGD for that portfolio is calculated under different write-off strategies and compared with the actual LGD results...|$|R

The PECs were elaborated by a one-shot addition of <b>default</b> <b>amounts</b> of one counterpart to the polymer in excess. Depending {{on the nature of}} the excess polyelectrolyte, the submicrometric colloid was either positively or negatively charged. HIV- 1 capsid p 24 protein was chosen as antigen, the ultrapure form, lipopolysaccharide-free (endotoxin-, vaccine grade) was used in most experiments, as the level of purity of the protein had a great impact on the immobilization process. p 24 sorption kinetics, isotherms, and loading capacities were investigated for positively and negatively charged particles of chitosans and dextran sulfates differing in degrees of polymerization (DP) or acetylation (DA). Compared with the positive particles, negatively charged colloids had higher binding capacities, faster kinetics, and a better stability of the adsorbed p 24. Capacities up to 600 mg x g(- 1) (protein-colloid) were obtained, suggesting that the protein interacted within the shell of the particles. Small-angle X-rays scattering experiments confirmed this hypothesis. Finally, the immunogenicity of the p 24 -covered particles was assessed for vaccine purposes in mice.

Key variables of the formulation process (e. g., degree of depolymerization, charge mixing ratio, the concentration, and pH of polyelectrolyte solutions) were optimized based on the PECs sizes and polydispersities. The PECs maintained their colloidal stability at physiological salt concentration and pH thanks to the complexation of polyelectrolytes with zinc(II) ion during the nanoPECs formation process. The PECs were capable of encapsulating an antiretroviral drug tenofovir (TF) with a minimal alteration on the colloidal stability of the dispersion. Moreover, the particle interfaces could efficiently be functionalized with anti-OVA or anti-alpha 4 beta 7 antibodies with conservation of the antibody biorecognition properties over 1 week of storage in PBS at 4 degrees C. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that zinc(II) stabilized chitosan-ChonS nanoPECs were noncytotoxic to human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs), and in vitro antiviral activity test demonstrated that nanoparticles formulations led to a dose-dependent reduction of HIV- 1 infection.

40|$|The {{credit spread}} puzzle 1 Spreads on {{corporate}} bonds {{tend to be}} many times wider than what would be implied by expected default losses alone. These spreads are the difference between yields on corporate debt subject to default risk and government bonds free of such risk. 2 While credit spreads are often generally understood as the compensation for credit risk, it {{has been difficult to}} explain the precise relationship between spreads and such risk. In 1997 – 2003, for example, the average spread on BBB-rated corporate bonds with three to five years to maturity was about 170 basis points at annual rates. Yet, during the same period, the average yearly loss from <b>default</b> <b>amounted</b> to only 20 basis points. In this case, the spread was more than eight times the expected loss from default. The wide gap between spreads and expected default losses is what we call the credit spread puzzle. 3 In this article we argue that the answer to the credit spread puzzle might lie in the difficulty of diversifying default risk. Most studies to date have implicitly assumed that investors can diversify away the unexpected losses in a corporate bond portfolio. However, the nature of default risk is such that the distribution of returns on corporate bonds is highly negatively skewed. Such skewness would require an extraordinarily large portfolio to achieve full diversification. Evidence from the market for collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) indicates that in practice such large portfolios are unattainable, and thus unexpected losses are unavoidable. Hence, we argue that spreads are so wide because they are pricing undiversified credit risk. We first review the existing evidence on the determinants of credit spreads, including the role of taxes, risk premia and liquidity premia. We the...|$|R

We show that an increase in additional lending, L, could increase the probability of repayment of both the loan outstanding and L, thereby increasing the expected return of L for a given interest rate. Thus, additional lending could be provided at a lower contract interest rate, implying a downward sloping additional loan supply curve. Moreover, we show that over some regions of the additional loan supply schedule the contract interest rate could be below the risk-free rate. Debt; Lending...|$|R
5000|$|Insurance companies: Corporations such as AIG provide {{insurance}} products called credit default swaps, which {{are intended to}} protect against credit defaults, {{in exchange for a}} premium or fee. They are required to post a certain amount of collateral (e.g., cash or other liquid assets) {{to be in a position}} to provide payments in the event of <b>defaults.</b> The <b>amount</b> of capital is based on the credit rating of the insurer. Due to uncertainty regarding the financial position of the insurance company and potential risk of default events, credit agencies may downgrade the insurer, which requires an immediate increase in the amount of collateral posted. This risk-downgrade-post cycle can be circular and destructive across multiple firms and was a factor in the AIG bailout. Further, many major banks insured their mortgage-backed assets with AIG. Had AIG been allowed to go bankrupt and not pay these banks what it owed them, these institutions could have failed, causing risk to the entire financial system. Since September 2008, the U.S. government has since stepped in with $150 billion in financial support for AIG, much of which flows through AIG to the banks.|$|R
40|$|The year 2002 {{was remarkably}} {{difficult}} on many fronts for most financial markets. For the high yield bond market, {{it was again}} a year of record <b>amounts</b> of <b>defaults</b> which contributed to low recovery rates and slightly negative absolute returns. The default rate registered a massive 12. 8 %, based on $ 757 billion outstanding. Despite these record default totals and rates, the market’s decline was orderly with little panic and actually ended the year with reduced defaults and highly positive returns in the fourth quarter. <b>Default</b> <b>amounts</b> registered its fourth consecutive record year and almost topped $ 100 billion ($ 97. 9 billion) for the first time. This total was more than 52 % higher than last year’s record. Combined with a near record low recovery rate of 25 cents on the dollar, weighed down by Telecom’s average recovery rate of 16 %, loss rates from defaults reached record levels of about 10 % [...] even adjusted for fallen angel default recoveries. The pervasive influence of WorldCom’s massive default {{had a profound effect}} on both the default and recovery rates. Without WorldCom, the year’s default rate would have been 9. 27 % [...] a differential of about 3. 5 %. This report documents and comments upon the high yield bond market’s risk and return performance over the period 1971 - 2002. We will present traditional, dollar-denominated default rates as well as our own mortality rate statistics. Default rate analysis will be complemented by discussion on corporate bankruptcies and the immense impact of fallen angels on the high yield market. We conclude with our annual estimate of the size of the distressed debt market and our forecast for defaults in 2003. Our analysis will include an update on our default recovery forecasting model which was extremely accurate in estimating 2002 ’s recovery rate of about 25 %. Based on the fourth quarter’s reduction in default rate to 1. 82 % and our aging-mortality conceptual framework, we are predicting a reduction in the dollar denominated default rate to 7. 5 - 8. 0 %, as much as 5 % less than 2002 (but still far above the average rate). This should help provide a more attractive environment for high yield debt new issues and returns in 2003. In 2002, there was $ 65. 6 billion in new high yield bond issuance, down from 2001 ’s $ 88. 2 billion. We expect new issuance in 2003 to escalate unless the economic/political scene motivates another flight to quality in our financial markets. ...|$|R
5000|$|Variations in {{rules of}} Bourré abound, {{possibly}} {{due to its}} nature as a regional game. Perhaps most common is {{the introduction of a}} pot limit, which caps the total amount a single bourré or renege can cost a given player. In some games, it is common for the dealer to ante for all of the players; this simplifies trying to determine whether individuals have anteed. In a sense, the dealer is paying for his face-up trump. In this variation, for a five-person, one-dollar-ante game, the dealer of each hand would ante five dollars. A common point of dissent is whether a player who holds trumps but not the lead suit should be forced to play a trump if he cannot beat a higher trump already on the table; while consensus seems to be that the [...] "play to win" [...] rule applies, groups of players are known to require a player to play trump even though the player cannot possibly win the trick. Punishments for misplay range from simple retraction (good for new players), retraction-and-renege, or just a renege, which can lead to the misplaying individual attempting to bourré one or more other players. The <b>default</b> ante <b>amount</b> is understandably variable and the second ante is fairly common.|$|R
