5|$|The main {{tension between}} <b>fisheries</b> <b>science</b> and the fishing {{industry}} {{is that the two}} groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska {{the fishing industry}} is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it. On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.|$|E

25|$|The {{research}} Ricketts did on sardines was {{a seminal}} application of ecology to <b>fisheries</b> <b>science,</b> {{but it was}} not published as an academic paper.

This is strange, but fisheries scientists so far as they are trained do extraordinarily little ecology... I will not publish a paper on pelagics without now mentioning Ricketts”.|$|E

25|$|Virtual {{population}} analysis (VPA) is a cohort modeling technique {{commonly used in}} <b>fisheries</b> <b>science</b> for reconstructing historical fish numbers at age using information on death of individuals each year. This death is usually partitioned into catch by fisheries and natural mortality. VPA is virtual {{in the sense that}} the population size is not observed or measured directly but is inferred or back-calculated to have been a certain size in the past in order to support the observed fish catches and an assumed death rate owing to non-fishery related causes.|$|E

25|$|Sette {{at first}} {{encountered}} hostility and resistance in California, where the Chief of the State Bureau of Marine Fisheries, N.B.

Sette, however, overcame the hostility and opposition through tact and diplomacy, and his previous work in <b>fisheries</b> <b>science</b> and honesty in his dealings won over those who opposed him.|$|E
