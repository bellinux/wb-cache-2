5|$|How {{great the}} glory of Origen was, appears {{from the fact that}} Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>while.</b> Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also from the fact that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E

25|$|Bargeld left Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in 2003. In {{order to}} go on tour, the band reneged {{on the idea of}} {{creating}} a supporter-only album, and cooperated with Mute Records to go on tour and release Perpetuum Mobile in 2004. Air sounds, such as blowing the plastic pipes with an air compressor, were greatly explored and used for this album: the working title of the album was, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>while,</b> Luftveränderung ("Change of air").|$|E
25|$|The Men of the Second House first {{appeared}} in Beleriand in the Year of the Sun 312 of the First Age, crossing the Ered Luin in small parties and hiding in the woods of Thargelion, since they were unwilling to settle in Estolad with the Bëorians and Marachians.

25|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>while</b> Birkenshaw's {{performances}} for Leicestershire {{were rather}} disappointing. In his first six {{years at the}} club he never took more than 27 wickets in a season, {{and he had to}} rely on some useful lower-order contributions with the bat to keep his place in the side. He earned a place in the history books by playing (exclusively as a batsman) in the pioneering Midlands Knock-Out Cup limited-overs tournament in 1962. However, he was capped by the county in 1965, and greater success was lying ahead.|$|E
25|$|In Wallis and Futuna {{the local}} {{administrator}} and bishop sided with Vichy, but faced opposition {{from some of}} the population and clergy; their attempts at naming a local king in 1941 (to buffer the territory from their opponents) backfired as the newly elected king refused to declare allegiance to Pétain. The situation stagnated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>while,</b> due to the remoteness of the islands and because no overseas ship visited the islands for 17 months after January 1941. An aviso sent from Nouméa took over Wallis on behalf of the Free French on 27 May 1942, and Futuna on 29 May 1942. This allowed American forces to build an airbase and seaplane base on Wallis (Navy 207) that served the Allied Pacific operations.|$|E
25|$|We have {{mentioned}} that natural selection has not played its part <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>while.</b> That many inferior individuals have been conserved {{through the efforts}} of hygiene and medicine. But we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal. Or destroy sickly or defective children as we do the weaklings in a litter of puppies. The only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the strong. Our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless. We should, then, turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit. By making the strong still stronger, we could effectively help the weak; For the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite. Instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities, we should amplify them and construct greater men.|$|E

500|$|His wife Maria, who {{had been}} {{suffering}} from poor health for many years, became very ill {{in the spring of}} 1853 and died on October 27 of tuberculosis. Just before her burial, her coffin was opened so that her daughter Mabel could see her face while Lowell [...] "leaned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>while</b> against a tree weeping", according to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his wife, who were in attendance. In 1855, Lowell oversaw the publication of a memorial volume of his wife's poetry, with only fifty copies for private circulation. Despite his self-described [...] "naturally joyous" [...] nature, life for Lowell at Elmwood was further complicated by his father becoming deaf in his old age, and the deteriorating mental state of his sister Rebecca, who sometimes went a week without speaking. He again cut himself off from others, becoming reclusive at Elmwood, and his private diaries from this time period are riddled with the initials of his wife. On March 10, 1854, for example, he wrote: [...] "Dark without & within. M.L. M.L. M.L." [...] Longfellow, a friend and neighbor, referred to Lowell as [...] "lonely and desolate".|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut although she disagrees, saying: [...] "All that rubbish people said, that I created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [...] had it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>while</b> and the others copied it. I suppose {{the most important thing}} I contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E
