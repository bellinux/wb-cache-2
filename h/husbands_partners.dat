40|$|Women play an {{important}} role in the development of their families and communities economically; however, in comparison to men, they disproportionately experience barriers such as low income households, poverty, unemployment, lack of training, and discrimination. The purpose of this mini-ethnographic case study was to explore the perceptions of women entrepreneurs in Enugu State, Nigeria on what information they need to overcome possible barriers in their business and economic development. The 5 M (market, money, management, motherhood, meso, and microenvironment) framework provided the theoretical lens for this investigation. The data gathering process involved face-to-face semistructured interviews with 15 women entrepreneurs in 3 local markets in Enugu State, in addition to direct observation, field notes, and reflective journal entries. Data were inductively analyzed and then triangulated to ensure trustworthiness of findings. The major themes revealed that these women needed information in the areas of marketing, customer relations, accounting procedures, financing strategies, and formal business training to grow their businesses. Embracing the results of this research may contribute to positive social change by providing information on how small scale women entrepreneurs could reduce their dependence on their <b>husbands,</b> <b>partners,</b> and relatives...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{electronic}} {{version of an}} article published in AIDS Care. 2005 Jul; 17 (5) : 648 - 57. AIDS Care is available online at informaworldTMThis study reports the results of a cross-sectional questionnaire survey undertaken in the Kassena-Nankana district of Ghana to assess the perception and attitude of 270 antenatal clinic attendants towards voluntary counseling and HIV testing. It was found that although 92. 6 % (95 % CI 88. 8 - 95. 4) of respondents indicated a willingness to get tested, only 51 % (95 % CI 45. 0 - 57. 2) considered HIV testing for pregnant women to be useful. Most (93. 6 %) indicated they would like their <b>husbands</b> (<b>partners)</b> to know the result of the test and 52. 2 % indicated that their husbands would be willing to accompany them to antenatal clinic (ANC) at least once during the pregnancy. The perception of the usefulness of HIV testing (OR = 8. 5, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 40. 0), the willingness to disclose test result to the husband (OR = 13. 3, 95 % CI 4. 0 - 44. 5) and perceived willingness of husband to accompany wife to antenatal clinic (OR = 5. 2, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 19. 8) were found to be independent predictors of a woman's willingness to get tested. The willingness to disclose test result to husband (OR 3. 2, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 10. 5) and knowledge of at least one mode of MTCT HIV transmission (OR = 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 6) were found to be independent predictors of a woman's perception that getting tested was useful. The results suggest that for pregnant women in this district, the willingness to get tested for HIV does not equate with the perception of the test's usefulness, and that spouses are likely to exert strong influence on the attitude of pregnant women towards VCT. Couple counseling facilitated through couple-friendly ANC services should be explored as strategy for the intended VCT program in this district...|$|E

40|$|This ethnographic study {{examines}} the life histories and persisting concerns {{of women who}} once received the death sentence in the Philippines. This research examines the circumstances that led to these women 2 ̆ 7 s incarceration and sentencing and the consequences thereof for their families, particularly their children. This study also looks into {{the impact of the}} June 2006 abolition of capital punishment on their situation. The research methods for this project included participant observation with former death row inmates in the Correctional Institution for Women (CIW) and the Correctional Institution for Women-Mindanao (CIW-Mindanao). The researcher also conducted in-depth interviews with 27 women formerly on death row, nine members of their families, and eight corrections staff. Finally, the researcher engaged in document analysis of prison and dormitory rules and regulations, articles and reports on the death penalty and incarcerated women in the Philippines, and other pertinent sources. The majority of the inmate-respondents were incarcerated for kidnapping and drug-related offenses. A smaller proportion of the women were incarcerated for such crimes as: parricide (killing their husbands), murder, car theft with murder, and arson with homicide. Only 10 women pleaded guilty; of this, two women charged with parricide claimed that they had killed their husbands in self-defense or in response to their in-laws 2 ̆ 7 abuse of their children. The remainder claimed that they had been implicated in the offenses of their <b>husbands,</b> <b>partners,</b> relatives, and/or acquaintances or framed up by more powerful players in the drug trade, drug users negotiating a lighter sentence, law enforcement agents, and members of organized crime syndicates. The majority also reported police brutality and/or extortion upon their arrest. When asked about their time on death row, the majority of the women recalled their fear and outrage when they were sentenced to death [...] especially those who insisted on their innocence [...] and their inability to eat, sleep, and concentrate shortly after their transfer from jail to prison. The women largely acknowledged the moral support of their fellow death row inmates. Others recounted the stigma they faced as death row inmates. All the women mentioned the sense of relief and hope they felt upon the abolition of capital punishment. The women 2 ̆ 7 s sentences have since been commuted to life imprisonment without parole. The only exceptions are those whose sentences were commuted to regular life imprisonment terms before the abolition of the death penalty. There {{is a great deal of}} confusion among the women as regards the terms of their new sentence, in that many assume that they are automatically eligible for parole. To date, no sociological studies on women formerly on death row, let alone women inmates, have been conducted in the Philippines, thereby reinforcing their invisibility. This research intends to make women formerly on death row more visible and to advocate for continued reforms in the criminal justice system on their behalf...|$|E
40|$|Retrospect {{website and}} radio series The Retrospect website {{is part of}} a larger {{collaborative}} research project that aims to collect and present the stories of contemporary Australian veterans and their families. These stories reflect the ways digital communication has largely replaced the letters and diaries that servicemen and women of earlier generations used to share their experiences with their and record their memories. Retrospect also features a series of six half-hour documentaries, produced and broadcast by ABC RN’s Features and Documentaries Unit, which are available for download from March 20, 2015. The Retrospect website represents a creative partnership across a number of areas of the ABC. It was produced and developed by a team based in ABC Radio Multiplatform and Development in collaboration with ABC RN’s Features and Documentaries Unit, and draws extensively on the ABC’s vast archives collection. The website combines audio interviews with six veterans of Operation Slipper in Afghanistan (2001 - 2014) and their families with commissioned portraits by the renowned war photographer Stephen Dupont and remarkable video shot on location (originally for ABC TV’s Four Corners program) in Afghanistan by award-winning ABC cinematographer Neale Maude. An original music score was commissioned from composer Oonagh Sherrardand performed by an ensemble of fine musicians, including performers from Sydney’s Afghan community. Veterans also share their own videos and photos to create a unique and nuanced portrayal of how war is experienced – and remembered – by army personnel and their families in the digital era. The audio interviews were conducted with the veterans and their families at their homes at locations across Australia by ABC Radio producer and historian Michelle Rayner. These many hours of interviews form the foundation of the landmark six-part documentary series, broadcast over six days on ABC RN from March 20, 2015. The Retrospect research project Retrospect forms the foundation of a living archive of memories from Australia’s longest war. It takes us beyond the news headlines and gives voice to those who have experienced war in the field and how this has impacted on their family life. The website and radio series are only the first stage of a major Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage-funded research project investigating and prototyping new digital forms of war memorial. The next stage of the project is an interactive cinema screening at the UNSW iCinema Centre. This is planned to launch on Armistice Day, November 11, 2015. Further developments will include the establishment of an expansive, interactive database accessible to both specialist researchers and the veteran community. The Retrospect Research project is a collaboration between the University of New South Wales and ABC Radio, involving researchers from UNSW iCinema Research Centre and at the School of Humanities and Social Science as well as UNSW Canberra. Additional support comes from the Australia Council for the Arts and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). War, family and memory ‘It was only after a matter of hours of them being back in the country, they wished that they were back over there [in Afghanistan] because that had become the norm. You had to really not take it to heart that they were calling someone else their family. ’ Bev Murray, mother of Corporal Tyson Murray, High Risk Search Team Defence personnel have mothers and fathers, wives and <b>husbands,</b> <b>partners</b> and children. And the services themselves become another kind of family. One of the unique aspects of the Retrospect website and radio series, and of the wider Retrospect Research Project, is that it takes as its starting point the fact that military service has an impact on both defence personnel and their families; that the experience of war involves a two-way relationship, with each one supporting and affecting the other. As a consequence, military service involves two sets of interacting stories and memories. Retrospect addresses these intersecting experiences for the first time. One of the recurring themes of the stories told by veterans and their families in Retrospect is the extent to which veterans find themselves attached to two families: the army family and their family back in Australia. The dominant image of a veteran – especially as the series of World War I centenaries approach – is of an elderly man in a slouch hat. The common picture that springs to mind when the word ‘veteran’ is used, is seldom of a mother with four young children, who also has vivid memories of her experiences as a pilot of Chinook helicopters, flying across the deserts of Afghanistan. A woman who was simultaneously a military pilot and a mother, whose story of war is also the story of her family. Yet this is the modern reality of war, where home life and life on the front are intimately interconnected. How can these experiences be shared and remembered across generations and the wider community? What is the window into this world? Retrospect is the start of a conversation about the stories and memories of contemporary veterans and their families in the digital era...|$|E
