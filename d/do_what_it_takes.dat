She thinks she loves Riley and will <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. I want to see what happens when they don't..." ...|$|E
