25|$|The {{capacitance}} C {{increases with}} the area A of the plates and with the permittivity ε of the dielectric material and decreases with the plate separation distance d. The capacitance is therefore greatest in devices made from materials with a <b>high</b> <b>permittivity,</b> large plate area, and small distance between plates.|$|E

25|$|Ceramic {{capacitors}} class 2 {{have much}} higher capacitance values {{in a given}} case than class 1 capacitors because of their much <b>higher</b> <b>permittivity.</b>|$|R

25|$|Polyvinylidene {{fluoride}} (PVDF) {{has a very}} <b>high</b> <b>permittivity</b> of 18 to 20, {{which allows}} large amounts of energy to be stored in a small space (volumetric efficiency). However, it has a Curie temperature of only 60nbsp&°C, which limits its usability. Film capacitors with PVDF are described for one very special application, in portable defibrillators.|$|E
25|$|However, the <b>high</b> <b>permittivity</b> {{supports}} high capacitance {{values in}} small devices. Class 2 capacitors are significantly smaller than class 1 devices at the equal rated capacitance and voltage. They {{are suitable for}} applications that require the capacitor to maintain only a minimum value of capacitance, for example, buffering and filtering in power supplies and coupling and decoupling of electric signals.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, {{capacitance}} C is {{greatest in}} capacitors made from materials with a <b>high</b> <b>permittivity</b> ε, large electrode plate surface areas A and small distance between plates d. As a result, double-layer capacitors have much higher capacitance values than conventional capacitors, {{arising from the}} extremely large surface area of activated carbon electrodes and the extremely thin double-layer distance {{on the order of}} a few ångströms (0.3-0.8nm), of order of the Debye length.|$|E

25|$|Class 3 {{barrier layer}} or semiconductive ceramic {{capacitors}} have very <b>high</b> <b>permittivity,</b> up to 50,000 {{and therefore a}} better volumetric efficiency than class 2 capacitors. However, these capacitors have worse electrical characteristics, including lower accuracy and stability. The dielectric is characterized by very high nonlinear change of capacitance over the temperature range. The capacitance value additionally depends on the voltage applied. As well, they have very high losses and age over time.|$|E
25|$|Class 2 ceramic {{capacitors}} have a dielectric with a <b>high</b> <b>permittivity</b> {{and therefore}} a better volumetric efficiency than class 1 capacitors, but lower accuracy and stability. The ceramic dielectric {{is characterized by a}} nonlinear change of capacitance over the temperature range. The capacitance value also depends on the applied voltage. They are suitable for bypass, coupling and decoupling applications or for frequency discriminating circuits where low losses and high stability of capacitance are less important. They typically exhibit microphony.|$|E
25|$|In electromagnetism, {{permittivity}} or absolute permittivity, usually {{denoted by}} the Greek letter ε (epsilon), {{is the measure}} of resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field in a particular medium. More specifically, permittivity describes the amount of charge needed to generate one unit of electric flux in a particular medium. Accordingly, a charge will yield more electric flux in a medium with low permittivity than in a medium with <b>high</b> <b>permittivity.</b> Thus, permittivity is the measure of a material's ability to resist an electric field, not its ability to ‘permit’ it (as the name ‘permittivity’ might seem to suggest).|$|E
40|$|A novel two-layer stacked {{wideband}} dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) of rectangular {{shape is}} proposed. The DRA {{is composed of}} a dielectric resonator (DR) and a thin dielectric segment, which reside above a ground plane, and is excited by a small metallic patch connected to a coaxial probe.

40|$|A Bragg {{resonator}} uses dielectric plates {{within a}} metallic cavity to confine the energy within a central free space region. The {{importance of the}} permittivity is shown with a better Q-factor possible using <b>higher</b> <b>permittivity</b> materials of larger intrinsic dielectric losses. This is because the electric energy in the reflectors decreases proportionally to the square root of permittivity and the coupling to the metallic losses decrease linearly. In a sapphire resonator with a single reflector pair a Q-factor of 2. 34 x 10 ^ 5 is obtained, which may be improved on by up to a factor of 2 using <b>higher</b> <b>permittivity</b> materials...|$|R

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, some Japanese manufacturers started the development of a new, low-ohmic water-based class of electrolytes. Water, with its <b>high</b> <b>permittivity</b> of ε = 81, is a powerful solvent for electrolytes, and possesses high solubility for conductivity-enhancing concentrations of salt ions, resulting in significantly improved conductivity compared to electrolytes with organic solvents like GBL. But water will react quite aggressively and even violently with unprotected aluminum, converting metallic aluminum (Al) into aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3), via a highly exothermic reaction that gives off heat, causing gas expansion that can lead to an explosion of the capacitor. Therefore, the main problem in the development of water-based electrolytes is achieving long-term stability by hindering the corrosive action of water on aluminum.|$|E
500|$|When {{dielectric}} resonators {{are made}} from a <b>high</b> <b>permittivity</b> material, such {{as one of the}} barium titanates, they have an important space saving advantage compared to cavity resonators. [...] However, they are much more prone to spurious modes. [...] In high-power applications, metal layers may be built into the resonators to conduct heat away since dielectric materials tend to have low thermal conductivity.|$|E
2500|$|Class 2 {{capacitors}} {{are made}} of ferroelectric materials such as barium titanate (...) and suitable additives such as aluminium silicate, magnesium silicate and aluminium oxide. These ceramics have high to very <b>high</b> <b>permittivity</b> (200 to 14,000), which depends on the field strength. Hence the capacitance value of class 2 capacitors is nonlinear. It depends on temperature and voltage applied. Additionally class 2 capacitors age over time.|$|E
50|$|Microwave {{technology}} utilises the <b>higher</b> <b>permittivity</b> {{of water}} than hydrocarbons {{to detect the}} overall water fraction in the liquid and gas phases. As it only detects and measures the water component, the liquid hydrocarbon component must be measured by another method.|$|R
25|$|The <b>higher</b> <b>permittivity</b> {{resulted}} in much higher capacitance values, {{but this was}} coupled with relatively unstable electrical parameters. Therefore, these ceramic capacitors only could replace the commonly used mica capacitors for applications where stability was less important. Smaller dimensions, {{as compared to the}} mica capacitors, lower production costs and independence from mica availability accelerated their acceptance.|$|R
25|$|The {{volume of}} an {{electrolytic}} capacitor {{is defined by}} the product of capacitance and voltage, the so-called CV-volume. However, in comparing the permittivities of different oxide materials, it is seen that tantalum pentoxide has an approximately 3 times <b>higher</b> <b>permittivity</b> than aluminum oxide. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors of a given CV value can therefore be smaller than aluminum electrolytic capacitors.|$|R
2500|$|A {{tantalum}} electrolytic capacitor, {{a member}} of the family of electrolytic capacitors, [...] is a polarized capacitor whose anode electrode (+) is made of tantalum on which a very thin insulating oxide layer is formed, which acts as the dielectric of the capacitor. A solid or liquid electrolyte which covers the surface of the oxide layer serves as the second, cathode electrode (−) of the capacitor. Because of its very thin and relatively <b>high</b> <b>permittivity</b> dielectric layer, the tantalum capacitor distinguishes itself from other conventional and electrolytic capacitors in having high capacitance per volume (high volumetric efficiency) and lower weight.|$|E
