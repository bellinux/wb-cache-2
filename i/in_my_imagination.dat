500|$|During this {{intercourse}} I {{perceived the}} superiority of Miss Honora Sneyd's capacity ... her sentiments were on all subjects so just and were delivered with such blushing modesty though not without an air of conscious worth as to command attention from every one capable of appreciating female excellence. Her person was graceful her features beautiful and their expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing she said. I was six and twenty and {{now for the first}} time in my life I saw a woman that equalled the picture of perfection which existed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>imagination.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lawrence Morton, in a {{study of}} the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's {{collection}} Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is [...] "Yarila" [...] which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: [...] "The likeness is too close to be coincidental". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music {{rather than the other way}} round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: [...] "One day , when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision... I saw <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>imagination</b> a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps".|$|E

2500|$|The main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, but I am {{at least}} 50 percent {{responsible}} because I did it. I {{was not so}} politically minded in those days as I am now. You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which {{you say that the}} intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale– definitely. But I was very interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture– thought it was silly and stupid– then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures—should I say now that I like Metropolis because something I have seen <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>imagination</b> comes true, when I detested it after it was finished? ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{my young}} days... I had been {{attracted}} {{to the idea of}} pure creativity, taking the form of abstract art.... I derived ideas for my abstract studies from life around me. I would look at a man, a house, a plant, at intricate machinery, extravagant shadowscapes on walls or ceilings, at quivering bonfire flames, and would compose them into abstract pictures, creating <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>imagination</b> visions that were not like actual reality.... Fortunately I soon realised that it was not given to me, a human being, to create from 'nothing', in the way only God can create. I realised that everything that I created was conditioned by what was already in existence. I could not invent a new colour or line that had never existed anywhere before. An abstract picture is like a string of words, beautiful and sonorous in themselves, perhaps, but never expressing a complete thought..."—Preface to St Silouan the Athonite ...|$|E
2500|$|After Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn died in 1950, his son-in-law, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, {{soon became}} the seventh Rebbe. The Rebbe was a passionate {{believer in the}} coming of the mashiach. In a letter to Israeli President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Schneerson wrote: [...] "From the time that I was a child {{attending}} Cheder, and even before, the vision of the future Redemption began to take form <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>imagination</b> -- the Redemption of the Jewish people from their final Exile, a redemption of such magnitude and grandeur through which the purpose of the suffering, the harsh decrees, and annihilation of Exile will be understood." [...] Rabbi Schneerson also encouraged people to focus on Messiah very much. Beginning with his very first farbrengen as Rebbe, he spoke of this generation's mission to complete the Dira Betachtonim, and urged everyone to do all within their power to help the world reach its ultimate state of perfection, when Godliness and goodness will be naturally apparent and prevalent, with the final redemption.|$|E
60|$|What {{he offers}} upon this head is so very amazing from a Christian, a clergyman, and a prelate of the Church of England, that I must <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>imagination</b> strip him {{of those three}} capacities, and put him among the number of that set of men he {{mentions}} in the paragraph before; or else {{it will be impossible}} to shape out an answer.|$|R
60|$|But I saw {{his face}} at that moment {{in the light of}} a small tallow dip, and in it was none of the {{confidence}} that was in his voice.

2500|$|In {{the film}} adaptations, Flitwick is portrayed by Warwick Davis. Rowling said: [...] "I must admit, I {{was taken aback}} when I saw the film Flitwick, who {{looks very much like}} a goblin/elf (I’ve never {{actually}} asked the film-makers precisely what he is), because the Flitwick <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>imagination</b> simply looks like a very small old man." [...] However, Rowling mentions on her official website that Flitwick is human, with [...] "a dash of goblin ancestry." [...] His on-screen appearance changes noticeably in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, in which he takes on a more human and less elf-like look, with slicked-down dark hair and moustache. According to Davis, the moustachioed character was originally not supposed to be Flitwick; Flitwick was absent from the script for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but [...] "the producer" [...] (presumably David Heyman) added the new character (as the conductor of the school choir and orchestra, credited as [...] "Choir Master") so that Davis could still appear in the film. Goblet of Fire director Mike Newell preferred the new look, [...] "and from that moment, the character became known as 'Flitwick'." ...|$|E

5000|$|When a photo {{triggers}} something <b>in</b> me - <b>my</b> <b>imagination</b> perhaps - I {{feel that}} I am offered {{a chance to}} reinterpret the visual image, or I am inspired to create an alternative reality by integrating the photo with other media, materials, and objects.

Not only the boy's own answers to your questions, but even a chance expression that dropped from the schoolmaster's lips in explaining his story, have forced the idea back into my mind.

60|$|Next I {{remembered the}} self-wounded Greek, sewed up by Mr. Pike and lying gibbering between the steel {{walls of the}} 'midship-house. This picture almost decided me, for <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fevered <b>imagination</b> he typified the whole mad, helpless, idiotic crew. Certainly I {{could go back to}} Baltimore. Thank God I had the money to humour my whims. Had not Mr. Pike told me, in reply to a question, that he {{estimated}} the running expenses of the Elsinore at two hundred dollars a day?

60|$|The next morning, {{aided by}} Scipio, I made my toilet with rather more care than usual, and descended {{the stairs with}} some trepidation, eager to see the {{original}} of the portrait which had been so completely pictured <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>imagination.</b>|$|E

60|$|This process only stifled {{the family}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>imagination</b> for a time.

60|$|I think Emily {{never looked}} more {{beautiful}} than she did while listening to this arrangement. It doubtless relieved her mind on the painful subject of her father's health, and I fancied it relieved it also {{on the subject of}} our own immediate separation. Months must elapse before we could reach St. Helena; and who could foresee what those months might bring forth? As I had a good deal to do at such a moment, I took my leave, with my feelings lightened, as it might be, of a burthen. The reader will at once infer, I was in love. But he will be mistaken. I was not <b>in</b> love; though <b>my</b> <b>imagination,</b> to use a cant phrase of some of the sects, was greatly exercised. Lucy, even then, had a hold of <b>my</b> heart <b>in</b> a way of which I was ignorant myself; but it was not in nature for a youth, just approaching his majority, to pass months and months, almost alone, in the society of a lovely girl who was a year or two his junior, and not admit some degree of tenderness towards her in big feelings. The circumstances were sufficient to try the constancy of the most faithful swain that ever lived. Then, it must be remembered that I had never professed love to Lucy--was not at all aware that she entertained any other sentiment towards me than that she entertained towards Rupert; whereas Emily-- but I will not prove myself a coxcomb on paper, whatever I might have been, at the moment, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>imagination.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{place or}} field, for me, is {{a sea of}} glowing parrot-green {{seedlings}} of rice––planted, transplanted,harvested, threshed, scattering into the air, rays of light and rice-dust, bouncing lightly on the ground before being swept into jute bags, loaded up on oxen carts, ready for the market––in Tamil, the word which overlaps this semantic space of “field ” is vayal (paddy field) 1. There is a different sense of the post-field for someone like me, as these rice fields reside <b>in</b> <b>my</b> memory, long before I have arrived back there, a returned child from the capital city, and long after I have left them, back to the cosmopolitan.

2500|$|Although her novels {{typically}} {{concentrate on}} black women, Morrison does not identify her works as feminist. When {{asked in a}} 1998 interview [...] "Why distance oneself from feminism?" [...] she replied: [...] "In order to be as free as I possibly can, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>imagination,</b> I can't take positions that are closed. Everything I've ever done, in the writing world, has been to expand articulation, rather than to close it, to open doors, sometimes, not even closing the book – leaving the endings open for reinterpretation, revisitation, a little ambiguity." [...] She went on to state that she thought it [...] "off-putting to some readers, who may feel that I'm involved in writing some kind of feminist tract. I don't subscribe to patriarchy, and I don't {{think it should be}} substituted with matriarchy. I think it's a question of equitable access, and opening doors to all sorts of things." ...|$|R
60|$|That the old man-at-arms {{should have}} exerted a strong {{attraction}} upon my young mind, you will readily understand.

60|$|I cannot {{trace the}} {{development}} of my ideas at Cambridge, but I believe the mere physical fact of going two hours' journey away from London gave that place {{for the first time}} an effect of unity <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>imagination.</b> I got outside London.

5000|$|Lipton {{created a}} project within the Actors Studio Drama School: a non-credit class called Inside the Actors Studio (1994), where {{successful}} and accomplished actors, directors and writers would be interviewed and would answer questions from acting students. These sessions are also taped and broadcast on television {{for the general}} public to see. The episodes are viewed in 89 million homes throughout 125 countries. Lipton hosts the show and conducts the main interview. During an interview with Daniel Simone, author of The Lufthansa Heist, when asked if he had anticipated the sudden success, Lipton responded, [...] "Not <b>in</b> <b>my</b> wildest <b>imaginations.</b> It was a joint, arduous effort involving many people. At a point and time not too distant in the past, I had three lives. I was the dean of the Actors Studio, the writer of the series, its host and executive producer.

60|$|I {{put out the}} light, {{and tried}} to force myself to sleep;--all in vain! The fire gleaming up a little, threw an {{uncertain}} light about the room, leaving, however, {{the region of the}} picture in deep shadow. What, thought I, if this be the chamber about which mine host spoke as having a mystery reigning over it?--I had taken his words merely as spoken in jest; might they have a real import? I looked around. The faintly lighted apartment had all the qualifications requisite for a haunted chamber. It began <b>in</b> <b>my</b> infected <b>imagination</b> to assume strange appearances. The old portraits turned paler and paler, and blacker and blacker; the streaks of light and shadow thrown among the quaint old articles of furniture, gave them singular shapes and characters. There was a huge dark clothes-press of antique form, gorgeous in brass and lustrous with wax, that began to grow oppressive to me.|$|R
