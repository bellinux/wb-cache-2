"Well, be <b>he</b> <b>right</b> or be he wrong, it were {{easier to}} make the Glommen run up the fells than to alter the King's determination; {{and it seems to}} me that it behoves every man who loves his country, and would spare further bloodshed, to submit to what is inevitable." ...|$|E

60|$|The chief {{merit of}} Madame Bovary {{is not the}} moral lesson {{that can be found}} in it, any more than the chief merit of Salammbo is its archaeology; but Flaubert was {{perfectly}} right in exposing the ignorance of those who called the one immoral and the other inaccurate; and not merely was <b>he</b> <b>right</b> in the ordinary sense of the word, but he was artistically right, which is everything. The critic has to educate the public; the artist has to educate the critic.|$|E

Of course it is. Any ensign in a marching {{regiment}} could tell us that from his mere sense of soldier's honour. But then-if she is wrong, is <b>he</b> <b>right?</b> How do I know? I want reasons: he gives me historic authorities." ...|$|E
