5|$|J.E.B. Stuart {{deprived}} Lee of cavalry intelligence {{during a}} <b>good</b> <b>part</b> {{of the campaign}} by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the meeting engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent {{for the failure of}} the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Mathias Brugman (1811–1868) {{was the son}} of Pierre Brugman from Curaçao of Dutch-Jewish ancestry and Isabel Duliebre from Puerto Rico. His parents met {{and married}} in New Orleans, Louisiana where Brugman was born, raised and educated. The Brugman family moved to Puerto Rico and settled in the City of Mayagüez where Brugman met and married Ana Maria Laborde. He opened a colmado (grocery store) and became rather successful, only to lose a <b>good</b> <b>part</b> of his fortune {{attempting}} to grow coffee. Like many other residents of Puerto Rico at the time, he resented the political injustices practiced by Spain on the island. This led him to become a believer in the cause of the Puerto Rican independence movement.|$|E

Yet the number of FPY units of each process counts only those that made it through the process as <b>good</b> <b>parts</b> that needed no rework to be <b>good</b> <b>parts.</b> The calculation of RTY, rolling throughput yield, shows how good the overall set of processes is at producing good overall output without having to rework units.|$|R
