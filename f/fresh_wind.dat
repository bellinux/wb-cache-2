25|$|On April 30, 1603, a {{fire started}} {{in a little}} field house used by some Filipinos and Negroes of the native {{hospital}} in the city, at {{three o'clock in the}} afternoon, and passed to other houses so quickly, with the force of the rather <b>fresh</b> <b>wind,</b> that it could not be stopped. It burned houses of wood and stone, even the monastery of St. Dominic, the royal hospital for the Spaniards, and the royal warehouses, without leaving a building standing among them. Fourteen people died in the fire, Spaniards, Filipinos and Negroes, among them Licentiate Sanz, canon of the cathedral. In all 260 houses were burned, with much property that was in them. The damage was estimated at more than one million pesos.|$|E
2500|$|Fearing that Congress might {{consider}} confining all American ships to port, {{as soon as}} Rodgers received news of the declaration of war in June, he departed New York harbor with his squadron within the hour. In anticipation of the war, Rodgers had already had his squadron fitted and ready to embark on the high seas. Their first objective was a British fleet reported to have recently departed from the West Indies, and Rodgers set a course south-east in search of these ships. President passed Sandy Hook on June 21. In the early morning of the 23rd a ship was spotted on the horizon to the north-east {{which turned out to}} be the frigate HMS Belvidera, commanded by Captain Richard Byron. Rodgers immediately gave chase, with Congress following close behind. Belvidera had already been informed of the inevitability of war by a passing New York pilot boat and immediately turned about, crowded on all sails and began flight to the north-east with a <b>fresh</b> <b>wind</b> behind all ships coming from the west.|$|E

60|$|The {{afternoon}} was calm. A thunderstorm that wet the streets had gone, and an enervating damp heat brooded over the city. After the <b>fresh</b> <b>winds</b> that sweep {{the woods and}} plains, Lister felt the languid air made him slack and dull. His steamer did not sail until daybreak, and since he had gone up the mountain and seen the cathedral and Notre Dame, {{he did not know}} what to do. The bench he occupied was in the shade, and he smoked and looked about.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} for PopMatters, Sean Murphy notes that [...] "What Saft manages {{to do on}} Fight Against Babylon is create an organic ambiance and, without any in-the-studio sorcery or clever {{manipulation}} (strategies he has already showcased on the aforementioned efforts), establish a deep, utterly pleasant groove". On All About Jazz, Eyal Hareuveni, said [...] "producer and multi-instrumentalist Jamie Saft's New Zion Trio debut recording succeeds in blowing <b>fresh</b> <b>winds</b> in the traditional piano trio with dub aesthetics, citing King Tubby, Bob Marley, Bill Evans, Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane as influences".|$|R
60|$|The {{monoplane}} curved about, and the keen <b>fresh</b> <b>wind</b> {{cut across}} Graham's {{face and his}} garment lugged at his body as the stem pointed round to the west. The two men looked into each other's eyes.|$|E

60|$|And {{out there}} our heart watches--though Palermo is near us, just behind. We look round, {{and see it}} all behind us--but already it is gone, gone from our heart. The <b>fresh</b> <b>wind,</b> the gleamy wisps of light, the running, open sea beyond the harbour bars.|$|E
6000|$|The invigorating air {{did them}} both good, and much {{exercise}} worked wholesome changes in minds {{as well as}} bodies.

The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts. The lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying, [...] "Little children, love one another." ...|$|R
50|$|A safe jibe can be {{aided by}} {{tensioning}} the boom vang (kicking strap) {{to prevent the}} boom from lifting. In <b>fresh</b> <b>winds,</b> sailing nearly directly downwind briefly {{before and after the}} jibe and making only a small direction changes will produce less heeling force and reduce the tendency to round-up. In heavier gusts, the crew or skipper can sheet the boom in and force the boom across the boat by hand, holding the boom in position by locking the traveler or using a preventer. After the jibe has been completed, the course can then be changed to higher points of sail.|$|R

60|$|Captain Nicholl frankly {{admitted}} {{that in this}} uncharted ocean he {{had no knowledge of}} any near land.

60|$|All {{day they}} rode. Toward noon {{they left the}} sunny prairie land of {{northern}} Illinois and southern Wisconsin, and entered upon the hill land of Madison and beyond.

60|$|There was a <b>fresh</b> {{westerly}} <b>wind,</b> so by {{the time}} the sun was fairly through the morning haze, the ship was hull down from the islands. The decrepit Governor still limped the deck, with one guiding hand upon the quarter-rail.|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper offers}} a fresh {{perspective}} from the South about {{the relevance of}} progressive Latin American public health (termed ‘collective health’) by highlighting a number of its hard scientific contributions which, unfortunately, remain almost unknown to mainstream medical and public health researchers outside Latin America.
