5|$|B. katerinae {{is named}} after G.Beaton's wife, the senior author of the 1982 protologue. It was first {{discovered}} in 1964, <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seed follicles of dead cones of Banksia ornata in the Mount Zero Area in the Grampians in northwestern Victoria.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, English mycologists Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome {{described}} {{a species of}} fungus they named Tympanis toomansis, collected from dead infructescences ("cones") of Banksia <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banks of the Tooma River in southern New South Wales, Australia. Its generic placement {{was a result of}} its resemblance to Tympanis, a genus in the family Helotiaceae of the Ascomycota.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first {{vascular}} plant was found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has been closely studied, the vascular plants in particular {{as they have been}} of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and fungi in the development of vegetation.|$|E

[...] "I do not think ANY minister's son would eat {{blueberries}} that <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> graves of dead people. You know it would not be so bad, Mrs. Dr. dear, to eat things that <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dyke." ...|$|R
50|$|This plant <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Front Range in Colorado. It <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Niobrara, Pierre, Fountain, Ingleside, and Lykins Formations. The {{soils are}} {{limestone}}, limestone shale, or red sandstone. The habitat is shrubland dominated by Rhus trilobata and Cercocarpus montanus.|$|R
50|$|It <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clay soils of deserts.|$|R
5|$|The many {{inhabitants}} of the tidal flats include lugworms, polychaete worms, sand hoppers and other amphipod crustaceans, and gastropod molluscs. These molluscs feed on the algae <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of the mud, and include the tiny Hydrobia, an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000m−2. Bivalve molluscs include the edible common cockle, {{although it is not}} harvested here.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} a broad {{distribution}} in forested areas of North America and Europe. A saprobic fungus, it derives nutrients from decaying organic matter, {{and as such}} is usually found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stumps and logs of fallen deciduous trees. However, it is also found {{on a variety of}} living trees as well. For example, in Europe it has been found on the stems of living spruce (Picea abies) in Finland, France, Great Britain, Norway, and Germany.|$|E

5|$|Amanita onusta, {{commonly}} known as the loaded Lepidella or the gunpowder Lepidella, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family of mushrooms. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruit bodies that have white to pale gray caps crowded with roughly conical, pyramidal, or irregular gray warts. The stipe is whitish-gray with woolly or wart-like veil remnants, and at the base is a spindle- or turnip-shaped base that is rooted somewhat deeply in the soil. The species is distributed in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia to Mexico, and may be found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground in deciduous forests, particularly those with oak, hickory and chestnut. Fruit bodies smell somewhat like bleaching powder, and their edibility is unknown, but possibly toxic.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground in mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes {{the roots of the}} trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E
5|$|Bisporella citrina is saprobic, and so obtains {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down complex organic molecules into simpler ones. Fruit bodies are typically encountered growing in dense clusters {{on the surface}} of rotten wood (especially deciduous trees), particularly beech. They have also been found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fruit bodies of the polypore fungus Daedaleopsis confragosa. In a study of the succession of fungi associated with the decay of a 120-year-old healthy beech tree uprooted by strong winds, B.citrina was found on the wood about three years after the fall. It appeared after early colonizers such as Quaternaria quaternata, Tubercularia vulgaris (the anamorph form of Nectria cinnabarina), and Bulgaria inquinans, and was followed by Stereum hirsutum and Nectria cinnabarina.|$|E

5|$|E.J.H. Corner {{defined the}} {{varieties}} M.inclinata var. kinabaluensis and var. subglobospora in his 1994 publication on Agaric mushrooms of Malesia, a biogeographical region straddling {{the boundary of}} the Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones. The variety kinabaluensis (named after its type locality, Kinabalu) has a cap margin that is not scalloped, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dead wood of Lithocarpus havilandii, a stone oak tree in the beech family. Variety subglobospora, found in Sabah, has spores that are almost spherical.|$|E
5|$|Hapalopilus nidulans has {{a mostly}} circumboreal {{distribution}} in the north temperate zone, and {{has been found in}} North Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Outside of this region, it has been recorded from Australia, and Oceania. In North America, where it can be found as far north as the Northwest Territories in Canada, it is more common in the eastern and southwestern part of the continent. In Europe, its northern distribution extends to Porsanger in Norway. Reported for the first time from India in 2011, it was found in forests depots of Chhattisgarh, <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stored logs of several native trees: Anogeissus latifolia, Chloroxylon swietenia, Desmodium oojeinense, Shorea robusta, and Terminalia elliptica.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckii is an {{inedible}} (though not toxic) fungus, and {{a member}} of the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that hang from the undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species, and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of coniferous trees, <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.|$|E

50|$|It <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rocky hillsides, and on alpine meadows.|$|R
5|$|Like {{all species}} {{remaining}} in the genus Collybia, C.cirrhata is saprobic, and is typically found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms; occasionally the fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms, although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue—possibly from a previous season—has decayed {{to such an extent}} that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate. Known hosts include Lactarius, Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Bovista dermoxantha.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, {{as well as the}} wood of other flowering plants. The species favours the trunks of trees, where it feeds as a saprotroph, causing white rot. P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations in the color and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E
50|$|It <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rocky mountain-sides {{with other}} small shrubs.|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the native flora of Compton Bay, a variety of hardy plants <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> down. Large European gorse bushes <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cliff, with the shelter they provide {{allowing}} other plants such as wild cabbage and bird's foot trefoil to thrive. Due to the strong prevailing wind from the English channel to the west, no large trees are able to <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> down, allowing shrubs and grasses to thrive. The Isle of Wight's county flower, the pyramidal orchid, also grows here, along with Plantago lanceolata, the main food plant for the rare Glanville fritillary.|$|R
50|$|Amazing melocactuses <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{flower beds}} near Playa Honda beach.|$|R
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{cultivated}} emmer and barley, {{and several}} other cereal grains, {{all of which were}} used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer. Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
5|$|The final lap of {{the trail}} to Saint Paul, which had {{replaced}} Mendota as the principal entrepôt for the cart trade, continued along the sandplain on the east bank of the Mississippi. This route ran within {{a few miles of}} the river to Saint Anthony Falls and the community of that name which was <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east bank of the Mississippi. The trail then left the river and crossed open country to Saint Paul. The carters camped on the uplands west of the steamboat landing during the interval between their arrival with the furs and their return to the north with supplies and trade goods.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is {{a host of}} {{the widespread}} moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, and of the louse Philopterus reguli. The amblycerous mite Ricinus frenatus has been found on the eastern goldcrest subspecies, R. r. japonensis in Japan, and {{at the other end}} of the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the Faroes and in Spain. These lice move over the host's body, and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin so that they can feed on blood, and sometimes feather material. A number of feather mites have been recorded in the genus Regulus; these mites live on fungi <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.|$|E
