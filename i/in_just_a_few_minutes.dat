25|$|Burgess’ studies {{revealed}} how the dendrites {{of brain}} neurons grow during development. Together with Richard Coss at the University of California, Davis, Burgess {{was the first}} to show that sensory stimuli, including social stressors, can cause long-lasting changes in brain cell anatomical structure <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> Together with Jaime Villablanca at UCLA, Burgess discovered that early brain injury resembling childhood congenital disorders and adult traumatic brain injury can heal naturally and that rehabilitative exercise improves brain healing. He helped clarify the rôle of the caudate nucleus in aggression and found that, without input from this nucleus, usually aggressive cats are friendly and affiliative. Burgess also contributed to our understanding of how the nervous system responds to morphine, especially during early development.|$|E
