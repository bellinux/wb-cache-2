25|$|Carney was the Democratic Party {{nominee for}} Delaware's at-large {{seat in the}} United States House of Representatives in 2010.

In the first week of October, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll released the results of its opinion research, showing Carney with a 15-point advantage over Urquhart, 51%-36%; well ahead in New Castle County (56-32) but running even with Urquhart (43-43) in the downstate counties of Kent and Sussex. Days before the election, a second Fairleigh Dickinson poll showed Carney leading by 17 percentage points, 53% to 36% among likely voters.|$|E

500|$|I Never Liked You {{was well}} received, and its {{influence}} {{can be found in}} the work of cartoonists such as <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Brown,</b> Ariel Schrag and Anders Nilsen. The book appeared amid the early 1990s trend in autobiographical alternative comics, and Brown was one of a prominent trio of Toronto-based autobiographical cartoonists, with Seth and Joe Matt. Brown originally set the panels against black page backgrounds, which he replaced with white for an annotated [...] "New Definitive Edition" [...] in 2002.|$|E
500|$|Brown's autobiographical work {{developed}} from {{a scene that}} had been developing since the 1970s and which had reached a peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [...] Brown's open and self-deprecating example left an impact on cartoonists such as <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Brown</b> and Ariel Schrag, and his sparse layouts on the likes of Anders Nilsen. [...] Upon the serial's conclusion, reviewer Darcy Sullivan called it [...] "a major step forward for the artist, a leading light in adult comics". [...] American cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez hailed The Playboy and I Never Liked You as [...] "probably the best graphic novels next to Maus"; British cartoonist Eddie Campbell called them [...] "the most sensitive comics ever made"; and American comics writer Heidi MacDonald called I Never Liked You [...] "a masterpiece" [...] that is [...] "the equal of any 'coming of age' movie".|$|E
