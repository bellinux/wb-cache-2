Since MV and LV grid share their earthing system at the MV-LV transformer, one might question the safety with respect to LV customers {{in case of a}} phase-to-earth fault, occurring in the MV grid. Models and actual measurements in a operating grid are preformed to determine the current distribution and touch voltages.

40|$|The {{ever more}} {{electrified}} and energy-intensive society increases {{the need for}} a secure power grid and energy service. The transmission system is the backbone of the electrical power infrastructure, to have a well-functioning protection system of this is therefore crucial. The most common type of faults in the power grid are ground faults on overhead lines, which makes it important to be sure about how the relays will measure such a fault. Distance protection is the preferred protection scheme for the transmission grid, thus it is of importance to determine how the performance of these depends on parameters like presence of ground wires, ground conductivity, system neutral earthing, different types of faults and size of fault resistance. This masters thesis investigates the impact that presence of ground wires has on the ability of the distance relay to detect single phase-to-ground faults in a grid with solid earthed neutral. In compensated earthed networks it is investigated whether the distance relays are able to distinguish two single phase-to-ground faults at two different phases occurring at the same time but at distant locations from a single ground fault. To investigate these scenarios, models of a transmission line and a section of a transmission grid were implemented in the simulation programme ATPDraw. The models were used for testing of various fault scenarios in combination with different system neutral earthing methods, line design and ground conductivity. It was found that presence of overhead ground wires does not have decisive impact on whether the distance relays are able to detect a single ground fault in a solid <b>earthed</b> <b>grid.</b> However, estimated fault location was severely improved for lines with ground wires compared to those without. Fault resistance was found to be the factor deciding whether a ground fault was detected. For a solid <b>earthed</b> <b>grid</b> lacking ground wires, high earth potential rise at fault location during a ground fault is a concern. The distance relays are displaying a clear difference in measured impedance for one ground fault versus two ground faults. Thus, in theory, {{it should be possible to}} implement more advanced protection zones that will only trip the relay for double faults and persistent single faults. However, this subject needs further analysis before a general conclusion applicable to all possible fault scenarios can be stated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Large {{power systems}} are {{normally}} operated with their neutral points directly earthed. At a major generating or switching station, {{this results in}} the provision of a large <b>earth</b> <b>grid</b> buried in the ground. The design of earthing systems requires a worst case approach. There is a possibility of heavy currents flowing into the <b>earth</b> <b>grid</b> from the overhead earth wires through the tower during a line conductor fault and from lightning strikes. The flow of earth current during a fault or lightning conditions results in a rise of <b>earth</b> <b>grid</b> potential with respect to a physically remote earth point, which can lead to unsafe conditions under some conditions for personnel and connected electrical plant. This paper aims to investigate the potential of adding novel coatings to the conventional copper <b>earth</b> <b>grid</b> conductors to enhance overall conductivity and diminish corrosion.

40|$|Nowadays, {{with more}} of {{suburban}} area developed into an urban area, power system for transmission and distribution have become more critical with the growing of load demand in the area. A substation, previously located away from other other structures, are now standing next to residential buildings and other public structures, raising concerns over public safety factor. Increasing energy demands have caused the utility company to increase the capacity of a substation, and hence consequently increases the system fault current level. The existing and installed <b>earthing</b> <b>grid</b> systems had incorporated the safety factor based on the old fault current level, which is now may not be sufficient for the new fault current level capacity. During the propagation of fault current, there exist the earth potential rise (EPR) along the conductor at {{the surface of the}} soil, the touch potential (TP), and the step potential (SP), all of which may become lethal when over a certain level. The values of ERP, TP and SP must comply to the safety level as described in the IEEE 80 - 2000 standard. Several factors that contribute to the ERP value are the fault current level, soil resistivity and grid geometry.

Regular on-site testing of <b>earthing</b> <b>grids</b> is essential to prevent these situations. The most commonly used method to test <b>earthing</b> <b>grids</b> is accurate and reliable, but only for installations with low background noise, a limited number of feeders and a low system impedance. These limitations in field testing have motivated this research into improving the method of measuring currents during live earthing system tests. Traditional methods of noise removal and parameter extraction do not have sufficient noise rejection capabilities for noise levels equal to and greater than the test signal magnitude. The designed method for current measurement involves active noise removal using destructive interference to improve the accuracy of small signal measurement. Passive digital filtering and phase locked loops are used to identify the parameters for each frequency before the signals are fedback to cause destructive interference. This strategy can measure phase and frequency with an error of less than 0. 1 % and the magnitude to less than 1 % under low noise conditions. For small input magnitudes at noise levels of - 60 dB the phase and frequency of the signal can be extracted with errors of 1 %, however the magnitude extraction can only achieve this for unity magnitude. Improvement of the measurement system in low frequency tests allows for greater confidence in the assessment of an earthing system, its subsequent models and works required for hazard reduction...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{evaluation}} of performance and behaviour of earth electrode systems subjected to DC, AC and transient current injections with different rise times and shapes. The performance of the earth electrode system when injected with currents at the power frequency is now well understood, but {{the response of the}} system under high frequency and transient conditions is yet to be fully clarified. This thesis contributes to the better understanding of complex earthing systems such as <b>earth</b> <b>grids</b> and wind turbine earthing system behaviour under high frequency and transient conditions including voltage distributions {{along the length of the}} electrode. The frequency and time domain responses of earth electrodes (vertical and horizontal earth electrodes and <b>earth</b> <b>grids)</b> were quantified for soil resistivity ranged from 10 Ωm to 10 kΩm. Practical wind turbine earthing system models were developed to account for the additional effects of the above–ground tower structure of the wind turbine and also to consider the benefits of various enhancements to the earthing system. Simulations using 1 / 5 μs and 8 / 20 μs impulse currents were carried out, and a number of parameters were quantified; these include the earth potential rise and the voltage distributions at ground surface level. In particular, the contribution of mitigating techniques, such as rings and rods were derived. The computations allowed determination of touch and step voltages. The results show that the performance of an earth electrode depends on a number of factors such as soil resistivity and permittivity and electrode dimensions, and it was found that significant inductive effects dominate at high frequency. Thus, the ability of a horizontal earth electrode to reduce the earth potential rise is limited because, beyond a certain length known as the effective length, no further reduction is obtained. The effective length was determined experimentally by incrementally increasing the length of the test electrode. The experimental and simulation results show reasonably close agreement. Furthermore, reasonable prediction of the effective length may be possible using simple empirically derived equations. The thesis proposes a new method to increase the effective length of in-ground horizontal earth electrodes and the effective area of <b>earth</b> <b>grids.</b> It is proposed that an additional insulated parallel an above ground conductor is bonded to the horizontal electrode at suitable points along its length. Field tests show that the addition to such enhancement reduces inductance effects and helps dissipation of injected currents, so that a greater length of buried earth conductor is utilised, and this contributes to an additional reduction in the earth impedance. Hence, the earth potential rise at the point of current injection is reduced. Enhancing the earthing system in this way results in a significant reduction in the transient potentials developed at the base of the turbine structure. These TEPR reductions produce associated reductions in touch and step voltages. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
