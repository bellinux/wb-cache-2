This discussion considers three categories of sketch: thinking sketches, used to focus and guide non-verbal thinking; talking sketches, employed to support discussion of the design with colleagues; and prescriptive sketches, which give instructions to the draftsman in charge of making the <b>finished</b> <b>drawing.</b> 1...|$|R
