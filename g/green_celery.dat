50|$|Pindar {{stated that}} the games were {{afterward}} celebrated in honor of Zeus. Initially the games were warlike in character, and only warriors and their sons were allowed {{to take part in}} them. Later on, however, they were thrown open to all the Greeks. The games took place in a grove between Cleonae and Phlius. The various events, according to Apollodorus, were horse-racing, running in armour in the stadium, wrestling, chariot racing and discus, boxing, spear-throwing and archery, as well as musical contests. The prize given to the victors was originally a wreath of olive branches, but afterwards a wreath of <b>green</b> <b>celery.</b> The location of the Nemean Games varied at different times among Cleonae, Corinth, and Argos. They were sometimes called the Cleonaean Games after the first location. The judges who awarded the prizes were dressed in black robes, and an instance of their justice, when the Argives presided, is recorded by Pausanias.|$|E
50|$|Green {{smoothies}} {{consist of}} typically 40-50% green vegetables—usually raw leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, swiss chard, collard <b>greens,</b> <b>celery,</b> parsley, or broccoli—the rest being mostly or entirely fruit. Most raw green leafy vegetables are bitter, but {{this can be}} ameliorated by suitable choice of vegetables (e.g. baby spinach is almost flavourless) or fruit (e.g. banana softens both the flavour and texture).|$|R
50|$|One type of Catalan dish is escudella, a soup which {{contains}} chick peas, potatoes, and vegetables such as <b>green</b> cabbage, <b>celery,</b> carrots, turnips, and meats such as botifarra (a Catalan sausage), pork feet, salted ham, chicken, and veal.

50|$|The flat {{reclaimed}} areas {{consist of}} fertile organic soil, ideal for growing market garden {{crops such as}} onions, leafy <b>greens,</b> <b>celery</b> and carrots. Organic matter consists of living plant tissues and organisms found in soil. Organic matter improves the physical condition of soil, and residues from its decomposition {{play an important role}} in holding plant nutrients and water. Organic matter in soil undergoes change as it breaks down and decomposes and new material is added. Careful management of this soil is necessary to prevent wind erosion. Much of the fertile, organic soil has been depleted due to unsustainable use by farmers over the years. Submerged decayed trees contribute highly to the valuable fibrous nature of the soil, but without human assistance and ingenuity, the area would have little fertility.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{vegetable}} juices are commonly made from varying combinations of carrots, beets, pumpkin, and tomatoes. The latter two, although not technically vegetables, {{are commonly used}} to increase palatability.

40|$|The {{production}} of celery by farmers in Utah has undergone important {{changes in the}} past five or six years. The most notable have been centered around the introduction of the new <b>green</b> type (Pascal) <b>celery.</b> The methods of production have advanced rapidly, the quality of the product has been greatly improved, the yield per acre has been increased at least twofold, and the acreage has been expanded. With the growing impetus of the industry have come requests for information on cost and return to the farmer and for an analysis of other economic and physical factors associated with the industry. Few economic data have been available for the use of those interested in the new developments in celery production. To provide more current data on celery production in Utah, the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station conducted a study on cost and efficiency of producing celery in Utah for the years 1945 and 1947...|$|R

50|$|Louisiana remoulade {{can vary}} from the French-African Creole, the rustic Afro-Caribbean Creole, or the Classic Cajun version, and like the local {{variants}} of roux, each version {{is different from the}} French original. Creole versions often have tan or pink hues and are usually piquant. Louisiana-style remoulades fall generally into one of two categories—those with a mayonnaise base and those with an oil base, but sometimes both mayonnaise and oil are used. Each version may have finely chopped vegetables, usually <b>green</b> onions and <b>celery,</b> and parsley; most are made with either Creole or stone-ground mustard. Salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper are also standard ingredients. In the oil- and mayonnaise-based versions, the reddish hue often comes from the addition of a small amount of ketchup and/or paprika. The sauce is often topped with paprika for the aesthetics as well as the flavor. Generally, lemon juice or vinegar are added for acidity. Other additions include hardboiled egg or raw egg yolks, minced garlic, hot sauce, vinegar, horseradish, capers, cornichons, and Worcestershire sauce.|$|R

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					In {{the absence}} of current {{cumulative}} dietary exposure assessments, this analysis was conducted to estimate exposure to multiple dietary contaminants for children, who are more vulnerable to toxic exposure than adults. 				 				 					 						Methods 					We estimated exposure to multiple food contaminants based on dietary data from preschool-age children (2 &# 8211; 4 years, n= 207), school-age children (5 &# 8211; 7 years, n= 157), parents of young children (n= 446), and older adults (n= 149). We compared exposure estimates for eleven toxic compounds (acrylamide, arsenic, lead, mercury, chlorpyrifos, permethrin, endosulfan, dieldrin, chlordane, DDE, and dioxin) based on self-reported food frequency data by age group. To determine if cancer and non-cancer benchmark levels were exceeded, chemical levels in food were derived from publicly available databases including the Total Diet Study. 				 				 					 						Results 					Cancer benchmark levels were exceeded by all children (100 %) for arsenic, dieldrin, DDE, and dioxins. Non-cancer benchmarks were exceeded by > 95 % of preschool-age children for acrylamide and by 10 % of preschool-age children for mercury. Preschool-age children had significantly higher estimated intakes of 6 of 11 compounds compared to school-age children (p< 0. 0001 to p= 0. 02). Based on self-reported dietary data, the greatest exposure to pesticides from foods included in this analysis were tomatoes, peaches, apples, peppers, grapes, lettuce, broccoli, strawberries, spinach, dairy, pears, <b>green</b> beans, and <b>celery.</b> 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Dietary strategies to reduce exposure to toxic compounds for which cancer and non-cancer benchmarks are exceeded by children vary by compound. These strategies include consuming organically produced dairy and selected fruits and vegetables to reduce pesticide intake, consuming less animal foods (meat, dairy, and fish) to reduce intake of persistent organic pollutants and metals, and consuming lower quantities of chips, cereal, crackers, and other processed carbohydrate foods to reduce acrylamide intake...|$|R
