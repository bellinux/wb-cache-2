5|$|After {{the success}} of Spielberg's <b>Jurassic</b> Park, Joe Johnston {{expressed}} interest in directing a sequel. Spielberg instead gave Johnston permission to direct a third film in the series, if {{there were to be}} one. Production of <b>Jurassic</b> Park III began on August 30, 2000. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film was successful at the box office, grossing $368 million worldwide. A sequel, <b>Jurassic</b> World, was released on June 12, 2015.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jurassic</b> Park III premiered at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, California, on July 16, 2001, {{followed}} {{two days}} later by a release in the United States and other countries. The film earned $181,171,875 in the United States and $368,780,809 worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year worldwide {{but it is the}} lowest grossing <b>Jurassic</b> Park film in the entire series. The film was released on VHS and DVD on December 11, 2001. It was re-released with both sequels in December 2001 as the <b>Jurassic</b> Park Trilogy, and as the <b>Jurassic</b> Park Adventure Pack in November 2005. The film has also been released as a two-disc DVD set alongside Hulk. In 2011, the film was released on Blu-ray as part of the <b>Jurassic</b> Park Ultimate Trilogy. The soundtrack was released in July 2001.|$|E
5|$|On June 1, 2016, <b>Jurassic</b> Park, {{along with}} its sequels The Lost World and <b>Jurassic</b> Park III, {{were added to the}} Netflix {{streaming}} service.|$|E

5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{was first}} {{excavated}} from Antarctica's Early <b>Jurassic,</b> Sinemurian to Pliensbachian aged Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, by paleontologist Dr. William Hammer in 1991. It {{was the first}} carnivorous dinosaur to be discovered in Antarctica and the first non-avian dinosaur from the continent to be officially named. The sediments in which its fossils were found have been dated at ~194 to 188 million years ago, representing the Early <b>Jurassic</b> Period.|$|E
5|$|Early <b>Jurassic</b> uplift {{created an}} {{unconformity}} above the Chinle Formation that represents about ten million years of missing sedimentation {{between it and}} the next formation, the Moenave. Periodic incursions of shallow seas from the north during the <b>Jurassic</b> flooded parts of Wyoming, Montana, and a northeast–southwest trending trough on the Utah/Idaho border. The Moenave was deposited in a variety of river, lake, and flood-plain environments.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its release, <b>Jurassic</b> Park has frequently been cited by film critics and industry professionals {{as one of the}} greatest movies of the action and thriller genres. The American Film Institute named <b>Jurassic</b> Park the 35th most thrilling film of all time on June 13, 2001. The Chicago Film Critics Association also ranked <b>Jurassic</b> Park as the 55th scariest movie of all time and, in 2005, Bravo chose the scene in which Lex and Tim are stalked by two raptors in the kitchen as the 95th scariest movie moment ever. On Empire magazine's fifteenth anniversary in 2004, it judged <b>Jurassic</b> Park the sixth most influential film of the magazine's lifetime. Empire called the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus the 28th most magical moment in cinema. In 2008, an Empire poll of readers, filmmakers, and critics also rated it one of the 500 greatest films of all time. On Film Reviews fifty-fifth anniversary in 2005, it declared the film to be one of the five most important in the magazine's lifetime. In 2006, IGN ranked <b>Jurassic</b> Park as the 19th greatest film franchise ever. In a 2010 poll, the readers of Entertainment Weekly rated it the greatest summer movie of the previous 20 years. The popularity of the movie caused the management of the National Basketball Association expansion franchise founded in Toronto in 1995 to adopt the nickname Raptors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jurassic</b> Park III is a 2001 American science-fiction {{adventure}} {{film and}} the third installment in the <b>Jurassic</b> Park film series. The film stars Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, and Michael Jeter. It is the first film in the series {{not to have been}} directed by Steven Spielberg, nor based on a book by Michael Crichton (though numerous scenes in the film were ultimately taken from Crichton's novels <b>Jurassic</b> Park and The Lost World). The film takes place on Isla Sorna, off Central America's Pacific coast, the island featured in the , where a divorced couple has tricked Dr. Alan Grant into going in order to help them find their son.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jurassic</b> Park was {{broadcast}} on television {{for the first}} time on May 7, 1995, following the April 26 airing of The Making of <b>Jurassic</b> Park. Some 68.12 million people tuned in to watch, garnering NBC a 36 percent share of all available viewers that night. <b>Jurassic</b> Park was the highest-rated theatrical film broadcast on television by any network since the April 1987 airing of Trading Places. In June–July 1995 the film was aired a number of times on the TNT network.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus is {{the first}} {{definite}} ceratosaur from eastern Asia to be discovered. It {{is also one of}} the earliest members of the group Ceratosauria, living during the Oxfordian stage of the <b>Jurassic</b> period (approximately 161-157 million years ago). Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late <b>Jurassic</b> period than previously thought, and suggests a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E
5|$|Many eusauropods, {{including}} Dinheirosaurus {{have been}} found in the Late <b>Jurassic</b> of Europe. The sauropods are from {{around the base of the}} Tithonian as based on the presence of Anchispirocyclina lusitanica. One sauropod, a diplodocid currently based on an unnamed specimen including vertebrae and some bones, is clearly different from Dinheirosaurus and Losillasaurus, confirming the presence of a least two and possibly more diplodocids in the Late <b>Jurassic</b> of Spain and Portugal. This is unique in the variety of diplodocoids in all Europe, with the only other genera possibly non-diplodocoid (Cetiosauriscus), or classified in Rebbachisauridae. This suggests that the biogeography of primitive sauropods is incomplete, with possible primitive eusauropods and diplodocids surviving in the Late <b>Jurassic,</b> potentially until the Berriasian.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus meriani {{was a new}} {{combination}} by George Olshevsky for Megalosaurus meriani Greppin, 1870, {{based on}} a tooth from the Late <b>Jurassic</b> of Switzerland. However, a recent overview of Ceratosaurus included it in Ceratosaurus sp.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Bjorøy Tunnel, the geology of the area was thought to consist entirely of metamorphic basement rocks similar to those exposed on the surrounding islands. The <b>Jurassic</b> sediments encountered in the tunnel included breccia and conglomerate in contact with the underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments, some of which was quite unconsolidated. Spore and pollen samples gave an Oxfordian age (Late <b>Jurassic)</b> for the sequence. The sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by a fault zone, which later reactivated, disrupting the bedding and causing steep dips.|$|E
5|$|He also {{appeared}} in video games, such as Grand Theft Auto V, Lego <b>Jurassic</b> World, Star Wars: The Old Republic - Knights of the Fallen Empire and Halo 5: Guardians.|$|E
5|$|I. praecursor (also spelled I. precursor), {{described}} by E. Sauvage in 1876 from teeth from an unnamed Kimmeridgian (Late <b>Jurassic)</b> formation in Pas-de-Calais, France, {{is actually a}} sauropod, sometimes assigned to Neosodon, although the two come from different formations.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the Blu-ray release, <b>Jurassic</b> Park had a digital print released in UK cinemas on September 23, 2011. It wound up grossing £245,422 ($786,021) from 276 theaters, finishing at eleventh on the weekend box office.|$|E

5|$|<b>Jurassic</b> Park {{became the}} highest-grossing film {{released}} worldwide {{up to that}} time. Following $3.1 million from midnight screenings on June 10, the film earned $47 million in its first weekend, with the $50.1 million total breaking the opening weekend record set by Batman Returns the year before. By {{the end of its}} first week, <b>Jurassic</b> Park had grossed $81.7 million, and stayed at number one for three weeks. It eventually grossed $357 million in the U.S. and Canada. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 86.2 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run. The film also did very well in international markets, breaking opening records in the United Kingdom, Japan, India, South Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan, ultimately earning $914 million worldwide, with Spielberg reportedly making over $250 million from the film. It surpassed Spielberg's own E.T. the Extraterrestrial as the highest-grossing film ever worldwide, and became second to E.T. in North America earnings. <b>Jurassic</b> Parks record was only surpassed in 1998 by Titanic, the first film to gross over $1 billion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jurassic</b> Park is a 1993 American science-fiction {{adventure}} film {{directed by}} Steven Spielberg and produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald R. Molen. The first installment in the <b>Jurassic</b> Park franchise, {{it is based}} on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton and a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film is set on the fictional islet of Isla Nublar, located off Central America's Pacific Coast near Costa Rica, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of cloned dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Synapsida, a clade that {{contains}} mammals and their extinct relatives, originated during the Pennsylvanian subperiod, when they split from reptilian and avian lineages. Crown group mammals evolved from earlier mammaliaforms during the Early <b>Jurassic.</b> The cladogram takes Mammalia {{to be the}} crown group.|$|E
5|$|The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument {{lies within}} the Blue Mountains physiographic province, which {{originated}} {{during the late}} <b>Jurassic</b> and early Cretaceous, about 118 to 93million years ago. Northeastern Oregon was assembled in large blocks (exotic terranes) of Permian, Triassic, and <b>Jurassic</b> rock shifted by tectonic forces and accreted to {{what was then the}} western edge of the North American continent, near the Idaho border. By the beginning of the Cenozoic era, 66million years ago, the Blue Mountains province was uplifting (that is, was being pushed higher by tectonic forces), and the Pacific Ocean shoreline, formerly near Idaho, had shifted to the west.|$|E
5|$|The crocodylomorphs are {{the only}} pseudosuchians to have survived the Triassic–Jurassic {{extinction}} event, 201.3 million years ago. During the early <b>Jurassic</b> period, the dinosaurs became dominant on land, and the crocodylomorphs underwent major adaptive diversications to fill ecological niches vacated by recently extinguished groups. Unfolding fossil evidence shows that Mesozoic crocodylomorphs had a much greater diversity of forms than modern crocodilians. Some became small fast-moving insectivores, others specialist fish-eaters, still others marine and terrestrial carnivores, and a few became herbivores. The earliest stage of crocodilian evolution was the protosuchians, which evolved in the late Triassic and early <b>Jurassic.</b> They were followed by the mesosuchians, which diversified widely during the <b>Jurassic</b> and the Tertiary. Another group, the eusuchians, appeared in the late Cretaceous 80 million years ago and includes all the crocodilians living today.|$|E
5|$|The {{earlier and}} more basal genus Huayangosaurus from the Middle <b>Jurassic</b> of China (some 165 {{million years ago}} – Mya) antedates Stegosaurus by 20 million years {{and is the only}} genus in the family Huayangosauridae. Earlier still is Scelidosaurus, from Early <b>Jurassic</b> England, which lived about 190Mya. Interestingly, it possessed {{features}} of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. Emausaurus from Germany was another small quadruped, while Scutellosaurus from Arizona was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known avialan fossils {{come from}} the Tiaojishan Formation of China, which has been dated to the late <b>Jurassic</b> period (Oxfordian stage), about 160 million years ago. The avialan species from this time period include Anchiornis huxleyi, Xiaotingia zhengi, and Aurornis xui.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} formed {{on top of}} {{plutonic}} rocks, which were scoured by glaciation. At the south coast of Tierra del Fuego, volcanic activity provided the late <b>Jurassic</b> formation known as the Lemaire Formation. Later, during the Cretaceous, the Yaghan Formation consisting of marine sediments was deposed {{on top of the}} Lemaire Formation. The basement of Fueguino consists of an ophiolite of Late <b>Jurassic</b> to Early Cretaceous age. The ophiolitic sequence contains pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, titanomagnetite, cubanite and pyrite.|$|E
5|$|The film {{made its}} VHS and LaserDisc debut on October 4, 1994. With 17 million units sold in both formats, <b>Jurassic</b> Park {{is the fifth}} best-selling VHS tape ever.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{unambiguous}} termite fossils date to {{the early}} Cretaceous, but given the diversity of Cretaceous termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects, they likely originated earlier in the <b>Jurassic</b> or Triassic. Further evidence of a <b>Jurassic</b> origin {{is the assumption that}} the extinct Fruitafossor consumed termites, judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite-eating mammals. The oldest termite nest discovered is believed to be from the Upper Cretaceous in West Texas, where the oldest known faecal pellets were also discovered.|$|E
5|$|The three Plesiosaurus models {{represents}} {{three species}} of marine reptile, P. macrocephalus, P. dolichoderius and P. hawkinsii, from the <b>Jurassic</b> of England. Two {{of them have}} implausibly-flexible necks.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 150 {{important}} fossil sites from the <b>Jurassic,</b> the majority in Eastern Europe and North Asia. Outstanding sites include Solnhofen in Upper Bavaria, Germany, Karatau in South Kazakhstan, the Yixian formation in Liaoning, North China, {{as well as the}} Jiulongshan formation and further fossil sites in Mongolia. In North America {{there are only a few}} sites with fossil records of insects from the <b>Jurassic,</b> namely the shell limestone deposits in the Hartford basin, the Deerfield basin and the Newark basin.|$|E
5|$|While the {{traprock}} cliffs {{remain the}} most obvious evidence of the prehistoric geologic processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life {{in the form of}} Triassic and <b>Jurassic</b> fossils; in particular, dinosaur tracks. At a state park in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, more than 2,000 well preserved early <b>Jurassic</b> prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.|$|E
5|$|A {{ridge of}} low <b>Jurassic</b> hills {{runs through the}} county, {{separating}} the basins of the Welland and Nene rivers. The county has good communications as it is crossed by two main railway lines and the M1 motorway, and it has many small industrial centres rather than large conurbations. The main architectural feature is its country houses and mansions.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the Dicraeosauridae, a family ranked clade within the Diplodocoidea. Currently, this clade consists of five species belonging to four genera. These are, besides Amargasaurus cazaui, the species Dicraeosaurus hansemanni and Dicraeosaurus sattleri from the Late <b>Jurassic</b> Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, as well as Brachytrachelopan mesai from the Late <b>Jurassic</b> of Argentina. Whitlock (2011) argued that Suuwassea emilieae from the Morrison Formation of the United States has to be placed inside the Dicraeosauridae as well, which was supported by subsequent studies. Amargasaurus is the only named dicraeosaurid from the Cretaceous; an unnamed specimen from Brazil indicates that this group persisted until the end of the Early Cretaceous. Most analyses find Dicraeosaurus and Brachytrachelopan to be more closely related to each other than to Amargasaurus. Suuwassea was recovered as the most basal member of the family. A 2015 analysis by Tschopp and colleagues came to the preliminary result that two poorly known genera from the Morrison Formation, Dyslocosaurus polyonychius and Dystrophaeus viaemalae, might be additional members of the Dicraeosauridae.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Paleozoic, the crinoids and blastoids were the {{predominant}} echinoderms, and some limestones {{from this period}} are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In the two major extinction events {{that occurred during the}} late Devonian and late Permian, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived. Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly within about sixty million years during the Early <b>Jurassic</b> {{and the beginning of the}} Middle <b>Jurassic.</b> A 2012 study found that speciation in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of Cryptasterina hystera and Cryptasterina pentagona has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and brooding and the latter remaining a broadcast spawner.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} Triassic follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late Triassic and early <b>Jurassic,</b> the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late <b>Jurassic,</b> where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the <b>Jurassic</b> was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} <b>Jurassic,</b> Europe was a dry, {{tropical}} archipelago {{at the edge}} of the Tethys Sea. The fine limestone in which the skeletons of Compsognathus have been found originated in calcite from the shells of marine organisms. Both the German and French areas where Compsognathus specimens have been preserved were lagoons situated between the beaches and coral reefs of the <b>Jurassic</b> European islands in the Tethys Sea. Contemporaries of Compsognathus longipes include the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica and the pterosaurs Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Pterodactylus antiquus. The same sediments in which Compsognathus have been preserved also contain fossils of a number of marine animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the coastal habitat of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with Compsognathus, indicating that these little dinosaurs might in fact have been the top land predator in these islands.|$|E
