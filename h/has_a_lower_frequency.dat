30|$|Obviously the {{instance}} where k[*]=[*] 1 <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> reuse factor, {{the average}} set size of STRXs sharing a frequency is smaller {{compared to the}} other case. Since the chance of interference rises quadratically in the amount of STRX in a single set, the overall interference level rises (though every single potential interference value is strictly lower) if k increases. In other words, with a relatively low k value it is possible to form sets of STRX having very few (if any) interference relations not equal to zero while at higher k values, i.e., demanding more frequencies to hop, increases the set size and therefore the chance of strictly positive interference values dramatically. In the above context, this means that inducing randomization will increase the probability of having a suboptimal assignment in one time-frame, thus increasing the expected interference.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} effects of kefir, a traditional source of probiotic, on coccidial oocysts excretion and on the performance of dairy goat kids following weaning. Twin kids were randomly allocated to one of two groups at weaning. Kids of the first group received 20 ml of kefir daily for 6 weeks (KEF), while kids in the control group were given a placebo (CON). Individual faecal samples were regularly (n 018 per kid) taken to quantify the number of coccidial oocysts per gram of faeces (OpG). There were no differences between the groups in terms of body weight de-velopment (P> 0. 05) and feed consumption. Kids of both groups were not able to consume enough feed to meet their nutrient requirements during the first 3 weeks following wean-ing. KEF <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> of OpG positive samples than CON (P 00. 043). Kefir did not affect the maximum oocyst excretion and age of the kids at the highest oocyst excretion (P> 0. 05). KEF shed numerically 35 % lower coccidial oocysts than the controls, which corresponded to a statistical tendency (P 00. 074) in lowering Log-OpG in comparison to CON. While KEF <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> of OpG positive samples and tended to shed lower OPG by around one-third, the frequency of diarrhea, level of highest oocyst excretion, and performance of the kids remained unaffected. Therefore, it is concluded that overall effects of kefir do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant impact on sub-clinical infection and performance in weaned kids under relatively high-hygienic farming conditions...|$|R

We investigated the association between gender, gestational and postnatal age, preeclampsia (PE), premature rupture of membranes (PROM) as well as prenatal steroid treatment (PS) and the frequency of activated T lymphocyte subsets (HLA-DR+, CD 69 +, CD 25 +, CD 62 L+) and major T lymphocyte subpopulations (CD 4, CD 8, Th 1, Th 2, naive, memory) in peripheral blood during the first postnatal week in preterm infants. RESULTS: Cord blood and peripheral blood samples were collected from 43 preterm infants on the 1 st, 3 rd, and 7 th days of life. We assessed the frequency of the above T lymphocyte subsets using flow cytometry. The 'mixed effect model' was used to analyze the effects of clinical parameters on T lymphocyte markers. The frequency of CD 25 + T lymphocytes was higher in PROM. The frequency of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells and the CD 4 +/CD 8 + cell ratio was decreased in PE. The frequency of CD 62 L+ T lymphocytes was higher in male compared with female infants. PS did not affect the frequency of the investigated markers.

The direct methods involve viewing the trachea as employed by this study. It is different from TRUE [14] and trans-cricothyroid membrane ultrasonography [7]. TRUE utilises a convex transducer in the suprasternal notch window, whereas transcricothyroid membrane ultrasound uses a linear transducer on the cricothyroid membrane as the name implies. However, a convex transducer <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> which makes visualisation of superficial structures difficult, and anatomical artefacts such as thyroid gland calcification can cause a false negative [14]. Trans-cricothyroid membrane ultrasonography uses the cricothyroid membrane as scanning position and entirely depends on the appearance change of the vocal cords, but a study had shown that only 71 % of the healthy human subjects were visible by ultrasound [35]. In the preliminary study of ultrasound of the vocal cords and larynx, real-time ultrasound image of the vocal cords and larynx had been successfully used to guide the endotracheal intubation of an awake, healthy volunteer. However, it had been unsuccessful in anaesthetised patients because of the difficulty in viewing the advancing tip of the endotracheal tube [36].

Since {{the temperature of}} prominences is typically {{of the order of}} 10 ^ 4 K, the prominence plasma is only partially ionized. In this paper, we study the effect of neutrals on the wave propagation in a filament thread modeled as a partially ionized homogeneous magnetic flux tube embedded in an homogeneous and fully ionized coronal plasma. Ohmic and ambipolar magnetic diffusion are considered in the basic resistive MHD equations. We numerically compute the eigenfrequencies of kink, slow, and Alfven linear MHD modes, and obtain analytical approximations in some cases. We find that the existence of propagating modes is constrained by the presence of critical values of the longitudinal wavenumber. In particular, the lower and upper frequency cut-offs of kink and Alfven waves owe their existence to magnetic diffusion parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field lines, respectively. The slow mode only <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> cut-off, which is caused by perpendicular magnetic diffusion and is significantly affected by the ionization degree.

40|$|The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the {{dominant}} component of intraseasonal (30 - 90 days) variability in the tropical atmosphere. Here, traveling wave solutions are presented for the MJO skeleton model of Majda and Stechmann. The model is a system of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe {{the evolution of the}} tropical atmosphere on planetary (10, 000 - 40, 000 km) spatial scales. The nonlinear traveling waves come in four types, corresponding to the four types of linear wave solutions, one of which has the properties of the MJO. In the MJO traveling wave, the convective activity has a pulse-like shape, with a narrow region of enhanced convection and a wide region of suppressed convection. Furthermore, an amplitude-dependent dispersion relation is derived, and it shows that the nonlinear MJO <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> and slower propagation speed than the linear MJO. By taking the small-amplitude limit, an analytic formula is also derived for the dispersion relation of linear waves.

In the limit of weak forcing, it is shown that the nonlinear traveling waves have a simple sech-squared waveform...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glutathione transferases (GST) are a {{group of}} {{multifunctional}} enzymes important in the detoxification of many electrophiles and, in addition, fatty acid hydroperoxides, thus limiting tissue damage from oxidative free radical attack. Of the four classes of GST (alpha, mu, pi, and theta), a class mu isoenzyme, GST mu, is dominantly inherited and is expressed in {{approximately half of the}} population. GST mu expression was examined in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and correlated to clinical course, extension, and age of onset of the diseases. METHODS: GST mu can be measured as GST activity against trans-stilbene oxide. This GST activity was measured in whole blood in 179 patients with ulcerative colitis, 109 patients with Crohn's disease, and 449 age-matched controls. RESULTS: Frequencies of GST mu expression were as follows: controls (n = 449, 51. 2 %), mild ulcerative colitis (n = 76, 47. 3 %), moderate ulcerative colitis (n = 43, 46. 5 %), and severe ulcerative colitis (characterized by colectomy) (n = 60, 36. 7 %). This trend was, however, not significant (p = 0. 094). Patients with onset of the colitis before the age of 30 years (n = 91) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frequency</b> of GST mu expression (35. 2 %) than patients with a later onset (n = 88, 52. 3 %) (p < 0. 05).
