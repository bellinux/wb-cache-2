5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and <b>ectoderm.</b> The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the <b>ectoderm</b> around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the <b>ectoderm,</b> forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with <b>ectoderm,</b> {{mesoderm}} and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying <b>ectoderm</b> into nervous tissue. The neural tube, forming from the <b>ectoderm,</b> contains CSF prior {{to the development of the}} choroid plexuses. The open neuropores of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.|$|E
5|$|During {{embryogenesis}} the ear develops {{as three}} distinct structures: the inner ear, {{the middle ear}} and the outer ear. Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the <b>ectoderm,</b> endoderm and mesenchyme.|$|E
5|$|The ear {{develops}} {{from the}} first pharyngeal pouch and six small swellings that develop in the early embryo called otic placodes, which are derived from <b>ectoderm.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic <b>ectoderm</b> forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Neural crest cells (derived from the <b>ectoderm)</b> populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest. The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the wing buds is of a thickening of the hypodermis, which {{can be observed in}} insect species as early the embryo, and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in the embryo, or embryogenesis, a cluster of cells grow underneath the <b>ectoderm</b> which later in development, after the lateral <b>ectoderm</b> has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, can be seen in those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second instar the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last instar, or fifth, the wing is pushed out of the wing-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after eclosion, the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E
5|$|Toroids : The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata {{from the}} Nama Group, Namibia, has been {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large gut cavity and a transversely ridged <b>ectoderm.</b> The organism is {{in the shape of}} a flattened torus, with the long axis of its toroidal body running through the approximate center of the presumed gut cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the <b>ectoderm</b> layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial {{position}} and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (<b>ectoderm,</b> endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the <b>ectoderm,</b> connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of <b>ectoderm</b> running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
25|$|Although proneural genes {{operate in}} the <b>ectoderm,</b> lethal of scute acts in the somatic {{mesoderm}} to define cell cluster from which muscle progenitors will be single out. The interaction between these cells and <b>ectoderm,</b> leads {{to the formation of}} muscle founder cells, in an analogous process to the one that occurs in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The prechordal plate, notochord, and non-neural <b>ectoderm</b> are {{believed}} to be important inducer tissues which release these chemical signals, in order to trigger neural plate folding.|$|E
25|$|The {{ectodermal}} dysplasia associated with EEC syndrome arises from abnormalities in the embryonic <b>ectoderm,</b> as described above. Very early in embryonic development, the {{embryonic stem cells}} differentiate into three types of cells: the <b>ectoderm,</b> mesoderm, and endoderm. It is from these three types of cells that all body organs originate. In general terms, ectodermal cells generate the skin, spinal cord, and teeth (as well as the numerous derivatives mentioned above). Mesodermal cells generate blood vessels, muscle and bone, and endodermal cells generate the lungs, the digestive system and the urinary system.|$|E
25|$|During development, {{definitive}} endoderm and <b>ectoderm</b> differentiates {{into several}} gastrointestinal epithelial lineages, including endocrine cells. Many {{studies have indicated}} that Notch signaling has a major role in endocrine development.|$|E
25|$|Ectodermal {{dysplasia}} describes {{abnormalities of}} structures {{derived from the}} embryonic <b>ectoderm.</b> These abnormalities affect both the superficial ectodermal layer, {{as well as the}} mesectodermal layer constituted by the neural crest.|$|E
25|$|First, {{extracellular}} signaling molecules, secreted {{from the}} adjacent epidermis and underlying mesoderm such as Wnts, BMPs and Fgfs separate the non-neural <b>ectoderm</b> (epidermis) from the neural plate during neural induction.|$|E
25|$|In primary neurulation, {{the layer}} of <b>ectoderm</b> divides into three sets of cells: the neural tube (future brain and spinal cord), {{epidermis}} (skin), and neural crest cells (connects epidermis and neural tube and will migrate to make neurons, glia, and skin cell pigmentation).|$|E
25|$|Neural crest {{cells are}} a {{temporary}} group of cells unique to vertebrates {{that arise from}} the embryonic <b>ectoderm</b> cell layer, and in turn {{give rise to a}} diverse cell lineage—including melanocytes, craniofacial cartilage and bone, smooth muscle, peripheral and enteric neurons and glia.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, paracrine {{signaling}} of Fgf {{is essential}} in the developing eye of chicks. The fgf8 mRNA becomes localized in what differentiates into the neural retina of the optic cup. These cells are {{in contact with the}} outer <b>ectoderm</b> cells, which will eventually become the lens.|$|E
25|$|The human {{inner ear}} {{develops}} during week 4 of embryonic development from the auditory placode, a thickening of the <b>ectoderm</b> which {{gives rise to}} the bipolar neurons of the cochlear and vestibular ganglions. As the auditory placode invaginates towards the embryonic mesoderm, it forms the auditory vesicle or otocyst.|$|E
25|$|There is {{initially}} a cloacal membrane, composed of <b>ectoderm</b> and endoderm, reaching from {{the umbilical cord}} to the tail, separating the cloaca from the exterior. After {{the separation of the}} rectum from the dorsal part of the cloaca, the ventral part of the cloacal membrane becomes the urogenital membrane.|$|E
25|$|The tooth germ is an {{aggregation}} {{of cells}} that eventually forms a tooth. These cells {{are derived from}} the <b>ectoderm</b> of the first pharyngeal arch and the ectomesenchyme of the neural crest. The tooth germ is organized into three parts: the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental sac or follicle.|$|E
25|$|During {{embryonic}} development, the parietal {{eye and the}} pineal {{organ of}} modern lizards and tuataras form together from a pocket formed in the brain <b>ectoderm.</b> The loss of parietal eyes in many living tetrapods is supported by developmental formation of a paired structure that subsequently fuses into a single pineal gland in developing embryos of turtles, snakes, birds, and mammals.|$|E
25|$|Following amputation, most annelids {{are capable}} of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to {{infection}} prevention. In certain species, like Limnodrilus, autolysis can be seen within hours after amputation in the <b>ectoderm</b> and mesoderm. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.|$|E
25|$|During {{the stage}} of neural plate {{formation}} the embryo consists of three cell layers: the <b>ectoderm</b> that eventually forms the skin and neural tissues, the mesoderm that forms muscle and bone, and the endoderm that will form the cells lining the digestive and respiratory tracts. The progenitor cells {{that make up the}} precursors to neural tissues in the neural plate are called neuroepithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|The prepuce in {{both sexes}} is {{formed by the}} growth of a solid plate of <b>ectoderm</b> into the {{superficial}} part of the phallus; on coronal section this plate presents the shape of a horseshoe. By the breaking down of its more centrally situated cells the plate is split into two lamellæ. Thus, a cutaneous fold, the prepuce, is liberated and forms a hood over the glans.|$|E
25|$|A tooth (plural teeth) is a hard, calcified {{structure}} {{found in}} the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates and used to break down food. Some animals, particularly carnivores, also use teeth for hunting or for defensive purposes. The roots of teeth are covered by gums. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness. The cellular tissues that ultimately become teeth originate from the embryonic germ layer, the <b>ectoderm.</b>|$|E
25|$|A zygote {{initially}} develops into {{a hollow}} sphere, called a blastula, which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber, and two separate germ layers—an external <b>ectoderm</b> and an internal endoderm. In most cases, a mesoderm also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.|$|E
25|$|This {{striking}} data offers convincing {{support for}} the p63 gene hypothesis. This study is also cited in the demonstration that the growth and patterning of the underlying mesenchyme is highly dependent on the apical ectodermal ridge of the limbs, {{as well as the}} maxillary and mandibular branchial <b>ectoderm</b> that are so prominently disturbed in these mice. All of {{these findings are consistent with}} the clinical presentation of EEC in humans and may explain the association of limb malformation and clefting that are found in this syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the other}} phyla, the Ctenophora and the Cnidaria, which {{includes}} sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers {{with a single}} opening, which serves as both the mouth and the anus. Both have distinct tissues, {{but they are not}} organized into organs. There are only two main germ layers, the <b>ectoderm</b> and endoderm, with only scattered cells between them. As such, these animals are sometimes called diploblastic. The tiny placozoans are similar, but {{they do not have a}} permanent digestive chamber.|$|E
25|$|In {{the outer}} part of the {{intermediate}} mesoderm, immediately under the <b>ectoderm,</b> in the region from the fifth cervical segment to the third thoracic segment, a series of short evaginations from each segment grows dorsally and extends caudally, fusing successively from before backward to form the pronephric duct. This continues to grow caudally until it opens into the ventral part of the cloaca; beyond the pronephros it is termed the Wolffian duct. Thus, the Wolffian duct is {{what remains of the}} pronephric duct after the atrophy of the pronephros.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two layers}} of mesoderm; intraembryonic and extraembryonic. As the intraembryonic layer grows laterally, it becomes {{continuous}} with the extraembryonic layer, forming the chorion (contributing to the blood supply). At the same time during embryonic development, the <b>ectoderm</b> begins to thicken and fold upward, forming the neural folds, which eventually meet to form the neural tube and neural crest. Because these two events occur {{at roughly the same}} time in embryological development, abnormalities found in this syndrome can involve not only the ectodermal cells, but also disruption to development in the mesectodermal layer constituted by the neural crest.|$|E
25|$|Embryonic stem (ES) {{cells are}} {{the cells of}} the inner cell mass of a {{blastocyst}}, an early-stage embryo. Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4–5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. ES cells are pluripotent and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: <b>ectoderm,</b> endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the placenta.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids {{have two}} kinds of eyes: the lateral and median ocelli. The lateral ocelli evolved from {{compound}} eyes and may have a tapetum, which enhances the ability to collect light. With the exception of scorpions, which can have up to five pairs of lateral ocelli, there are never more than three pairs present. The median ocelli develop from a transverse fold of the <b>ectoderm.</b> The ancestors of modern arachnids probably had both types, but modern ones often lack one type or the other. The cornea of the eye also acts as a lens, and is continuous with the cuticle of the body. Beneath this is a transparent vitreous body, and then the retina and, if present, the tapetum. In most arachnids, the retina probably {{does not have enough}} light sensitive cells to allow the eyes to form a proper image.|$|E
25|$|Learning about PCD {{in various}} species is {{essential}} in understanding the evolutionary basis and reason for apoptosis in development of the nervous system. During {{the development of the}} invertebrate nervous system, PCD plays different roles in different species. The similarity of the asymmetric cell death mechanism in the nematode and the leech indicates that PCD may have an evolutionary significance {{in the development of the}} nervous system. In the nematode, PCD occurs in the first hour of development leading to the elimination of 12% of non-gonadal cells including neuronal lineages. Cell death in arthropods occurs first in the nervous system when <b>ectoderm</b> cells differentiate and one daughter cell becomes a neuroblast and the other undergoes apoptosis. Furthermore, sex targeted cell death leads to different neuronal innervation of specific organs in males and females. In Drosophila, PCD {{is essential in}} segmentation and specification during development.|$|E
