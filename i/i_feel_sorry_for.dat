Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

500|$|Cagney held {{a variety}} of jobs early in his life, giving all his {{earnings}} to his family: junior architect, copy boy for the New York Sun, book custodian at the New York Public Library, bellhop, draughtsman, and night doorkeeper. While Cagney {{was working for the}} New York Public Library, he met Florence James, who helped him into an acting career. Cagney believed in hard work, later stating, [...] "It was good for me. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the kid who has too cushy a time of it.

500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music. [...] I do what I like and I happen to like rock 'n' roll, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> anybody who only listens to one form of music." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was at home}} to Charlton Athletic. The team conceded four {{goals in}} 20 minutes and blew several chances to [...] "kill the game", in what was the club's biggest home defeat in the league under Wenger. An away trip to local rivals Tottenham Hostpur became {{magnified}} with interest, given it marked the return of Campbell following his move to Arsenal. An 81st-minute goal scored by Pirès put Arsenal into the lead, before a lapse by Wright in goal allowed Gus Poyet‘s shot to squirm from his grasp and enter the goalnet. Arsenal then faced league champions Manchester United {{and in spite of}} conceding inside 14 minutes through a Paul Scholes’ strike, Ljungberg equalised for them [...] "with a wonderful chipped finish, following Gary Neville's wretched error." [...] Arsenal improved in the second half but scored in unforeseen fashion: United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez passed the ball directly into the feet of Henry, who profited from the error and scored. Five minutes later, Barthez's failure to grasp the ball presented Henry the chance to score his second, which he did. Both Henry and Wenger defended the opposition goalkeeper, with the former, his international teammate saying: [...] "Of course I was happy to score the goals but it was strange. He's my good friend and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him; I would rather have got them another way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mac Cocker was a radio DJ in Sydney, with Double J in the 1970s {{and then}} Triple J in the 1980s, {{and did not}} counter a common {{impression}} there that he was Joe Cocker's brother or cousin (despite both being from Sheffield, they are not related). By {{the time of his}} son's visit, Mac Cocker had moved to a hippie commune in Darwin, Northern Territory. Cocker says he has forgiven his father for abandoning them, saying, [...] "I don't feel any bitterness towards him at all. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{defended his}} wife's proxy candidacy. He felt {{somewhat}} vindicated when Republicans in Idaho denied renomination in 1966 to Governor Robert E. Smylie, {{author of the}} article entitled [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Sorry</b> <b>for</b> Lurleen Wallace." [...] In his memoirs, Wallace recounts his wife's ability to [...] "charm crowds" [...] and cast off invective: [...] "I was immensely proud of her, and it didn't hurt a bit to {{take a back seat}} to her in vote-getting ability." [...] Wallace rebuffed critics who claimed that he had [...] "dragooned" [...] his wife into the race. [...] "She loved every minute of being governor the same way ... that Mrs. (Margaret) Smith loves being senator." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 30 June 2007, Japan's defense {{minister}} Fumio Kyūma said the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan by the United States during World War II was an inevitable {{way to end}} the war. Kyūma said: [...] "I now have come to accept {{in my mind that}} in order to end the war, it could not be helped (shikata ga nai) that an atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and that countless numbers of people suffered great tragedy." [...] Kyūma, who is from Nagasaki, said the bombing caused great suffering in the city, but he does not resent the U.S. because it prevented the Soviet Union from entering the war with Japan. Kyūma's comments were similar to those made by Emperor Hirohito when, in his first ever press conference given in Tokyo in 1975, he was asked what he thought of the bombing of Hiroshima, and answered: [...] "It's very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the citizens of Hiroshima but it couldn't be helped (shikata ga nai) because that happened in wartime." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 July 1999, after 364 {{appearances}} and 66 goals for Liverpool, McManaman transferred to Real Madrid as Guus Hiddink's last signing (before being sacked, {{and while the}} club was under president Lorenzo Sanz). Before McManaman arrived, the club was described as undergoing a management and debt crisis and Raúl told the press, [...] "The dressing room is a cesspit of lies, treachery and whispers... <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> new players like Steve McManaman coming into the club. If McManaman thinks he is coming {{to one of the}} world's top clubs then he has made a big mistake." [...] The club appointed John Toshack as its new coach and had already been forced to sell key players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker and Christian Panucci due to mounting debt, while Clarence Seedorf was also released shortly after McManaman arrived. McManaman's arrival saw him become only the second English player to ever play for the club, after Laurie Cunningham had played for them in the 1980s. He was also the most high-profile English footballer to move to Spanish football since Gary Lineker had moved to Barcelona from Everton in 1986. Thereafter he proved an instant hit with the fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium after scoring three times and creating several goals in his first few games for Los Merengues.|$|E

Yet I never called him up again. He is happy. Let him stay.|$|E
6000|$|It {{hurt her}} {{to hear him}} speak of Mrs. Haney in that off-hand, {{habitual}} way, and she foretold further misconception {{on the part of}} Mrs. Crego in case he should forget--as he was likely to do--and allude to [...] "Bertha" [...] in her presence. But how could she tell him not to do that? She merely said: [...] "I like Mrs. Haney, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> her--I mean I'm sorry she can't have a place in the town to which she is really entitled. She is improving very rapidly." ...|$|E
