50|$|A {{number of}} these {{measures}} drew fire from environmental and First Nations groups. In particular, Bill C-45 overhauled the Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA) of 1882, renaming it the Navigation Protection Act (NPA). The NWPA had mandated an extensive approval and consultation process before construction of any kind could take place in or around any water which could in principle be navigated by any kind of <b>floating</b> <b>craft.</b> Under the new NPA, the approval process would only be required for development around one of a vastly circumscribed list of waterways set by the Minister of Transportation. Many of the newly deregulated waterways passed through traditional First Nations land.|$|E

For the production were accepted the <b>floating</b> <b>crafts</b> of naval engineer B.S. Smirnov's system.

50|$|Ships, dredgers, other <b>floating</b> <b>craft</b> {{and even}} a bridge were sunk to block the canal. In {{addition}} to the vessels that were sunk, {{there were a number}} of sea mines that prevented navigation. With the war having left the Israelis in possession of the entire east bank of the canal, the Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser quickly resolved to keep the canal closed to all shipping indefinitely. The only other alternative would have been allow the Israelis to use it, which was anathema to the Egyptian government. Even if the political issues surrounding the canal could have somehow been resolved, its maintenance would have been economically unviable since very few (if any) shippers would have been willing to send their vessels and crews through what was effectively a no man's land in an active combat zone.|$|E
50|$|In the {{afternoon}} of April 6, a local pro-Union resident was found to guide the division forward, and the advance finally started. Unfortunately, the difficult march through a narrow track in the swamp caused the division to become strung out and widely separated. At 5 p.m. the lead elements arrived at the crossing point on the east bank of the river. Across the river chaos ensued, with roughly 10,000 to 15,000 disorganized Union troops milling about seeking a way to escape the Confederate attack {{that was in the}} process of smashing the Federal lines on the west bank. Desperate to begin moving his men across the river, Nelson commandeered any <b>floating</b> <b>craft</b> he could and pressed them into service, shuttling men of the 4th Division to the west bank. Despite his best efforts, however, by the time Johnson and his Confederates launched their final attacks around 6 p.m., only about 500 men of the division had made it across. The rest, still working their way out of the swamp, began to stack up on the eastern bank, waiting for transport. Among the stranded troops were Hazen's brigade and the 41st.|$|E

5000|$|The {{subsequent}} interviews {{are conducted}} by Henry Ayscough, a lawyer employed by Bartholomew's father, {{who is a}} Duke. The interviews reveal that Bartholomew had hired the party to travel with him but deceived them about the purpose of his journey. Variations of his story are (1) {{he was on his}} way to elope against the wishes of family; (2) he was visiting a wealthy, aged aunt to secure an inheritance from her; (3) he was seeking a cure for impotence; (4) he was pursuing some scientific or occult knowledge, possibly concerning knowledge of the future. He takes Rebecca and Dick to a cave in a remote area. Rebecca's initial tale, retold by Jones, is that he there performed a satanic ritual, and Rebecca herself was raped by Satan and forced to view a panorama of human suffering and cruelty. Rebecca's own testimony admits this was a deception to quiet Jones. She says that she actually saw Bartholomew meet a noble lady who took them all inside a strange <b>floating</b> <b>craft</b> (which she calls [...] "the maggot"). In this craft she sees what she describes as a divine revelation of heaven ("June Eternal") and the Shaker Trinity (Father, Son, and female Holy Spirit or [...] "Mother Wisdom"). She also sees a vision of human suffering and cruelty in this version of her story. Modern readers may interpret her visions as films and her overall experience as a contact with time travellers or extraterrestrials. Rebecca then loses consciousness; she wakes, finds Jones outside the cave, and they leave together. She then tells Jones the satanic version of her experience. Meanwhile, Jones has seen Dick leave the cave in terror, presumably to go and hang himself.|$|E
40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>craft</b> are {{compared}} to those that fly. Drag/weight for floaters is shown to be proportional to v squared/L, while for flyers it is independent of size and speed. The transportation market will therefore assign airships to lower speeds than airplanes, and will favor large airship sizes. Drag of an airship is shown to be only 11 percent of submarine drag at equal displacement and speed, raising the possibility that airships can compete with some types of ships...|$|E

The process of safe movement of the ship in the area is called safe navigation. These areas are called as limited waters. The manoeuvring of ships on each water area is connected with the risk of accident, which is unwanted event in results of this can appear the losses. Among water areas there are those where ship manoeuvring is restricted more than in other sea areas. These areas are called as limited waters. They are mainly characterised a relatively high number of navigation accidents. The assessing of navigation safety requires the application of proper criteria, measures and factors. The criteria {{make it possible to}} estimate the probability of navigational accident for certain conditions. The safety of ship’s movement can be identified as admissible risk, as a combination of probability of accident and losses.
