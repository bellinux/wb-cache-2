40|$|Three {{synthetic}} analogues of westiallamide, H 3 Lwa {{have previously}} been synthesized (H 3 L 1 - 3) {{which have a}} common backbone (derived from L-valine) with H 3 Lwa but differ in their <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>rings</b> (imidazole, oxazole, thiazole and oxazoline). Herein we explore in detail through high resolution pulsed EPR and MCD spectroscopy in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) the geometric and electronic structures of the mono- and di-nuclear CuII complexes of these cyclic pseudo-hexapeptides. Orientation selective HYSCORE, ENDOR and three-pulse ESEEM of [CuII(H 2 L 1) (MeOH) 2]+ reveal delocalization of the unpaired electron spin onto the ligating and distal nitrogens of the coordinated <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>rings</b> {{and that they are}} magnetically inequivalent.

The magnetic inequivalencies in [CuII(H 2 L 1) (MeOH) 2]+ arise from different orientations of the <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>rings</b> coordinated to the CuII ion and that delocalization of the unpaired electron onto the distal heteroatoms within these N-methylimidazole rings depend upon their location with respect to the CuII dx 2 -y 2 orbital.

2500|$|A {{heme group}} {{consists}} of an iron (Fe) ion (charged atom) held in a <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>ring,</b> known as a porphyrin. This porphyrin ring consists of four pyrrole molecules cyclically linked together (by methine bridges) with the iron ion bound in the center. The iron ion, which {{is the site of}} oxygen binding, coordinates with the four nitrogen atoms {{in the center of the}} ring, which all lie in one plane. The iron is bound strongly (covalently) to the globular protein via the N atoms of the imidazole ring of F8 histidine residue (also known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, completing the octahedral group of six ligands. Oxygen binds in an [...] "end-on bent" [...] geometry where one oxygen atom binds to Fe and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.|$|E
