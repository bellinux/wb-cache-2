50|$|Bankers Life {{offers a}} variety of annuities, {{including}} Fixed Interest Annuity, <b>Fixed</b> <b>Index</b> Annuity, and Immediate Annuity.|$|R

50|$|Prior to 2016, {{the company}} offered several annuities: fixed {{immediate}} annuities, traditional fixed deferred annuities, and <b>fixed</b> <b>index</b> annuities.|$|R
30|$|Now, we {{establish}} {{the existence of}} positive solutions of the system based on the above results about the <b>fixed</b> <b>index.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this section, we will {{calculate}} the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> of (1.3) {{by using the}} standard <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> theory in cone.|$|R
50|$|For a {{fixed field}} and a <b>fixed</b> <b>index</b> set, the graded vector spaces form a {{category}} whose morphisms are the graded linear maps.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we mainly show Theorem  1.1 by the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> theory. Hence, {{we first}} {{introduce}} a proposition about the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{category}} theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, a diagram is the categorical analogue of an indexed family in set theory. The primary difference {{is that in the}} categorical setting one has morphisms that also need indexing. An indexed family of sets is a collection of sets, <b>indexed</b> by a <b>fixed</b> set; equivalently, a function from a <b>fixed</b> <b>index</b> set to the class of sets. A diagram is a collection of objects and morphisms, <b>indexed</b> by a <b>fixed</b> category; equivalently, a functor from a <b>fixed</b> <b>index</b> category to some category.|$|R
40|$|We study Weyl group orbits in {{symmetric}} Kac-Moody root {{systems and}} show a finiteness of orbits of roots with a <b>fixed</b> <b>index.</b> We apply this result {{to the study}} of the Euler transform of linear ordinary differential equations on the Riemann sphere whose singular points are regular singular or unramified irregular singular points. The Euler transform induces a transformation on spectral types of the differential equations and it keeps their indices of rigidity. Then as a generalization of the result in [10], we show a finiteness of Euler transform orbits of spectral types with a <b>fixed</b> <b>index</b> of rigidity...|$|R
50|$|Deferred annuities, {{including}} <b>fixed,</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>indexed</b> and variable, typically pay the advisor or salesperson 1 {{percent to}} 10 {{percent of the}} amount invested as a commission, with possible trail options of 25 basis points to 1 percent. Sometimes the advisor can select his payout option, which might be either 7 or 10 percent up front, or 5 percent up front with a 25 basis point trail, or 1 percent to 3 percent up front with a 1 percent trail. Trail commissions are most common in variable annuities while fixed annuities and <b>fixed</b> <b>indexed</b> annuities typically pay an up front commission.|$|R

5000|$|A new {{category}} of deferred annuity, called the <b>fixed</b> <b>indexed</b> annuity (FIA) emerged in 1995 (originally called an Equity-Indexed Annuity). <b>Fixed</b> <b>indexed</b> annuities may have features of both fixed and variable deferred annuities. The insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return for EIA. An investor can still lose money {{if he or}} she cancels (or surrenders) the policy early, before a [...] "break even" [...] period. An oversimplified expression of a typical EIA's rate of return might be that it is equal to a stated [...] "participation rate" [...] multiplied by a target stock market index's performance excluding dividends. Interest rate caps or an administrative fee may be applicable.|$|R

30|$|The {{main results}} of papers [25, 26] have been {{obtained}} by the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> theory for problems without deviating arguments. The study of positive solutions to boundary value problems with Stieltjes integrals {{in the case of}} signed measures has also been done in papers [3, 7, 13, 14, 27] for second-order differential equations (also impulsive) or third-order differential equations by using the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> theory, the Avery-Peterson fixed point theorem or <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> theory involving eigenvalues.|$|R
50|$|On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A {{claiming}} indexed annuities {{should be}} regulated as securities and {{should only be}} sold by registered representatives. A lawsuit was filed {{on the same day}} challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate <b>fixed</b> <b>indexed</b> annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”) which exempted <b>fixed</b> <b>index</b> annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.|$|R
30|$|The {{coexistence}} of an unstirred chemostat model with B-D functional response is studied by <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> theory in our paper. First of all, some prior estimates for positive solutions are proved by the maximum principle {{and the upper}} and lower solution method. Second, the calculations are performed on the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> of chemostat model by degree theory and the homotopy invariance theorem. Finally, some sufficient condition on the existence of positive steady-state solutions is established by <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> theory in cone and bifurcation theory.|$|R

30|$|Based on the {{approach}} of Fitzpatrick and Petryshyn [17], {{the concept of a}} <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> for A-proper maps related to (1.1) has been introduced by Cremins [18, 19]. Since then, some existence results for the semilinear equation (1.1) in cones have been established in [20, 21] using the properties of the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> and partial order method. Recently, the computation of the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> for A-proper semilinear operators was proved in [22] under the sublinear case, but to the best of the knowledge of the authors nothing has been published concerning the computation results available in the literature for the superlinear case. In this paper, we will continue this study and focus on the computation of the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> with certain boundary conditions in the superlinear case.|$|R

50|$|On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A {{claiming}} indexed annuities {{should be}} regulated as securities and {{should only be}} sold by registered representatives. A lawsuit was filed {{on the same day}} challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate <b>fixed</b> <b>indexed</b> annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal. On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”) which exempted <b>fixed</b> <b>index</b> annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.|$|R

30|$|With {{the help}} of (1.5)-(1.6) and Cauchy’s {{inequality}} with δ> 0, similarly to Section  2.1, we prove that the operator A_k is coercive, strong monotone, bounded, and hemicontinuous.

30|$|The {{following}} well-known {{results of}} the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> are crucial in our arguments.|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} we compute the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> for A-proper semilinear {{operators}} under certain boundary conditions.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that some of the {{properties}} enjoyed by the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> can be chosen as axioms, the choice depending on the class of maps and spaces considered. In the context of finite-dimensional real differentiable manifolds, we will provide a simple proof that the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> is uniquely determined by the properties of normalization, additivity, and homotopy invariance.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, {{this paper}} generalizes the {{boundary}} value problems on finite intervals discussed in [12, 13] to {{ones on the}} whole lines, the main tools used in this paper is the well-known Schauder fixed point theorem (not {{the upper and lower}} solution method, the fundamental properties of the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index,</b> and the <b>fixed</b> point <b>index</b> theorem used in [12, 13]).|$|R
