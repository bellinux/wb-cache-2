500|$|When {{asked why}} he had not asked Meckiff to bowl {{at the other end}} to gauge the {{judgment}} of the other umpire, Lou Rowan, Benaud replied [...] "over the years I have always accepted the umpire's decision". The Australian captain was criticised for being acquiescent, and one of his predecessors Lindsay Hassett believed Meckiff should have been used at reduced speed. Rowan later indicated his concurrence with Egar, writing in his book The Umpire's Story, [...] "There is nothing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> say that will alter the opinions already expressed that his [...] delivery was unfair". For his part, Meckiff said: [...] "the game is bigger than the individual" [...] and he backed Benaud's decision because doing otherwise [...] "could only have added fuel to the controversy".|$|E
500|$|In the 1997 {{election}} and subsequently, Brown pledged not {{to increase the}} basic or higher rates of income tax. Over his Chancellorship, he reduced the basic rate from 23% to 20%. However, in all but his final budget, Brown increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation, rather than earnings, resulting in fiscal drag. Corporation tax fell under Brown, from a main rate of 33% to 28%, and from 24% to 19% for small businesses. In 1999, he introduced a lower tax band of 10%. He abolished this 10% tax band in his last budget in 2007 to reduce the basic rate from 22% to 20%, increasing tax for 5 million people and, according to the calculations of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, leaving those earning between £5,000 and £18,000 as the biggest losers. To backbench cheers, Brown had described the measure in his last Budget thus: [...] "Having put in place more focused ways of incentivising work and directly supporting children and pensioners {{at a cost of}} £3bn a year, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> return income tax to just two rates by removing the 10p band on non savings income".|$|E

500|$|On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft {{gave birth}} to her second daughter, Mary. Although the {{delivery}} seemed to go well initially, the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; puerperal (childbed) fever was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century. After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, [...] "I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> ever know happiness again." [...] She was buried at Old Saint Pancras Churchyard, where her tombstone reads, [...] "Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797." [...] (In 1851, her remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter's Church, Bournemouth.) Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of Sir John Soane's grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin (1766–1841).|$|E
500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I {{would also like to thank}} you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E

2500|$|From a musician’s {{perspective}} or piano player’s perspective, he matters {{because he}} {{figured out how}} to do things no one had ever done before, at least in a rhythm-and-blues context.... Basically he figured out ways {{to do a lot of}} stuff at the same time and make the piano sound like an entire band. It’s Ray Charles on the level of Chopin. It’s all the soul, all the groove, and all the technique in the universe packed into one unbelievable player ... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> say with certainty that it’s a pianistic experience unlike any other. He invented an entirely new way of playing blues and roots-based music on the piano, and it was mind-blowingly brilliant and beautiful.|$|E
2500|$|On April 30, 2001, Wolfson left Lambda to form Freedom to Marry with a [...] "very generous" [...] {{grant from}} the Evelyn & Walter Haas Jr. Fund. [...] Wolfson {{described}} the breadth of his vision for the new organization: [...] "I'm not in this just to change the law. It's about changing society. I want gay kids to grow up believing {{that they can get}} married, that they can join the Scouts, that they can choose the life they want to live." [...] Lambda executive director Kevin Cathcart said that over twelve years Wolfson had [...] "personified Lambda's passion and vision for equality." [...] Kate Kendall, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said of her experience with Wolfson at Lambda: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> say is that, in the intervening years, what has been made unmistakably clear to me by the lesbians and gay men that we work with and represent, is that the denial of our right to marry exacerbates our marginalization; winning that right is the cornerstone of full justice." ...|$|E

2500|$|The organisers of the 2013 Egyptian Marathon {{agreed to}} pay his travel {{expenses}} for the January race, but Kawauchi missed his flight after arriving at the airport without his passport. He decided to pay 800,000 yen (US$9,000) for a replacement flight – an amount that equated to a quarter of his yearly salary. The decision paid off {{as he reached the}} starting line for the marathon and won with a time of 2:12:24 – the fastest ever for a race in Egypt. Less than three weeks later he ran at the Beppu-Ōita Marathon and he {{reached the top of the}} Japanese rankings by winning the race in a personal best of 2:08:15 hours, breaking Gert Thys's 17-year course record in the process. In spite of the lengthy races, his passion was not dimmed: [...] "after 21 Marathon runs, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> say with confidence how fun Marathon running can be". He saw off a number of professional runners at the Kumanichi 30 km Road Race two weeks later, finishing in 1:29:31 hours – another course record and personal best time. The race organisers said a 30,000 increase in spectators that year was due to Kawauchi's popularity with the Japanese public – the runner had received invitations to over 100 races.|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} almost universally {{critically}} panned. [...] Matt Roush {{wrote in his}} USA Today review that Curry [...] "gives it his maul", and that the show's leads seemed [...] "lost in the TV equivalent of summer stock". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly went one step further, likening it to a variation of The Odd Couple that possessed [...] "neither romantic spark nor crisp verbal byplay". [...] The Los Angeles Daily News claimed {{it was the worst}} new show of the season, and that if you tuned in to the show at 8:30, you would [...] "probably be watching something else by 8:38". TeeVee's Peter Ko wrote a lengthy review (which itself got some publicity nine years later) in which he heavily bashed Curry, then he went on to state, [...] "I have stood in a freezer full of dead people at the morgue. I have seen a man's scalp pulled back over his nose. I've even seen 35 minutes of Ellen DeGeneres's Mr. Wrong. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> honestly say that until Steve Carell's turn in the premiere of Over the Top, I have never known true horror." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales, on the other hand, was substantially kinder than most critics, saying [...] "the show seemed merely okay at first encounter," [...] but after seeing the season's other new shows, [...] "Over the Top is looking better and better. [...] I could almost kiss it right on the lips." ...|$|E
