40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} on chromatin structure that allows access of trans-acting transcription factors. Logically, the target DNA elements become accessible by either exposing themselves towards the environment {{on the surface}} of the nucleosome, or making the regulatory region free of the nucleosome. Here, we demonstrate that curved DNA that mimics a negative supercoil can play both roles in the promoter region. By constructing 35 reporter plasmids and using in vivo assay systems, we scrutinized the relationships between upstream DNA geometry, nucleosome positioning and promoter activity. When the left-handedly curved DNA was linked to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV tk) promoter at a specific rotational phase and distance, the curved DNA attracted the nucleosome and the TATA box was thereby left in the linker DNA <b>with</b> its minor <b>groove</b> <b>facing</b> outwards, which led to the activation of transcription. Neither planar curving, nor right-handedly curved DNA nor straight DNA had this effect. Our results seem to provide a clue for solving the problem of why curved DNA is often located near transcriptional control regions...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of snakes (Squamata: Serpentes) represents a major transition in squamate reptiles and involves extensive modifications {{in the body}} plan. Functional morphology and phylogeny are integrated to discuss adaptive morphological traits in the origin of snakes and in the {{evolution of}} the venom-injecting apparatus among lizards, which is convergent with that in snakes. The focus of these analyses is to determine how to best optimize morphological traits on the phylogeny and to use character distribution in terminal taxa to estimate ecological adaptation in ancestral nodes. To study the locomotion transition from lizards to snakes, 45 virtual models of the squamate bony labyrinth in the inner ear were reconstructed. The results show morphological diversifications of the vestibular region among burrowers, generalists and marine swimmers. The vestibule is enlarged in fossorial species, and reduced in marine snakes and the marine lizard Platecarpus coryphaeus. To quantify the morphological differences and provide tractable methods to reconstruct locomotion in ancestral snakes, I performed three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis of the 45 samples, using six landmarks and 22 semilandmarks. ANOVA tests on the Procrustes coordinates supported differences among fossorial, generalist, and aquatic locomotion categories. Phylogenetic signal was insignificant in the Procrustes coordinates. Using a phylogeny with the 44 extant samples as terminal taxa, I reconstructed shape coordinates of all internal nodes. Reconstructed shape of the vestibular region of key ancestral nodes in snakes preferred a terrestrial origin for crown-group snakes. Morphological proxies used in this study can be applied to stem snakes to estimate locomotion. Methodologically, this study provides a novel approach to resolve the question whether snakes become limbless on land or in the oceans. Evolution of the venom-injection apparatus in lizards is discussed, based on new material of Estesia mongoliensis. A total-evidence phylogenetic analysis of anguimorph lizards is performed with 86 anguimorph taxa coded to 435 morphological characters and four genes. The matrix includes eight new morphological characters. The total-evidence phylogeny suggests that Estesia Mongoliensis is a basal monstersaur whose crown groups are Heloderma, the only living venomous lizards. Presence of tooth <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> venom <b>grooves</b> is recognized as a new monstersaurian synapomorphy in this study. Estesia mongoliensis has venom grooves comparable to extant Heloderma, but has a deeper root-to-tip groove in the caudal tooth carina, revealing morphological variations of lizard venom delivery apparatus that are not recorded in extant species...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{seemingly}} ubiquitous {{feature of}} the Spanish miquelets was the striated battery face, or put another way, vertically grooved frizzen. Initially, the striated face was a detachable plate dovetailed and often screwed to the battery. This allowed for the replacement of worn faces without having to rework or replace the complete battery. The detachable <b>grooved</b> <b>face</b> went out of fashion around 1660-1675, replaced by grooving made directly into the battery face, almost certainly due to improved heat treatment and tempering of the battery. The grooving was {{to a great extent}} eliminated by French-influenced Madrid gunsmiths around 1700. However, the practice of using both the detachable and integral <b>grooved</b> <b>face</b> was continued by many Spanish provincial gunsmiths as well as by North African and Ottoman lockmakers.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} divided into two parts namely, the use of strain gages and {{photoelastic}} coatings to investigate dynamic fracture. In the first part use of electrical resistance strain gages to determine instantaneous stress intensity factors for running crack is presented. Dynamic strain field equations are developed using the Westergaard 2 ̆ 7 s stress function approach. These equations are then analyzed to study the effect of various parameters like crack velocity, distance from the crack tip, etc. on the dynamic strain profile. Finally, a series of experiments was conducted with two different geometries on brittle birefringent polyester, Homalite 100 to determine dynamic stress intensity factors with strain gages. The K-values thus determined were compared with similar results obtained from the method of photoelasticity in transmission mode. In the second part of this thesis, mirror like reflective photoelastic coatings were used to study dynamic fracture in brittle structural metals. Dynamic fracture experiments are conducted on heat-treated 4340 Steel and 7075 -T 6 Aluminum <b>with</b> <b>face</b> <b>grooved</b> SEN specimen geometry. The mirror like reflective coating used in conjunction with focused light is the key to obtaining clear isochromatic fringe patterns.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{involved}} the parametric analysis of bolted flange connections of eighteen different circular monopoles. The parameters considered were {{the number of}} bolts (8, 6, and 4) and thickness of flange plate [25. 4 mm (1. 0 in.), 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) ]. These were analyzed under stiffened and unstiffened conditions. Four, two and four stiffeners, 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick, were used with 8 -, 6 - and 4 -bolt arrangements. Each finite element model {{is made up of}} a small diameter (171. 5 mm) circular pipe and a large diameter (327 mm) circular pipe both welded to circular flanges. The outer and inner diameters of the flange plates were 327 mm and 171. 5 mm respectively. Each bolt was 25. 4 mm (1 in.) diameter and was pretensioned to 227 kN (51 kips); and an external load of 45 kN (10 kips) was applied at the free end of the monopole, 1804 mm (71 in.) from the bolted joint, in the Riks analysis load step of ABAQUS (version 6. 3) computer program. From the finite element analysis, it was found that monopoles (8 bolts, 6 bolts and 4 bolts) with unstiffened 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick flange plates experienced a large deformation because of the thin flange plate. Optimum solutions to stiffened and unstiffened connections were found to be among those monopoles with minimal gap, deflection and deformation, i. e., 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 6 bolts for unstiffened case; and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 8 bolts, 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 6 bolts for stiffened case. In addition to the parametric study, T-Stub and yield line analytical procedures were also presented with examples; and {{it was found that the}} analytical methods provide good preliminary guidance regarding connection parameters when designing bolted flange connections for circular monopoles.

50|$|The histone-fold domains’ {{interaction}} <b>with</b> {{the minor}} <b>groove</b> {{accounts for the}} majority of the interactions in the nucleosome. As the DNA wraps around the histone octamer, it exposes its minor groove to the histone octamer at 14 distinct locations. At these sites, the two interact through a series of weak, non-covalent bonds. The main source of bonds comes from hydrogen bonds, both direct and water-mediated. The histone-fold hydrogen bonds with both phosphodiester backbone and the A:T rich bases. In these interactions, the histone fold binds to the oxygen atoms and hydroxyl side chains, respectively. Together these sites have a total of about 40 hydrogen bonds, most of which are from the backbone interactions. Additionially, 10 out of the 14 times that the minor <b>groove</b> <b>faces</b> the histone fold, an arginine side chain from the histone fold is inserted into the minor groove. The other four times, the arginine comes from a tail region of the histone.|$|R
