Currently, the home kit {{consists of a}} navy blue shirt with a chevron which <b>fades</b> <b>from</b> <b>white</b> at the bottom to navy blue at the top, paired with navy blue shorts and socks. The away kit is all white, with the shirt featuring a yoke consisting of a design reminiscent of the clubs home ground AAMI Park, set inside an off-centre chevron.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2010, after {{a process}} of {{getting the word out}} beyond the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) and to non-English {{speaking}} areas, a flag was chosen following a vote on a non-AVEN site. It has since been seen used on Tumblr in various LGBT areas, but had been seen alongside other Sexual Orientations flags previous to formal election. The black stripe represents asexuality, the grey stripe representing the grey-area between sexual and asexual, the white stripe sexuality, and the purple stripe community. The AVEN logo is a triangle <b>fading</b> <b>from</b> <b>white</b> to black to symbolise the gradient between sexuals, gray-asexuals, demisexuals, and asexuals. The ace of spades and ace of hearts are also used as asexual symbols since [...] "ace" [...] is a phonetic shortening of asexual. Generally, romantic asexuals use the ace of hearts as their symbol and aromantic asexuals use the ace of spades.|$|R
50|$|The {{sequence}} {{begins with}} a white dot blinking across the screen, from left to right. Upon reaching the right edge of the frame, the dot opens up to reveal a gun barrel's interior. From {{the point of view}} of an off-screen assassin, the camera follows James Bond as he walks from right to left against a white background. Suddenly aware of being observed, he stops at the centre of the screen, quickly turns to the camera and shoots his gun towards it. A blood-red wash, representing the gunman bleeding, runs down the screen. The gun barrel dissolves to a white dot which moves from side-to-side across the screen and settles in the corner. With a few exceptions, the circle then either shrinks and disappears, or <b>fades</b> <b>from</b> <b>white</b> to a circular cutout of the first scene, expanding to reveal the full view of the scene shortly thereafter. However, in recent years, the barrel doesn't dissolve or move. After the blood runs down, everything simply fades out.|$|R
60|$|Burney {{clutched}} it {{and snapped}} {{off the end}} as a terrier bites at a rat. He laid {{it to his lips}} like a long-lost sweetheart. When the smoke began to draw he gave a long, deep sigh, and the bristles of his gray-red moustache curled down over the cigar like the talons of an eagle. Slowly the red <b>faded</b> <b>from</b> the <b>whites</b> of his eyes. He fixed his gaze dreamily upon the hills across the river. The minutes came and went.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movie was}} filmed entirely in color. After test screenings, {{it was decided}} to use black and white for the [...] "past" [...] {{sequences}} to help clear up audience confusion. The final frame, once the mystery is solved, <b>fades</b> <b>from</b> black and <b>white</b> to color. The negative of the final frame was flipped to match the present day lovers to the doomed 1940s newlyweds they embodied; i.e., Margaret dissolves into Mike, and Roman dissolves into Grace.|$|R

50|$|The species {{grows to}} between 5 and 12 metres high often with {{multiple}} trunks {{that have a}} mottled flaking bark including grey, grey-brown and/or pink colouration. The leaves are simple and opposite and are 5.5 to 9 cm long and 1.5 to 3.8cm wide. The white flowers appear in clusters of 10 and have 56 to 65 stamens.Flowering is induced by the first significant rainfall of the wet season, appearing four weeks later. The distinctive fruits are capsules with four wings that appear in clusters and <b>fade</b> <b>from</b> pink to <b>white</b> and dry to brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{video for}} the song does not show Houston {{performing}} the song but is a basic collage of clips from previous Olympic ceremonies. It opens with footage of Olympic games from 1924 and 1964 until the lighting of the cauldron from the 1988 games is shown which <b>fades</b> <b>from</b> black and <b>white</b> to color. As the song plays throughout, footage from the games in 1988 and 1984 are shown. When the chorus is sung for the last time, midway through it, scenes of the awarding from 1984 and 1988 are shown. The song video ends with the 1988 Olympic Cauldron blazing.|$|R
5000|$|Reminiscent {{of several}} other Gehry designs, the {{building}} appears to consist of two major levels: a large base of twisted tower-sections packed together like the cells of a bee hive, with a second bundle of lesser diameter {{sitting on top of}} the first. The cell units have the appearance of sails skinned over the skeleton of the building. The full-height windows <b>fade</b> <b>from</b> clear to <b>white</b> on the top and bottom edges of each story. The overall impression is of two very tall stories, which belies its actual 10-story structure. Vanity Fair commented that the building is perhaps one of the world's most attractive office buildings. [...] Barry Diller, the head of IAC who was intimately involved with the project, mandated that the facade be covered in smooth glass rather than wrinkling titanium, as Gehry had originally planned. Diller said he chose Gehry to design the building because he wanted a space where workers [...] "could collaborate and be in an open atmosphere" [...] which he did not think could be done as easily in a typical boxy building.|$|R
