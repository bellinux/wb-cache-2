This research {{was aimed at}} determining the resulting consequences arising from Amendments to the Delict against protection towards creators or copyright holders. It employed the method of normative legal research. The Copyrigh Act of 2014 make some amendments. Among the most fundamental ones {{is the nature of}} the Delict. The type of offence used in the Copyrigh Act of 2014 is the complaintbased Delict. Prior to the enactment of the Copyrigh Act of 2014, the regular Delict was used. Issues raised in this research had something to do with the factors causing such amendments and the effects of such amendments to the Delict on the protection towards creators or copyright holders. The factors causing Delict amendments are the enactment of the ASEAN Economic Community by the end of 2015 as well as the regular Delict which is considered less effective to be used in the Copyrigh Act of 2014. Based on interviews with informants, such Delict amendments did not affect the protection towards the creators or copyright holders. It was because of declarative copyright protection causing the Delict used to have no effect on the protection. On the contrary, the analysis which the author conducted revealed that such Delict amendments can potentially weaken the said protection towards creators or copyright holders. The reason is because with the use of complaint-based Delict, law enforcement officers can exercise their authority only after creators or copyright <b>holders</b> <b>file</b> a lawsuit claiming copyright infringement...|$|R
40|$|É geralmente aceito que os procedimentos realizados durante o tratamento endodôntico dever-se-iam manter nos limites do sistema de canais radiculares. Para atingir este objetivo, o término do canal radicular deve ser determinado com precisão durante o preparo biomecânico e o controle do comprimento de trabalho mantido durante todo o processo. Várias técnicas têm sido utilizadas para a determinação do comprimento real do canal, incluindo métodos eletrônicos. O objetivo deste estudo ex vivo foi avaliar a capacidade do localizador apical Root ZX II em determinar a posição do limite CDC, a partir de análise radiográfica e macroscópica. Foram selecionados 37 dentes permanentes humanos não tratados endodônticamente. Após abertura coronária convencional, realizou-se, cuidadosamente, a patência dos canais com uma lima 06. Após armazená-los em NaOCl 1 % por um período de 1 hora, os terços, {{cervical}} e médio dos canais, foram alargados com auxílio de limas e brocas Gates-Glidden, sob irrigação abundante, visando remover tanto quanto possível o tecido pulpar remanescente. A determinação eletrônica do comprimento de trabalho com o Root ZX II foi feita com o canal radicular preenchido com NaOCl 1 % e uma lima tipo K de diâmetro compatível com o terço apical do canal. Todos os dentes e o conector de lábio foram inseridos em um modelo de alginato. A lima, presa ao outro conector, foi progressivamente inserida no interior do canal até que o visor do localizador apical indicasse o registro Apex. O instrumento foi, então, recuado até o registro 1. Neste ponto as limas foram fixadas na câmara pulpar com resina autopolimerizável. Os dentes foram removidos do alginato e radiografados no sentido ortorradial. Um sensor digital de raios-X captou e transferiu as imagens para um computador. A distância da ponta da lima ao ápice foi mensurada por três investigadores. Então, os 5 mm apicais da raiz foram desgastadas no sentido longitudinal do dente até que a lima fosse vista através de uma fina camada de dentina. A camada remanescente foi, então, cuidadosamente removida usando uma lâmina de bisturi. Cada espécime foi fotografado e três investigadores, de forma independente, mensuraram a distância entre a ponta da lima ao limite CDC, com auxílio de microscópio. As medidas obtidas foram comparadas usando o teste t para amostras pareadas. A distância média entre o comprimento de trabalho obtido eletronicamente e o limite CDC foi de 0, 42 ± 0, 45 mm. O limite CDC (± 0, 5 mm) foi localizado em 83, 78 % das vezes. A distância entre a ponta da lima e o ápice mensurada no exame radiográfico (- 0, 95 ± 0, 43 mm) e macroscópico (- 0, 93 ± 0, 44 mm) não apresentou diferença estatística (p> 0, 05). Concluiu-se que o registro 1 do visor do Root ZX II apresentou uma precisão de 83, 78 % quando da identificação do limite CDC sendo uma margem de segurança para prevenir sobre-instrumentação não intencional. It {{is generally}} accepted that root canal treatment procedures should be confined within the root canal system. To achieve this objective the canal terminus must be detected accurately during canal preparation and precise {{control of working}} length during the process must be maintained. Several techniques {{have been used for}} determining the apical canal terminus including electronic methods. The purpose of this ex vivo vitro study was to evaluate the ability of apex locator Root ZX II to locate the CDC limit under radiographic and macroscopic analysis. Thirty seven extracted permanent human teeth that had not been endodontically treated previously were selected. After conventional access, patency of the root canal was carefully checked with a # 6 file. After storage in 1 % NaOCl for a period of 1 h, the cervical and the middle portions of the root canal were slightly enlarged with endodontic files and Gates-Glidden burs to remove the pulp tissue as completely as possible under thorough irrigation with 1 % NaOC 1. The electronic working length measurement was conducted with 1 % NaOCl as canal irrigant and a K-type file fitting loosely in the apical third of the canal. To measure the canal length with Root ZX II, all the samples and 1 lip clip of the apex locator were mounted in an alginate model. A file attached to the <b>file</b> <b>holder</b> was slowly inserted into the root canal until the meter on the apex locator dial indicated the meter reading Apex. The file was then withdrawn until the flashing bar on the meter designated the 1 mark. After the measurements, the files were fixed with self-curing resin in the pulpal chamber. All teeth were removed from alginate and radiographed with a zero-degree inclination in buccolingual plane. A digital sensor records the X-ray image and transfers the image to a computer. The distance {{from the end of the}} file to apex was measured by three investigators, and recorded. Then, the apical 5 mm of the root was shaved along the long axis of the tooth until the file could be seen through a thin layer of dentin. The remaining layer was then carefully removed using a scalpel blade. Each specimen was photographed and the distance from the end of the file to CDC limit was measured microscopically by three investigators, independently. The obtained distances were compared using a paired samples t test to determine the accuracy. The mean distance between the apex locator working length and CDC limit was - 0. 42 ± 0. 45 mm. The CDC limit (± 0. 5 mm) was located 83. 78 % of the times. The distance from the end of the file to apex measured on both radiographic (- 0. 95 ± 0. 43 mm) and macroscopic examinations (- 0. 93 ± 0. 44 mm) showed no statistical differences (p> 0. 05). It was concluded that the meter reading 1 on Root ZX II display allowed 83. 78 % precision providing a safety margin to prevent unintentional overinstrumentation...|$|R

Compared with the issue of file management in the information age, the book "The information on the Internet: Brazilian public archives" is the result of an extensive study on the "information" or data are produced by private and public institutions, especially the latest, in order to show how they make the management of public records and can make better use of new information and communication technologies to make available your files securely, quickly, with easy accessibility. This work provides grants to understand what are the new areas and challenges for the archival science, to bring an enriching reflection on how the Internet can reposition the archival institutions as public spaces of access to information and management of the democratization of knowledge, without incurring in a manual format, with general and prescriptive agendas. The book entitled "Information on the Internet: Brazilian public archives" is an adaptation of the doctoral thesis in information science defended by Dr Anna Mariz Carla Almeida, being structured in four chapters plus an introduction and conclusion that deal with the archival institutions, forms of information transfer and the use of technological tools for the modernization of the files. In the first chapter, "Transfer of archival information", there is an approach that involves the different stages of document production, with a breakdown of the meaning and the importance given to information, access, custody and availability of files and on the transfer of information or its possible failure or absence when registered the lack of adequate administrative policies. The contents of this chapter also discusses the broad way information currently reaches your users before the significant change documents for support of the emphasis on the content and the information contained therein due to the large number of documents produced using digital media since the conformation of the revolution in information and communication technologies. In this context, a recurring concern presented in the management of public archives is how the information will be made publicly available, as there are numerous barriers encountered by users to be worked through different tracks or languages ​​such as visual media, text, images and sounds, thus allowing diverse means for access to information to materialize to a wide audience interested. In the second chapter, "The archival institutions", the book discusses the origin of the files since the Middle Ages, when nature was personal in order to control the imperial domains, through the Middle Ages, when there was an increase of documentary mass nature Private, with the emergence of monarchs who were carrying their files to the new conquered peoples, which reflected in a significant boost for the creation of management units of documents at the time. In the modern age, with the organization of bureaucratic bodies and the centralization of power in institutions and bodies that came to compose the National States, diffuses a creation of public archives trend coming to the Contemporary Age with the aim of storage documents facilitating government management of public administration and the development of public policies.  In the case of Brazilian public archival institutions, there is highlighting the year 1838, when it was created the National Archives which was characterized {{by the middle of the}} twentieth century for guarding and preserving material and historical country content bound for users of bureaucratic res as opposed to 1988 which brought in the Federal Constitution a new mentality to the organs and <b>holders</b> <b>file</b> information, through broad access to users of public res to content produced in public administration. In the third chapter, "The Internet and communication networks", the book describes the beginning of the use of information and communication networks by the military of the United States of America in order to show how its civilian use by universities, through the use of computers connected to the Internet to transmit data, reflected in the technological evolution of the current state of the art in the file management. The new information technologies and communication, conjugating the support and transport, just engendering a spatio-temporal compression in which the researcher-user no longer needs to submit to the rules of time, location or query limit in physical files as the information increasingly becomes digitally publicized to a wide audience of users. In a context that the files become virtual due to the use of the Internet, the issue of digital inclusion becomes increasingly important to define who has access and how the public archives, as there are technological barriers that imply the need for access infrastructure, availability of equipment as well as training in the use of computers and the internet. Last but not least, the fourth chapter deals with "Interfaces of Brazilian public archives to the internet", to warn about the worrying reality of the absence of public policies for the efficient management of files in which are listed a number of barriers ranging from a lack of financial resources to the dependency source maintainers agencies (federal, state or municipal). Overall, there is an evolution in construction in public files manifested by the use of the network for easy access to your data, but in Brazil this process has manifested itself in a slow and tortuous way, since many of the files are still not making use of online research tools, serving only as the institution marketing tool and not as a portal for services to citizens. With reference to a deep literature review and fieldwork in Brazilian public archives, the work shows that technological advances were not enough to move the topic in the country, given that persist both, infrastructure deficiencies in publicizing the files to the the general public, as, cognitive gaps in public users to use the files as information sources. Based on the discussions presented in the book, through four chapters, it is observed that the management of public archives in Brazil is extremely poor, with an emphatic understanding that we are far from making adequate information available, as collections continue without possibility physical access simultaneously the shortcomings of skilled professionals and technologies to facilitate the process in the information age and knowledge. The work shows that for different stakeholders, actors with specific interests in the subject, the Brazilian public archives are not structured to fit enough to efficiently meet their users through virtual service, is due not to computerization of their material, either, because the user does not recognize forms of research and the willingness of documents filed in the search software. It concludes that the extremely relevant and updated content on the management of public records, to be conjugated to a simple and concise language makes the book a work of reference and essential reading for undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of management, information science and Executive Secretariat, as well as to update professionals who deal directly or indirectly with the issue.
