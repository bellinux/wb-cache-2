25|$|Barbarossa {{received}} from the Ottoman Empire 2,000 janissaries, artillery, and an important <b>financial</b> <b>support.</b> <b>Through</b> bribery Barbarossa first obtained {{a change in the}} allegiance of the supporters of the Algiers Sheikh. After taking power in the city, Barbarossa then started to lay siege to El Peñón de Argel, the Spanish fortress at the entrance of the harbour. After 22 days enduring artillery fire, the Spanish under Governor Don Martin de Vargas finally surrendered on 29 May 1529, with only 25 men left and without having received help from the Spanish mainland. Vargas was cudgelled to death, the fortress was dismantled, and the stonework used to build a seawall using Christian slaves as manpower.|$|E

2500|$|RTA {{was created}} after a {{referendum}} in 1974. [...] In 1973, CTA had instituted its first major service cuts, and several suburban bus companies, including Evanston Bus Company and Glenview Bus Company had ceased operations, forcing Evanston {{to make arrangements}} with CTA and Wilmette to start a municipal service. The Rock Island and Milwaukee Road were already facing financial distress, which would lead to their eventual bankruptcy, and the Illinois Central was petitioning the Interstate Commerce Commission to increase commuter fares, {{on the basis that}} the cost of operating its commuter train system was a burden on interstate commerce. While several suburbs had organized Mass Transit Districts to purchase equipment for the carriers with federal financial assistance, the Rock Island was still operating old equipment that it could not replace. In an attempt to deal with these problems in the six-county area, the RTA was established, with some taxing powers, to provide <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>through</b> grants to the CTA and suburban mass transit districts, and purchase of service agreements with the private bus and rail operators.|$|E
2500|$|Macedonia was {{a region}} disputed between Greece, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria (created at the Congress of Berlin). On , the feast {{day of the}} Prophet Elijah (Bulg. Ilinden), the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising, {{sponsored}} by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, began. The uprising failed, and Turkish reprisals were severe, with 2,000 killed and villages and homes razed. Following these events, many Greeks became concerned {{with the level of}} Bulgarian activity in Macedonia. The Ethniki Etairia (National Society) was set up, which sent armed bands of Greeks (makedonomakhoi), tacitly aided by the government in Athens, which provided <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>through</b> its consular agents such as Ion Dragoumis and training from military advisers such as Pavlos Melas. This began what is known in Greece as the [...] "Macedonian Struggle", where Greeks clashed with Bulgarian komitadjis, while both sides clashed with the Ottoman army and gendarmerie. Reprisals took many forms, including pillage, arson and assassination. [...] Deeply concerned, the Western powers decided to intervene. The eventual plan was for an administrative reorganisation of the region that would allow for an ethnic-based partition. Thus, each of the ethnic groups concerned sought to strengthen its position so as to gain a maximum of territory when the potential partition came. The successes and sacrifices of young officers such as Melas restored the image of part of the army. In turn, the meddling of the European powers in internal Ottoman affairs contributed to the outbreak of the Young Turk Revolution of July 1908, which {{put an end to the}} Greek-Bulgarian clashes in Macedonia.|$|E

Overall, we can say that our results indicate that chains that use franchising more intensively increase their growth rates and possibilities of survival.
