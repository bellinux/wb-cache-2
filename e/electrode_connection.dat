The circuits present multilayered structures containing {{tens of thousands}} of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions (JJs) of various sizes interconnected by four Nb wiring layers, resistors, and other circuit elements. In order to be operational, the integrated circuits should be fabricated such that the critical currents of Josephson junctions remain within the tight design margins and the proper relationships between the critical currents of JJs of different sizes are preserved. We present experimental data and discuss mechanisms of process-induced variations of the critical current and energy gap of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions in integrated circuits. We demonstrate that the Josephson critical current may depend on the type and area of circuit elements connected to the junction, on the circuit pattern, and on the step in the fabrication process at which the connection is made.

40|$|The cathode {{process of}} {{hydrogen}} evolution in chlorate cells, including possible depolarization, {{has not been}} studied to date. High hydrogen polariza-tion at graphite electrodes delayed the industrial application of bipolar cells for more than 80 years. A new method of depolarization has been developed which consists of depositing on the cathode side of a graphite electrode metallic chromium and/or an addition of small amounts of molybdate. The finely divided cathode molybdenum deposit decreases the cathode polarization for the hydrogen evolution reaction (h. e. r.) ~ The Tafel lines obtained on metallized graphite exhibit nearly the same slopes as the ones for the parent metals, but are shifted to more positive values. This represents a further ex-tension of the methods for depolarized hydrogen cathode evolution with metallized graphite (8, 9). Bipolar chlorate cells have found recent acceptance in industry because of their high permissible current densities, low potential drops in the electrodes, simple design, and high capacity (1, 2). The bipolar construc-tion of the cell allows copper bus bars and their con-nections to graphite lectrodes to be almost completely eliminated (except {{for the first and}} the last <b>electrode</b> <b>connection).</b> Thus, contact resistances are practically avoided.

40|$|Miniature {{inchworm}} actuators {{that would}} have relatively simple designs have been proposed for applications {{in which there are}} requirements for displacements of the order of microns or tens of microns and for the ability to hold their positions when electric power is not applied. The proposed actuators would be members of the class of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), but would be designed and fabricated following an approach that is somewhat unusual for MEMS. Like other MEMS actuators, the proposed inchworm actuators could utilize thermoplastic, bimetallic, shape-memory-alloy, or piezoelectric actuation principles. The figure depicts a piezoelectric inchworm actuator according to the proposal. As in other inchworm actuators, linear motion of an extensible member would be achieved by lengthening and shortening the extensible member in synchronism with alternately clamping and releasing one and then {{the other end of the}} member. In this case, the moving member would be the middle one; the member would be piezoelectric and would be shortened by applying a voltage to it. The two outer members would also be piezoelectric; the release of the clamps on the upper or lower end would be achieved by applying a voltage to the electrodes on the upper or lower ends, respectively, of these members. Usually, MEMS actuators cannot be fabricated directly on the side walls of silicon wafers, yet the geometry of this actuator necessitates such fabrication. The solution, according to the proposal, would be to use the microfabrication technique known by the German acronym LIGA - "lithographie, galvanoformung, abformung," which means lithography, electroforming, molding. LIGA involves x-ray lithography of a polymer film followed by selective removal of material to form a three-dimensional pattern from which a mold is made.

40|$|The thesis {{has dealt}} with the {{electric}} melting of glass in all-electric glass melting furnace. The mathematical modelling based on using the programme Fluent {{has been used for}} observing the processes taking place in all-electric glass melting furnace. The Fluent has solved the mass, momentum and heat transfer, but this programme has not contained the solution of an electric multiphase current field.

The fundamental differential equations describing the mass, momentum and heat transfers have been introduced {{in the first half of}} the theoretical part of the thesis. The relations characterising the electric multiphase current field and the method of its simplification using symbolic method based on the phasors have been described as well. The method of determining of the electric boundary conditions, i. e. determining of the electric potential on the electrodes needed for solution of the electric multiphase current field, has been worked out within the framework of the theoretical part. The relations have been derived for the electrodes fed by A. C. power supplies represented by one-phased or three-phased transformers. The verification of the programme Fluent modified by user subroutines and verification of the calculation of electric boundary conditions comparing with the results from the physical model has been the first problem solved in the experimental part. The parameters of the mathematical model have been identical with the parameters of the physical model. The results from the both models have been in good accord.

40|$|Purpose: The authors {{purpose is}} to model {{the case of an}} implantable pulse {{generator}} (IPG) and the electrode of an active implantable medical device using lumped circuit elements in order to analyze their effect on radio frequency induced tissue heating problem during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Methods: In this study, IPG case and electrode are modeled with a voltage source and impedance. Values of these parameters are found using the modified transmission line method (MoTLiM) and the method of moments (MoM) simulations. Once the parameter values of an electrode/IPG case model are determined, they can be connected to any lead, and tip heating can be analyzed. To validate these models, both MoM simulations and MR experiments were used. The induced currents on the leads with the IPG case or electrode connections were solved using the proposed models and the MoTLiM. These results were compared with the MoM simulations. In addition, an electrode was connected to a lead via an inductor. The dissipated power on the electrode was calculated using the MoTLiM by changing the inductance and the results were compared with the specific absorption rate results that were obtained using MoM. Then, MRI experiments were conducted to test the IPG case and the electrode models. To test the IPG case, a bare lead was connected to the case and placed inside a uniform phantom. During a MRI scan, the temperature rise at the lead was measured by changing the lead length. The power at the lead tip for the same scenario was also calculated using the IPG case model and MoTLiM. Then, an electrode was connected to a lead via an inductor and placed inside a uniform phantom. During a MRI scan, the temperature rise at the electrode was measured by changing the inductance and compared with the dissipated power on the electrode resistance. Results: The induced currents on leads with the IPG case or <b>electrode</b> <b>connection</b> were solved for using the combination of the MoTLiM and the proposed lumped circuit models. These results were compared with those from the MoM simulations. The mean square error was less than 9 %. During the MRI experiments, when the IPG case was introduced, the resonance lengths were calculated to have an error less than 13 %. Also the change in tip temperature rise at resonance lengths was predicted with less than 4 % error. For the electrode experiments, the value of the matching impedance was predicted with an error less than 1 %. Conclusions: Electrical models for the IPG case and electrode are suggested, and the method is proposed to determine the parameter values. The concept of matching of the electrode to the lead is clarified using the defined electrode impedance and the lead Thevenin impedance. The effect of the IPG case and electrode on tip heating can be predicted using the proposed theory. With these models, understanding the tissue heating due to the implants becomes easier. Also, these models are beneficial for implant safety testers and designers. Using these models, worst case conditions can be determined and the corresponding implant test experiments can be planned. © 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|E
40|$|Lithium ion {{conducting}} membranes (LICMs) {{are important}} to protect the lithium metal electrode and act {{as a barrier to}} crossover species such as redox mediators in Li-O 2 cells, polysulphides in Li-S systems or impurities formed by oxidation reactions in high voltage Li-ion materials [1]. We present an in-situ method and cell design for measuring permeability of LICMs to mediator (or other) species. The method employs a ‘Swagelok’ cell design equipped with four <b>electrode</b> <b>connections</b> (Figure 1 a). Mediator species are placed initially in the counter electrode compartment only. Permeability through the LICM (which separates working and counter electrodes) is determined using a square wave voltammetry (SWV) technique that allows evaluation of the concentration of crossover species over time. Figure 1 b shows SWV scans recorded at a glassy carbon electrode in a Swagelok cell containing an LICM and an ethyl viologen mediator. Additional experiments have shown that: the cell is well-sealed with gaskets, ruling out any ‘leakage’ of mediator species around the membrane; glassy carbon is better (more sensitive) than other materials as a working electrode; pulsed voltammetry is better (more sensitive and stable) than cyclic voltammetry in detecting crossover species. Relative to previous approaches to studying permeability which employed H-type cells and/or ex-situ techniques such as XRD and XPS of the lithium metal surface or elemental analysis of the electrolyte [2 - 4], the new cell design and method offer advantages in terms of low electrolyte volume, facile and in-situ measurement, and, thanks to the four <b>electrode</b> <b>connections,</b> ability to take measurements before and after passing current lithium ion current through the membrane.

50|$|This {{is a type}} of {{fuel cell}} that instead of being {{designed}} to produce power, is designed to produce a signal current that is precisely related to the amount of the target gas (in this case carbon monoxide) in the atmosphere. Measurement of the current gives a measure of the concentration of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. Essentially the electrochemical cell consists of a container, two <b>electrodes,</b> <b>connection</b> wires and an electrolyte - typically sulfuric acid. Carbon monoxide is oxidized at one electrode to carbon dioxide while oxygen is consumed at the other electrode. For carbon monoxide detection, the electrochemical cell has advantages over other technologies in that it has a highly accurate and linear output to carbon monoxide concentration, requires minimal power as it is operated at room temperature, and has a long lifetime (typically commercial available cells now have lifetimes of five years or greater). Until recently, the cost of these cells and concerns about their long term reliability had limited uptake of this technology in the marketplace, although these concerns are now largely overcome. This technology is now the dominant technology in USA and Europe.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA novel {{vertical}} nanoporous {{structure is}} reported {{as a starting}} point for the fabrication of a fully-surround gate field effect transistor (FET) based on well-ordered nanostructures array. The proposed porous stacking is perfectly suited both for the collective organization of high density (up to 1011. cm- 2) arrays of nanostructures like nanowires (NWs) or nanotubes (NTs), as with calibrated diameters (during growth), as well as for easing the Source, Gate, and Drain <b>electrodes</b> <b>connections</b> for individual or groups of nanostructures. Moreover the unique fully-surround gate architecture enables a quasi-ideal coupling between the gate and the channel, theoretically leading to improved devices performance and reduced global power consumption. In this paper we describe the main steps for this versatile and lithography-free technique to fabricate a multi-layer porous template down to the nanometer scale, as well as the first nanostructures (carbon NTs) growth attempts inside such functional template. We highlight the fact that the proposed porous structure may acts as a passive template for the one-dimensional nanomaterials growth as well as an active element in the future device. The proposed approach is in line with bottom-up fabrication approach to provide smaller devices, and is fully-compatible with classical processes used in the silicon industry...|$|R

In the case of alginate beads entrapping carbon nanotubes (CNTs), SECM allows evidencing of the local conductivity, organization,and communication between the CNTs. It shows that the CNT network is active enough to allow long range charge evacuation, enabling the use of alginate/CNT beads as soft 3 D <b>electrodes.</b> Direct <b>connection</b> or local interrogation by a microelectrode allows visualization of their communication as anetwork and eventually the study of them individually at the nanoscale...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} a microdischarge-based approach for sensing the diaphragm deflec-tion in a monolithically fabricated pressure sensor. This transduc-tion approach is appealing {{from the viewpoint of}} miniaturization. The device consists of a deflecting Si diaphragm with a sensing cathode, and a glass substrate with an anode and a reference cath-ode. The total exterior volume of the device is 0. 05 mm 3; typical electrode size and separations are 35 and 10 µm. Pulsed microdis-charges are initiated in a sealed chamber formed between Si and glass chips, and are filled with Ar gas. External pressure deflects the Si diaphragm and changes the interelectrode spacing, thereby redistributing the current between the anode and two competing cathodes. The differential current is indicative of the diaphragm deflection which is determined by the external pressure. A 6 -mask microfabrication process is investigated for device fabrication. <b>Electrode</b> <b>connections</b> to the interior of the chamber are provided by laser drilling and copper electroplating through high aspect ratio glass vias. The Si and glass substrates are bonded by Au-In eutectic. The redistribution of plasma current between competing cathodes, as a consequence of diaphragm deflection over a range of pressure, was experimentally demonstrated. First principles modeling of transient microdischarges have provided insights to the fundamental processes responsible for the differential current and guidance for scaling the device to smaller dimension.
