Although this area was relatively remote and unsettled at the time of UCLA's founding, decades of growth in the area around campus means that UCLA <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> suburban location it once was.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary press {{reaction}} to 2K and their Barbican performance was mixed but mostly negative. Since then, however, The Observer have {{held up the}} Barbican show as the model of a pop performance. [...] "At one unfortunately memorable Stereophonics gig ...", the paper said, [...] "the extent of Richard Jones' showmanship was to play his bass while standing on a rug.... this <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> pyjama-clad KLF, horns strapped to their heads, whizzing around the Barbican in wheelchairs with Zodiac Mindwarp in a pulpit and hundreds of sacked Liverpool dockers yelling [...] "Fuck the millennium!" [...] at the tops of their voices ..." [...] Likewise, a 1999 feature on Drummond and Cauty in The Irish Times reported their millennium activities with some warmth. [...] "As {{a critique of the}} sponsor-saturated multi-million pound Millennium Dome," [...] the editorial ran, [...] "the 'people's pyramid' is unsurpassed." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{found some}} of Stargate's {{succeeding}} works {{a replica of}} Irreplaceables musical formula. Sheffield commented that, in the song [...] "Tattoo" [...] by Sparks, the team [...] "have no shame about churning out 'Irreplaceable' replicants forever", reprising the acoustic guitar-drum loop formula. The New York Times music critic Kelefa Sanneh deemed it [...] "sounds like a cousin" [...] of [...] "Irreplaceable". The release of R singer Chris Brown's 2007 single [...] "With You" [...] produced similar impressions: Sheffield, in his review for Brown's album, noted that [...] "Stargate {{was just trying to}} roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time". Hillary Crosley of Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "With You" [...] "leans a bit too heavily" [...] toward [...] "Irreplaceable". Stylus Magazine also noted that Rihanna's Stargate produced single, [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] was a rehash of Ne-Yo and Stargate's previous works saying, [...] "Here you've got the 'Sexy Love' drums, the 'Irreplaceable' strum, and a bit of the synth and chorus melody from 'So Sick'... <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> new twist all these old bits need to sound fresh." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She {{noted that the}} episode suffered from a [...] "bland story" [...] filled with [...] "bland teens", noting that the actors playing the three main teenagers were [...] "as generic as can be". Vitaris ultimately concluded that [...] "'Rush' <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> worst of The X-Files; it's merely forgettable." [...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode, arguing that the show was re-using plot lines and that the personalities of the teenagers were wholly uninteresting. He wrote, [...] "This episode unfolds with a bland sense of familiarity. Once again, troubled adolescents are toying with paranormal forces that can only get them into further trouble. Sadly, these adolescents lack interesting personalities, and the force in question remains wholly mysterious." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that the episode was [...] "Not brilliant, but moderately entertaining." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. Despite praising the episode's set pieces, they ultimately concluded that [...] "The X-Files just isn't cool anymore daddio." ...|$|E
2500|$|British {{newspaper}} The Times gave a mixed review. Despite Toby Young awarding {{the film}} three stars out of five, he critiqued, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> freshest romantic comedy of past 20 years. Taking the best bits from other movies and rearranging {{them in a}} non-linear sequence does not make for an original film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Simson Garfinkel, an {{entrepreneur}} {{and professor of}} computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School, says Kurzweil's pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM) is misnamed because of the word [...] "theory", he feels {{it is not a}} theory since it cannot be tested. Garfinkel rejects Kurzweil's one-algorithm approach instead saying [...] "the brain is likely to have many more secrets and algorithms than the one Kurzweil describes". Garfinkel caricatures Kurzweil's plan for artificial intelligence as [...] "build something that can learn, then give it stuff to learn", which he thinks <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> [...] "secret of human thought" [...] promised by the subtitle of the book.|$|E
2500|$|Austen {{might be}} known now for her [...] "romances," [...] but the marriages {{that take place}} in her novels engage with {{economics}} and class distinction. Pride and Prejudice <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> exception. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome, though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy will become: [...] "Will the shades of Pemberley be thus polluted?" [...] Though Elizabeth responds to Lady Catherine's accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy are [...] "equals"), Lady Catherine refuses to accept Darcy's actual marriage to Elizabeth even as the novel closes.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have also}} said it is {{detrimental}} to the presumption of innocence. [...] "It's {{a way for the}} police to try their case in the press and to get the intimation of guilt by virtue of an arrest," [...] says New York Civil Liberties Union director Donna Lieberman. [...] "The question is, does it poison the right to a fair trial? And that depends on each case." [...] Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice observed that [...] "nder such circumstances, even Mother Teresa would look extremely suspicious, especially if her hands were cuffed behind her back." [...] Acknowledging a common response to such criticisms, that no arrested defendant is spared the perp walk, law professor Patricia Williams says [...] "the perp walk is a social equalizer all right, but not in a good way" [...] since the United States leads the world in incarceration rates. [...] " [...] <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> greatest icon of equal rights".|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{problems}} with Dershowitz's {{heavy reliance on}} Morris. The first is that Morris <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> left-wing peacenik that Dershowitz makes him out to be, which means that calling him as a witness in Israel's defense is not very helpful to the case. The more important problem {{is that many of}} the points Dershowitz cites Morris as supporting—that the early Zionists wanted peaceful coexistence with the Arabs, that the Arabs began the 1948 War to destroy Israel, that the Arabs were guilty of many massacres while the Israelis were scrupulous about protecting human rights, and that the Arabs fled at the behest of their leaders rather than being ethnically cleansed by the Israel Defense Forces—turn out to be based on a partial reading or misreading of Morris's books. Finkelstein documents these charges in exhaustive detail in Appendix II of his book and the preponderance of evidence he provides is conclusive." [...] (30–31) ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{study in}} 2008 {{concluded}} that a contributing factor to the Israeli Defense Force's defeat in the Israeli-Hezbollah Conflict in the Summer of 2006 was {{due in large part}} to an over reliance on EBO concepts. However, contrary to this opinion, Dag Henriksen, PhD, Royal Norwegian Air Force Academy, highlights the reality that [...] "the absence of a clearly identified military strategy for war or of one’s objectives reduces the relevance of the concept of EBO—or, indeed, of any military concept. In other words, if you do not know where you are going, the means to get there <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> key problem. Thus, one risks cherry-picking the variable (in this case EBO) that actually played a subordinate role in the negative outcome for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during this conflict. Logically, these factors render this particular conflict largely unsuitable as an empirical foundation for harshly criticizing EBO." [...] Henriksen's study finds that the Israeli campaign in 2006 does not provide sufficient empirical evidence of flaws in EBO.|$|E
2500|$|Today, Byrdmaniax is {{generally}} regarded as The Byrds' weakest album, {{as well as the}} least popular of any of the band's releases amongst their fanbase. [...] Mark Deming, writing for the Allmusic website, has summed up the album by concluding [...] "Not an awful album, but Byrdmaniax <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> pleasure it could have been {{in the hands of a}} more tasteful production team." [...] In his 2000 review for The Austin Chronicle, Raoul Hernandez gave the album a rating of three stars out of five, commenting [...] "Byrdmaniax may be as disjointed as reviews claimed at the time, but most of these same critics didn't like Sweetheart of the Rodeo either, and if the Gram Parsons-blessed classic is ground zero for 'country rock' then Maniax is full-blown 'gospel rock'." [...] Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke noted in 2000 that Byrdmaniax suffered not just from Melcher's inappropriate orchestration but also from being a Byrds' album that is almost totally bereft of The Byrds' signature sound. [...] Fricke noted that the familiar chime of McGuinn's 12-string Rickenbacker guitar is lost beneath the overbearing strings and the band's trademark harmonies are also largely absent from the album.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Fred Anderson {{says that}} Washington's Providence was, [...] "a {{generally}} benevolent, {{as well as}} an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being, but He <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> kind of warm and loving God embraced by the evangelical Protestants." ...|$|R

2500|$|Commentator Andrew Sullivan {{wrote an}} article in The New Republic accusing the liberal media of {{political}} correctness and using Dirkhising's death to attack the Human Rights Campaign for its support of hate-crime legislation. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), however, complained that The Washington Times [...] "omitted a key piece of information" [...] for its front-page story on Dirkhising: The HRC had provided a statement strongly condemning the crime and called for the perpetrators to be punished [...] "to the fullest extent of the law." [...] Sullivan also criticized {{some aspects of the}} conservative coverage of the Dirkhising case equating gay sex with child molestation as [...] "ugly nonsense". Sullivan squarely summed up the differences in media coverage as being due to political interests. Sullivan stated that whereas the Shepherd case was used to support including LGBT people in federal hate-crime law the Dirkhising case was ignored for concerns of inciting anti-gay prejudice. In November 1999, E. R. Shipp, ombudsman at The Washington Post, noted that [...] "readers, prodded by commentators who are hostile to LGBT people and to what they view as a 'liberal' press" [...] had raised questions about the Dirkhising case. Shipp said, however, that she [...] "made a clear distinction" [...] between the Dirkhising and Shepard cases: [...] "Matthew Shepard's death sparked public expressions of outrage that themselves became news[...] [...] [...] That Jesse Dirkhising's death has not done so <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> fault of The Washington Post." [...] Shipp also noted that the Shepherd story was newsworthy because of the debate it fostered on hate crimes and the level of intolerance towards LGBT people in the United States.|$|E
