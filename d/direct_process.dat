40|$|Neutrino (antineutrino) {{scattering}} off ^ 12 C is one {{of various}} important key reactions for ν-process in the nucleosysnthesis of light nuclei. Most of neutrino-nucleus scattering are considered through indirect processes within the energy range from a few to tens of MeV. Target nuclei are excited by incident neutrino (antineutrino) through various transitions, and subsequently decay into other nuclei with emitting particles. But, <b>direct</b> <b>processes</b> are also feasible, in which incident neutrino (antineutrino) strips directly one nucleon from target nuclei. Consequently, <b>direct</b> <b>processes</b> may affect abundances of ^ 11 C and ^ 11 B additionally to indirect <b>processes.</b> We investigate <b>direct</b> neutrino (antineutrino) quasi-elastic scattering off ^ 12 C around the energy region liberating one nucleon and discuss implications of <b>direct</b> <b>processes</b> in the nucleosynthesis. The <b>direct</b> <b>processes</b> might be comparable to the indirect processes if the final state interaction is taken into account. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
5|$|The {{direct or}} American process starts with diverse {{contaminated}} zinc composites, such as zinc ores or smelter by-products. The zinc precursors are reduced (carbothermal reduction) by heating with {{a source of}} carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor, which is then oxidized as in the indirect process. Because of the lower purity of the source material, the final product is also of lower quality in the <b>direct</b> <b>process</b> {{as compared to the}} indirect one.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} resolution {{process is}} the procedure by which, starting from the CRID of a given content, one or several locators of that content are obtained. Resolving a CRID can be a <b>direct</b> <b>process,</b> which leads immediately to one or many locators, or it may also happen {{that in the first}} place one or many intermediate CRIDs are returned, which must undergo the same procedure to finally obtain one or several locators.|$|E

[...] Typically raw oil shale particles between [...] and [...] in size are {{fed into the}} top of the retort and are heated by the rising hot gases, which pass through the descending oil shale, thereby causing decomposition of the kerogen at about [...] Shale oil mist, evolved gases and cooled combustion gases are removed {{from the top of the}} retort then moved to separation equipment.

[...] He was forced to turn over his passport, pay a $50,000 bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the <b>direct</b> <b>process</b> of the court. On February 17, Gettleman sentenced Trudeau to 30 days in jail and forfeiture of the $50,000 bond. Well-known critic of Trudeau, Stephen Barrett, the creator of Quackwatch.org, [...] "has for years labeled Trudeau a fraud" [...] and was quoted: [...] "He struck me as somebody who (believes he) is omnipotent.

2500|$|In 1861, the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay {{developed}} a more <b>direct</b> <b>process</b> for producing soda ash from salt and limestone {{through the use}} of ammonia. [...] The only waste product of this Solvay process was calcium chloride, and so it was both more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method. [...] From the late 1870s, Solvay-based soda works on the European continent provided stiff competition in their home markets to the Leblanc-based British soda industry. Additionally the Brunner Mond Solvay plant which opened in 1874 at Winnington near Northwich provided fierce competition nationally. Leblanc producers were unable to compete with Solvay soda ash, and their soda ash production was effectively an adjunct to their still profitable production of chlorine, bleaching powder etc. (The unwanted by-products had become the profitable products). [...] The development of electrolytic methods of chlorine production removed that source of profits as well, and there followed a decline moderated only by [...] "gentlemen's' agreements" [...] with Solvay producers. By 1900, 90% of the world's soda production was through the Solvay method, or on the North American continent, through the mining of trona, discovered in 1938, which caused the closure of the last North American Solvay plant in 1986. [...] The last Leblanc-based soda ash plant closed in the early 1920s. [...] However, because of solubility of the bicarbonate, the Solvay process does not work for the manufacture of potassium carbonate, and the Leblanc process continued in limited use for its manufacture until much later.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the study of the {{statistical}} properties of the scattering matrix S for quantum chaotic scattering in the presence of <b>direct</b> <b>processes</b> (charaterized by a nonzero average S matrix) can be reduced to the simpler case where <b>direct</b> <b>processes</b> are absent (= 0). Our result is verified with a numerical simulation of the two-energy autocorrelation for two-dimensional S matrices. It is also used to extend Wigner's time delay distribution for one-dimensional S matrices, recently found for = 0, to the case not equal to zero; this extension is verified numerically. As a consequence of our result, future calculations can be restricted to the simpler case of no <b>direct</b> <b>processes.</b> Comment: 9 pages (Latex) and 1 EPS figure.

60|$|There {{are also}} {{two or three}} of the {{principal}} laws of space or extension which are unusually fitted for rendering one position or magnitude a mark of another, and thereby contributing to render the science largely deductive. First, the magnitudes of inclosed spaces, whether superficial or solid, are completely determined by the magnitudes of the lines and angles which bound them. Secondly, the length of any line, whether straight or curve, is measured (certain other things being given) by the angle which it subtends, and vicè versa. Lastly, the angle which any two straight lines make with each other at an inaccessible point, is measured by the angles they severally make with any third line we choose to select. By means of these general laws, the measurement of all lines, angles, and spaces whatsoever might be accomplished by measuring a single straight line and a sufficient number of angles; which is the plan actually pursued in the trigonometrical survey of a country; and fortunate it is that this is practicable, the exact measurement of long straight lines being always difficult, and often impossible, but that of angles very easy. Three such generalizations as the foregoing afford such facilities for the indirect measurement of magnitudes (by supplying us with known lines or angles which are marks of the magnitude of unknown ones, and thereby of the spaces which they inclose), that it is easily intelligible how from a few data we can go on to ascertain the magnitude of an indefinite multitude of lines, angles, and spaces, which we could not easily, or could not at all, measure by any more <b>direct</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} chaotic {{scattering}} in presence of <b>direct</b> <b>processes</b> or prompt responses is mapped via a transformation {{to the case}} of scattering in absence of such processes for non-unitary scattering matrices, S̃. In the absence of prompt responses, S̃ is uniformly distributed according to its invariant measure in the space of S̃ matrices with zero average, = 0. In the presence of <b>direct</b> <b>processes,</b> the distribution of S̃ is non-uniform and it is characterized by the average (≠ 0). In contrast {{to the case of}} unitary matrices S, where the invariant measures of S for chaotic scattering with and without <b>direct</b> <b>processes</b> are related through the well known Poisson kernel, here we show that for non-unitary scattering matrices the invariant measures are related by the Poisson kernel squared. Our results are relevant to situations where flux conservation is not satisfied.
