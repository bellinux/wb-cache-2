5|$|The period since Madsen's {{monograph}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> a great {{expansion in}} studies dealing with topics concerning Allosaurus in life (paleobiological and paleoecological topics).

Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large 'allosaur' specimens), new discoveries in Portugal, and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.|$|E

25|$|Another {{implication}} of histone acetylation {{is to provide}} a platform for protein binding. As a posttranslational modification, the acetylation of histones can attract proteins to elongated chromatin that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> acetyl groups. It has been hypothesized that the histone tails offer recognition sites that attract proteins responsible for transcriptional activation. Unlike histone core proteins, histone tails {{are not part of the}} nucleosome core and are exposed to protein interaction. A model proposed that the acetylation of H3 histones activates gene transcription by attracting other transcription related complexes. Therefore, the acetyl mark provides a site for protein recognition where transcription factors interact with the acetylated histone tails via their bromodomain.|$|E
