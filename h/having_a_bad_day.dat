25|$|Fern was {{extremely}} successful in her lifetime as a columnist. She {{was said to}} fit her material and subject matter to the audience. Many readers of weekly literary papers were women, and Fern addressed them in a conversational style, often using interjections and exclamation points, while tackling topics that concerned the daily life of ordinary women. Her readers were wives and mothers who worried about their children, current fashions, difficult husbands, and aggravating relatives. Sometimes they felt oppressed, depressed, or stressed. Fern expressed their problems in plain language, addressing women's suffrage, the woman's right to her children in a divorce, unfaithful husbands, social customs that restricted women's freedom, and sometimes just <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Bad Day" [...] {{were said to}} have a {{universal}} appeal by Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine as they have an [...] "everyman breeziness" [...] because the song's subject can be any person going through a bad daytime. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as: [...] "a loping, sunny tune that pretty much has the opposite sentiment of its title". Although About.com's Bill Lamb described its lyrics as having a [...] "reassuring, comforting" [...] tone, Powter said the song [...] "mak fun of self-absorbed and narcissistic people who bitch and gripe". He also affirmed: [...] "It's not literally about <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>day,</b> it's more about not taking yourself too seriously and complaining about trivial things".|$|E

[...] Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Kamin gave the bridge four stars (out of a possible four) in his review and admires [...] how [...] "computers have given Gehry unparalleled formal freedom" [...] to design [...] "the complexity of its geometry" [...] and multidimensional curvatures. The bridge provides views of both the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and Lake Michigan {{in a way that}} Kamin says makes it a belvedere. Kamin also recommends anyone <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>day</b> to stroll across the bridge, adding, [...] "You won't get where you're going quickly, but you'll feel a whole lot better once you're done." ...|$|E

Khan was pleased to work with Menon and identified with the film due to its [...] "modern, slightly unorthodox take on relationships". He borrowed several real-life experiences for his character, and in preparation, trained at the JW Marriott Hotels in Mumbai. The film received generally positive reviews with several commentators believing that it was Khan's best performance to that point. Anupama Chopra wrote: [...] "Khan get his groove back... doesn’t play Roshan as a hero <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>day.</b> He gives us a flawed, fumbling man {{who is trying to}} repair the broken chords of his life." [...] As with his last few releases, Rangoon and Chef earned little at the box office leading trade analysts to question his commercial appeal.|$|E

You can accuse me of lots of things – of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>day,</b> of missing chances, of many things – but I have always had ambition and always will have. I think I have proved that on the pitch with Zaragoza, Sporting, UD Langreo, and the national team." [...] In October 2008, Kaká praised Villa: speaking to Canal+, he claimed that Villa is [...] "the best Spanish footballer" [...] adding that, [...] "The player with whom I would most like to play is David Villa of Valencia."

Meyers also praised Swartzwelder's script. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict commented that how an episode that starts with Bart <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>day</b> can lead to him being tried for murder {{as the head of the}} local Mafia [...] "is just one of the amazing monuments to this show's superiority." ...|$|E
