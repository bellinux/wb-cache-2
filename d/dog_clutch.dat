2500|$|In 1952 and 1953, {{a larger}} 2.0-litre petrol engine was fitted. This engine has Siamese bores, meaning {{that there are}} no water {{passages}} for cooling between the cylinders. During 1950, the unusual semi-permanent 4WD system was replaced with a more conventional setup, with drive to the front axle being taken through a simple <b>dog</b> <b>clutch.</b> Around this time the Land Rover's legal status was also clarified. As mentioned above, the Land Rover was originally classed as a commercial vehicle, meaning it was free from purchase tax. However, this also meant it was limited to a speed of [...] on British roads. After an appeal to the Law Lords after an owner was charged with exceeding this limit, the Land Rover was classified as a [...] "multi-purpose vehicle" [...] which was only to be classed as a commercial vehicle if used for commercial purposes.|$|E

50|$|The {{installation}} of these engines was somewhat unorthodox, necessitated by the limited funds for new work. The rear engine was started first by compressed air starting, then the front engine was started through a mechanical friction clutch. Once synchronised, they were locked {{together with a}} <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> for the record attempt. The car's last run was a demonstration circuit at Brooklands, running at slow speed on only one engine, with this <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> disconnected.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>clutches</b> {{are used}} where slip is {{undesirable}} and/or the clutch {{is not used}} to control torque. Without slippage, <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> are not affected by wear {{in the same way}} that friction clutches are.|$|R
50|$|The {{slipper clutch}} {{consists}} of two bases, one with <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> and ramps with ball bearings, a splined hub, and clutch plates. In normal operation, the <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> mate, driving the transmission. When a back torque comes from the transmission, the splined hub slides up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the clutch plates and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|R

5000|$|The now {{ubiquitous}} constant-mesh gearboxes, {{which can}} include non-synchronised, or synchronized/synchromesh systems, where typically diagonal cut helical (or sometimes either straight-cut, or double-helical) gear sets are constantly [...] "meshed" [...] together, and a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is used for}} changing gears. On synchromesh boxes, friction cones or [...] "synchro-rings" [...] are used {{in addition to the}} <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> to closely match the rotational speeds of {{the two sides of the}} (declutched) transmission before making a full mechanical engagement.|$|E

50|$|Some {{clutches}} are {{not designed}} to slip; torque may only be transmitted either fully engaged or disengaged to avoid catastrophic damage. An {{example of this is}} the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch,</b> most commonly used in non-synchromesh transmissions.|$|E
50|$|The clutch that mates {{the engine}} to the {{transmission}} in a modern manual-shift automobile is a friction clutch whose disc and pressure plate are smooth; they lock up simply through friction. However, some kinds of clutches (including those inside an automatic transmission) may lock up via the engagement of dogs, rather than only through friction. These <b>clutches</b> are called <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> and the <b>dogs</b> used within them are called <b>clutch</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In engineering, a dog {{is a tool}} or part of a {{tool that}} {{prevents}} movement or imparts movement by offering physical obstruction or engagement of some kind. It may hold another object in place by blocking it, clamping it, or otherwise obstructing its movement. Or it may couple various parts together so that they move in unison - the primary example of this being a flexible drive to mate two shafts in order to transmit torque. Some devices use <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> to lock together two spinning components. In a manual transmission, the <b>dog</b> <b>clutches,</b> or [...] "dogs" [...] lock the selected gear to the shaft it rotates on. Unless the dog is engaged, the gear will simply freewheel on the shaft.|$|R
5000|$|Greatly {{simplified}} single-revolution clutches {{were developed}} in the 20th century, requiring much smaller operating forces and in some variations, allowing for a fixed fraction of a revolution per operation. [...] Fast action friction <b>clutches</b> replaced <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> in some applications, eliminating the problem of impact loading on the dogs every time the clutch engaged.|$|R
5000|$|The reverse turbine had 4 rows of blades. It {{was engaged}} by a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch,</b> {{activated}} when the reverser lever {{was set to}} [...] "0". This was originally steam-operated by a small piston and cylinder.|$|E
50|$|A {{good example}} of a simple <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> {{can be found in}} a Sturmey-Archer bicycle hub gear, where a sliding cross-shaped clutch is used to lock the driver {{assembly}} to different parts of the planetary geartrain.|$|E
50|$|Among many {{different}} types of clutches, a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> provides non-slip coupling of two rotating members. It is not at all suited to intentional slipping, in contrast with the foot-operated friction clutch of a manual-transmission car.|$|E
50|$|The 9HP is only 0.24 inches (6mm) longer than, {{and weighs}} 16.5 lbs (7.5 kg) less than, the {{outgoing}} six-speed transmission. The compact packaging {{is achieved by}} using a number of innovative design features: a new compact hydraulic vane-type pump, two patented <b>dog</b> <b>clutches,</b> which replace bulkier conventional clutch packs, and a nested gear set.|$|R

But a <b>dog,</b> <b>clutched</b> {{by the neck}} from the back, can never be a match for two men, gifted with the {{intelligence}} and deftness of men, each of them two-handed with four fingers and an opposable thumb to each hand.|$|R
50|$|The Tossers are a six-piece Celtic punk {{band from}} Chicago, Illinois formed in July 1993. They have toured with Murphy's Law, Streetlight Manifesto, Catch 22, Dropkick Murphys, The Reverend Horton Heat, Flogging Molly, Street <b>Dogs,</b> <b>Clutch,</b> Sick of it All & Mastodon. They opened for The Pogues in New York City on St. Patrick's Day, 2007. The Tossers were honored {{to play the}} Kennedy Center in May 2016.|$|R
50|$|Dog {{clutches}} {{are used}} inside manual automotive transmissions to lock different gears to the rotating {{input and output}} shafts. A synchromesh arrangement ensures smooth engagement by matching the shaft speeds before the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> is allowed to engage.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, newer [...] "constant mesh" [...] {{transmissions}} use gears {{that are}} held axially, but gears on one shaft spin freely on the shaft. Gear pairs in the transmission {{are always in}} mesh, though at most one is engaged at any time. Each free-spinning gear has a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> which is engaged by an axial sliding collar that transfers power to the shaft. The <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> may be plain, also called [...] "non-synchromesh", or may use an additional synchromesh mechanism that helps get the parts moving {{at the same speed}} to assist engagement. Many constant mesh transmissions use a sliding-mesh gear for reverse, but since reverse is only engaged from near a stop, it is still easy to engage.|$|E

50|$|From 1913 the Duo was {{available}} {{with an extra}} chain driven countershaft with two gears and <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> before the drive went to the variable pulley arrangement, so that gear ratios extended from 4:1 to 16:1. The price went up with the change from 97 guineas to 106 guineas. In the Cyclecar Club's fuel economy competition the three Duos equipped with Lukin, Stewart-Precision and Solex carburettors recorded fuel consumptions of 40.3, 50.7 and 53.1 miles per gallon respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} driven by two 2 ft wide tracks and on the surface {{steering}} was possible by means of <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> on the gear-box output shafts. When digging, only small changes in direction were possible by means of hydraulically operated steering doors, {{one on each side}} of the machine. There was an arrangement to draw an adjustable amount of spoil back into the trench and under the vehicle's tracks so as to counter any tendency to heel over.|$|R
50|$|There can be {{significant}} backlash in unsynchronized transmissions {{because of the}} intentional gap between dog gears (also known as <b>dog</b> <b>clutches).</b> The gap is necessary so that the driver or electronics can engage the gears easily while synchronizing the engine speed with the driveshaft speed. If there was a smaller clearance, it would be nearly impossible to engage the gears because the teeth would interfere {{with each other in}} most configurations. In synchronized transmissions, synchromesh solves this problem.|$|R
50|$|A form of {{transmission}} brake is commonly fitted to automatic transmissions. These brakes use a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> or pawl system, rather than friction linings. They thus provide {{a simple and}} positive lock when stationary, but cannot (or at least, should not) be engaged when moving.|$|E
50|$|A {{constant-mesh}} transmission {{offers several}} advantages over a sliding-mesh design. First, the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is designed for}} the task, rather than asking the gear to do dual duty of power transmission and sliding engagement. Second, the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> is typically smaller in diameter than the gear it controls, so absolute speeds of the engaging parts are lower, aiding engagement. Thus, while a non-synchromesh transmission still relies on the operator to match speeds, gears are easier to engage. Third, a constant-mesh transmission can easily use helical gears which are smoother, quieter, and can carry more torque for a given size of gear. Fourth, a constant-mesh transmission can use synchromesh for easier shifting; while many heavy vehicle transmissions do not use it, most medium- and light-duty automotive transmissions do.|$|E
50|$|Locking {{the output}} shaft with a gear is {{achieved}} {{by means of a}} <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> selector. The <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> is a sliding selector mechanism which is splined to the output shaft, meaning that its hub has teeth that fit into slots (splines) on the shaft, forcing that shaft to rotate with it. However, the splines allow the selector to move {{back and forth on the}} shaft, which happens when it is pushed by a selector fork that is linked to the gear lever. The fork does not rotate, so it is attached to a collar bearing on the selector. The selector is typically symmetric: it slides between two gears and has a synchromesh and teeth on each side in order to lock either gear to the shaft.|$|E
50|$|The {{shifting}} mechanism was chosen {{with the additional}} input of Richard Ansdale. Space requirements, {{and the length of}} the gear cluster, meant that the selection mechanism would have to be mounted inside the gear cluster, rather than the usual motorcycle arrangement of <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> between the gears, an external drum to control their engagement and forks to connect the two. The mechanism needed to lock the selected gear onto the shaft, never engage more than one at a time, and all had to work at racing speeds.|$|R
50|$|Single-revolution {{clutches}} {{were developed}} in the 19th century to power machinery such as shears or presses where a single pull of the operating lever or (later) press of a button would trip the mechanism, engaging the clutch between the power source and the machine's crankshaft for exactly one revolution before disengaging the clutch. When the clutch is disengaged and the driven member is stationary. Early designs were typically <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> with a cam on the driven member used to disengage the dogs at the appropriate point.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the layout}} of the gearbox, the {{layshaft}} is normally mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The gear lever enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the layshaft. The layshaft gear cluster is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor bronze bushes, or for high-load applications needle rollers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is a type}} of clutch {{that couples}} two {{rotating}} shafts or other rotating components not by friction but by interference. The two parts of the clutch are designed such that one will push the other, causing both to rotate at the same speed and will never slip.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the planes}} {{designed}} and built was Riesenflugzeug ("giant aircraft") AEG R.I. This aircraft was powered by four [...] Mercedes D.IVa engines linked to a combination leather cone and <b>dog</b> <b>clutch.</b> The first flight tests were satisfactory, but on September 3, 1918, the R.I broke {{up in the air}} killing its seven crewmen.|$|E
50|$|All-indirect {{were used}} for some very early cars, before the {{advantages}} of the direct-drive top gear were recognised. They contain no dog clutches; at the time, gear changing was still carried out by sliding the gears in and out of mesh. Once the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> came into use, the further advantage of a direct-drive top gear was immediately recognised.|$|E
50|$|The {{cast-iron}} windshaft {{was probably}} not made for the mill originally. It carries a 9 ft diameter composite brake wheel with 81 cogs which has been converted from clasp arm construction. This drives a cast-iron wallower with 25 teeth. The cast-iron upright shaft is 5 in diameter and in three parts, with <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> at {{the fourth and fifth}} floor. The cast-iron great spur wheel is 5 ft diameter with 76 cogs. It drove three pairs of underdrift millstones of 5 ft, 4 ft and 4 ft diameter.|$|R
5000|$|Frazer Nash {{were strong}} proponents {{of this system}} using one chain per gear {{selected}} by <b>dog</b> <b>clutches.</b> The Frazer Nash chain drive system, (designed for the GN Cyclecar Company by Archibald Frazer-Nash and Henry Ronald Godfrey) was very effective, allowing extremely fast gear selections. The Frazer Nash (or GN) transmission system {{provided the basis for}} many [...] "special" [...] racing cars of the 1920s and 1930s, the most famous being Basil Davenport's Spider which held the outright record at the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|Algolia {{claims a}} number of {{advantages}} for their approach, including speed of response from searching a single site rather than the entire web. Moreover, as Algolia's search can be tailored to the client site, its known structure and its metadata facets, the search offered can be smarter and more site-specific than a generalised web text search. This improves the relevance of search results as searching may take the semantics of site content into account. A web site selling both puppies and <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> could avoid the search confusions and homonymy that bedevil the simple text-based search approaches.|$|R
