40|$|Today, the {{insulation}} of overhead transmission lines with composite insulators is common practice world-wide. A large variety of designs of such insulators {{is available on}} the market for all currently used service voltage levels. It is well known that the electrical field distribution of insulator sets equipped with composite insulators differ from those equipped with “conven-tional “ insulators (ceramic longrod, ceramic or glass cap and pin type insulators). Generally, the field distribution of a composite longrod <b>insulator</b> <b>set</b> is more non-linear than of a set with conventional insulators. This is caused by missing intermediate metal parts and by the dielectric material characteristics of the polymeric materials used for composite insulators. The field distribution along non-polluted composite insulators is mainly influenced by the earth and high voltage (hv) capacitances. The real situation can only be calculated numerically e. g. using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The tower arrangement of an <b>insulator</b> <b>set</b> and its clearances to tower crossarms and to the shaft are of great importance for the electrical field distribution. Furtheron, the influence on the electrical field characteristics in dependence on the composite insulator design is studied. Proposals for optimum designs are discussed. Theoretical results are compared with field measurements in a laboratory...|$|E
40|$|Interfacial {{phase change}} memory (iPCM), {{that has a}} {{structure}} of a superlattice made of alternating atomically thin GeTe and Sb 2 Te 3 layers, has recently attracted attention not only due to its superior performance compared to the alloy of the same average composition in terms of energy consumption but also due to its strong response to an external magnetic field (giant magnetoresistance) that has been speculated to arise from switching between topological insulator (RESET) and normal <b>insulator</b> (<b>SET)</b> phases. Here we report magneto-optical Kerr rotation loops in the visible range, that have mirror symmetric resonances {{with respect to the}} magnetic field polarity at temperatures above 380 K when the material is in the SET phase that has Kramers-pairs in spin-split bands.

The observed results open new possibilities for use of iPCM beyond phase-change memory applications...|$|E

Data from genome-wide localization studies of insulator proteins indicate a possible functional specialization, with different insulators playing distinct roles in nuclear biology.

40|$|Boundary or <b>insulator</b> {{elements}} <b>set</b> up independent {{territories of}} gene activity by establishing higher order domains of chromatin structure. The gypsy retrotransposon of Drosophila contains an insulator element that represses enhancer-promoter interactions and {{is responsible for}} the mutant phenotypes caused by insertion of this element. The gypsy insulator inhibits the interaction of promoter-distal enhancers with the transcription complex without affecting the functionality of promoter-proximal enhancers; in addition, these sequences can buffer a transgene from chromosomal position effects. Two proteins have been identified that bind gypsy insulator sequences and are responsible for their effects on transcription. The suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw) ] protein affects enhancer function both upstream and downstream of its binding site by causing a silencing effect similar to that of heterochromatin. The modifier of mdg 4 [mod(mdg 4) ] protein interacts with su(Hw) to transform this bi-directional repression into the polar effect characteristic of insulators. These effects seem to be modulated by changes in chromatin structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{complexity}} of regulatory systems in higher eukaryotes, featuring many distantly located enhancers that nonetheless properly activate the target promoters, has prompted {{the hypothesis that}} the action of enhancers should be restricted by insulators. Continuing our research on the functional role of insulators and the consequences of their interaction in Drosophila, we studied the interplay of different Su(Hw) -dependent Drosophila <b>insulators.</b> The <b>set</b> of transgenic constructs comprised two consecutive genes (yellow and white) with their enhancers and insulator elements differently arranged in between and/or around the gene(s). All insulators were found to interact in twin or mixed tandems, demonstrating the bypass phenomenon. However, insulator pairing around a gene did not always improve its isolation from an outside enhancer. On the other hand, merely two insulator elements (identical or different) in appropriate positions can permit the expression of one gene but not the gene next to it or, conversely, largely block the transcription of the first gene, while allowing full enhancement of the second, or make them behave similarly. Thus, {{the results of this study}} support the model that loop formation by insulators is an essential component of insulator action on a positive and negative regulation of an enhancer-promoter communication...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} an {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) methodology in order to estimate the critical flashover voltage on polluted insulators is the objective here. The methodology uses as input variables characteristics of the insulator such as diameter, height, creepage distance, form factor and equivalent salt deposit density, and it estimates the critical flashover voltage based on an ANN. For each ANN training algorithm, an optimisation process is conducted regarding the values of crucial parameters such {{as the number of}} neurons and so on using the training set. The success of each algorithm in estimating the critical flashover voltage is measured by the correlation index between the experimental and estimated values for the evaluation set, and finally the ANN with the correlation index closest to 1 is specified. For this ANN and the respective algorithm, the critical flashover voltage of the test <b>set</b> <b>insulators</b> is estimated and the respective confidence intervals are calculated through the re-sampling method. © 2008 The Institution of Engineering and Technology...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there is}} a {{considerable}} study on gapped symmetric phases of bosons that do not break any symmetry. Even without symmetry breaking, the bosons can still be in many exotic new states of matter, such as symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which are short-range entangled and symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases, which are long-range entangled. It {{is well known that}} noninteracting fermionic topological insulators are SPT states protected by time-reversal symmetry and U(1) fermion number conservation symmetry. In this paper, we construct three-dimensional exotic phases of bosons with time-reversal symmetry and boson number conservation U(1) symmetry by means of fermionic projective construction. We first construct an algebraic bosonic insulator, which is a symmetric bosonic state with an emergent U(1) gapless gauge field. We then obtain many gapped bosonic states that do not break the time-reversal symmetry and boson number conservation via proper dyon condensations. We identify the constructed states by calculating the allowed electric and magnetic charges of their excitations, as well as the statistics and the symmetric transformation properties of those excitations. This allows us to show that our constructed states can be trivial SPT states (i. e., trivial Mott insulators of bosons with symmetry), nontrivial SPT states (i. e., bosonic topological <b>insulators),</b> and <b>SET</b> states (i. e., fractional bosonic topological insulators). In nontrivial SPT states, the elementary monopole (carrying zero electric charge but unit magnetic charge) and elementary dyon (carrying both unit electric charge and unit magnetic charge) are fermionic and bosonic, respectively. In SET states, intrinsic excitations may carry fractional charge. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (Grant DMR- 1005541...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structures of}} supercells of CeO 2 −δ have been calculated within the density functional theory (DFT). The equilibrium properties such as lattice constants, bulk moduli, and magnetic moments are well reproduced by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Electronic excitations are simulated by robust total-energy calculations for constrained states with atomic core holes or valence holes. Pristine ceria CeO 2 {{is found to}} be a nonmagnetic <b>insulator</b> with magnetism <b>setting</b> in as soon as oxygens are removed from the structure. In the ground state of defective ceria, the Ce-f majority band resides near the Fermi level but appears at about 2 eV below the Fermi level in photoemission spectroscopy experiments due to final-state effects. We also tested our computationalmethod by calculating threshold energies in Ce-M 5 andO-K x-ray absorption spectroscopy and comparing theoretical predictions with the corresponding measurements. Our result that f electrons reside near the Fermi level in the ground state of oxygen-deficient ceria is crucial for understanding the catalytic properties of CeO 2 and related materials...|$|R
40|$|Topological {{insulators}} {{represent a}} new class of quantum phase defined by invariant symmetries and spin-orbit coupling that guarantees metallic Dirac excitations at its surface. The discoveries of these states have sparked the hope of realizing nontrivial excitations and novel effects such as a magnetoelectric effect and topological Majorana excitations. Here we develop a theoretical formalism to show that a three dimensional topological insulator can be designed artificially via stacking bilayers of two-dimensional Fermi gases with opposite Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling on adjacent layers, and with inter-layer quantum tunneling. We demonstrate that in the stack of bilayers grown along a (001) -direction, a nontrivial topological phase transition occurs above a critical number of Rashba-bilayers. In the topological phase we find the formation of a single spin-polarized Dirac cone at the Γ-point. This approach offers an accessible way to design artificial topological <b>insulators</b> in a <b>set</b> up that takes full advantage of the atomic layer deposition approach. This design principle is tunable and also allows us to bypass limitations imposed by bulk crystal geometry. Comment: (v 2) : Two design principles for our proposals are included.

Magnetization measurements with a {{superconducting quantum interference device}} confirm a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition around 110, 121, 150, 160, and 178 K for x- 0. 15, 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, and 0. 5, respectively. Four probe resistivity measurements at low temperatures show a monotonic increase for x- 0. 15 which represents a ferromagnetic insulating (FMI) phase. For $Nd_{ 0. 8 }Pb_{ 0. 2 }MnO_ 3 $ there is a slope change present in the resistivity profile at 127 K where metal to <b>insulator</b> transition (MI) <b>sets</b> in. For x- 0. 3 this MI transition is more prominent. However, both these samples have FMI phase at low temperature. When the concentration of lead increases $(x> 0. 3) $ the sample displays a clear insulator to metal transition with a low temperature ferromagnetic metallic phase. On the basis of these measurements we have predicted the phase diagram of $Nd_{ 1 -x}Pb_xMnO_ 3. $ Magnetization measurements by a vibration sample magnetometer point out the appreciable differences between zero field cooled and field cooled profiles below the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition temperature for all x.
