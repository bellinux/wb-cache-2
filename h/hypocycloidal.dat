40|$|Stress field {{solutions}} and Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) are found for $n$-cusped <b>hypocycloidal</b> shaped voids and rigid inclusions in an infinite linear elastic plane subject to nonuniform remote antiplane loading, using complex potential and conformal mapping. It is {{shown that a}} void with <b>hypocycloidal</b> shape {{can lead to a}} higher SIF than that induced by a corresponding star-shaped crack; this is counter intuitive as the latter usually produces a more severe stress field in the material. Moreover, it is observed that when the order $m$ of the polynomial governing the remote loading grows, the stress fields generated by the hypocycloidal-shaped void and the star-shaped crack tend to coincide, so that they become equivalent {{from the point of view}} of a failure analysis. Finally, special geometries and loading conditions are discovered for which there is no stress singularity at the inclusion cusps and where the stress is even reduced with respect to the case of the absence of the inclusion. The concept of Stress Reduction Factor (SRF) in the presence of a sharp wedge is therefore introduced, contrasting with the well-known definition of Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) in the presence of inclusions with smooth boundary. The results presented in this paper provide criteria that will help in the design of ultra strong composite materials, where stress singularities always promote failure. Furthermore, they will facilitate finding the special conditions where resistance can be optimized in the presence of inclusions with non-smooth boundary...|$|E

40|$|The plasma-puff {{triggering}} mechanism {{based on}} a <b>hypocycloidal</b> pinch geometry was investigated to determine the optimal operating conditions for an azimuthally uniform surface flashover which initiates plasma-puff under wide ranges of fill gas pressures of Ar, He and N 2. The optimal fill gas pressures for the azimuthally uniform plasma-puff were about 120 mTorr less than P(opt) less than 450 Torr for He and N 2. For Argon 120 mTorr less than P(opt) less than 5 Torr for argon. The inverse pinch switch was triggered with the plasma-puff and the switching capability under various electrical parameters and working gas pressures of Ar, He and N 2 was determined. It was also shown that the azimuthally uniform switching discharges were dependent {{on the type of}} fill gas and its fill pressure. A new concept of plasma-focus driven plasma-puff was also discussed in comparison with <b>hypocycloidal</b> pinch plasma-puff triggering. The main discharge of the inverse pinch switch with the plasma-focus driven plasma-puff trigger is found to be more azimuthally uniform than that with the <b>hypocycloidal</b> pinch plasma-puff trigger in a gas pressure region between 80 mTorr and 1 Torr. In order to assess the effects of plasma current density on material erosion of electrodes, emissions from both an inverse-pinch plasma switch (INPIStron) and from a spark gap switch under test were studied with an optical multichannel analyzer (OMA). The color temperature of the argon plasma was approximately 4, 000 K which corresponded with the peak continuum emission near 750 nm. There are the strong line emissions of argon in the 650 - 800 nm range and a lack of line emissions of copper and other solid material used in the switch. This indicates that the plasma current density during closing is low and the hot spot or hot filament in the switch is negligible. This result also indicates considerable reduction of line emission with the INPIStron switch over that of a spark-gap switch. However, a strong carbon line emission exists due to vaporization of the plastic insulator used. In order to reduce the vaporization of the insulator, the plexiglass insulating material of INPIStron was replaced with Z- 9 material. A comparative study of the INPIStron and a spark gap also reveals that the INPIStron, with a low impedance of Z equals 9 ohms, can transfer a high voltage pulse with a superior pulse-shape fidelity over that of a spark gap with Z equals 100 ohms...|$|E

40|$|Generating {{smooth and}} {{continuous}} paths for robots with collision avoidance, which avoid sharp turns, {{is an important}} problem {{in the context of}} autonomous robot navigation. This paper presents novel smooth <b>hypocycloidal</b> paths (SHP) for robot motion. It is integrated with collision-free and decoupled multi-robot path planning. An SHP diffuses (i. e., moves points along segments) the points of sharp turns in the global path of the map into nodes, which are used to generate smooth <b>hypocycloidal</b> curves that maintain a safe clearance in relation to the obstacles. These nodes are also used as safe points of retreat to avoid collision with other robots. The novel contributions of this work are as follows: (1) The proposed work is the first use of hypocycloid geometry to produce smooth and continuous paths for robot motion. A mathematical analysis of SHP generation in various scenarios is discussed. (2) The proposed work is also the first to consider the case of smooth and collision-free path generation for a load carrying robot. (3) Traditionally, path smoothing and collision avoidance have been addressed as separate problems. This work proposes integrated and decoupled collision-free multi-robot path planning. ‵Node caching‵ is proposed to improve efficiency. A decoupled approach with local communication enables the paths of robots to be dynamically changed. (4) A novel ‵multi-robot map update‵ in case of dynamic obstacles in the map is proposed, such that robots update other robots about the positions of dynamic obstacles in the map. A timestamp feature ensures that all the robots have the most updated map. Comparison between SHP and other path smoothing techniques and experimental results in real environments confirm that SHP can generate smooth paths for robots and avoid collision with other robots through local communication...|$|E

In contrast with convetional macroscopic atomic cell configuration, and in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, the measured relaxation times were found to be at least one order of magnitude longer than the limit set by the atom-wall collisional relaxation from thermal atoms.

All patients answered an evaluation questionnaire on perception of the Oral Impact on Daily Performances (OIDP) and underwent physical and imaging examination. The following aspects were evaluated in temporo mandibular join (TMJ) physical examination: maximum mouth opening, left/right lateral movements and protrusive movements. Vertical height measurements of right and left mandibular branches were evaluated by means of orthopantomography.

Outcome Measures: Development of pituitary (micro) prolactinoma, prolactin (PRL) levels, and clinical signs of menstrual dysfunction. Results: With exception of one woman in whom it probably had been missed by <b>hypocycloidal</b> tomography, no demonstrable prolactinoma developed. Prolactin levels rose in two patients, one using oral contraceptives {{and the other with}} prolactinoma. At the end of follow-up, 15 of 16 patients using a dopaminergic drug had a normal cycle; 13 had normal final PRL levels.

The control group consisted of 22  individuals. Both groups were similar in age [33 (SD 11) v 34  (9) years, P =  0. 8]. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis had more variability in TMJ mobility than controls (P <  0. 05) and showed increased frequency of condylar erosions (P <  0. 01), flattening (P <  0. 01), sclerosis (P <  0. 01), and temporal flattening (P <  0. 01).

Atomic vapour loaded HC-PCF and PMC’s have applications in laser metrology, coherent optics and magneto optical spectroscopy. State of the art HC-PCF have been fabricated for loading with atomic vapour including both photonic bandgap (PBG) guiding and inhibited coupling (IC) <b>hypocycloidal</b> core shape Kagome HC-PCF. Record loss of 70 dB/km has been achieved in IC hypocycloid core shape Kagome HC-PCF in the spectral region centred at 800 nm.
