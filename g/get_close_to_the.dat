Some sources say the king was basically dependent on Gyllenstierna,. His sudden death in 1680 opened up the road to the monarch, and many men tried to <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king to take Gyllenstierna's place.|$|E

He announced that he would spearhead change on many issues, from politics to culture. The ceremony was attended by the provincial governors, Supreme Court president Julio Nazareno, the heads of the armed forces, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Raúl Alfonsín was the only former president in attendance. Kirchner walked to the Casa Rosada along Avenida de Mayo, breaking with protocol to <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people, and was accidentally hit {{in the head with a}} camera.|$|E

Czolgosz, since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland, had {{decided to do something}} he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief, and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.|$|E

5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, would be good for the country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe {{division}} tracks down {{a series}} of deaths of wives shortly after the passing of their respective husbands. Discovering traces of the husbands' DNA on {{the bodies of the}} wives, Walter Bishop (John Noble) suspects that the killer is using pheromones taken from the husbands to <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wives, using the substances as a perfume. Further identifying castoreum within the pheromone mix, they identify the murderer as Anson Carr (Michael Massee), a former and disgruntled employee of a perfume company inflicted with a rare skin disease. They arrive at Carr's home to find another husband, already dead, in a dehydration chamber, and race to protect his wife, Dianna (Ona Grauer). When no attack comes at the wife, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) realizes that her husband may have been having an affair, and races to the mistress' home, stopping Carr before he can kill her. As he is taken away, he admits he was trying to discover what love was, scientifically, so that he could reproduce it and allow the entire world to share in it.|$|E

5|$|There {{were strong}} {{factional}} conflicts inside the Ohio Republican party; {{one source of}} bitterness was the 1888 Republican National Convention. Ohio Republicans had endorsed the state's senior senator, John Sherman, for president. This was Sherman's third attempt at the Republican nomination; among his supporters were Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna, and Governor Foraker, whom Hanna had to that point strongly supported. After repeated balloting, Sherman did not <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of delegate votes needed to nominate, and when rumors swept the convention that the party's 1884 nominee, former Maine senator James G. Blaine, might enter the race, Foraker expressed willingness to support Blaine. This dealt a serious blow to Sherman's candidacy by showing division in his home state, and the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was Ohio-born {{and went on to}} be elected. McKinley had received some delegate votes, and his action in refusing to consider a candidacy while pledged to support Sherman impressed Mark Hanna. The industrialist was outraged at Foraker and abandoned him. McKinley and Hanna shared similar political views, including support for a tariff to protect and encourage American industry, and in the years following 1888, Hanna became a strong supporter of McKinley.|$|E

25|$|Night jumpers {{should be}} made aware of the dark zone, when landing at night.

Once they <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower they get, the darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. Suddenly it becomes very dark, and the jumper hits the ground soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations {{should be made}} to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it easier to see the ground.|$|E

25|$|On Saturday, 20 November {{the party}} {{set off on}} a two-day navigational {{exercise}} to cross the Cairngorm Plateau from Cairn Gorm south to Ben Macdui. Because they were very late in starting (it was almost 11:00 when they left Lagganlia) they used the Cairngorm ski lift to <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plateau and then, as planned, they separated into two groups – the more experienced group led by Beattie set off and {{was followed by the}} group led by Davidson and Sunderland. After crossing the plateau both groups were to descend to the Corrour Bothy at a much lower level in the Lairig Ghru where they would spend the night – sunset was just before 16:00. The less-experienced group of 15-year-olds would then return along the Lairig Ghru while the other group would return by traversing Cairn Toul and Braeriach {{on the far side of}} the valley. In case of emergency each group was to go to the Curran shelter high on the plateau. This plan had been approved in advance by the head of Lagganlia, John Paisley, who could forbid unsuitable expeditions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the family}} members told {{investigators}} that civilians in Villa Purificación were scared {{to reach out to the}} government for help because they feared reprisals from the Army. They said that they believe the Army summarily executed civilians out of rage for the incidents that occurred on May 1 in Villa Purificación. The families also said that the Army was not letting cattle ranchers give water to their livestock in order to kill them, and asked President Peña Nieto to intervene in the incidents. One {{of the family}} members who supposedly approached the military men guarding the bodies told the press that when he asked a soldier if she could <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bodies to see if any of them corresponded to her missing relative, the soldier told her that they were not getting their bodies back and that they would let the corpses rot.

Though he initially views their relationship as pure flirtation, Lydgate backs away from Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, after seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution to abandon his relationship with Rosamond and the two become engaged. At roughly the same time, Casaubon, returned from Rome, suffers a heart attack. Lydgate is brought in to deal with him and informs Dorothea that, in all likelihood, Casaubon only has around fifteen years left if he takes it easy and ceases his studies. Meanwhile, as Fred recovers, Mr. Featherstone becomes ill. On his deathbed, he reveals that he has two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one. Unwilling to be mixed up in the business of his will, she refuses, and Featherstone dies with the two wills still intact.|$|E

25|$|Rosenqvist {{attempted}} to replicate his earlier overtaking manoeuvre on Sette Cãmara {{but was not}} successful. Yamashita and Ilott made {{contact with each other}} but the Japanese driver was able to move into fourth place after passing Ilott. Sette Cãmara slid sideways at Fisherman's Bend corner, allowing Rosenqvist to get into the slipstream of the Brazilian driver. Rosenqvist went to the outside line and passed Sette Cãmara driving into Lisboa corner to move into second place. Piquet collided with Ticktum, ending the Double R Racing driver's race while MacLeod went wide off the track in order to avoid a multi-car accident. Rosenqvist began catching Félix da Costa by setting the race's fastest lap on lap 14, completing a circuit of two minutes and 11.080 seconds, but was unable to <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese driver, though yellow flags were waved for Maini who drove straight at Lisboa corner. Félix da Costa controlled the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race to clinch the victory. It was the second Macau Grand Prix win of Félix da Costa's career. Rosenqvist finished in second place, 1.603 seconds behind, with Sette Cãmara in third, Yamashita fourth and Ilott fifth. Hughes, Russell, Juncadella, Piquet and Sims completed the top ten finishers. The race had two yellow flag periods and two lead changes among two different drivers. Félix da Costa led once for a total of nine laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E
25|$|On 27 July 1809, as Victor pursued Gregorio García de la Cuesta's Spanish army, Arthur Wellesley's British troops {{attempted}} {{to cover their}} retreat across the Alberche River. Having successfully overseen {{the withdrawal of the}} Spanish infantry, Alexander Randoll Mackenzie's British 3rd Division pulled back to the west bank. The British cavalry had been withdrawn because it was useless in the wooded area near the Casa de Salinas in which Mackenzie's troops were situated. Lapisse's division crossed the Alberche farther north undetected and was able to <b>get</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British formation because its pickets were badly posted. Wellesley was there in person and even he was completely taken by surprise as Lapisse's division rolled forward against Mackenzie's left flank. With the 16th Light Infantry in the front line with the other three regiments in support, the French fell on Rufane Shaw Donkin's brigade, breaking the 2nd Battalion of the 87th Foot, 1st Battalion of the 88th Foot and 2nd Battalion of the 31st Foot and taking 80 prisoners. The 1st Battalion of the 45th Foot and a half-battalion of the 60th Foot held firm and covered the retreat of the beaten units. Though Lapisse aggressively pressed forward, Mackenzie's division was able to fall back to the main position in good order well-protected by the 14th Light Dragoons and the 1st Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion (KGL). However, the Casa de Salinas action cost the British 447 casualties, including 70 killed, 284 wounded, and 93 missing. The 87th alone lost 198 casualties. Lapisse's losses were probably less than 100.|$|E
