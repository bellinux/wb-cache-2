5|$|Although Collins {{used it as}} a {{catharsis}} for her {{opposition to}} the Vietnam War, two years after her rendition, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, senior Scottish regiment of the British Army, recorded an instrumental version featuring a bagpipe soloist accompanied by a pipe and drum band. The tempo of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the bagpipes, but it was based on Collins': <b>it</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice, then it was accompanied by the band of bagpipes and horns, whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus. It topped the RPM national singles chart in Canada for three weeks, and rose as high as number 11 in the U.S. It is also a controversial instrumental, as it combined pipes with a military band. The Pipe Major of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards was summoned to Edinburgh Castle and chastised for demeaning the bagpipes. Funeral processions for killed police, fire, and military personnel have often played a bagpipes version ever since.|$|E
5|$|Games between FBS and FCS teams {{typically}} {{result in}} lopsided victories for the FBS team, and the Appalachian State–Michigan game {{was not expected}} to be an exception. The predicted outcome was a lopsided victory for Michigan. Las Vegas sportsbooks did not give a betting line. The game was also the first to be broadcast on the then-new Big Ten Network. <b>It</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong first half for Appalachian State, who held a 28–17 lead {{at the end of the}} half. Michigan regained the lead at 32–31 in the fourth quarter, but Appalachian State took the lead for a second time on a short field goal with 26seconds left. The Mountaineers blocked a game-winning field goal attempt from Michigan at the end of regulation to secure a 34–32 win.|$|E

5|$|The Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration {{was founded}} in 1939. A Wartrace resident, Henry Davis, went to Winchester, Tennessee to buy hay and while there {{observed}} the Crimson Clover Festival being held. He felt that Wartrace should have a similar festival, and proposed the idea {{to a group of}} fellow horsemen, who accepted it. The first Celebration was held in 1939. <b>It</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> parade and elaborate pageant that depicted the evolution of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed from its original use as a plow and utility horse, to its present use as a show horse. The first Celebration attracted over 40,000 people. The Celebration later moved to Shelbyville, which is located about 60 miles southeast of Nashville, due to space issues, as small Wartrace was unable to cope with the volume of visitors and horses the show attracted. Shelbyville is now known as the Walking Horse Capital of the World.|$|E

Verbist finished sixth in the Grand Prix José Dubois, before Habeaux took another top ten finish in Antwerpse Havenpijl in August. Later in August, van Dijk finished third in the Dutch Food Valley Classic, Verbist finished tenth in the Châteauroux Classic, Drucker finished sixth in the Grote Prijs Stad Zottegem, with Van Goolen adding a fourth top ten within the space of a week, with third in the Druivenkoers Overijse event.|$|E

25|$|The Transvaal Boer {{republic}} was forcefully annexed by Britain in 1877, during Britain's {{attempt to}} consolidate the states of southern Africa under British rule. Long-standing Boer resentment turned into full-blown rebellion in the Transvaal and the first Anglo-Boer War, {{also known as the}} Boer Insurrection, broke out in 1880. The conflict ended almost as soon as <b>it</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> decisive Boer victory at Battle of Majuba Hill (27 February 1881).|$|E

25|$|Certain {{elaborate}} ceremonies that blend Islamic traditions {{with local}} culture were also began taking shape during Malaccan era. One of the example was recorded {{during the reign}} of Muhammad Shah. A special ceremony was held that marked the celebration of the 27th night of Ramadan, the Laylat al-Qadr. <b>It</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> daytime procession, led by the Temenggung on elephant-back, conveying the Sultan's prayer mat to the mosque for Tarawih performed after the mandatory night prayers. On the following day the Sultan's turban would be carried in procession to the mosque. Similar ceremonies accompanied the grand celebrations of both Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Aidiladha. Apparently Malaccan Malay society had become so infused with the Islamic worldview that {{on the eve of the}} fall of Malacca, warriors at the court requested copies of two Islamic heroic epics, the Hikayat Amir Hamzah and the Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah, to inspire them in battle the next day. These two epics, still read today, tell of heroes fighting in the defence of Islam.|$|E
25|$|In the Sprint Cup Series, Earnhardt hit {{a slight}} resurgence, {{and in the}} first five races of the season {{recorded}} three Top 5's and five Top 10 finishes. <b>It</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> second-place finish to teammate Jimmie Johnson at the Daytona 500, Earnhardt's third runner up finish in the 500 since 2010. The following week at Phoenix, he led for 47 laps, but was shuffled back in traffic during a cycle caution flag pit stops, which allowed Carl Edwards to assume the lead while Junior finished in fifth place. This was followed by two more Top 10 finishes: 7th at Las Vegas and 6th at Bristol. At Fontana, Earnhardt started mid-pack and after a couple of mistakes including a lengthy pit stop caused by missed lug nuts on a right rear tire, he came home in 2nd-place finish, assuming the points lead as a result of Brad Keselowski going off pace and falling back. Two weeks later in Martinsville, Earnhardt struggled throughout the race, and spun out after Danica Patrick was hit by Brian Vickers and sent into Earnhardt and ended up finishing 24th, 2 laps down, losing the points lead to Jimmie Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{constraints}} are available, {{with the}} current loss mostly due to low gravity and solar wind aided by photolysis. The loss of Titan's early atmosphere can be estimated with the 14N–15N isotopic ratio, because the lighter 14N is preferentially lost from the upper atmosphere under photolysis and heating. Because Titan's original 14N–15N ratio is poorly constrained, the early atmosphere may have had more N2 by factors ranging from 1.5 to 100 with certainty only in the lower factor. Because N2 is the primary component (98%) of Titan's atmosphere, the isotopic ratio suggests {{that much of the}} atmosphere has been lost over geologic time. Nevertheless, atmospheric pressure on its surface remains nearly 1.5 times that of Earth as <b>it</b> <b>began</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> proportionally greater volatile budget than Earth or Mars. It is possible that most of the atmospheric loss was within 50million years of accretion, from a highly energetic escape of light atoms carrying away {{a large portion of the}} atmosphere (hydrodynamic blow off event). Such an event could be driven by heating and photolysis effects of the early Sun's higher output of X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) photons.|$|E
