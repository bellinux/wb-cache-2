5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, vignettes aired where he berated {{members of his}} own family, eventually being confronted by José Huertas González. On October 7, 2012, Savio Vega reappeared in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, issuing yet another challenge. However, this time Colón fired back with a challenge of his own, inviting Vega to a special edition of Carlito's Cabana. The edition of Carlito's Cabana that featured Vega took place on October 14, 2012. In the segment, both traded insults and it finished with the security removing Vega when he tried to assault Colón after the former spat an apple in his face. At Halloween Wrestling Xtravaganza he was disqualified, assaulting his opponent after his father, who served as special referee, did not allow Huertas González to use his finisher. At Honor vs. Traición, Colón unsuccessfully challenged Ray González for the Universal Heavyweight Championship. A Hair vs. Hair rematch was immediately scheduled for Lockout, which will feature a guest referee elected by popular vote between Vega and Huertas González. The following night marked the first time that Colón participated in a match where his father was among his opponents, but he avoided <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> directly, instead requesting a tag and only entering later to pin González.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, on February 6, {{they won}} the WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating Los Guerreros. They continued their rivalry with Benoit, <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> and Brock Lesnar at No Way Out in a handicap match, where they teamed with their mentor Angle in a losing effort. After a successful title defense at WrestleMania XIX against Los Guerreros and the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno, Team Angle lost the championship to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri at Judgment Day on May 18 in a ladder match. Shortly afterwards, on June 12, Angle confronted Benjamin and Haas about the losing streak {{they had been in}} for a couple of weeks, and, after they blamed him for losing the Tag Team Championship and began to question his leadership, he fired them both from Team Angle. For a few weeks they wrestled against Angle, both in singles matches and in tag team matches.|$|E

25|$|Returning to Stampede Wrestling in late 1976, {{he began}} feuding {{with his former}} tag team partner Mr. Hito <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> on December 26. <b>Facing</b> <b>him</b> {{several times during the}} next month, he also faced him in a no countout/disqualification match on January 2. Fighting him to a no contest at the Victoria Pavilion in Calgary several days later, he would also {{participate}} in battle royal later that night which included Leo Burke, John Foley, Gama Singh, Gypsy Joe, Mr. Hito, Ed & Jerry Morrow, the Cuban Assassins (Cuban Assassin & Bad News Allen) and Bruce & Keith Hart. The winner was to receive a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am.|$|E
25|$|Some doubts {{were raised}} about the {{legality}} of Clarke's bowling action {{while he was at}} Surrey. Several opposition sides made official complaints about Clarke's faster ball and umpire Dickie Bird closely studied tapes of Clarke's action for any irregularities but found none, nor was Clarke ever called for throwing. It is commonly accepted that rather than chucking, it was Clarke's sheer strength and unusually open-chested action, combined with his speed, that left opposition batsmen fearing for their safety when <b>facing</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, <b>facing</b> <b>him,</b> then put her arms around him in concern.|$|E

25|$|Scouts from Averell's 2nd Division, Cavalry Corps, {{detected}} Confederate cavalry near Culpeper Court House {{about three}} weeks later. Averell assembled a force of 3,000 cavalrymen and six artillery pieces (the 6th Battery, New York Light Artillery, under Captain Joseph W. Martin) and set off for Kelly's Ford on the Rappahannock River between Fauquier and Culpeper Counties. After various troops were detached to cover his movements and to engage the enemy's pickets at Rappahannock Station, he had 2,100 men ready for battle in three brigades, commanded by Col. Alfred N. Duffié, Col. John B. McIntosh, and Capt. Marcus Reno. <b>Facing</b> <b>him</b> was a detached Confederate brigade commanded by Fitzhugh Lee, 800 men in five regiments, with a two-gun artillery section.|$|E
25|$|Failing {{to defeat}} to Stampede International Tag Team Champions Pat and Mike Kelly with Gordon Ivey on December 27, he would briefly feud with Ivey <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> in a singles match on January 24, 1975. Also facing former tag team partner Benny Ramirez the {{following}} week, he began teaming with Mr. Hito facing Lindy Calder & Roy Callender on February 7, he and Mr. Hito would lose to Callender and Wayne Bridges in Melville, Saskatchewan on April 22. Splitting from Mr. Hito for a time, he would face Frankie Laine, Keith Hart and Bill Cody before teaming with Jack Pesek against Bill Cody & Nick Pacchiano on May 23. He would team once more with Pesek against Bill Cody & Keith Hart on May 30.|$|E
25|$|Welsh {{followed}} up the Attell {{fight with a}} narrow victory over George Memsic in Los Angeles, before heading to New Orleans to take a points victory over Young Erne and then a knock-out win over Ray Bronson. Shortly after the Bronson fight, Welsh learned that Nelson {{had no intention of}} <b>facing</b> <b>him,</b> deciding to face three more opponents before retiring; none of these talks included Welsh. Welsh just carried on fighting, with one final match in New Orleans against Young Donahue. It was an acrimonious affair before the bout started, and when Welsh rejected the referee before the match began, another referee was found, but was told to call a draw if no clear winner was apparent. When the fight reached its ten-round conclusion, the referee called a draw, much to Welsh's annoyance.|$|E

25|$|Dominic Kinnear {{states that}} the first time the Earthquakes {{coaching}} staff first got a good look at Brian Ching was <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> in the July 17, 2002 third round match of the U.S. Open Cup when San Jose defeated the Seattle Sounders 4-3 after sudden death extra time. Kinnear, assistant coach at the time, and head coach Frank Yallop were impressed with how Ching matched up with Earthquakes defender Eddie Robinson, considered one of the best defenders in MLS at the time. Ching began training with the Earthquakes the following January. On February 11, 2003, San Jose traded Devin Barclay to D.C. United in exchange for the first overall pick in the 2003 MLS Supplemental Draft and on February 28, 2013, they used that pick to draft Ching.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{days after}} his {{appearance}} at SummerSlam and only one night after competing at a WWF house show in Saint John, New Brunswick, Luger made his return to WCW on the premiere of Nitro, coming out during the main event for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship between champion Hulk Hogan and Big Bubba Rogers. After Luger's return, he did not make his allegiances known acting as a tweener, except for that he still did have a long-time friendship with Sting. He merely claimed {{that he wanted to}} stake his claim at Hogan's WCW World Heavyweight Title, <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> on the September 11, 1995 episode of Nitro, which Hogan won by disqualification. At Halloween Havoc, Luger attacked Hogan after his match with The Giant and joined Kevin Sullivan's Dungeon of Doom stable.|$|E
25|$|Marlovians {{suggest it}} is {{significant}} that every person involved in the incident seems to have been associated {{in one way or another}} either with his friend and patron Thomas Walsingham (Frizer and Skeres) or with his employers the Cecils (Poley, Bull and Danby). They point to the lengthy period (10 hours) in which the four men remained together at Eleanor Bull's house that day, and suggest this seems unnecessary if the intent had been simply to dispose of Marlowe. The most likely reason for the get-together, they say, would have been to save him in some way from the peril <b>facing</b> <b>him.</b> They claim that the faking of his death fits more of the facts as known than any other scenario. That Poley, Frizer and Skeres all made a living from being able to lie convincingly may have been relevant too.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Voce and Larwood practised this {{modified}} form of leg theory for Nottinghamshire, causing severe problems for opposing batsmen. Although Voce was somewhat slower than Larwood, his line, from left-arm over the wicket, and the steeper bounce that he obtained from his height, made him formidable enough and the batsmen got no relief when <b>facing</b> <b>him.</b> Voce took 123 wickets for 19.29 each in 1931, and with 136 for 16.87 each in 1932, he was chosen {{as one of the}} Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1933. His bowling was so good that he regained his Test place and, with Larwood, was named for the 1932–1933 English tour of Australia, to be captained by Jardine. The bowlers implemented Jardine's tactic, bowling fast and short at the Australian batsmen, with Voce inflicting several bruising injuries. The Australian media dubbed the tactic 'Bodyline'. This resulted in severe ill-feeling between the cricket teams, and the countries.|$|E
25|$|By 1979 Leroy Brown {{began working}} in San Francisco for NWA Hollywood. Brown {{teamed up with}} Allen Coage and {{together}} they defeated Los Guerreros (Héctor and Mando Guerrero) to win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship. They would later lose the belts to Mando Guerrero and Carlos Mata. Working for NWA Hollywood also allowed Brown to travel to Japan, touring with New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). During the tour he challenged Seiji Sakaguchi for the NWF North American Heavyweight Championship in July 1979 but Sakaguchi retained the title by disqualification. In his book Animal, George Steele describes Brown's problems in Japan, including how during a match a Japanese wrestler was trying to break a bottle over Brown's head but had not prepared it properly and it took several hard blows to break the bottle. The following day several Japanese wrestlers would watch the tape of the match over and over again, laughing at Brown's misfortune and pain. Back in San Francisco Brown defeated Chavo Guerrero to win the WWA Americas Heavyweight Championship, holding it for 50 days before losing it to Al Madril. In late 1979 Brown returned to the eastern coast, competing for Championship Wrestling from Florida. Initially he became involved in a feud with then NWA Florida Heavyweight Champion, Manny Fernandez <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> on several occasions during January. After that {{he moved on to}} facing Sweet Brown Sugar, whom he defeated to win the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship. He would later lose it to Dusty Rhodes on February 16, 1980 Jacksonville, Florida. By late 1980 Brown ended up working for Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling, teaming with Ernie Ladd for {{most of his time in}} Mid-South. The two defeated Junkyard Dog and Terry Orndorff to win the Mid-South Tag Team Championship. They later trade the championship with Junkyard Dog and other partners such as Killer Karl Kox and Dick Murdoch.|$|E

Reports came out of the Giants training compound of the exploits of the new [...] Taylor's teammates took to calling him Superman and joked that his locker should be replaced with a phone booth. Phil Simms, the team's quarterback, said, [...] "on the pass rush, he's an animal. He's either going to run around you or over you. With his quickness, he's full speed after two steps." [...] Taylor made his NFL exhibition debut on August 8, 1981, recording 2 sacks in the Giants' 23–7 win over the Chicago Bears. Before the season word spread around the league about Taylor. Years after <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> in an exhibition game, Pittsburgh Steelers Quarterback Terry Bradshaw recalled, [...] "e dang-near killed me, I just kept saying, 'Who is this guy?'

500|$|ESPN play-by-play {{announcer}} Dan Schulman said: [...] "He's {{not your}} prototypical break-you-down-off-the-dribble with blow-by-speed kind of point guard. [...] I would {{describe him as}} a very cerebral player, a very unselfish player ... He's {{been one of the}} most effective point guards in America." [...] ESPN's Doug Gottlieb said Scheyer was making an interesting case for national player of the year. [...] On February 15, Scheyer became the first player to win the ACC Player of the Week award three times in the 2009–10 season; it was the fourth time he had won the award in his career. After <b>facing</b> <b>him,</b> North Carolina point guard Larry Drew said: [...] "He's as crafty as you can get. [...] You just don't like playing against players like that. He can shoot the ball well. He's quick enough. He's smart. He knows about angles. He's a good actor. And he can shoot." [...] University of Maryland coach Gary Williams observed: ...|$|E
500|$|He then {{ended his}} feud with Michaels, {{defeating}} {{him in a}} Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood, which became the longest Hell in a Cell match in history. He then resumed his feud with Chris Benoit, <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> for the title at Vengeance and on the July 26 episode of Raw in a 60-Minute Iron Man match, losing both times after Eugene interfered and hit him with a steel chair. He went on to defeat Eugene at SummerSlam. [...] Triple H then regained the title from former associate Randy Orton at Unforgiven. Following a triple threat World Heavyweight title defense against Benoit and Edge on the November 29, 2004 episode of Raw, the World Heavyweight Championship became vacant for the first time. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won the Elimination Chamber to begin his tenth world title reign. At WrestleMania 21, Triple H lost the championship to Batista, and subsequently lost two rematches at Backlash and Vengeance. After Vengeance, Triple H took a hiatus from WWE due to suffering from minor neck problems.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the successes of the {{destroyer}} runs, Kawaguchi insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to Guadalcanal by slow barges. Therefore, a convoy carrying 1,100 of Kawaguchi's troops and heavy equipment in 61 barges, mainly from the 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment {{under the command of}} Colonel Akinosuka Oka, departed the northern coast of Santa Isabel Island on 2 September. On 4–5 September, aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the barge convoy, killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit's heavy equipment. Most of the remaining 1,000 troops were able to land near Kamimbo (...) , west of the Lunga perimeter over the next few days. By 7 September, Kawaguchi had 5,200 troops at Taivu Point and 1,000 west of the Lunga perimeter. Kawaguchi was confident enough that he could defeat the Allied forces <b>facing</b> <b>him</b> that he declined an offer from the 17th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces. Kawaguchi believed that there were only about 2,000 U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal.|$|E
