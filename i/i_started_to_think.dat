[...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions.

500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be a}} novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E

2500|$|Ultimately, U2 {{felt that}} Pop {{had not been}} {{completed}} to their satisfaction. The Edge described the finished album as [...] "a compromise project by the end.

40|$|Summary-DESA 1002 -Design studio 2008 As the {{programme}} is sort {{of continuing}} the way of last semester, all those tasks and requirements became much clearer to me. The concept of ‘nine cities’ is quite interesting which gives us a cultural and environmental background which make the design process more logical and practical. This design including the so called “Artists’ House”, the Arts Exhibition Centre and a foot bridge which links these two relevant buildings. The idea of the Artists’ house came from the form of Bag packers Hotel, but instead of just accommodations for travellers, the Artists’ House provides an enjoyable space for those artists or arts lovers {{who want to work}} and live in Jerusalem for a period of time. The footbridge links the Artists’ House with the Arts Exhibition Centre where could hold arts exhibitions, shows and provides a space for communications. The main concept of this design is to create an opening, friendly space for artists, designers and those people who love arts and Jerusalem to enjoy and work with the incredible arts and cultures of Jerusalem. Though I was still doing a lot of work with models and drawings as last semester, <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> more about some realistic architectural elements or problems that are supposed to happen in my design such as the climate, the local materials and so on.

Walking through the quad on Quad Day, my friends and I passed a booth that had a large sign saying: “Atheist Club”. I thought nothing of it until now, and the fact that John said that the less you know about the subject you are studying; the better the project will turn out. So the question is: “So what? ” What am I going to do get involved with the Atheist club? Is the Atheist club too extreme? What if I actually agree with what they’re saying? These are all questions that I asked myself the moment I thought of the Atheists. As a member of the Irish Catholic community, I have been brought up with the ideals that God is the almighty power, {{and that there is a}} heaven and a hell. From what I understand about Atheists is that they believe in nothing, and that there is no higher power, which goes against everything that I’ve been raised with. Overall, I feel that getting involved in the Atheist community on campus would open my eyes, and possibly others, to a whole new world that many people do not understand...|$|R
