40|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis {{virus was}} {{eradicated}} from a 150 cow beef herd at the Animal Diseases Research Institute, Lethbridge, Alberta. Tests used {{to accomplish this}} included standard and modified serum-virus neutralization tests and an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. These results and those of preliminary pilot studies in the herd and in a nonvaccinated, <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis-infected 450 cow beef herd suggest that eradication of <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis infection {{can be considered as}} a practical control alternative to vaccination, and that young animals in purebred herds could be monitored serologically and isolated, to enhance their eligibility for entry into artificial insemination studs or for export...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the normal {{rate of decay}} of maternal antibody {{and the influence of}} maternal antibody on responses to a single vaccination with modified-live bovine virus diarrhea and <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis virus vaccines at 196 days of age and on response to vaccinations with the same vaccines given twice at 84 and 196 days of age. Passive immunity decreased to near zero over {{the first six months of}} life for both bovine virus diarrhea and <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis controls. All calves seroconverted to bovine virus diarrhea vaccine at 84 days of age, even though high levels (greater than 1 : 32) of maternal antibodies were present. These calves did not seroconvert to <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis vaccine at 84 days of age when high levels (less than 1 : 16) of maternal antibodies were present.

After intranasal vaccination of all bulls, the sporadic occurrence of clinical <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis ceased.

40|$|Ewes (N = 7) {{and their}} lambs (N = 12) were vaccinated with a {{commercial}} modified live <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis-parainfluenza type 3 virus vaccine. Both the vaccinated ewes and lambs {{and a group}} of unvaccinated ewes (N = 8) and their lambs (N = 13) were subsequently challenged with virulent parainfluenza type 3 virus. Although absolute immunity to infection and clinical response was not conferred, the clinical response was less severe in vaccinated lambs. Vaccinated animals also shed parainfluenza type 3 virus in nasal secretions for a shorter time than nonvaccinated animals. Some vaccinated lambs developed a persistent <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis virus infection that was recrudesced by treatment with dexamethasone. It was concluded that vaccination was of benefit in reducing the severity of infection with parainfluenza type 3 virus. However, the inclusion of <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis virus in a vaccine for sheep respiratory tract disease is highly questionable as it might increase the risk factor associated with vaccination.

40|$|One or {{both eyes}} of 20 calves were inoculated {{one or more}} time with variou(s {{combinations}} of microorganism (live oor killed Moraxella bovis, <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis virus, bovine adenovirus, bovine parainfluenza- 3 virus and Mycoplasma bovoculi) by conjunctival instillation or direct inoculation of the conjunctivea or cornea. The eyes of all the calves received natural or artificial ultraviolet irradiation. Neither the adenovirus nor parainfluenza- 3 virus became established in the eye or produced keratoconjunctivitis. Both M. bovis and <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis virus became established in the bovine eye and produced disease. Subconjunctival or intracorneal inoculation of M. bovis caused a severe disease, simulating natural <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> keratoconjunctivitis.

40|$|An electrophoretic {{analysis}} of radioactively labeled, purified, "empty" and DNA-containing <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis virions revealed {{the presence of}} 25 to 33 structural (virion) polypeptides. A total of 11 of these polypeptides could be labeled with [3 H]glucosamine and were identified as glycoproteins. In addition to the 25 structural polypeptides, <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis virus infected cells also contained at least 15 nonstructural (nonvirion) polypeptides that were not present in purified virions. Expression of the viral polypeptides in infected cells was controlled temporally. Thus, most viral polypeptides could be categorized as "alpha" (immediate early), "beta" (early), or "gamma" (late) {{on the basis of}} their order of appearance in infected cells and whether their syntheses were dependent upon prior viral protein or DNA synthesis. None of the glycoproteins belongs to the alpha class, although at least one (GVP 11) was synthesized in the absence of viral DNA synthesis.

Further immunological tests revealed that Hershey Medical Center virus is antigenically indistinguishable from <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis virus.

Six months later, stock cultures of pig kidney (PK- 15) cells were found to be contaminated with SV- 5 virus.

40|$|A {{seroepidemiological study}} of the {{association}} between antibody titers to <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis, parainfluenza- 3, bovine virus diarrhea and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses, and treatment for bovine respiratory disease was conducted. A total of 322 calves from five different groups were bled on arrival, then one month later all cases (cattle treated for bovine respiratory disease) were rebled together with {{an equal number of}} controls (cattle not treated for any disease).

40|$|Nasal {{epithelial}} cells {{were collected by}} cotton swabs for the diagnosis in experimental and field cases of <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis and field cases of bovine viral diarrhea in calves.
