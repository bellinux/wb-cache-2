5|$|In {{recent years}} the Dutch brick {{industry}} has attracted unwelcome attention from the European Union (EU) competition authorities. In the early 1990s the industry had excess capacity due to technological advances, competition from other materials and an <b>economic</b> <b>slowdown.</b> Producers with combined market share of 90% agreed to reduce capacity, shutting down the older and inefficient plants. The producers compensated those who closed plants. However, the agreement also included fixing production quotas and fining members who produced more than their quota. The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU.|$|E

5|$|The {{decisive factor}} {{in favour of}} change in Chicago, however, was the <b>economic</b> <b>slowdown</b> in the early 1890s, which {{gave way to the}} {{financial}} panic of 1893. The recession, combined with the frantic building of the previous few years, meant that Chicago suddenly had a significant surplus of office space, threatening occupancy levels and rents. Regulation was introduced by the city council to control the problem in 1892, with support from the real estate industry who hoped to slow the construction of additional office space and shore up their diminishing profit margins. The height of new buildings was limited to , with lower height levels on narrower streets, effectively curtailing the construction of any taller skyscrapers.|$|E

In 2008, the price briefly rose above $10,000 per ounce ($350,000 per kilogram). The <b>economic</b> <b>slowdown</b> of the 3rd quarter of 2008 pushed rhodium prices sharply back below $1,000 per ounce ($35,000 per kilogram); the price rebounded to $2,750 by early 2010 ($97,000 per kilogram) (more than twice the gold price), but in late 2013, the prices were less than $1000.|$|E
5|$|Depopulation {{stemming}} from the Black Death led to increased wages, static food costs and a resulting improvement in {{the standard of living}} for the peasantry. However, under Henry misgovernment and harvest failures depressed the English economy to a pitiful state known as the Great Slump. The economy was in ruins by 1450, a consequence of the loss of France, piracy in the channel and poor trading relations with the Hanseatic League. The <b>economic</b> <b>slowdown</b> began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s. It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, which drove up the price of food and damaged the wider economy. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 per cent in just four years {{at the end of the}} 1440s, collapsing by up to 90 per cent in some parts of the South-West. The Crown's debts reached £372,000, Henry's deficit was £20,000 per annum, and tax revenues were half those of his father.|$|E

50|$|While infant {{mortality}} is normally {{negatively correlated with}} GDP, there may indeed be some opposing short-term effects from a recession. A recent study by The Economist showed that <b>economic</b> <b>slowdowns</b> {{reduce the amount of}} air pollution, which results in a lower {{infant mortality}} rate.

50|$|After the Asian crisis, {{international}} {{investors were}} reluctant to lend to developing countries, leading to <b>economic</b> <b>slowdowns</b> in developing countries {{in many parts of}} the world. The powerful negative shock also sharply reduced the price of oil, which reached a low of about $11 per barrel towards the end of 1998, causing a financial pinch in OPEC nations and other oil exporters. In response to a severe fall in oil prices, the supermajors that emerged in the late-1990s, undertook some major mergers and acquisitions between 1998 and 2002 - often in an effort to improve economies of scale, hedge against oil price volatility, and reduce large cash reserves through reinvestment.|$|R
