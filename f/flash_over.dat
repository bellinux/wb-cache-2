Soon afterwards, Pahad reported that he had been misquoted by Ha'aretz and that he was merely repeating rumours that had been circulating for years.|$|E
25|$|Staccato {{lightning}} is a cloud-to-ground lightning (CG) strike {{which is}} a short-duration stroke that (often but not always) appears as a single very bright flash and often has considerable branching. These are often found in the visual vault area near the mesocyclone of rotating thunderstorms and coincides with intensification of thunderstorm updrafts. A similar cloud-to-cloud strike consisting of a brief <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> a small area, appearing like a blip, also occurs in a similar area of rotating updrafts.|$|E
2500|$|The short {{was written}} by Borst and {{produced}} by DiRaffaele in Adobe <b>Flash</b> <b>over</b> {{the course of two}} months. Daymond, who provides the voice of SwaySway, was found on a casting call website and invited into the apartment of DiRaffaele to audition. Originally a one-off, Breadwinners premiered at the Midsummer Night Toons short film festival in New York City, where they wanted to entertain their colleagues. The short was uploaded to YouTube to positive reception, and after obtaining 10,000 to 15,000 views on its first week, Borst explained, [...] "it just took {{on a life of its}} own." [...] The creators linked it to Nickelodeon after users expressed wanting more. Upon receiving an inquiry from a Nickelodeon executive, DiRaffaele was doubtful of the offer, joking that he [...] "thought it was spam". After several months, the creators were hired to expand the short into a full-fledged series.|$|E

60|$|It was a long, hazy {{reach of}} land; {{piled up in}} terraces, traced here and there with rushing streams, that worked up gold dust alluvian, and seemed to <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> pebbled diamonds. Heliotropes, sun-flowers, marigolds gemmed, or starred the violet meads, and vassal-like, still sunward bowed their heads. The rocks were pierced with grottoes, blazing with crystals, many-tinted.|$|E

60|$|A ploughman {{going to}} his work, along under the stone wall of Siddermorton Park, saw the Strange Bird <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> {{him for a moment}} and vanish among the hazy {{interstices}} of the beech trees. But he saw little of the colour of the wings, witnessing only that its legs, which were long, seemed pink and bare like naked flesh, and its body mottled white.

60|$|She {{was stunned}} by his cruelty, and did not hear. He had not the faintest notion {{of what he was}} saying.

She only sat crouched beneath his cruelty and his hatred of her. She never realised in a <b>flash.</b> <b>Over</b> everything she brooded and brooded.|$|E

That of Joshua, which was first mentioned, darted along the Cross in a stream. The light of Judas Maccabeus went spinning, as if joy had scourged it.[23] Charlemagne and Orlando swept away together, pursued by the poet's eyes. Guglielmo[24] followed, and Rinaldo, and Godfrey of Bouillon, and Robert Guiscard of Naples; and the light of Cacciaguida himself darted back to its place, and, uttering another sort of voice, began shewing how sweet a singer he too was amidst the {{glittering}} choir.|$|E

6000|$|... "O madam, I want not freedom {{at such a}} price!" [...] And yet Cicely {{had never}} {{recovered}} her looks since those seventeen days at Tickhill. She still looked white and thin, and her dark eyebrows lay in a heavy line, seldom lifted by the merry looks and smiles that used to <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> her face. Life had begun to press its weight upon her, and day after day, as Humfrey watched her across the chapel, and exchanged {{a word or two}} with her while crossing the yard, had he grieved at her altered mien; and vexed himself with wondering whether she had after all loved Babington, and were mourning for him.|$|E

"While I {{was looking}} at this latter, a red blaze burst from the summit, {{and at the same}} moment seemed to <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> the whole building, filling up the pale outline with a {{simultaneous}} burst of fire. This is a celebrated display; and is done, I believe, by the employment of a very great number of men to light, at the same instant, the torches which are fixed for the purpose all over the building. After the first glare of fire, I did not think the second aspect of the building so beautiful as the first; it wanted both softness and distinctness. The two most animated days of the Carnival are still to come." ...|$|E
60|$|As we {{had some}} way, however, to trot along the valley before {{we came to the}} {{ascending}} place, I improved the opportunity to cultivate a little the acquaintance of my guide. He was a tall, spare man, with black eyes, black hair, and features expressive of shrewdness, energy, and determination. Either from paralysis, or some other cause, he was subject to a spasmodic twitching of the features, producing very much the effect that heat lightning does in the summer sky--it seemed to <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> his face and be gone in a wink; at first this looked to me very odd, but so much do our ideas depend on association, that after I had known him for some time, I really thought that I liked him better with, than I should without it. It seemed to give originality to the expression of his face; he was such a good, fatherly man, and took such excellent care of me and the mule, and showed so much intelligence and dignity in his conversation, that I could do no less than like him, heat lightning and all.|$|E

6000|$|Some hours after, {{he came to}} me in my library, {{asked if}} I forgave him, and desired to be reconciled. I drew the lad to my side, and there I kept him a good while, and had much talk with him, in the course of which he {{disclosed}} many points of feeling and thought I approved of in my son. I found, it is true, few elements of the [...] "good fellow" [...] or the [...] "fine fellow" [...] in him; scant sparkles of the spirit which loves to <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> the wine cup, or which kindles the passions to a destroying fire; but I saw in the soil of his heart healthy and swelling germs of compassion, affection, fidelity. I discovered in the garden of his intellect a rich growth of wholesome principles--reason, justice, moral courage, promised, if not blighted, a fertile bearing. So I bestowed on his large forehead, and on his cheek--still pale with tears--a proud and contented kiss, and sent him away comforted. Yet I saw him the next day laid on the mound under which Yorke had been buried, his face covered with his hands; he was melancholy for some weeks, and more than a year elapsed before he would listen to any proposal of having another dog.|$|E
6000|$|How deluges of frantic Sansculottism roared {{through all}} {{passages}} of this Tuileries, ruthless in vengeance, how the Valets were butchered, hewn down; and Dame Campan saw the Marseilles sabre <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> her head, but the Blackbrowed said, [...] "Va-t-en, Get thee gone," [...] and flung her from him unstruck: (Campan, ii. c. 21.) {{how in the}} cellars wine-bottles were broken, wine-butts were staved in and drunk; and, upwards to the very garrets, all windows tumbled out their precious royal furnitures; and, with gold mirrors, velvet curtains, down of ript feather-beds, and dead bodies of men, the Tuileries was like no Garden of the Earth:--all this let him who has a taste for it see amply in Mercier, in acrid Montgaillard, or Beaulieu of the Deux Amis. A hundred and eighty bodies of Swiss lie piled there; naked, unremoved till the second day. Patriotism has torn their red coats into snips; and marches with them at the Pike's point: the ghastly bare corpses lie there, under the sun and under the stars; the curious of both sexes crowding to look. Which let not us do. Above a hundred carts heaped with Dead fare towards the Cemetery of Sainte-Madeleine; bewailed, bewept; for all had kindred, all had mothers, if not here, then there. It {{is one of those}} Carnage-fields, such as you read of by the name 'Glorious Victory,' brought home in this case to one's own door.|$|E
60|$|But such instances, or any tokens of vitality, {{are rare}} indeed in my City churchyards. A few sparrows {{occasionally}} {{try to raise}} a lively chirrup in their solitary tree--perhaps, as taking {{a different view of}} worms from that entertained by humanity--but they are flat and hoarse of voice, like the clerk, the organ, the bell, the clergyman, {{and all the rest of}} the Church-works when they are wound up for Sunday. Caged larks, thrushes, or blackbirds, hanging in neighbouring courts, pour forth their strains passionately, as scenting the tree, trying to break out, and see leaves again before they die, but their song is Willow, Willow--of a churchyard cast. So little light lives inside the churches of my churchyards, when the two are co-existent, that it is often only by an accident and after long acquaintance that I discover their having stained glass in some odd window. The westering sun slants into the churchyard by some unwonted entry, a few prismatic tears drop on an old tombstone, and a window that I thought was only dirty, is for the moment all bejewelled. Then the light passes and the colours die. Though even then, if there be room enough for me to fall back so far as that I can gaze up to the top of the Church Tower, I see the rusty vane new burnished, and seeming to look out with a joyful <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> the sea of smoke at the distant shore of country.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile, {{in spite}} of my broken leg, the volcano itself {{attracted}} no little share of my distinguished attention. I couldn't go out to call on it in person, to be sure; but I had in Frank an acute and well-trained assistant, who could be trusted to keep a steady eye upon its daily proceedings, and who knew exactly what traits in its character I wished him to report to me. In order that I might the more fully be kept informed from time to time {{of the state of the}} crater, and the momentary changes taking place in its temper and the lava level, I taught Frank in his leisure moments how to work a heliograph. For that purpose I fastened a slanting piece of looking-glass to my own bed-head, and stationed my brother with a second mirror on the summit of the mountain, in a good position for observing the lake of fire and the smoke-stacks in its centre. On this simple form of telegraphic arrangement Frank flashed me news by the Morse code; so many long and short flashes in certain fixed and regular orders standing each for a certain letter: and I flashed him back by the same method my directions and remarks on his own despatches. In this way we constantly kept up quite a brisk conversation by means of the mirrors. [...] "Lava now rising in the main basin;" [...] Frank would <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> to me. [...] "Any fissures?" [...] I would ask. In a minute the answer came promptly back, [...] "Yes, two, in the black basalt." [...] "Steam issuing from them?" [...] "None at present, but clouds of dense smoke forming slowly in the second cavern." [...] "All right: then note its volume and direction." [...] And so forth for an hour at a time together. It relieved the monotony of my existence on my sick bed thus to carry on by proxy my accustomed avocations: and I was glad to feel I wasn't quite useless, even with my broken leg to weigh me down, but was honestly earning my bread (or at least my taro-paste) from the subscribers to the British Association Seismological Committee Fund.|$|E
60|$|Later on, {{when their}} hired brougham had, {{with the long}} vociferation that tormented her impatience, been extricated from the endless rank, she rolled into the London night, beside her husband, as into a {{sheltering}} darkness where she could muffle herself and draw breath. She had stood for the previous half-hour in a merciless glare, beaten upon, stared out of countenance, it fairly seemed to her, by intimations of her mistake. For what she was most immediately feeling was that she had, in the past, been active, for these people, to ends that were now bearing fruit and that might yet bear a larger crop. She but brooded, at first, in her corner of the carriage: it was like burying her exposed face, a face too helplessly exposed, in the cool lap of the common indifference, of the dispeopled streets, of the closed shops and darkened houses seen {{through the window of}} the brougham, a world mercifully unconscious and unreproachful. It wouldn't, like the world she had just left, know sooner or later what she had done, or would know it, at least, only if the final consequence should be some quite overwhelming publicity. She fixed this possibility itself so hard, however, for a few moments, that the misery of her fear produced the next minute a reaction; and when the carriage happened, while it grazed a turn, to catch the straight shaft from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing his inquisitive <b>flash</b> <b>over</b> an opposite house-front, she let herself wince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest, not less quickly, against mere blind terror. It had become, for the occasion, preposterously, terror--of which she must shake herself free before she could properly measure her ground. The perception of this necessity had in truth soon aided her; since she found, on trying, that, lurid as her prospect might hover there, she could none the less give it no name. The sense of seeing was strong in her, but she clutched at the comfort of not being sure of what she saw. Not to know what it would represent on a longer view was a help, in turn, to not making out that her hands were embrued; since if she had stood in the position of a producing cause she should surely be less vague about what she had produced. This, further, in its way, was a step toward reflecting that when one's connection with any matter was too indirect to be traced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored. By the time they were nearing Cadogan Place she had in fact recognised that she couldn't be as curious as she desired without arriving at some conviction of her being as innocent. But there had been a moment, in the dim desert of Eaton Square, when she broke into speech.|$|E
