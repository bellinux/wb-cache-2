25|$|In double entry bookkeeping, debits and credits (abbreviated Dr and Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers {{to record}} changes in value {{resulting}} from business transactions. Generally speaking, the sources for spending money in transaction account is credit (that is, an entry is {{made on the}} right side of the account's ledger) and what the money obtained with the credits is destined as debit in transaction accounts (that is, an entry is made on the left side). The credits <b>here</b> <b>could</b> be share capital, revenues, etc. and The debits <b>here</b> <b>could</b> be assests, dividends, etc. From a technical point of view the sides refer to the balance sheet placement of accounts. Total debits must equal total credits for each transaction; individual transactions may require multiple debit and credit entries to record.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} was where this amphibious landing could best take place. Several locations on the Dutch coast were considered. Many strategists preferred either {{the mouth of}} the Meuse river, or the vicinity of Scheveningen, both of which offered an opportunity to quickly deploy the attacking forces and threaten the supply lines of the French army of occupation in the Batavian Republic. These locations had as a severe drawback the dangerous shoals before the Dutch coast that made it difficult to navigate these waters. The extreme north of the North Holland peninsula did not have this drawback and a landing <b>here</b> <b>could</b> thus be supported by British sea power in the North Sea. It also recommended itself to the planners of the invasion, because the area was only lightly fortified; {{a large part of the}} Dutch fleet (an important objective of the expedition) was based nearby and might be at least dislocated, if the landing was successful; and the terrain seemed to promise the possibility of an easy advance on the important strategic objective of the city of Amsterdam. The area south of Den Helder was therefore selected as the landing place.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, LA Weekly Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "It isn't that Spider-Man is {{inherently}} unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated."

He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals <b>here</b> <b>could</b> have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea." [...] Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led IGN's Richard George to comment years later, [...] "We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from Spider-Man is almost comically bad...

500|$|At {{a meeting}} with Mackay on Christmas Eve, 1940, O'Connor visited Mackay at 6th Division {{headquarters}} and directed him to prepare an attack on Bardia. O'Connor recommended that this be built around the 23 Matilda tanks of Lieutenant Colonel R. M. Jerrram's 7th Royal Tank Regiment that remained in working order. The attack was to be made with only two brigades, leaving the third for a subsequent advance on Tobruk. Mackay did not share O'Connor's optimism {{about the prospect of}} an easy victory and proceeded on the assumption that Bardia would be resolutely held, requiring a well-planned attack similar to that required to breach the Hindenburg Line in 1918. The plan developed by Mackay and his chief of staff, Colonel Frank Berryman, involved an attack on the western side of the Bardia defences by Brigadier Arthur [...] "Tubby" [...] Allen's 16th Infantry Brigade at the junction of the Gerfah and Ponticelli sectors. Attacking at the junction of two sectors would confuse the defence. The defences here were weaker than in the Mereiga sector, the ground was favourable for employment of the Matilda tanks, and good observation for the artillery was possible. There was also the prospect that an attack <b>here</b> <b>could</b> split the fortress in two. Brigadier Stanley Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade would then exploit the breach in the fortress defences in the second phase. Most of the artillery, grouped as the [...] "Frew Group" [...] under British Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Frowen, would support the 16th Infantry Brigade; the 17th would be supported by the 2/2nd Field Regiment. In the event, the artillery density—96 guns for an attack on an [...] front—was comparable to the Battle of St. Quentin Canal in September 1918, when 360 guns supported an attack on a [...] front. Mackay insisted that the attack required 125 rounds per gun. It had to be postponed to 3 January in order for this ammunition to be brought forward.|$|E

A condition of the sale to the bank was that all signs of Parliament were to be removed. However, the concepts of Pearce are still very evident in the surviving House of Lords.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evidence}} that the royal Tanite tomb belonged to Takelot I was suggested long ago {{by the presence of}} grave goods found within the burial which mentioned his known parents: [...] "namely a Gold Bracelet (Cairo JE 72199) and an alabaster Jar (Cairo JE 86962) of Osorkon I, and an Ushabti figure of Queen Tashedkhons." [...] In addition, a heart scarab found in the king's burial gave his name simply as [...] "Takelot Meryamun" [...] without the Si-Ese epithet used by Takelot II. Recent confirmation of this circumstantial evidence was published by the German scholar Jansen-Winkeln in 1987. His examination of several inscriptions written on the tomb's walls proved beyond doubt that the person buried <b>here</b> <b>could</b> only be Takelot I, Osorkon II's father. Jansen-Winkeln's conclusions have been accepted by Egyptologists today including Professor Kenneth Kitchen. Osorkon II arranged for this aforementioned inscription to be carved on a scene in his tomb where Osorkon is depicted adoring Osiris and Udjo (as a uraeus).|$|E

2500|$|Oser already {{received}} angered clarifications from several communities. But in March and April 1819, {{the most senior}} Italian authority, Rabbi Abraham Eliezer ha-Levi of Triest, journeyed the peninsula from his city {{as far south as}} Ragusa.

Shem-Tov Samun criticized [...] "those who rebelled" [...] against the rabbis and prevalent customs of their community. Recanati's response was not recorded. While not necessarily reneging on their former rulings, the Italians elucidated that they set many limitations and that those were more theoretical than concrete permits, adding harsh attacks against the [...] "sectarians and schismatics". Lois C.

In 1816, they had as well, drawing upon Italian practice and halakhic arguments... Though they were misconstrued as supporters of reform, they really did not favour the change of customary practice. What confused German modernizers was that they failed to see that the Italians were speaking from a different context and tradition.
