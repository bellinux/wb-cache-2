40|$|Halftoning of a colour {{image is}} {{normally}} performed by halftoning the colour separations independently. Each halftoned image then builds the corresponding colour {{separation of the}} final halftoned colour image. In conventional halftoning methods different screen angles for different separations {{are being used to}} reduce the correlation between the separations to reduce artefacts in the form of moiré patterns for example. In FM screening, due to the random placement <b>of</b> <b>dots,</b> this <b>effect</b> is reduced without the need for using different orientations. With a detailed control <b>of</b> the <b>dot</b> placement it is possible to increase the colour gamut and reduce the colour noise of the image. The present paper discusses the problem and presents a halftoning method that halftones the colour separations dependently, that is, it can control the dot placement not only in each separation by itself, but also in each separation in relation to the others. Predicting and modelling the dot gain accurately is another problem of image reproduction in general since the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>dot</b> gain has to be considered {{in one way or another}} when the halftoned image is to be printed on a substrate. This paper also discusses how the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>dot</b> gain can be taken into account within the algorithm presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Methylation of histone H 3 lysine 79 (H 3 K 79) by Dot 1 {{is highly}} conserved among species {{and has been}} {{associated}} with both gene repression and activation. To eliminate indirect effects and examine the direct consequences <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 binding and H 3 K 79 methylation, we investigated the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> targeting <b>Dot</b> 1 to different positions in the yeast genome. Results Targeting Dot 1 did not activate transcription at a euchromatic locus. However, chromatin-bound Dot 1 derepressed heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing over a considerable distance. Unexpectedly, Dot 1 -mediated derepression was established by both a H 3 K 79 methylation-dependent and a methylation-independent mechanism; the latter required the histone acetyltransferase Gcn 5. By monitoring the localization of a fluorescently tagged telomere in living cells, we found that the targeting <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1, but not its methylation activity, led to the release of a telomere from the repressive environment at the nuclear periphery. This probably contributes to the activity-independent derepression <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1. Conclusions Targeting <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 promoted gene expression by antagonizing gene repression through both histone methylation and chromatin relocalization. Our findings show that binding <b>of</b> <b>Dot</b> 1 to chromatin can positively affect local gene expression by chromatin rearrangements over a considerable distance. </p...|$|R

This study was designed to examine the expression <b>of</b> <b>DOT</b> 1 L (histone 3 lysine 79 methyltransferase) and H 3 K 79 methylation in normal ovarian tissues and ovarian tumors and to explore the function <b>of</b> <b>DOT</b> 1 L and its underline mechanisms in ovarian cancer. Methods The expression <b>of</b> <b>DOT</b> 1 L and H 3 K 79 methylation in 250 ovarian tumor samples and 24 normal ovarian samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>DOT</b> 1 L on cell proliferation in vitro were evaluated using CCK 8, colony formation and flow cytometry. The DOT 1 L-targeted genes were determined using chromatin immune-precipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ChIP-PCR. Gene expression levels were measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>DOT</b> 1 L on tumor growth in vivo were evaluated using an orthotopic ovarian tumor model. Results DOT 1 L expression and H 3 K 79 methylation was significantly increased in malignant ovarian tumors. High DOT 1 L expression was associated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histologic grade, and lymphatic metastasis. DOT 1 L was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of ovarian cancer, and higher DOT 1 L expression was associated with poorer OS and PFS. Furthermore, DOT 1 L regulates the transcription of G 1 phase genes CDK 6 and CCND 3 through H 3 K 79 dimethylation; therefore, blocking DOT 1 L could result in G 1 arrest and thereby impede the cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Conclusions Our findings first demonstrate that DOT 1 L over-expression has important clinical significance in ovarian cancer and also clarify that it drives cell cycle progression through transcriptional regulation of CDK 6 and CCND 3 through H 3 K 79 methylation, suggesting that DOT 1 L might be potential target for prognostic assessment and therapeutic intervention in ovarian cancer...|$|R

Adult coherence thresholds were constant at approximately 9 %, regardless of speed or density.

40|$|The electron-hole {{correlation}} length {{serves as}} an intrinsic length scale for analyzing excitonic interactions in semiconductor nanoparticles. In this work, the derivation of electron-hole correlation length using the two-particle reduced density is presented. The correlation length was obtained by first calculating the electron-hole cumulant from the pair density,and then transforming the cumulant into intracular coordinates, and finally then imposing exact sum-rule conditions on the radial integral of the cumulant. The excitonic wave function for the calculation was obtained variationally using the electron-hole explicitly correlated Hartree-Fock method. As a consequence, both the pair density and the cumulant were explicit functions of the electron-hole separation distance.

40|$|AbstractFor {{exposure}} durations {{longer than}} about 40 msec, a field <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> in sampled motion {{has been reported}} to appear less smeared than predicted from the visual persistence of static displays. This reduction of perceived smear has been attributed to a motion “deblurring” mechanism. However, it has been long recognized that an isolated target moving continuously in a dark field appears to be extensively smeared. To reconcile these apparently contradictory observations, we investigated the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>dot</b> density on the extent of perceived smear for a single moving dot and for fields <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> with densities ranging from 0. 75 to 7. 5 dots/deg 2. Bright targets were presented in continuous motion against a photopically illuminated background field. The results reconcile previous conflicting observations by showing that the length of perceived smear decreases systematically with dot density for exposure durations longer than about 50 msec. In three additional experiments, we arranged the spatial configuration of the targets to evaluate whether motion deblurring results primarily from a motion compensation mechanism (such as integration within the spatiotemporally oriented receptive fields of putative motion mechanisms) or from inhibition exerted by spatiotemporally adjacent targets. The results show that the activation of motion mechanisms is not a sufficient condition for motion deblurring and that the reduction of perceived smear requires the presence of spatiotemporally adjacent targets. Taken together, these findings suggest that motion deblurring results primarily from masking exerted by spatiotemporally proximal targets...|$|R

In this work, we address this challenge by solving the electron-hole Schrodinger equation using the electron-hole explicitly correlated Hartree-Fock (eh-XCHF) method.

One of the key insights from this study is that the electron-hole recombination probability decreases at a much faster rate than the exciton binding energy as a function <b>of</b> <b>dot</b> size. It was found that an increase in the dot size by a factor of 16. 1, resulted in a decrease in the exciton binding energy and electron-hole recombination probability by a factor of 14. 4 and 5. 5 × 10 ^ 6, respectively.

Here we identify that DOT 1 L cooperates with c-Myc and p 300 acetyltransferase to epigenetically activate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators in breast cancer progression. DOT 1 L recognizes SNAIL, ZEB 1 and ZEB 2 promoters via interacting with the c-Myc-p 300 complex and facilitates lysine- 79 methylation and acetylation towards histone H 3, leading to the dissociation of HDAC 1 and DNMT 1 in the regions. The upregulation of these EMT regulators by the DOT 1 L-c-Myc-p 300 complex enhances EMT-induced breast cancer stem cell (CSC) -like properties. Furthermore, in vivo orthotopic xenograft models show that DOT 1 L is required for malignant transformation of breast epithelial cells and breast tumour initiation and metastasis.

The method is shown to be general and applicable to systems of different physical nature. Despite mathematical similarities of dynamical equations, the physics of the processes for quantum dots and magnetic nanoclusters is rather different. In a quantum dot assembly, coherence develops due to the Dicke <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>dot</b> interactions through the common radiation field. For a system of magnetic clusters, coherence in the spin motion appears due to the Purcell effect caused by the feedback action of a resonator. Self-organized coherent spin radiation cannot arise without a resonator. This principal difference is connected with the different physical nature of dipole forces between the objects. Effective dipole interactions between the radiating quantum dots, appearing due to photon exchange, collectivize the dot radiation. While the dipolar spin interactions exist from the beginning, yet before radiation, and on the contrary, they dephase spin motion, thus destroying the coherence of moving spins. In addition, quantum dot radiation exhibits turbulent photon filamentation that is absent for radiating spins. Comment: Latex file, 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> rapid {{thermal annealing}} on the photoluminescence spectrum of InAs/In 0. 15 Ga 0. 85 As/GaAs Quantum dot-in-a-well heterostructures is presented. The variation of ground state interband transition energies with annealing has been modeled and the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> varying <b>dot</b> aspect ratios, well indium concentrations and well thicknesses analysed on both peak transition energy and winterdiffusion driven blueshift in the photoluminescence spectrum. Our simulations indicate that at low annealing temperatures indium diffusion from InAs dot to InGaAs well dominates, while at higher temperatures indium diffusion from well to GaAs barrier is predominant. Further, we see an increase in strain relaxation as the coverage <b>of</b> <b>dots</b> with InGaAs is increased, and as the indium concentration and/or thickness of InGaAs well is increased. Our model is useful in engineering dot-in-a-well heterostructures with the dual aim of achieving a desired peak wavelength and minimizing blueshift due to annealing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
