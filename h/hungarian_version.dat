2500|$|Future {{factional}} ally Benjamin Gitlow {{later recalled}} the initial impression which Pepper made upon {{him when he}} first {{met him at the}} Bridgman convention: [...] The second of the three Comintern nuncios looked like a <b>Hungarian</b> <b>version</b> of the proverbial traveling salesman. Short and stocky, with a large head and a disproportionately larger nose that proudly bore a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles perched importantly on its bridge, he dressed like a dude, combed his hair sleek and neat, was always clean-shaven, smoked gold-tipped cigarettes, listened attentively to everything that was being said in his presence, and said absolutely nothing....

2500|$|The {{original}} French-language release {{features a}} first-person narrative {{as if the}} story is being told by the penguins themselves.

For example, in the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>version,</b> actors Ákos Kőszegi, Anna Kubik, and Gábor Morvai provide the voices of the penguins, and the German version as seen in German movie theaters (and in the televised broadcast in April 2007 on channel ProSieben) uses the voices of Andrea Loewig, Thorsten Michaelis, and Adrian Kilian for the [...] "dubbed dialog" [...] of the penguins.

2500|$|The Hungarians (Magyars) in {{particular}} {{lay claim to}} Hunnic heritage. Although Magyar tribes only began to settle in the geographical area of present-day Hungary in {{the very end of}} the 9th century, some 426 years after the breakup of Attila's Hunnic Empire, Hungarian prehistory includes Magyar origin myths. There is also a medieval legend of a lineage that makes Attila the sixth-generation ancestor of Árpád conqueror of the modern Pannonian basin, through Attila's son Csaba, his son Ed, his son Ügyek, his son Előd, his son Álmos. Álmos was ruler of the Magyars and the father of Arpad The national anthem of Hungary describes the Hungarians as [...] "blood of Bendegúz'" [...] (the medieval and modern <b>Hungarian</b> <b>version</b> of Mundzuk, Attila's father). Attila's brother, Bleda, is called Buda in modern Hungarian and some medieval chronicles and literary works attribute the name of the city of Buda to him.|$|E
2500|$|A {{special section}} of Șăineanu's {{research}} {{in the same area}} was dedicated to comparative mythology. His contributions have led folklorist Linda Dégh to deem him [...] "one of the pioneers in classifying folktales according to their types". This method was employed in Basmele române, whose content was structured into both types and [...] "cycles". In Basmele române, arguing in favor of applying the principles introduced by Hasdeu, Șăineanu analyzed Romanian folktales in their native and national content. Nevertheless, he followed the conclusions of other folklorists on the universality of folklore, suggesting that the world's entire folkloric literature was structured into some tens of groups. With Studii folclorice, the researcher tested an anthropological investigation into the characteristics and supposed origins of each myth, in particular Meșterul Manole, Baba Dochia and the iele creatures. In Les rites de la construction, Șăineanu focused on a set of ballads with a similar construction- and immurement-related subject, present throughout East Central or Eastern Europe, likening the Romanian Meșterul Manole legend to its counterparts in Serbian (Zidanje Skadra), Hungarian (Kőműves Kelemen) and other regional folkloric traditions. According to critics John Neubauer and Marcel Cornis-Pope, he was [...] "the first author to attempt a synthetic treatment of the immurement motif in Eastern Europe". The two also note that Șăineanu, who believed that the motif reached its potential significance only in Eastern Europe, stayed clear of the controversy surrounding the geographic and ethnic sources of the ballad (while specifying his belief that the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>version</b> followed a Romanian source), and discussed Zidanje Skadra and Meșterul Manole as the most crafted variants of the myth.|$|E
50|$|Most Romani {{music is}} based on the folk music of the {{countries}} where the Romani went through or settled.

In its turn, Romani music has greatly influenced the local music. Among these the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>versions</b> have become best known, although examples of Romani music in other countries also endure.|$|R
