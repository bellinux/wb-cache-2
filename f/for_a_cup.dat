50|$|Cuban {{coffee is}} {{popular in the}} Cuban-American community. Cubans often drink cafe cubano: <b>a</b> small <b>cup</b> of coffee called a cafecito (or a colada), which is {{traditional}} espresso coffee, sweetened with sugar, with a little foam on top called espumita. It is also popular to add milk, which is called <b>a</b> cortadito <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small <b>cup</b> or <b>a</b> cafe con leche <b>for</b> <b>a</b> larger <b>cup.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to invite a woman <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E
5|$|The FA Cup {{was inaugurated}} in 1871, but Sheffield clubs {{declined}} {{to enter the}} competition as it was being played under FA rules. The first team to enter was Sheffield F.C. in the 1873–74 season. This was after an attempt to enter a Sheffield FA team was refused by the organisers. They reached the quarter-finals before being knocked out by Clapham Rovers. The Sheffield FA instituted their own Challenge Cup in 1876. The cup was open to {{all the members of}} the SFA that now included many clubs outside the local area. The first final attracted a crowd of 8,000, twice as much as the FA Cup final in the same season. It was a record crowd <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> match that would be held until the FA Cup of 1883. The match was between Heeley and Wednesday and resulted in a 2–0 win for the latter.|$|E
5|$|While at the dentist, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) reads {{an article}} about China's growing global power, and he decides that China must be stopped before it takes over the United States. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) tries to correct one of the {{statement}}s, but when Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) checks the fact online, it turns out Michael's statement was correct. Everyone mocks Oscar for his mistake, as Oscar is usually the smartest one in the office, having built this reputation by often correcting his coworkers. Oscar invites Michael <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee, but the other employees realize that Oscar wants to discuss China in more detail, in order to reestablish himself as the office's intellectual heavyweight. Seeing an opportunity to give Oscar a taste of his own medicine, they start quizzing Michael on different facts about China, but he cannot answer, so he makes note cards to keep track. When Michael and Oscar have their conversation, Ryan, Erin, Jim, Andy, and Kelly also sit in to watch. Michael blanks on one topic, but then changes the subject to conversation itself. The employees toast him, while Oscar is left infuriated.|$|E

25|$|The school held {{a yearly}} house championship, decided by {{a range of}} events {{throughout}} the school year in which all six houses competed, with the winners of each event being awarded eight points, the second placed house seven, down to the losing house one point. The house championship was traditionally called the 'Cock House' (or Cock House Cup Competition) competition, its name deriving {{from that of the}} Cock. The original cup that was competed for is one which was presented to the school in 1902 by the Old Elizabethans' Association; in modern times competition is <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> which was introduced in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the immense}} {{success of the}} Reliance, she was used only one season, her design and {{maintenance}} keeping her from being used for any other purpose than <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> defense. The extremity of both 1903 cup contenders encouraged Nathanael Herreshoff to make boats more wholesome and durable by devising a new rule. Proposing {{in the same year}} the Universal Rule, he added the elements of overall length and displacement into the rating, to the benefit of heavy, voluminous hulls and also divided boats into classes, without handicapping sail area. This went against the American Yacht Clubs' and the British Yacht Racing Association's general desire to promote speed at all costs for cup boats, but the NYYC adopted Herreshoff's proposal. Lipton long pleaded for a smaller size of yachts in the new rule, and the NYYC conceded to seventy-five footers in 1914. Lipton turned to Charles Ernest Nicholson for his fourth challenge, and got a superb design under the inauspicious shape of Shamrock IV, with a flat transom. She was the most powerful yacht that year, and the NYYC turned out three cup candidates to defend the cup: of George Owen's Defiance and William Gardner's Vanitie, it was Herreshoff who designed the wisest of all contenders. His last design for the cup, the Resolute, was small, which earned significant time allowance over other yachts. Barr had died, but his crew manned the Resolute, which faced stiff competition from Vanitie, but {{went on to win the}} selection trials, before the Cup was suspended as World War I broke out.|$|E

25|$|Paul's icon {{continues}} the Apostles tier {{on the right}} side. He {{was not one of}} the twelve disciples of Jesus; Paul, a Roman citizen, was arrested in Jerusalem because he was accused of preaching against the Jewish law and traditions. However, as a Roman citizen by birth, he exercised his right to appeal to Caesar. He was brought to Rome, and after six years' imprisonment, the curia sentenced him to death. Considering his Roman status, they chose the most pious way to execute him: Paul was beheaded with a sword according to tradition. This is the reason he is shown with a sword in his right hand. In his left hand he holds his epistles from the New Testament. The next icon portrays John. He has his own gospel in his left hand. Legend has it that John was the only apostle who was not martyred as he died after a long life in Ephesus. Nevertheless, he was unable to escape persecution and had to defend his faith before Domitian. The emperor told him that he should prove the strength of his God with deeds and not just words. John asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of poisoned wine that he blessed and then drank; the strength of his faith protected him and he remained unharmed. The empty chalice on his gospel is symbolic of this miracle. Luke the Evangelist appears in the next image. As in the icons of Mark and Matthew, he holds a quill and his gospel. The icon of James the Elder follows Luke's image. He was painted with a pilgrim's staff, holding a pack and a letter of pilgrimage in his right hand. James was John's brother, and he was beheaded in Judea in 44 AD. His relics were translated to Spain, where one of the first pilgrimage sites in Europe was born to venerate him. The Camino de Santiago leads to his shrine. Simon's icon is the next on the tier; he preached the Word in Egypt, and he was martyred in Armenia. Simon was put to death by a saw and is portrayed with the symbol of his martyrdom. The last image on the Apostles tier depicts Philip. He lived and spread Jesus' teachings in today's Turkey, and according to Christian traditions he was crucified upside-down. He holds a Latin Cross to commemorate his martyrdom.|$|E
