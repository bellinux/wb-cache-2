5000|$|Six {{possible}} {{species of}} Cheirolepis are currently known. The type species, named in 1835, is C. trailli. Remains {{of this species}} have been found from Scotland and {{date back to the}} Eifelian and <b>Givetian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Middle Devonian. C. canadensis was described in 1881 from material found in Miguasha, Canada that dated back to the middle Frasnian stage of the Late Devonian. Two species, C. gracilis and C. gaugeri, have been found from Germany and Belarus in deposits that are of Givetian age. They were first described in 1973 from scale material that is now of questionable validity. Another species has been found from Belarus that lived during the Eifelian, and has been named C. sinualis. A new species has recently been described from a locality in Red Hill, Nevada deposited during the Mid-Late Devonian boundary. The specimen from which this species was named, consisting of scales and a lower jaw, was originally referred to C. canadensis. New, more complete specimens have shown it to be distinct from the type, although a species name is yet to be given for the remains.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAfter terrestrialization, the {{diversification}} of arthropods and vertebrates {{is thought to}} have occurred in two distinct phases 1, the first between the Silurian and the Frasnian stages (Late Devonian period) (425 – 385 [*]million years (Myr) ago), and the second characterized by the emergence of numerous new major taxa, during the Late Carboniferous period (after 345 [*]Myr ago). These two diversification periods bracket the depauperate vertebrate Romer’s gap (360 – 345 [*]Myr ago) and arthropod gap (385 – 325 [*]Myr ago) 1, which could be due to preservational artefact 2, 3. Although a recent molecular dating has given an age of 390 [*]Myr for the Holometabola 4, the record of hexapods during the Early–Middle Devonian (411. 5 – 391 [*]Myr ago, Pragian to <b>Givetian</b> <b>stages)</b> is exceptionally sparse and based on fragmentary remains, which hinders the timing of this diversification. Indeed, although Devonian Archaeognatha are problematic 5, 6, the Pragian of Scotland has given some Collembola and the incomplete insect Rhyniognatha, with its diagnostic dicondylic, metapterygotan mandibles 5, 7. The oldest, definitively winged insects are from the Serpukhovian stage (latest Early Carboniferous period) 8. Here we report the first complete Late Devonian insect, which was probably a terrestrial species. Its ‘orthopteroid’ mandibles are of an omnivorous type, clearly not modified for a solely carnivorous diet. This discovery narrows the 45 -Myr gap in the fossil record of Hexapoda, and demonstrates further a first Devonian phase of diversification for the Hexapoda, as in vertebrates, and suggests that the Pterygota diversified before and during Romer’s gap...|$|R

50|$|Tristichopterids (Tristichopteridae) were {{a diverse}} and {{successful}} group of tetrapodomorph fishes living throughout the Middle and Late Devonian.

Within the group sizes ranged from a few tens of centimeters (Tristichopterus) to several meters (Hyneria and Eusthenodon). Some tristichopterids share some of the features of the elpistostegalians, a paraphyletic assemblage of fishes close to the origin of tetrapods. This mainly concerns the shape of the skull and a reduction in size of the posterior fins.|$|E
40|$|New teeth {{belonging}} to Karksiodus mirus Ivanov & Märss (Chondrichthyes) were found together with putative chondrichthyan scales in five new localities of the Leningrad Region, northwestern Russia, within the Aruküla and Burtnieki regional <b>stages,</b> <b>Givetian,</b> Middle Devonian. The teeth exhibit {{variability in the}} number of cusps, angles between the lateral cusps, base curvature, length of lateral parts and the prominence of the wall of the transversal basal canal. Karksiodus tooth material collected from these sites suggests that this taxon possesses an heterodont dentition and a specific, complex vascularization system affecting the dental base and the crown. Enameloid tissue seems to be absent, thus the surface striations on the cusps are presumably made up by orthodentine. The fish fauna from these localities is listed...|$|R
40|$|The Devonian Period was {{characterized}} by extensive shallow-marine regions, with the largest carbonate platform development of the Phanerozoic Eon. The research carried out in this thesis integrates field work, petrographic analysis, conodont biostratigraphy, elemental and carbon isotope geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility and magnetic hysteresis measurement. The aim, to better understand and characterize the environmental conditions {{that led to the}} development of three of the largest European Devonian carbonate platforms. This multi-disciplinary study also proposes to validate the use of magnetic susceptibility as a reliable tool for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction and long-distance correlation in marine carbonate. Fieldwork was conducted on four key sections of the European Pre-Mesozoic massifs: the Ardennes (La Thure and Fromelennes-Flohimont), the Rheinisches Schiefergebirge (Burgberg) and the Carnic Alps (Freikofel). The large quantity and in-depth analysis of rock samples and thin-sections has demonstrated the fascinating environmental diversity that shaped the carbonate platforms in the Rhenohecynian and Paleotethys oceans towards the mid-late Devonian times. The aforementioned analysis has enabled the development of reconstructed sedimentary models and large-scale shallowing-deepening histories for each section. New and published biostratigraphic data provided reliable age constraints for the foremost environmental changes evident in each of the sections. δ 13 C results from the Frasnian – Famennian boundary in the Burgberg and Freikofel sections have revealed Kellwasser events in limestone lithologies. Based on the analysis of ± 1800 samples, a high-resolution magnetic susceptibility (MS) curve for each section has been developed, highlighting the strong link between the MS signatures and the syn-sedimentary parameters, such as carbonate productivity/sedimentation rate, water agitation and siliciclastic input. The comparison between MS and elemental geochemistry datasets has demonstrated the inherent-parallel link existing between the siliciclastic input proxies and the variation in MS signature in each of the sections. Magnetic hysteresis measurements have shown that ferromagnetic minerals such as magnetite control the MS signal. By comparing our data sets with published data we could confirm that our MS signal is remagnetized. However links between siliciclastic input proxies and MS, and between MS and environmental parameters have proven a relatively good preservation of the primary depositionally-induced MS signal. Finally, by integrating complete data and establishing a correlation chart including the four long-term MS curves, it is apparent that on a regional scale long-term MS trends can be correlated, as long as the evolution of the main depositional setting in the sections studied remains comparable. The significant impact of syn-sedimentary parameters on the final MS signature seems to obscure the imprint of parameters driving variations in continental erosion (e. g., climate, sea-level and tectonic variations) and therefore limiting the inter-regional correlations. This collaborative project on time-series analysis of long-term high-resolution MS records in the Dinant Syncline has revealed the imprint of astronomical parameters, giving rise to a more accurate estimate of the <b>Givetian</b> <b>Stage’s</b> duration...|$|R
40|$|About 2, 450 carapaces, {{valves and}} {{fragments}} of ostracods have been extracted from 94 samples {{collected in the}} Fromelennes, Nismes and Moulin Liénaux Formations at Nismes, close to Frasnes (southern border of the Dinant Synclinorium, Belgium). Sixty-three taxa belonging to the Eifelian Mega-Assemblage are recognized. The only significant change as deduced from the ostracod fauna is the progressive transition from lagoonal and semi-restricted environments to open-marine environments in {{the upper part of}} the Fromelennes Fm. The Polyzygia beckmanni beckmanni Zone and the Favulella lecomptei Zone established on metacopid ostracods are recognized at Nismes, and the simultaneous occurrence of these two species in a sample collected in {{the upper part of the}} Sourd d’Ave Mbr implies the emendation of the definition of the P. beckmanni beckmanni Zone. The new definition is: presence of P. beckmanni beckmanni before the first occurrence of F. lecomptei. A new species, Ovatoquasillites nismesensis nov. sp., is described. The sedimentological analysis confirms that the transition of the <b>Givetian</b> and Frasnian <b>stages</b> does not correspond to a particular event. The evolution of the lithological curve across the Givetian / Frasnian boundary allows the recognition of 5 sequences recording a general drowning of the Givetian carbonate platform. No effective barrier system was active at that time suggesting that the Givetian carbonate platform was already dismantled prior to its definitive drowning...|$|R
50|$|Remains of Tinirau {{were first}} {{discovered}} by paleontologist Joseph T. Gregory in 1970, who then {{worked for the}} University of California Berkeley. Gregory and his field team found these fossils near the Simpson Park Mountains in Eureka County, Nevada. They came from a deposit called the Red Hill I beds, which date to the upper <b>Givetian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Middle Devonian. The Red Hill I beds include a series of limestone and mudstone, likely deposited in an outer continental shelf marine environment. Six fossils are known, all preserving bones of the skull. Two fossils preserve postcranial bones in articulation. The holotype specimen, UCMP 118605, is a mostly complete skeleton.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Givetian</b> <b>Stage</b> in the Givet area is {{represented}} by {{the main part of the}} Hanonet Fm, the Trois-Fontaines Fm, the Terres d'Haurs Fm, the Mont d'Haurs Fm, the Fromelennes Fm and the lowest part of the Nismes Fm. During Eifelian-Givetian transition, the sedimentary systems evolved from a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp to a carbonate platform dominated by cyclic tidal-flat and lagoonal wackestones with local patch reefs or coralgal banks. The shelf had an ESE-WNW trend and extended from the Avesnois basin (northern France) in the west to Aachen (western Germany). The sedimentation in the Ardennes consists of shallow water regressive metric (around 5 m or less) cycles. Stromatopores, corals, brachiopods, algae and cyanobacteria are abundant. Due to this general shallow water setting, the base of the <b>Givetian</b> <b>Stage</b> has been defined by the IUGS Subcommission on Devonian Stratigraphy in a GSSP in southern Morocco referring to the first occurence of the condodont species Polygnathus hemiansatus. The conodont species Icriodus obliquimarginatus appears approximately at the same level in Belgium...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in radiometric dating result in {{significant improvements in}} the geological timescale and provide better insight into the timing of various processes and evolutions within the Earth's system.

We examined the high-resolution magnetic susceptibility signals of four Givetian outcrops in the Givet area for a possible astronomical imprint, to fully understand the rates of evolutionary and environmental change. All four sections are firmly correlated and wavelet analyses of the magnetic susceptibility signals reveal the imprint of astronomical eccentricity forcing.

40|$|The Devonian marks a {{critical}} {{stage in the}} early evolution of vertebrates: It opens with an unprecedented diversity of fishes and closes with the earliest evidence of limbed tetrapods. However, {{the latter part of}} the Devonian has also been characterized as a period of global biotic crisis marked by two large extinction pulses: a “Big Five” mass extinction event at the Frasnian-Famennian stage boundary (374 Ma) and the less well-documented Hangenberg event some 15 million years later at the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (359 Ma). Here, we report the results of a wide-ranging analysis of the impact of these events on early vertebrate evolution, which was obtained from a database of vertebrate occurrences sampling over 1, 250 taxa from 66 localities spanning <b>Givetian</b> to Serpukhovian <b>stages</b> (391 to 318 Ma). We show that major vertebrate clades suffered acute and systematic effects centered on the Hangenberg extinction involving long-term losses of over 50 % of diversity and the restructuring of vertebrate ecosystems worldwide. Marine and nonmarine faunas were equally affected, precluding the existence of environmental refugia. The subsequent recovery of previously diverse groups (including placoderms, sarcopterygian fish, and acanthodians) was minimal. Tetrapods, actinopterygians, and chondrichthyans, all scarce within the Devonian, undergo large diversification events in the aftermath of the extinction, dominating all subsequent faunas. The Hangenberg event represents a previously unrecognized bottleneck in the evolutionary history of vertebrates as a whole and a historical contingency that shaped the roots of modern biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis The {{diversification}} of the tetrapod stem group {{occurred during the}} late Middle through the Late Devonian, that is from the <b>Givetian</b> to Famennian <b>stages</b> about 385 – 365 million years ago. The relationships between the known taxa representing this radiation have currently reached a reasonable consensus so that interpretations {{of the order of}} appearance of tetrapod characters is possible. The immediate fish relatives of the earliest limbed tetrapods show what is interpreted as a progressive increase in the spiracular chamber and its opening to the outside. Here, this is inferred to be associated with an increased capacity for air-breathing. Lungs are thought to have been present in most early bony fishes, and were most likely ventilated by air-gulping. This could have brought about a facultative capacity for air-breathing, which the tetrapod stem group exploited to the greatest degree. These adaptations are shown not only in freshwater forms but also in estuarine and marginal marine forms. Estimates of oxygen levels during this period suggest that they were unprecedentedly low during the Givetian and Frasnian periods. At the same time, plant diversification was at its most rapid, changing the character of the landscape and contributing, via soils, soluble nutrients, and decaying plant matter, to anoxia in all water systems. The co-occurrence of these global events may explain the evolution of air-breathing adaptations in at least two lobe-finned groups, contributing directly to the rise of the tetrapod stem group. In contrast to recent studies, low atmospheric oxygen is not considered to be a causal factor in the lack of fossils documenting the evolution of Early Carboniferous tetrapods...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we propose}} an {{approach}} to establish a preliminary age chronology for complete stages within the Phanerozoic by applying cyclostratigraphic methods that employ high-resolution data sets. This requires use of geochemical or geophysical data known {{to serve as a}} cyclic climate proxy. To demonstrate the method, we use the magnetostratigraphic susceptibility technique as the basis for fitting a climate model to the <b>Givetian</b> <b>Stage</b> of the Middle Devonian System. We show a Milankovitch eccentricity climate zonation for the Givetian that is pinned to time-series analyses from outcrop samples from its upper (Givetian/Frasnian, France) and lower (Eifelian/Givetian, Morocco) stage boundaries. Using these data sets we construct a uniform cyclicity model designed to conform to a ~  405  kyr cyclicity, with a duration corresponding to the published duration for the Givetian of ~  4. 4  myr (Kaufmann, 2006). To this model we fit two well-established conodont zonation schemes, thus allowing time estimates for conodont ranges for the Givetian, indicating a range from ~  1. 8  myr to ~  100  kyr before extinction of an individual conodont species. We then test and adjust the model using independent data sets from the eastern United States. Adjustments to the initial model yield a duration of ~  28 climate half-cycles (zones) for the <b>Givetian</b> <b>Stage</b> and an increased age to ~  5. 6  myr. These zones allow high correlation among sections to better resolve timing of major bio-events, and provide a Floating Point Time Scale to which absolute ages can be applied...|$|E

40|$|The Hujiersite Formation of West Junggar, Xinjiang contain fossil {{plants that}} {{represent}} significant examples of Middle Devonian flora in North China. However, previous radio-isotopic age constraint for this fossil-rich formation is absent. The best-studied {{section of the}} Hujiersite Flora occurs at a locality referred to as 251 Hill, which exposes numerous examples of fossil plants and information on depositional environment. In this study, we investigate the geological background of the 251 Hill section and collect two tuffaceous sandstone beds from a normal fault near the classic fossil outcrop. U-Pb ICP-MS analysis of detrital zircons from these samples gave a maximum depositional age of 385 Ma (<b>Givetian</b> <b>stage)</b> for the hanging wall and 380 Ma (early Frasnian stage) for the footwall of the upper Hujiersite Formation.

40|$|Abstract: Palaeozoic radiometric {{dates are}} so {{isolated}} and crude as to offer little numerical precision in stratigraphy. In a Givetian sequence of pelagic micrites in the Montagne Noire of southern France {{there is a}} succession of small-scale microrhythms which appear to represent precessional signatures. Correlations {{can be made with}} other sections in the Tafilalt of southern Morocco and, for the late Givetian, in the Marble Cliff Beds of north Cornwall. Now that the IUGS has approved boundaries defining the upper and lower limits of the Givetian it is possible to estimate the number of putative precessional signatures for the whole Givetian and, using the calculation of periods for these in the Devonian, to estimate the duration of the Givetian and its conodont zones independantly from radiometric dates. Graphical correlation techniques ar used to establish a time framework for the Givetian and this is used to estimate he duration of zones in relation to the preliminary precessional scale, and hence to estimate their duration in real time. Biological changes and sedimentary events can similarly be constrained against a scale for the Givetian. It is suggested that such techniques, using a stage for a base, is likely to be useful ong before continuous orbital forcing timescales (OFT) can be established. It would be a start in eliminating present crude estimates of the length of stages based on the false presumption that zones within them are of equal duration. Given boundaries, defined internationally b IUGS at Global Stratotype Section and Points, such OFT scales would enable events and zonal durations to be given in relation to OPT graphic omposite scales and on the basis of estimated precessional signatures. The problem of giving numerical ages to system and stage boundaries through geological time is well known. For the Tertiary and late Mesozoic considerable progress has been made, but the Palaeozoic has lagged far behind and estimates are crude in the extreme. The author has published a short paper (House 1992) suggesting that for the <b>Givetian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Devonian improvements might be possible.
