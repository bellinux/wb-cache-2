40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{frequency}} of ectopic pregnancies (EP) in women hospitalized yearly in relation to <b>IUD</b> <b>insertions</b> and number of live births, evaluating possible associated variables and characteristics of diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: In a cohort cross-sectional study, data was obtained from 151 women with EP hospitalized between 2000 and 2004, comparing the number of EP with that of live births and <b>IUD</b> <b>insertions,</b> annually. Variables studied were: age, schooling, marital status, current use and history of previous IUD use, history of abortions, infertility and EP, treatment and surgery performed, site of insertion, unruptured/ruptured EP, length of hospitalization, blood transfusion and complications. Analysis of frequencies was performed and multiple linear regression procedures were used for variables that could be associated with variation in the ratios studied each year. The study {{was approved by the}} Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: The frequency of EP did not increase in the five years studied. Only the percentage of women with previous EP was associated with prevalence of EP. Age of 80 % of the women ranged from 20 to 34 years, 61 % did not use contraceptive methods, 4. 6 % currently used and 10 % had used IUD, 42 % reported having had an abortion, 18 % infertility and 15 % a previous EP. Hospital admissions occurred in 69. 5 % of women with ruptured EP. Treatment was conservative for 20 % and radical surgery for 80 % of these women, 47 % of women remained hospitalized for > 4 days. There were 20. 5 % of transfusions and five complications. CONCLUSION: Frequency of ectopic pregnancies remained unchanged in the period under study and only the percentage of women with previous EP was associated with frequency of EP. OBJETIVOS: Comparar a freqüência de gestações ectópicas (GE) internadas anualmente em relação às inserções de DIU e o número de nascidos vivos, avaliar possíveis variáveis associadas e características do diagnóstico e tratamento. MÉTODOS: Estudo de coorte transversal; foram utilizados dados de 151 mulheres com GE internadas entre 2000 e 2004, relacionou-se o número de GE com o de nascidos vivos e inserções de DIU, anualmente. As variáveis analisadas foram idade, escolaridade, estado marital, uso atual e antecedente de uso de DIU, antecedentes de aborto, esterilidade e GE, tratamento e cirurgia realizada, sítio de inserção, GE íntegra/ rota, tempo de internação, transfusão sangüínea e complicações. Realizou-se análise de freqüências e regressão linear múltipla para as variáveis que poderiam estar associadas à variação nas razões estudadas a cada ano. O estudo teve a aprovação do Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa. RESULTADOS: A freqüência de GE não cresceu significativamente nos cinco anos estudados e somente a percentagem de mulheres com GE anterior esteve associada à prevalência de GE. A idade de 80 % das mulheres foi 20 a 34 anos, 61 % não utilizavam MAC, 4, 6 % utilizavam e 10 % haviam utilizado DIU, 42 % referiram aborto, 18 % esterilidade e 15 % GE anterior.

Methods: A group of 50 patients who had an intrauterine device introduced within tenminutes after delivery of the placenta were studied. Twenty-fivewomen had vaginal delivery and 25 had cesarean sections. Theintrauterine device used in this study was the Multiload CU 375,standard model, manufactured by Organon Ltd., in Ireland. Theintrauterine device was inserted in those who had vaginal deliveryeither manually and under anesthesia, or with an inserter, whichdid not require anesthesia. In patients who had cesarean sections,the insertion was manual. Clinical and ultrasound follow up wasperformed four times: 48 hours postpartum, and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The distance {{from the top of the}} intrauterine device to theuterine fundus was measured by ultrasound. Results: This studyshowed a significant difference in postplacental intrauterinedevices inserted after vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections. The expulsion/removal rate was 32 % among the subjects who hadan intrauterine device inserted after vaginal delivery. There wereno expulsions or removals in those submitted to cesarean sections. In the control ultrasound of intrauterine devices inserted aftervaginal delivery, at 6 weeks, the distance of 10 mm from the top ofthe device to the fundus was an average standard measurementto determine continuation (distance 10 mm,the IUD would be expelled or be removed). There were no cases ofuterine infections or perforations, and no pregnancies during thecourse of this study. Conclusions: Postplacental intrauterine deviceinsertion showed to be an useful and safe contraceptive method.

40|$|The Family Planning Centre of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Debrecen {{having more}} than 45, 000 IUD cases {{provided}} {{a unique opportunity to}} study and evaluate the incidence of rare clinical events associated with long-term IUD use. Keeping in mind to get statistically valid results of such rare events, I have selected ectopic pregnancy and cervical carcinoma as the main focus of my Ph. D thesis. Since the incidence of these two rare events is in a minimum of magnitude of thousandth, statistical evaluations are valid provided with large number of cases and longer observation period. This becomes an absolute condition especially in terms of premalignant and malignant pathologies of the cervix. To the best of my knowledge, results based on a single centre’s direct clinical observation with such a huge number of stringently followed-up cases {{for a long period of}} use has not been published yet. The number of patients at risk at the end of follow up period of 10 years (550 - 846) and the cumulative women months of use (180, 000 - 492, 000) was sufficient to conclude valid statistical results. On the sound basis of these fulfilled conditions, it is concluded that there is no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of ectopic pregnancy among medicated and non-medicated IUDs, in other words: duration of use of IUD does not play any role in generating ectopic pregnancy. Similar results have been concluded for cervical carcinoma as well: in case of premalignant and malignant cervical pathologies – also based on a long follow-up (10 years), a great number of cases (more then 17, 000 <b>IUD</b> <b>insertions)</b> and a huge observation period (163, 567 - 492, 836) – there were no statistically significant differences between the non medicated and the copper containing devices. As such, it can be stated that on comparison to the non-medicated (Szontágh) IUDs, the copper-containing intrauterine contraceptive devices do not have either an increased or a decreased risk of cervical cancer. The observation of the two rare clinical events during IUD use and the evaluation of the results with ectopic pregnancy and cervical premalignancies and malignancies further strengthen the opinion that intrauterine contraceptive devices still remain one of the most effective and safe method of contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancies.

50|$|The {{hormonal}} IUD {{is inserted}} {{in a similar}} procedure to the nonhormonal copper IUD, and can only be inserted by a qualified medical practitioner. Before insertion, a pelvic exam is performed to examine the shape and position of the uterus. It is also recommended that patients be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia prior to insertion, as a current STI {{at the time of}} insertion can increase the risk of pelvic infection.During the insertion, the vagina is held open with a speculum, the same device used during a pap smear. A grasping instrument is used to steady the cervix, the length of the uterus is measured for proper insertion, and the IUD is placed using a narrow tube through the opening of the cervix into the uterus. A short length of monofilament plastic/nylon string hangs down from the cervix into the vagina. The string allows physicians and patients to check to ensure the IUD is still in place and enables easy removal of the device. Mild to moderate cramping can occur during the procedure, which generally takes five minutes or less. Insertion can be performed immediately postpartum and post-abortion if no infection has occurred.

Clinicians at ambulatory healthcare centres participated in a PelvicSim IUD training programme and completed a self-administered survey. The survey assessed prior experience with <b>IUD</b> <b>insertion,</b> pre- and post-training competency and comfort and opinions regarding the acceptability of the PelvicSim. Results. The 237 participants were primarily female (97. 5 %) nurse practitioners (71. 3 %).
