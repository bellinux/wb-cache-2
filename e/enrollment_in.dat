40|$|Undergraduate <b>enrollments</b> <b>in</b> natural {{resources}} were analyzed for 30 NAUFRP institutions {{from around the}} country, covering the period 1980 - 2009.

Forestry <b>enrollments,</b> which <b>in</b> 1980 constituted {{nearly half of the}} total <b>enrollments</b> <b>in</b> all natural resource fields, currently make up less than only about one-fifth of these enrollments.

After the higher-priority bowl games made their selections, the Humanitarian Bowl had the choice of either Maryland or Wake Forest, the school with the smallest <b>enrollment</b> <b>in</b> any BCS football conference.

5|$|In {{order to}} secure a {{position}} as a teacher, erudite in the capital, or government official, a student could choose one of several paths to become well educated. Perhaps the most prestigious path was <b>enrollment</b> <b>in</b> the Imperial University. Students had to be above the age of eighteen to enroll, and were selected by the Minister of Ceremonies from those recommended by local authorities. Other students could choose to enroll in a school sponsored by the local commandery government. A professional teacher who opened a private school {{in a small town}} or village could sometimes gather a following of several hundred to over a thousand students. Students were expected to pay tuition, thus a teacher enjoyed a significant salary. His standing in the local community was usually paramount, and was even sought as an arbiter in disputes. Although the size of the Imperial Academy was greatly expanded in Eastern Han, private schools grew in importance as the imperial government lost authority and its academy's persecution of Old Text tradition drove many to pursue Old Text studies in private institutions.|$|E
