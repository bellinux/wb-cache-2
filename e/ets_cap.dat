40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic, environmental and distributional impacts of an idealised tradable white certificate (TWC) scheme and {{shows how the}} impacts are modified when the scheme operates in parallel with the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS). It uses simple graphical techniques to assess whether a TWC scheme will increase, decrease or have an ambiguous effect on electricity demand, wholesale and retail electricity prices, carbon emissions and investment in energy efficiency, paying {{particular attention to the}} interpretation of 'additionality'. Following a comparable analysis {{of the impact of the}} EU ETS, the paper {{examines the}} implications of introducing a white certificate scheme in a country that is already participating in the EU ETS. It compares the effect of this combination of instruments to that of the EU ETS operating in isolation. It concludes that there is no necessary link between the price of white certificates and marginal cost of energy efficiency investment, the price of electricity or the ability of the suppliers to eliminate free riders from their subsidy schemes. Also, a TWC scheme will make no contribution to reducing global carbon emissions unless and until it leads to a tightening of the EU <b>ETS</b> <b>cap.</b> White certificate schemes Emissions trading Policy interaction...|$|E
40|$|Launched in 2005, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is {{the first}} and largest cap-and-trade system of {{allowances}} for emitting greenhouse gases in the world. As such it represents a valuable policy experiment from which lessons can be drawn. Despite the diverse achievements of the EU ETS so far, the scheme is still far from having fulfilled its theoretical potential. Although it has been proven that the scheme led to abatement during the first phase, carbon prices have remained too low to promote investments in the development, diffusion and deployment of low-carbon technologies. Yet, if the EU wants to achieve the long-term challenge of ‘decarbonising’ its economy, a credible and long-term carbon price is needed to insure green investments. The lack of reliable and verified data for emission projections and the industry and Member States’ fear of the scheme’s economic costs led to a first phase with many design shortcomings. Some of these shortcomings were solved {{in the second phase}} but most have remained. In order to address the scheme’s design flaws and, thereby, improve the scheme’s credibility in its future Phase III, the ETS Directive was thoroughly revised in 2008. The analysis of the revised directive shows that most of the lessons from the earlier experience have been learned. However, since this revision, the economic crisis occurred and has greatly undermined the efficiency of the ETS, changing the political and economic landscape in which the EU’s climate policy was projected. By reducing industrial production, the economic recession has certainly reduced emissions but has also ensured that carbon prices stay low in the forthcoming years, delaying the necessary shift towards a low-carbon economy. In order to prevent Phase III from being rendered ineffective before its start and in order to ensure the EU ETS’ credibility as an effective means of reducing emissions, the <b>ETS</b> <b>cap</b> must be unilaterally revised towards an objective of 30 % emission reduction by 2020. This would not only correct the negative consequences of the economic recession on the scheme but would also boost investment in the development of green technologies. Besides, the future of the scheme will very much depend on the international context, which is far from clear. While the negotiations for a global climate agreement are progressing painfully, the ambition of the EU to link up its ETS with other trading systems in order to progressively build up an international global carbon market is very uncertain due to the waving will of external actors. Developments at the international level have created further uncertainties, hindering investment in green technologies. Against this background, this paper will analyse the lessons learnt so far from the EU ETS {{in order to have a}} better perspective of its future. After a general outline of the EU ETS (§ 1) its main achievements will be considered (§ 2). Next, the various shortcomings of the scheme in its first phase and ongoing second phase will be analysed (§ 3), followed by a description of the new design features of the revised scheme post- 2012 (§ 4). Then, it will be assessed how the shortcomings of the first years’ experience have been taken into account in the revised ETS scheme as well as how the recession has since then undermined these improvements, thereby reducing the efficiency of the future scheme (§ 5). Finally, the lessons learnt from the EU ETS so far and what they tell us on the future prospects of the scheme will be summarised in a conclusion...|$|E

In recent years {{the concept of the}} evapotranspirative (<b>ET)</b> <b>cap</b> has been developed in which the cap is designed to store all rain infiltration and re-evapotranspire it during dry weather. Con-cern at the long period required for landfilled {{municipal solid waste}} to decompose and stabilize in arid and semi-arid climates has led to an extension of the concept of the <b>ET</b> <b>cap.</b> With the infiltrate–stabilize–evapotranspire (ISE) cap, rain infiltration during wet weather is permitted to enter the underlying waste, thus accelerating the decomposition and stabilization proc-ess. Excess infiltration is then removed from both waste and cap by evaporation during dry weather. The paper describes the construction and operation of two sets of experimental ISE caps, one in a winter rainfall semi-arid climate, and the other in a summer rainfall semi-arid climate. Observation of the rainfall, soil evaporation and amount of water stored in the caps has allowed water balances to be constructed for caps of various thicknesses. These observations show that the ISE concept is viable. In the limit, when there is insufficient rain-fall to infiltrate the waste, an ISE cap operates as an <b>ET</b> <b>cap...</b>|$|R

30|$|Nowadays, vacuum {{insulation}} panels (VIPs) {{are regarded as}} one of the optimum thermal adiabatic materials for the energy conservation purpose on the market. The thermal insulation performances observed, even ten times better than common heat insulation materials can be achieved by applying VIPs, resulting in a great potential for the reduction of energy loss in thermal space with slim exterior-protected walls (Fricke et al. 2008; Baetens 2010; Nussbaumer et al. 2006; Nussbaumer et al. 2005; Brunner <b>et</b> al. 2012; <b>Caps</b> <b>et</b> al. 2001). The flat VIPs contain a porous core material which withstands the atmospheric air pressure, a gas-tight barrier envelope that is optimized for low air & moisture leakage rate and for a long service life to maintain the internal vacuum level, and getter or gas absorption materials, if necessary, to absorb internal gas from leakage or other sources. That is, the VIPs make use of vacuum to suppress heat transfer due to rarefied gaseous conduction (Bouquerel et al. 2012 a; Bouquerel et al. 2012 b; Alam et al. 2011). So the thermal adiabatic property of VIPs dramatically depends on the core materials and the internal gas pressure. The porous materials, such as, micro-open foam, nano-structured power and fine fiber, are commonly used as core materials of VIPs, which are easily evacuated and have minimum thermal conduction effect (Kwon et al. 2009). The heat transfer processing in VIPs is via solid conduction, rarefied gas conduction, radiation and convection occurring at interface of gas and solid wall which is nearly zero, is always ignored in calculation. The solid conduction and radiation depends on the structure, the porosity and properties of core materials, while the gas conduction by the residual gases embraced in the caves depends on the internal gas pressure which maybe increased with time. So the ETC. of VIPs must be function of the variables mentioned above.|$|R

The experiment required three similar bays, one to serve as control a d two to compare the fate and behaviour of oil and an oil-dispersant mix spilled in the nearshore zone. Geomorphic and sedimentologic observations indicate that (1) the shoreline sediments of Cape Hatt are reworked glacial deposits, (2) bays facing Eclipse Sound are the most exposed to wave and ice action and those of Z-Lagoon are the most sheltered, (3) there is a westerly sediment transport direction in the bays of Eclipse Sound, a winnowing of fines from the most exposed bays of Z-Lagoon and several transport directions in Ragged Channel and (4) ice action is the most important process at Cape Hatt. Qualitative assessment of these features was used to recommend that Bay 10 be used for control, Bay 9 for the oil-alone experiment and Bay 11 for the oil-dispersant mix experiment. Geological features, however, reflect the integration f all processes operating at Cape Hatt over long periods f time and do not warrant as high a priority as meteorological and o eanographic criteria in the final selection of bays for the BIOS Project.

Renutrition should take into account clinical characteristics unique to these patients, such as gastroparesis and fear of gaining body weight. The efficacy of tube feeding and home-tube feeding (Home-TF) has been suggested in AN and proven in bulimia nervosa (BN). TF and home-TF allow a better body weight gain (mainly fat-free mass) in AN patients and a strong decrease in the frequency {{and the intensity of}} binge-eating/purging episodes at relatively short-term (1 year) in BN patients. In AN, home-TF does not increase anxiety, depression, or worsen the eating behavior. In BN patients, home-TF decreases anxiety and depressive state and improves the quality of life. The goal of home-TF is not to cure the patients, but only to avoid serious malnutrition and its complications and to insure a better investment of the patients for their psychotherapy. Home-TF must be associated with psychotherapy, namely cognitive behavioural therapy and family therapy in adolescents. If the fear of gaining body weight is too high, the risk of failure of home-TF, because of poor compliance, is increasing. In any case, the aims and the goals of home-TF should be extensively explained. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. RESUME La nutrition entérale à domicile (NEAD) a fait en partie la preuve de son efficacité en cas d’anorexie mentale. La NEAD est très efficace à court terme contre les crises de boulimie. La NEAD permet une plus grande prise de poids et de masse maigre dans l’anorexie que l’approche classique. La NEAD permet aussi une diminution importante de la fréquence et de l’intensité des crises de boulimie. Elle n’altère pas l’humeur, ni n’aggrave le comportement alimentaire. La NEAD n’a pas pour objectif de guérir les malades, mais de passer un <b>cap</b> <b>et</b> de rendre la psychothérapie plus pertinente. La NEAD ne doit pas remplacer le travail diététique, ni faire faire l’économie du travail cognitif et comportemental. Si le malade a trop peur de grossir, la NEAD a de grandes chances d’être rejetée ou mise en échec. Il est donc essentiel de bien cibler les malades et de bien leur expliquer la démarche thérapeutique...|$|R
30|$|Cap {{color is}} an {{important}} quality trait for traders and consumers. The consumer preference seems to be for either pure white or dark brown. White cultivars represent still the largest part of the market, but the sale of brown button mushrooms is gradually increasing (Callac <b>et</b> al. 1998). <b>Cap</b> color is a quantitative trait controlled by a major locus on CHR 8 and several minor loci (Foulongne-Oriol et al. 2012 a; Gao et al. 2015). Since CC is mainly determined by one locus resulting in a white or non-white phenotype QTL mapping of this trait leads to extremely high LOD value and was, therefore, {{not included in the}} multi-trait analysis. Single-trait QTL analysis confirmed the presence of the major QTL on chromosome 8 explaining up to 87.6  % of the phenotypic variation in CC (Additional file 1 : Table S 6), which is in agreement with that reported in the previous studies. Cap color was measured with CIELAB image system in those two studies. In our study, the color scoring ranged from 1 to 5, and that might explain the absence of the minor QTLs. The minor QTL for CC, however, might represent important modifier genes that influence the color intensity. A shorter crop cycle is relevant for the production costs. Production ER is positively correlated with the speed of COCO, i.e., the faster the COCO, the earlier the mushroom production. Five QTLs for ER were detected previously on chromosome 1, 2, 5, 10 and 11 in an intervarietal segregating population (Foulongne-Oriol et al. 2012 a). Three of these were also detected in this study, but not the ones on CHR 1 and CHR 11. Over all QTLs detected for ER, the beneficial alleles for earlier mushrooms were mostly contributed by the wild parents (Mes 09143 or Z 8). If these QTLs can be assigned to smaller chromosome regions, it may facilitate marker-assisted breeding for an earlier producing cultivar. Smoothness of mushroom cap {{is an important}} quality trait, because SC on mushroom cap discolor easily post-harvest and reduce thus the quality. Although the two parental heterokaryons of Set 1 and Set 3 were not significantly different in scaling, the high value alleles beneficial for smoothness of the major QTL (31.4  % explained variance) were from the wild parent Mes 09143 and Z 8, which might be useful for breeding smoother mushroom caps.|$|R
40|$|The female {{gametophyte}} {{of higher}} plants {{gives rise to}} the diploid embryo and the triploid endosperm which develop to produce the mature seed. Seed development is a concerted interplay of the embryo, endosperm and the surrounding diploid maternal tissue. In addition, it is highly dependent on the contribution from genetic programs executed in the gametophytic generations. What role the gametophytic maternal factors play in this process is still largely unknown. This thesis describes two approaches to identify novel genes involved in seed development. A forward genetic approach addresses the molecular nature of the maternal effect mutant capulet 2 (cap 2) by molecular mapping and a reverse genetics approach analyze the role in seed development of candidate genes from a promoter trap screen. The capulet 2 gametophytic maternal-effect mutant was found in a linkage based screen preformed to identify gametophytic mutants in Arabidopsis (Grini <b>et</b> al., 1999). <b>cap</b> 2 embryo and endosperm development is blocked at a very early stages, and heterozygous plants display a 50 % reduced seed set. To investigate the molecular nature of the CAP 2 gene, a map-based cloning approach was performed. Using PCR-based molecular markers the cap 2 mutation was mapped to a genetic interval of 4238 basepairs, on the tip of the right arm of chromosome 1. This interval spanned parts of two genes, one involved in monoterpenoid biosynthesis and the other putatively involved in triterpenoid biosynthesis. Neither of these two genes could be verified to be responsible for the cap 2 phenotype by complementation analysis. However the mapping interval of cap 2 was reduced from more than 1 Mb to less than 100 kb. In a reverse genetic approach two candidate genes (AtHD 2 C and AtLDC) selected from a collection of promoter trap lines were analyzed to elucidate their role in seed development. Reporter gene expression studies, expression analysis, and the analysis of T-DNA insertion lines revealed that the candidate genes were expressed in the seed, but also in other organs. The promoter reporter line of AtLDC was found to have a similar but in some respects also different expression patterns in the seed than the original promoter trap line. The AtHD 2 C gene was found to be redundant as no phenotype could be observed in knock out alleles of the gene...|$|R
40|$|Les procédés membranaires hybrides (PMH) allient la {{filtration}} membranaire basse pression à l’usage du charbon actif en poudre (CAP). Afin de diminuer les coûts opérationnels du procédé, il a été proposé de laisser vieillir le CAP dans le PMH et donc de minimiser le dosage de CAP frais. Peu d’information est disponible quant à la capacité résiduelle d’adsorption de suspensions de CAP âgées. L’importance relative de l’adsorption et de la biodégradation dans les réacteurs à CAP âgés sur le traitement des composés dissous est inconnue, ce qui empêche notamment l’optimisation du procédé. Le principal objectif de ce projet de recherche est de décrire la performance du contacteur à CAP du PMH pour l’enlèvement de l’azote ammoniacal, du carbone organique dissous (COD), du COD biodégradable (CODB) et des micropolluants. Dans ce projet, l’emphase est placée sur l’opération du PMH avec de hauts temps de rétention de CAP. La première phase de ce projet a consisté en une série de développements méthodologiques, base nécessaire à l’étude du CAP âgé. Des méthodes permettant la quantification de la biomasse hétérotrophe et nitrifiante colonisant le CAP âgé ont mis en évidence des densités de biomasse similaires à celle du charbon actif en grain en surface de filtre biologiques. L’irradiation aux rayons gamma a été démontrée comme une méthode adéquate pour produire des témoins abiotiques à partir de <b>CAP</b> de 10 <b>et</b> de 60 jours. La seconde partie de cette étude s’est concentrée sur la démonstration de l’efficacité du PMH pour l’enlèvement de l’azote ammoniacal, du COD, ainsi que d’un mélange de micropolluants. Les cinétiques d’enlèvements ayant lieu au sein de des contacteurs à CAP ont été simulées en laboratoire sous diverses conditions (température, concentration en CAP, âge de CAP, matrice d’eau variable, temps de contact). Deux modèles cinétiques prédisant l’enlèvement de l’azote ammoniacal et du COD dans le PMH ont été développés sur base des simulations en laboratoire suivies sur <b>CAP</b> neuf, colonisé <b>et</b> abiotique. De manière générale, les travaux réalisés au cours de ce doctorat ont mis en évidence le rôle majeur de l’adsorption résiduelle sur l’enlèvement de la contamination dissoute. Alors que l’enlèvement d’azote ammoniacal a majoritairement eu lieu par nitrification, le COD et les micropollutants sont principalement adsorbés sur le CAP colonisé. Il a aussi été montré que la capacité d’adsorption résiduelle des suspensions de CAP âgées peut agir en tampon, {{permettant de}} faire face à une augmentation soudaine de la concentration en azote ammoniacal, en COD ou en micropolluants. Le suivi des cinétiques d’enlèvement a permis de démontrer que la concentration, l’âge de <b>CAP</b> <b>et</b> le temps de rétention hydraulique (TRH) sont trois paramètres clefs pour l’optimisation du procédé. D’un point de vue économique, un TRH inférieur à 15 min est néanmoins désiré pour limiter les coûts du procédé. Par ailleurs, l’intérêt économique associé à l’augmentation de l’âge du CAP peut-être atténué par le besoin d’augmenter la concentration en CAP si l’adsorption est le mécanisme visé. De façon générale, ce projet démontre qu’une optimisation à l’échelle pilote du procédé est nécessaire car les objectifs de traitement, la qualité de l’eau à traiter et le fait que les 3 paramètres d’opération soient inter-reliés complexifient l’optimisation du PMH. Étant donné l’impact du TRH sur le coût du PMH, de futures recherches devraient viser à l’optimisation du mélange. Hybrid membrane processes (HMPs) couple membrane filtration with powdered activated carbon (PAC). In HMPs, low-pressure membranes ensure an efficient particle removal, including protozoan parasites such as Cryptosporidium, while the PAC contactor {{is devoted to}} the removal of dissolved compounds. Such processes are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional treatment chains, which no longer allow the drinking water facilities to comply with increasingly stringent regulations on the treated water quality. To decrease the operating costs associated with virgin PAC consumption, it was suggested to let the PAC age in the PAC contactor of the process. Until now, the potential of using aged PAC in HMPs has been demonstrated for ammonia and DOC removal, but the potential to remove micropollutants remains unknown. It is suggested that the biological activity in aged PAC contactors contributes significantly to the removal of the dissolved compounds. Yet, neither the extent of the biomass on the aged PAC, nor the residual adsorption capacity, was quantified. No study focused on discriminating the mechanisms responsible for the treatment when using aged PAC suspensions. Most of the data published on HMPs using aged PAC were gathered at pilot scale under warm water conditions, yet the efficiency of the process is most likely sensitive to temperature changes. There is currently little information available on the efficiency of HMPs under cold water conditions. This lack of information hinders the optimization of the HMP, leading to sub-optimal usage of aged PAC. The main objective of this research project is to describe the performance of the PAC contactor of HMPs in removing ammonia, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), biodegradable DOC (BDOC) and micropollutants. In particular, emphasis was placed on the operation of the HMP under high PAC residence times. On a more detailed level, the objectives of this project were (1) to develop and compare methods to quantify the biomass developed on aged PAC, (2) to develop a method to produce an abiotic control for aged PAC, (3) to characterize the removal kinetics of ammonia, DOC, BDOC and micropollutants occurring in the carbon contactor of an HMP, (4) to evaluate the impact of water temperature on the performance of the carbon contactor of an HMP, (5) to discriminate the relative importance of adsorption versus biological oxidation as mechanisms responsible for ammonia, DOC and micropollutants removal in the PAC contactor of an HMP, and finally (6) to differentiate the relative importance of the hydraulic retention time (HRT), the PAC age and the PAC concentration as key operating parameters on the optimization of the performance of the PAC contactor of an HMP. To set the basis on the study of aged PACs, {{the first part of this}} research project consisted in methodological developments i) to quantify the heterotrophic and nitrifying biomass colonizing aged PAC, and ii) to create a reliable abiotic control of the colonized PAC, which is required for discriminating the mechanisms occurring on aged PAC. Heterotrophic and nitrifying biomass quantifying methods developed for colonized granular activated carbon (GAC) were successfully adapted to the aged PAC. The preferred methods were the potential 14 C-glucose respiration (PGR) rate and the potential nitrifying activity (PNA), as they quantify the active heterotrophic and nitrifying biomass, which is most likely responsible for the depletion of BDOC and ammonia. An alternative method to the PGR, the potential acetate uptake (PAU) rate, was developed to alleviate the logistical and budgetary issues associated with the utilization of radio-labeled glucose. The densities (per gram of dry PAC) of both active heterotrophic and nitrifying biomasses were found comparable to that of the GAC sampled from the surface of a biological GAC filter. The gamma-irradiation was demonstrated as a reliable method to produce abiotic samples from soils, and was therefore chosen to produce abiotic colonized PAC samples in this project. In order to determine the optimized dosage of gamma-rays, increased doses were applied on PAC samples. Heterotrophic plate counts and methylene blue adsorption kinetics were used to determine respectively the lowest gamma ray dose required to inhibit the bacterial activity, and the highest dose that could be applied without affecting the aged PAC adsorption capacity and kinetics. Refractory DOC (RDOC) adsorption kinetics confirmed the accuracy of the dose chosen as the adsorptive behavior of the aged PAC was not affected. PGR rates were decreased 83 % at the optimized dose. The gamma-irradiation method was therefore proven efficient and used in the following work phases of this research. The second part of this study focused on the removal of ammonia, DOC and a mixture of micropollutants. Firstly, the PAC contactor of an HMP was simulated at lab-scale to monitor ammonia removal kinetics. Three PAC concentrations (approximately 1 - 5 - 10 g/L) of three PAC ages (0 - 10 - 60 days) were tested at two temperatures (7 - 22 °C), in settled water with ambient influent condition (100 µg N–NH 4 /L) as well as under a simulated peak pollution scenario (1000 µg N–NH 4 /L). The kinetics evidenced that ammonia flux at pilot scale limited biomass growth (HRT = 67 min). In contrast, PAC colonization was not limited by the available surface and thus, PAC concentration was not a key operating parameter under the colonizing conditions tested (5 - 10 g/L). Ammonia adsorption was significant onto virgin PAC but the ammonia nitrification was crucial to reach complete ammonia removal at 22 °C. When using colonized PAC, the 60 -d PAC offered a better resilience to temperature decreases (78 % at 7 °C) as well as lower operating costs than the 10 -d PAC (DOC, BDOC and RDOC removals occurring in the PAC contactor of an HMP were also simulated at lab-scale. Similar conditions to that of the ammonia removal kinetics were tested. The initial ammonia concentration remained untouched in the water matrices (settled water and raw water) but the BDOC-to-DOC ratio was altered by pre-ozonation (0 to 1. 5 g O 3 /g C). The 10 -d and 60 -d abiotic controls were used to discriminate DOC adsorption from biodegradation. DOC biodegradation contributed marginally to DOC removal in the investigated conditions and DOC adsorption was increased at higher temperature. An original model integrating the PAC age distribution was developed to predict DOC removal in aged PAC contactors operated at steady-state. At a mean PAC residence time of 60 -d, the younger PAC fraction (25 -d and less) was primarily responsible for DOC adsorption (> 80 %). This fraction represents 34 % of the mass of PAC in the contactor. When using a water matrix with a higher initial DOC concentration (raw water) or a lower affinity for PAC (pre-ozonated settled water), the residual adsorption capacity of that older fraction was proven useful. Lastly, a mixture of micropollutants (atrazine, deethylatrazine (DEA), linuron, microcystin, caffeine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, progesterone and medroxyprogesterone) was spiked at environmentally relevant concentrations (from 130 ng/L to 33 µg/L) in settled water (0 and 0. 85 gO 3 /gC). The micropollutants concentration depletion was monitored over a period of 7 h to 48 h on 1 g/L of 0 -d, 10 -d, 60 -d PAC and gamma-irradiated 60 -d PAC. Even in presence of NOM, the spiked micropollutants were rapidly adsorbed on aged PAC. No biodegradation was observed. Removals superior to 95 % were reached within 5 minutes, and direct competition with NOM did not impact the efficiency of the process when micropollutants were spiked at environmentally relevant concentrations. Therefore, HMPs operated to remove DOC and ammonia can control transient micropollutant pollution and comply with the World health Organization recommendations for atrazine (2 µg/L) and microcystin (1 µg/L). However, the stricter European regulations for atrazine and DEA (0. 1 µg/L) could not be met with 10 -d and 60 -d PAC under the operating conditions tested. Reaching such strict treatment objective would require a specific optimization of the process. In general, this PhD research evidenced the role of the residual adsorption of aged PAC suspensions for the treatment of dissolved compounds. From the results obtained in this project, the potential of HMPs using aged PAC to remove micropollutants was evidenced. Additional research is however required to validate this potential under varied operating conditions. The modeling work improved the understanding of aged PACs. Finally, this research work provides original information on the optimization of HMPs. The optimization of the operating parameters will vary with the water quality targeted and the quality of the influent water. The PAC concentration, PAC age and HRT are inter-related. Therefore, it is recommended to optimize the operation of HMPs at pilot scale. Seasonal variations should be accounted for. An HRT of at least 15 min is required when the biological activity is mandatory to reach the water quality objectives. Lower HRT might be applied if adsorption is favored. Finally, as the HRT has a strong impact on the total cost of the process (capital and operational expenditure), PAC contactors’ hydraulic should be the point of focus of future research. &Doctorat en Sciences agronomiques et ingénierie biologiqueinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
