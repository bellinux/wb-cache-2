40|$|With the Westernization {{and opening}} of our society, adolescents' smoking is {{increasing}} and being popularized. Many adolescents start smoking {{at an early}} age out of curiosity and venturesomeness, and earlier start of smoking makes it more difficult to quit smoking. Adolescents' habitual smoking not only becomes a gateway to all kinds of substance abuse but also causes various health problems including upper respiratory infection, immature lung development, reduced maximum vital capacity, and lung cancer. Therefore, it is quite important to prevent adolescents from smoking. The lowering of adolescents' smoking rate cannot be achieved only through social restrictions such as stereotyped education on the harms of smoking and ID checking. In order to lower adolescents' smoking rate substantially, each area of society should develop standardized programs and make related efforts. As adolescents' smoking is highly influenced by <b>home</b> environment <b>or</b> <b>school</b> <b>life,</b> it is necessary to make efforts in effective education and social reinforcement in school, to establish related norms, and to execute preventive education using peer groups. When these efforts are spread throughout society in cooperation with homes and communities, they will be helpful to protect adolescents' health and improve their quality of life...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{previous}} research found a positive association between sensitivity to reward (SR) and adolescents' unhealthy snacking and drinking behavior, mechanisms explaining these associations {{remain to be}} explored. The present study will therefore examine whether the associations between SR and unhealthy snack and/or sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake are mediated by external and/or emotional eating and if this mediation is moderated by availability at <b>home</b> <b>or</b> at <b>school.</b> Methods: Cross-sectional data on snacking, availability of snacks {{at home and at}} school, SR (BAS drive scale) and external and emotional eating (Dutch eating behavior questionnaire) of Flemish adolescents (n = 1104, mean age = 14. 7 +/- 0. 8 years; 51 % boys; 18. 0 % overweight) in 20 schools spread across Flanders were collected. Moderated mediation analyses were conducted using generalized structural equation modeling in three steps: (1) direct association between SR and unhealthy snack or SSB intake, (2) mediation of either external or emotional eating and (3) interaction of <b>home</b> <b>or</b> <b>school</b> availability and emotional or external eating. Results: Partial mediation of external eating (a*b = 0. 69, p < 0. 05) and of emotional eating (a*b = 0. 92, p < 0. 01) in the relation between SR and intake of unhealthy snacks was found (step 2). The relation between SR and SSB intake was not mediated by external or emotional eating (step 2). No moderation effects of <b>home</b> <b>or</b> <b>school</b> availability were found (step 3). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the association between SR and the consumption of unhealthy snacks is partially explained by external and emotional eating in a population-based sample of adolescents irrespective of the <b>home</b> <b>or</b> <b>school</b> availability of these foods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the difference in quality of primary care provided by physicians between the types of medical institutions in Japan, we examined whether the physicians' comprehensive knowledge of their patients is perceived differently by the patients seen at clinics and hospitals. Methods Patients with prescriptions for hypertensive drugs were approached sequentially at 13 pharmacies, and were administered a questionnaire on their perception of their physician's knowledge about them. Data were obtained for 687 patients (362 from clinics and 325 from hospitals). A physician's knowledge {{of his or her}} patients was assessed according to six aspects: their medical history, their current medications, history of allergy, what worries patients most about their health, patients' values and beliefs on their health, and patients' roles and responsibilities at work, <b>home,</b> <b>or</b> <b>school.</b> Responses were scored from 1 through 6 (1 : knows very well; 6 : doesn't know at all). Results Patients treated in clinics were seen more frequently, for a longer period, and had fewer complications than the patients who were treated in hospitals. Among the six aspects of physicians' knowledge assessed, 79. 3 % of the patients reported that their physicians knew their complete list of medications "very well or well," while 28. 3 % reported the same about their roles and responsibilities at work, <b>home,</b> <b>or</b> <b>school.</b> Physicians in clinics were considered to know their patients' worries about their health (p = 0. 004) and the roles and responsibilities of the patients at work, <b>home,</b> <b>or</b> <b>school</b> (p = 0. 028) well. Multiple regression analysis showed that the type of medical institutions remained as a significant variable only for the aspect of patients' worries about their health. The factor that consistently affected the patients' perception of physicians' knowledge about them was the patients' age. Conclusions Hypertensive patients' perceptions of their physicians' knowledge about them did not differ significantly between clinics and hospitals in Japan for most of the aspects. In order to differentiate the roles of physicians in hospitals and clinics better and ensure the quality of primary care, the establishment of a standardized educational system to train primary care physicians better is recommended. </p...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the initial}} {{development}} of PMT, a {{second wave of}} research from 1975 to 1985 focused on the longer-term effects and generalization of treatment to settings other than the clinic (such as <b>home</b> <b>or</b> <b>school),</b> larger family effects (such as improved parenting with siblings), and behavioral improvements outside of the targeted areas (such as improved ability to make friends). Since 1985, the literature on PMT has continued to expand, with researchers exploring such topics as application of the treatment to serious clinical problems, dealing with client resistance to treatment, prevention programs, and implementation with diverse populations.|$|R
