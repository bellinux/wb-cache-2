25|$|Reading's {{next game}} {{was at home}} to Aston Villa. Shorey scored Reading's first goal in five matches in the 90th minute for the Royals, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> late—Villa had scored two goals earlier on in the match through Ashley Young and Marlon Harewood, condemning Reading to 2–1 defeat.|$|E
25|$|A {{crowd of}} a couple of hundred saw Bangladesh's opening batsman Javed Omar hit three {{boundaries}} in the opening overs, but he was run out by Russel Arnold, and from then on, Bangladesh lost wickets regularly. No partnership passed 30 until that of the very last wicket, by which time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> late. Dilhara Fernando started the procession, deceiving Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful to send them back for single-figure scores, and joint top-scorer Shahriar Nafees was fourth to fall, giving a return catch to Dilshan. Following Nafees' dismissal, Bangladesh quickly crashed to 103 for 8, with fast bowler Farveez Maharoof taking three wickets. Eventually, Bangladesh needed 143 for the last wicket off 98 deliveries, and Khaled Mashud and Tapash Baisya opted to block out the overs instead - while the Sri Lankan captain gave the ball to his spinners to get the match over with quickly, the three seamers Chaminda Vaas, Fernando and Maharoof only bowling 20 of a possible 30 overs.|$|E
25|$|England, however, {{continued}} to paste the bowlers, although skipper Michael Vaughan was lucky {{on more than}} one occasion – the most notable when he was dropped by Mohammad Rafique off Rafique's own bowling. By stumps, however, the pair had added 40, and they continued on a sunny second day – less rusty, however, than they had been on the first day. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> embarrassing for Bangladesh, as Vaughan raced to 120 before being caught behind off Mashrafe. Four overs later, the patient Rafique finally got his reward, Khaled Mashud coming up with a magnificent catch to get Trescothick out six short of a double century. That was as good as it got for Bangladesh, though, as Ian Bell, Warwickshire's prodigy, made 65 not out, and Graham Thorpe ran runs everywhere to score 42 not out with only two boundaries, before Vaughan decided that enough was enough and declared with seven wickets in hand and a lead of 420 runs.|$|E

25|$|The chase of 106 - again {{cut down}} due to rain - {{was led by}} Avishka Gunawardene, who saw off the opening bowlers with {{relative}} ease, taking Rasel for runs while defending more against the experienced Baisya - who dug out two wickets, those of Tharanga and pinch-hitter Lokuhettige. However, {{he did not get}} any further wickets, and Bangladesh were put to the sword by Gunawardene before Rafique and Mahmud calmed him down as he neared fifty. After four overs without boundaries, Gunawardene brought up his fifty with one edged through third man, before pulling a short ball straight to Tushar Imran who held the catch comfortably. Yet, Sri Lanka still needed 22 runs for the victory, with seven wickets in hand and one of their most experienced batsmen in Kumar Sangakkara at the crease. In the 21st over, Sangakkara levelled the scores with two big leg side shots that went for four, before calling a risky single that had Thilan Samaraweera run out for 18. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> late, as Sangakkara wrapped it up by hitting a single to midwicket.|$|E
2500|$|Manuel and Danko {{laid down}} the basic track in Woodstock in 1967, {{according}} to Griffin, and {{the contributions of the}} rest of the Band were overdubbed eight years later. Critic Dave Hopkins notes that the demo version included as a bonus track on the 2000 Music from Big Pink reissue is the same performance, without overdubbing. Griffin calls the song [...] "charming in its own right", but says it would not have fit in on the original Music from Big Pink because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> obviously from their past: [...] "an up-tempo bluesy number that the Hawks might have played" [...] in rural Ontario in 1964. Barney Hoskyns describes the song as one of the Band's early recordings that revealed [...] "the breathtaking scope" [...] of their musical range; he praises [...] "the rollicking bar-room R style" [...] of the performance.|$|E
2500|$|In {{making the}} above estimate, Petty {{introduced}} {{in the first two}} chapters of Verbum Sapienti the first rigorous assessments of national income and wealth. To him, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> obvious that a country's wealth lay in more than just gold and silver. He worked off an estimation that the average personal income was £6 13s 4d per annum, with a population of six million, meaning that national income would be £40m. [...] Petty's theory produced estimates, some more reliable than others, for the various components of national income, including land, ships, personal estates and housing. He then distinguished between the stocks (£250m) and the flows yielding from them (£15m). The discrepancy between these flows and his estimate for national income (£40m) leads Petty to postulate that the other £25m is the yield from what must be £417m of labour stock, the value of the people. [...] This gave a total wealth for England in the 1660s of £667m.|$|E

2500|$|The {{war started}} in March, 1672. An English fleet {{attacked}} the Dutch Smyrna convoy in the Channel, {{as in the}} previous two conflicts without a declaration of war. That was to follow only after France had declared war on April 6. The French army was the largest in Europe at the time. Louis assembled 118,000 infantry and 12,500 cavalry against a regular Dutch army that numbered at most 30,000. That Dutch army, long neglected by the De-Witt regime, was also qualitatively inferior. The regents belatedly tried to reinforce it with contingents of the citizen militias, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> little, too late. The Dutch enclaves in present-day Germany, Cleves and Lingen, were quickly overrun by the Elector of Cologne, the Munsterites, and the French, a long list of venerable fortresses being taken almost without a shot fired. Then the French stormed across the Rhine at Lobith on June 12, outflanking the main Dutch eastern line of defense at the IJssel. The Dutch now hastily retreated to the Hollandse Waterlinie, thereby abandoning all but the provinces of Holland, Zeeland, and Utrecht to the enemy. The French followed at their leisure, experiencing little resistance, as the citizens of first Arnhem, and then Utrecht [...] rioted, and forced their city governments to capitulate without a fight.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{works that}} Warhol {{submitted}} to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay. In Popism, furthermore, the artist recalls {{a conversation with the}} film maker Emile de Antonio about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but closeted) gay artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. De Antonio explained that Warhol was [...] "too swish and that upsets them." [...] In response to this, Warhol writes, [...] "There was nothing I could say to that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change... Other people could change their attitudes but not me". In exploring Warhol's biography, many turn to this period—the late 1950s and early 1960s—as a key moment in the development of his persona. Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like [...] "Um, no" [...] and [...] "Um, yes", and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.|$|E
