5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} short growing season for sugar producing crops, ethanol is not commercially produced as a fuel in Scotland at present. There are encouraging developments in cellulosic decomposition that might enable <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> tree crops {{to be used to}} this end in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than other production techniques.|$|E
5|$|The Delichon martins were {{originally}} cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff. However, the house martin now largely uses human structures, as, {{to a lesser}} extent, does the Asian house martin. The typical nest is a <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> feather-lined deep closed mud bowl with a small opening at the top, but many Asian house martins leave {{the top of the}} nest open.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} a {{depression}} in the ground, {{which may or may}} not be lined with bits of <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> similar materials. The eggs are mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and fledge after 21–24 days. If the parents are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.|$|E

5|$|This munia eats mainly {{grass seeds}} apart from berries and small insects. They forage in flocks and {{communicate}} with soft calls and whistles. The species is highly social and may sometimes roost with other species of munias. This species is found in tropical plains and grasslands. Breeding pairs construct dome-shaped nests using <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> bamboo leaves.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with <b>grass,</b> <b>or</b> shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
5|$|Solitary {{places are}} the best venues for yoga. A matha (hut) in a forest is ideal, but any private place that is free from distractions, high winds or intense {{sunshine}} is a good location for yoga. Either a pad made of kusha <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> a solid ground with deer skin mat on it, is desirable. Yoga can be learned, {{with the help of}} a teacher, within three to four months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over a period of three to four years.|$|E

5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly {{during the day}} and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet {{consists}} of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), fruits, and berries. It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> other soft materials. It {{is one of the first}} birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.|$|E
5|$|These ants live in nests {{in sandy}} soil which {{sometimes}} have a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves. Depending {{on the type}} of habitat in which the colony is located, they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and twigs. Nests are beside a clump of <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> bush or {{at the base of a}} tree.|$|E

5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} pictured with four arms in South Indian iconography. The front right arm is {{stretched}} out downwards {{and the hand}} holds a bit of <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> another plant in the kataka gesture, {{near the mouth of}} his pet deer or antelope, who leaps playfully by his side. The back right arm is raised and holds a damaru (drum). The front left hand holds a kapala (skull-cup), used as a begging bowl. The back left hand holds a trishula decorated with peacock feathers. The left leg is firmly rooted in the ground while the right one is slightly bent, suggesting walking. He often wears paduka (wooden sandals) but sometimes may be barefoot. The sandals are unique and identifying feature of Bhikshatana's iconography and distinguish him from other forms of Shiva and all other deities, who are always depicted barefoot. Sometimes Bhikshatana's iconography is amalgamated with that of Bhairava, in which case he displays Bhairava's attributes in addition to his own.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species have}} {{distinctive}} loud grating calls used for advertising and territorial purposes in the breeding season, although the corn crake is silent on its African wintering grounds. They are mainly active during the day; they walk with a high-stepping action, and when disturbed {{they can run}} swiftly through <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> fly a short distance to cover. Migration takes place at night, {{and the ability to}} undertake these journeys is innate, not learned from adults. The nest is a shallow cup of grass lined with finer vegetation and built in a well hidden depression. The precocial chicks leave the nest soon after hatching, and fledge after four to six weeks. These are ground-feeding omnivores, but mainly eat invertebrates. They may be killed by a variety of mammals and large birds, and infected by parasites.|$|E
5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii fruits singly or {{in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> among leaf litter. It is {{typically}} found in eucalypt forest and subtropical rainforests. It has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. In southwest Australia it is found in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forests, where fruiting usually occurs in late autumn and early winter. The fungus appears to prefer disturbed ground, as it is often found at roadsides by forests, on lawns, grassy areas of parks, and among the slash of thinned karri regrowth forests. It is common in river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) woodlands. M.clelandii also occurs in New Zealand, where it is found in mixed mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kānuka (Kunzea ericoides), and kauri (Agathis) forest, and in conifer plantations. It is the smallest and most slender of the Macrolepiota species that occur there.|$|E

5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form. These {{are more common}} south of the Sahara, where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded. Crag martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest for a third time in a season.|$|E
5|$|Nest size {{depends on}} species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been {{documented}} as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight {{that could result in}} overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 2010, an A-10 {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} of an aircraft with all engines powered by a biofuel blend. The flight, performed at Eglin Air Force Base, used a 1:1 blend of JP-8 and Camelina-based fuel. On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a new fuel blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based that can be derived using wood, paper, <b>grass,</b> <b>or</b> any cellulose based material, and are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel. ATJ is the third alternative fuel to be evaluated by the Air Force {{as a replacement for}} petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel. Previous types were a synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from coal and natural gas and a bio-mass fuel derived from plant-oils and animal fats known as Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet.|$|E

25|$|Burn piles can {{and have}} spread {{uncontrolled}} fires, {{for example if}} wind blows burning material off the pile into surrounding combustible <b>grasses</b> <b>or</b> onto buildings. As interior structures of the pile are consumed, the pile can shift and collapse, spreading the burn area. Even {{in a situation of}} no wind, small lightweight ignited embers can lift off the pile via convection, and waft through the air into <b>grasses</b> <b>or</b> onto buildings, igniting them. Burn piles often do not result in full combustion of waste and therefore produce particulate pollution.|$|R
50|$|The red-winged {{blackbird}} nests in loose colonies. The nest is built in cattails, rushes, <b>grasses,</b> sedge, <b>or</b> in alder or willow bushes. The nest is constructed entirely by the female {{over the course}} of three to six days. It is a basket of grasses, sedge, and mosses, lined with mud, and bound to surrounding <b>grasses</b> <b>or</b> branches. It is located 7.6 cm to 4.3 m above water.|$|R
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail is a {{seasonal}} breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. The nests are {{situated at the}} base of ferns with tussock grass, tussock grass clumps, or in tufts of sedges. The nests are domed and oval or pear shaped, with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. The nests are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, tussock <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> sedges. Where the construction material is tussock grass, larger leaves are used on the outside and finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced Malus domestica (apple) or Salix babylonica (willow).|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} detection of sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as <b>grass</b> <b>or</b> twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E
50|$|Features {{distinguishing}} {{members of}} the sedge family from <b>grasses</b> <b>or</b> rushes are stems with triangular cross-sections (with occasional exceptions) and leaves that are spirally arranged in three ranks (grasses have alternate leaves forming two ranks).|$|R
