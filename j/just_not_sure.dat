500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if it works. It's such a drastic change of scenery and tone it's {{hard to say}} whether this is genius or madness." [...] Isler observed {{that he would have}} [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup... But the approach we got feels an awful lot like a gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point." [...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E
500|$|The AFL's {{experiment}} was largely derided by AFL personalities throughout Hunt's early Australian rules career. [...] Wayne Carey is quoted {{to have said}} that [...] "I just think he's really going to struggle. I'm <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> a rugby player - {{as good as he}} is - can do it." [...] Tony Shaw was quoted in 2011 to have said [...] "he just cannot play the game naturally and it won't work. Just say to him, 'Take your money, you've been fantastic for us', maybe see the year out, but I wouldn't be playing him very often any more." [...] Paul Roos is quoted to have said that [...] "a player of Karmichael Hunt's current ability would probably be worth only $100,000 in the AFL". [...] Jason Akermanis is quoted to have said in reference to both Hunt and Israel Folau – who converted from rugby league to Australian rules football the year after Hunt – that [...] "if they can't run and they can't handball - and we're only talking basics like kick, run, chase, handball and get body-to-body collisions - and can't get up to speed its going to be such {{a waste of time and}} money." ...|$|E

In 1980, after her year at college, Enya decided not to study music at university and instead accepted Ryan's invitation to join the group {{with the aim of}} expanding their sound by incorporating keyboards and another backup vocalist. She toured across Europe and played an uncredited role on their sixth album, Crann Úll (1980), with a line-up of siblings Máire, Pól and Ciarán Brennan and twin uncles, Noel and Pádraig Duggan. Enya became an official and credited member by the time of their next album Fuaim (1981), which features a front cover photograph of her with the band. Nicky maintains it was never his intention to make Enya a permanent member, and realised she was [...] "fiercely independent ... intent on playing her own music.

Gutbrod: I think it would {{be fair to say that}} when I came here in 1999, there was trouble in every single way. Georgia and its people were running up against massive and huge {{challenges}}. Now, one of the things that have changed, clearly, is that they have narrowed the challenges down. Of course, the country is still facing important, critical challenges, such as, in the view of its own citizens according to our surveys, challenges like territorial integrity, unemployment, poverty, and that even when people have jobs, they are not getting paid very well, and healthcare. But where they face these large challenges, now they have moved into a field of political feasibility. Many of those things can now be addressed. There is a “state,” and in 1999 we <b>just</b> were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether Georgia constituted a state at all. And I do not think that is something people doubt now. So, huge progress, and, of course, many challenges remain, including that of completing democratization...|$|R

[...] Anupama Chopra of NDTV gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, and stated, [...] "Vijaykar and his actors are straining too hard to make you laugh at jokes that are simply too flimsy for film. It’s exhausting more than entertaining. See it if you must." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times Of India gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, and said, [...] "Neither fruity nor nutty, this film ends up as a total squish. After an unfruitful watch, you feel completely let down." [...] Kaveri Bamzai of India Today Group gave the film 1 star out of 5, and said, [...] "Unfortunately, the writers seem to have exhausted themselves thinking of the funny names and the interesting premise. There is nothing beyond it, except for two senseless item songs, one each for Irani and Mirza to stretch their legs." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, and stated, [...] "Despite juvenile jokes like peeing on open electric wires, Fruit & Nut is mercifully not the sort of vulgar comedy we’ve got used to seeing at the cinemas these days." ...|$|R

One Louis Walsh, who, ever determined to showcase some homegrown talent, has paired up with Westlife's Kian Egan to form five-piece girl group Wonderland.

[...] - we'd hazard a guess that their balls are twice as mighty as Louis's and Westlife's. Now there's a mental image we didn't need." [...] While Leeds' City Dweller Magazine described it [...] "as an uptempo song, a women-empowered song about not wanting to settle down." [...] Popledge ranked it [...] adding: [...] "Their first song is a kinda Corrs/Taylor Swift affair, pop with a slight country twang to it…but it’s actually ‘Not a Love Song’ it paints them as kinda bad-ass girls, ‘if you wanna write a love song I don’t wanna hear it..’ The song is ok and the ladies can all sing but it’s <b>just</b> ok…I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> {{if it was the}} best song to launch them with, {{it will be interesting to}} hear their next choice of single." ...|$|R
