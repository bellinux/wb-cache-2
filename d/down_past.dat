5|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} {{are found in}} warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide. In the western Atlantic Ocean it is found off the eastern coast of United States of America, the Gulf Stream, the Caribbean, and <b>down</b> <b>past</b> {{the southern part of}} Brazil. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from the Red Sea down to South Africa and eastward to the Andaman Sea. In the Western Pacific Ocean it can be found near Japan and north of Australia. In the Central Pacific Ocean, it can be found throughout the Hawaiian Islands. In the Eastern-Pacific Ocean, it is found in the Gulf of California down through Puerto Pizarro, an area that includes the Galapagos Islands. Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen in bays and reefs. They spend much of their time swimming freely in open waters, generally in schools close to the surface, and can travel long distances in a day.|$|E
5|$|Stamford Wharf was {{the upper}} limit of navigation, and was {{situated}} below Town Bridge, which carries the A43 road over the river at Stamford. There were buildings associated with the canal {{on both sides of}} the river, including a large warehouse next to the bridge, parts of which date from 1671, and which is Grade II listed. Barges followed the river <b>down</b> <b>past</b> the ruins of St Leonard's Priory, established in 1090 by the Benedictines, to Hudds Mill, where the cut began, on the north side of the mill. Hudds Mill Lock was almost at the start of the cut. The canal flowed initially to the east, but turned to the north east to cross the River Gwash at right angles. It then entered Uffington Park, where the remains of the weir that regulated river levels at the crossing can still be seen. The Gwash now has much less flow than it did when the canal was active, since the construction of the reservoir at Rutland Water further upstream. The earthworks of the canal continue through the park.|$|E

25|$|The most {{immediately}} noticeable {{feature is}} a white cassock and zucchetto (skull cap). Only the Pope is permitted to wear a cassock made out of watered silk. The cassock {{used to have a}} train on it, but Pope Pius XII discontinued this custom. For convenience, the train could be folded up and fastened {{to the back of the}} cassock. He used to wear a tufted fascia (white sash-like belt fastened about the waist, the ends of which fall <b>down</b> <b>past</b> the knees and are often embroidered with the Pope's coat of arms), until Paul VI replaced it with a simpler fringed sash. Previously, the tufted fascia (terminating in gold tassels) was worn with choir dress, and the fringed fascia (terminating in a simpler gold fringe) was worn with ordinary dress.|$|E

25|$|The {{office of}} the Elected President of Singapore {{represents}} an indigenisation of the Westminster system of government and is cast as a check against the powers enjoyed by the parliamentary executive, adding to the overall scheme {{of checks and balances}} in the doctrine of separation of powers. Nonetheless, the institution has a limited range of functions and is essentially reactive in nature, such that it cannot be seen to be an alternative locus of political power. The President has power to block attempts by the Government to draw <b>down</b> <b>past</b> reserves it did not accumulate, to approve changes to key appointments, and to exercise oversight over the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and decisions of the executive under the ISA and the MRHA. The aim is not to enable the President to target unlawful executive actions, but lawful actions against national interests.|$|E
25|$|Farragut {{ordered the}} Mortar Flotilla to Ship Island May 1, and Harriet Lane {{continued}} to Pensacola, Florida, where she transported Brigadier General Lewis G. Arnold's troops from Fort Pickens {{to the other}} side of the bay, where they occupied Forts Barrancas and McRee, Barancas Barracks, and the Navy Yard which had been abandoned by the Confederates. Back at Ship Island for repairs May 30, Harriet Lane prepared to ascend the Mississippi with Porter's mortar boats to engage enemy batteries on the cliffs of Vicksburg, Mississippi, while Farragut ran past this river stronghold to join Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis in an effort to clear the entire Mississippi Valley of obstructions to Union shipping. However, sufficient ground forces to take Vicksburg were not made available, nullifying the value of his operation, and after a frustrating encounter with the new Confederate ironclad ram Arkansas, Farragut ran back <b>down</b> <b>past</b> Vicksburg while Harriet Lane and her sister vessels in the Mortar Flotilla again covered the dash by bombarding the Confederate batteries 15 July.|$|E
25|$|In 1991 the Constitution of Singapore was {{amended to}} {{transform}} the office of President, which was previously indirectly elected by Parliament, into an office directly elected by the people. The amendment conferred on the President certain executive functions to block attempts {{by the government of}} the day to draw <b>down</b> <b>past</b> reserves that it did not accumulate. Thus, a guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, and his approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The President also possesses personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the Central Provident Fund Board to invest moneys belonging to it; and the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office. In addition, the President may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.|$|E

The next 6miles (10km) of cliff top paths from Bolberry <b>Down</b> <b>past</b> Bolt Head and the tidal ria of Kingsbridge Estuary to Prawle Point, belong to the National Trust. The estuary is crossed using the Salcombe Ferry, from Salcombe to East Portlemouth, close to Salcombe Castle and within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

Typically the vaulter will begin to angle their body toward the bar as the turn is executed, although ideally the vaulter will remain as vertical as possible. A more accurate description of this phase of the vault may be [...] "the spin" [...] because the vaulter spins around an imaginary axis from head to toe.|$|E

2500|$|The Government {{took the}} view that the {{safeguards}} could be achieved by providing the direct election of the President, thus making the President directly accountable to the people, and enabling him to serve as a check against the Government by increasing his discretionary powers. [...] The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1991 granted the President certain executive functions to block attempts by the government of the day to draw <b>down</b> <b>past</b> reserves that it had not accumulated, and to approve changes to key civil service positions.

[...] The archaeological record shows that Arabian Bifacial/Ubaid period came to an abrupt end in eastern Arabia and the Oman peninsula at 3800 BC, just after the phase of lake lowering and onset of dune reactivation. [...] At this time, increased aridity led to an end in semi-desert nomadism, and {{there is no evidence of}} human presence in the area for approximately 1,000 years, the so-called [...] "Dark Millennium".

2500|$|A {{special feature}} of {{competitive}} breaststroke is the underwater pullout. From the streamline position, one uses the arms to pull {{all the way}} <b>down</b> <b>past</b> the hips. As the arms are pulling down, one downward dolphin kick is allowed (as of the 2005 season), though still optional; more than one dolphin kick will result in disqualification. This {{is followed by the}} recovery of the arms to the streamline position once more with a breaststroke kick. The pullout is also called the [...] "pull down". The pullout at the start and after the turns contributes significantly to the swimming times. Open turns can be easily performed at the walls, but both hands must make contact with the wall. Therefore, one way to improve swimming times is to focus on the start and the turns.|$|E

[...] He twice left New Haven racing to beat the express train to Meriden, Connecticut. [...] On the second occasion, the mayor of Meriden saw Shevlin [...] "whirling riotously into town" [...] and set the police after him. [...] A Meriden police officer was tasked with finding Shevlin and followed his trail for two days. [...] The pursuit was unsuccessful, but Shevlin turned himself in after hearing that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. [...] Shevlin paid a $40 fine and returned to New Haven.

2500|$|While the {{fuselage}} was of conventional construction it was unusually deep, almost filling {{the gap between}} the planes, in the manner of the LFG Roland C.II. The portly dimensions of {{the fuselage}} made for a fairly clean engine installation â€“ but the radiators were rather clumsily attached to the fuselage sides, in a position that must have interfered with the pilot's view forward and <b>down</b> <b>past</b> the nose. Apparently either could be bypassed to limit loss of coolant in the event of battle damage. An advanced feature was that the controls were operated by rods mounted within the airframe rather than cables carried externally, as was more usual at the time. The very small gap between the top wing and the fuselage gave the pilot excellent visibility above, but probably precluded the fitting of a standard (S.E.5 type) Foster mounting for the upper Lewis gun; existing photographic evidence points to a fixed gun pointing up at a slight angle to clear the propeller arc. This would not have been conducive to Ball's favourite attack from behind and below, as is often stated (see illustrations), although, if the type had gone into production it is possible that a variant of the [...] "Nieuport type" [...] Foster mounting would have been devised, to allow the Lewis to be fired at various upward angles, including the steep one favoured by Ball, as well as at a flat angle directly forwards.|$|E
