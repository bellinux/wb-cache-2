5|$|A {{minute later}} Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard was shown a yellow card for a foul on García. The {{resulting}} free-kick found Steven Gerrard, but {{he fell to}} the ground after a challenge from Claude Makélélé. The referee Steve Bennett ignored Liverpool claims for a penalty and Chelsea went straight on the attack, but an effort by Drogba went wide of the Liverpool goal. Chelsea continued to attack in an effort to score an equalising goal, but attempts by Duff and Joe Cole failed to find the target. Liverpool defender Djimi Traoré was the third player to be shown a yellow card for a foul on Ferreira in the 35th minute. However, minutes later he made an important tackle as Duff beat the Liverpool offside trap, but a poor touch outside of the Liverpool penalty area allowed Traoré to <b>dispossess</b> him. As half-time approached Liverpool were content to remain in their own half and allow Chelsea to attack them, but any attack was dealt with by the Liverpool defence.|$|E
5|$|Political {{power was}} {{concentrated}} in the Ayyubid household which was not necessarily characterized only by blood relation; slaves and intimates could acquire great, and even supreme power within it. It was a common occurrence for the mothers of young Ayyubid rulers to act as independent powers or in a few cases, rulers in their own right. Eunuchs exercised substantial power under the Ayyubids, serving as attendants and atabegs within the household or as emirs, governors, and army commanders outside the household. One of Saladin's most important supporters was the eunuch Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad who helped him depose the Fatimids, <b>dispossess</b> their properties, and construct the wall of Cairo's citadel. Following the death of al-Aziz Uthman, he became the regent of his son al-Mansur and effectively ruled over Egypt {{for a short time}} before the arrival of al-Adil. Later sultans appointed eunuchs as deputy sultans and even awarded them sovereignty over certain cities, such as Shams al-Din Sawab who was given the Jaziran cities of Amid and Diyar Bakr in 1239.|$|E

5|$|At a {{professional}} level, most matches produce {{only a few}} goals. For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, {{but a number of}} specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who <b>dispossess</b> the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.|$|E

They did the contrary: Sweden continued actively to support the Birkebeiners and John of England sent mercenaries to help Sverre.

40|$|Abstract In {{this article}} I {{describe}} and analyse {{the conditions of}} youth in post-Soviet Kazakhstan, their attitudes to work and their economic practices. The article argues that the post-Soviet changes, most importantly neo-liberal reforms and rise of consumerism, have transformed the conditions of youth, their atti-tudes to work and their patterns of work. First, the neo-liberal reforms and {{the abolition of the}} welfare state have <b>dispossessed</b> the majority of youth from the access to welfare, education and work of the Soviet era. This has created a huge social cleavage among already stratified youth. While {{the sons and daughters of}} the elite, immersed in conspicuous consumption, have monopolized places in universities and good jobs, the <b>dispossessed</b> youth live in dire poverty. Poverty, insecure family backgrounds, lack of good formal education and lack of neces-sary contacts marginalize <b>dispossessed</b> youth in the labour market. The economic niche available to them consists of menial jobs in the informal sector. In spite of their poverty, the <b>dispossessed</b> youth have a consumerist mentality. This has created a tension between youth and parents among the <b>dispossessed...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{answer to}} this {{proposal}} was soon forthcoming. The executors of the estate secured writs of ejectment in suits against tenants in arrears. Crowds of angry tenants manhandled Sheriff Michael Archer and his assistants and turned back a posse of 500 men. Sheriff Archer called upon Governor William H. Seward for military assistance. Seward's proclamation calling on the people not to resist {{the enforcement of the}} law and the presence of several hundred militiamen overawed the tenants. The tenants persisted in their refusal to pay rent. Of course the sheriff could and did evict a few, but he could not <b>dispossess</b> an entire township.|$|E

25|$|Accelerating immigration, both Mexican and foreign, {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} Alta California government to seize the mission properties and <b>dispossess</b> the natives in accordance with Echeandía's directive. Despite the fact that Echeandía's emancipation plan was met with little encouragement from the novices who populated the southern missions, he was nonetheless determined to test the scheme {{on a large scale}} at Mission San Juan Capistrano. To that end, he appointed a number of comisionados (commissioners) to oversee the emancipation of the Indians. The Mexican government passed legislation on December 20, 1827 that mandated the expulsion of all Spaniards younger than sixty years of age from Mexican territories; Governor Echeandía nevertheless intervened on behalf of some of the missionaries to prevent their deportation once the law took effect in California.|$|E
25|$|As a youngster, Cannavaro {{played for}} a team from Bagnoli before being quickly spotted by the scouts of Napoli, his {{hometown}} and favourite childhood team. Cannavaro initially served as the club's ball boy and would often watch his idols Diego Maradona and Ciro Ferrara play. He later joined the club's youth team, initially playing as a midfielder like his idol Marco Tardelli, before the team's youth coach switched him {{to the role of}} centre-back. He gained a reputation when, in a training session at Napoli, the young Fabio produced a strong sliding challenge on Maradona, who was then the undisputed star of the club, to <b>dispossess</b> him. The rough challenge angered teammates and staff at Napoli. However, Maradona himself defended the promising player and encouraged him to play the way he wanted, and reportedly congratulated by Cannavaro by giving him his boots as a souvenir after the training session.|$|E
500|$|The {{object of}} the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a {{lacrosse}} stick or crosse, to catch, carry, and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling the ball into an opponent's goal. The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball. In addition to the lacrosse stick, players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to <b>dispossess</b> them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact. [...] The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field and require the ball to be moved continuously towards the opposing goal. It is sometimes referred to as the [...] "fastest sport on two feet".|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, {{opposition}} to Kantakouzenos began to coalesce around three figures: the Patriarch, a forceful man {{determined to have}} a voice in the governance of the Empire, the Empress-regent, who feared that Kantakouzenos would <b>dispossess</b> her son, and last but not least Alexios Apokaukos, the ambitious megas doux (commander-in-chief of the navy) and head of the bureaucracy. A [...] "new man" [...] promoted to high office as the protégé of Andronikos III and possibly the richest man in the Empire by 1341, Apokaukos was distrusted by the hereditary aristocracy. The only surviving narrative accounts of the period, Kantakouzenos's memoirs and the history of Nikephoros Gregoras, with their pro-aristocracy bias, paint a very negative picture of the man. According to Kantakouzenos, Apokaukos' adherence to the Patriarch's camp resulted from his ambition: Apokaukos sought further advancement by trying to convince Kantakouzenos to declare himself Emperor. When the latter refused, Apokaukos secretly switched his allegiance.|$|E
500|$|Described as [...] "one of {{the most}} talented footballers of his generation", Enda Muldoon has played in {{virtually}} all positions in the forward line, as well as midfield for both his club and county. He is regarded as the complete footballer in that he has impressive high-fielding skills, is hard to <b>dispossess,</b> is very accurate in front of the posts with both feet and covers a lot of ground often tracking back to help in defence. Muldoon has been praised for his vision and ability to pick out pin-point passes, and he is also regarded as a great reader of the game. Ballinderry and Derry team-mate Kevin McGuckin described him as [...] "a magician on the ball and can do anything with it or put it anywhere with his passing". GAA journalist and former Derry player Joe Brolly said of him: [...] "I cannot say I have ever seen a more elegant footballer" [...] and compared him to Kerry football legend Maurice Fitzgerald.|$|E
500|$|Tactics {{used by a}} defensemen include body {{positioning}} and checking. Checking {{is attempting}} to <b>dispossess</b> the opposition of the ball through body or stick contact. A check may include a [...] "poke check", where a defensemen thrusts his crosse at the top hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball (similar to a billiards shot), or a [...] "slap check", where a player applies a short, two-handed slap to the hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball. A [...] "body check" [...] is allowed {{as long as the}} ball is in possession or a loose ball is within five yards of the opposing player and the contact is made to the front or side of the torso of the opposing player. Defensemen preferably remain in a position relative to their offensive counterpart known as [...] "topside", which generally means a stick and body position that forces a ball carrier to go another direction, usually away from the goal.|$|E
