During the period of one year, random samples from raw materials and final products were tested according to United States Pharmacopeia, and those that showed suspect results for specified microorganisms and/or out-of-specification limits or showed out-of-trend results were subjected to further identification by using miniaturized biochemical identification system after performing Gram stain. From the total bacterial isolates of the investigated products, more than 60 % were primarily belonging to Micrococcaceae 16. 98 % (empty hard gelatin capsules), Enterobacteriaceae 18. 86 % (vaginal cream applicator, plastic caps for bottles, Sorbitol solution, finished hard gelatin capsule product, topical cream and oral suspension) and Bacillaceae 24. 53 % (Talc powder, liquid oral preparation and finished hard gelatin capsule product).

Biopharmaceutical market has significant benefits such as fast and effective development of production facilities, the development of more effective and safer {{medical products}}. The aim of our research was, on the example of medical products Cortexin and Retinalamin, examine the specifics of quality of biological medicinal products in the chain from production to sale. The objects of study - original biological medicines Cortexin and Retinalamin. Comparative, systematic, analytical methods and reviews were used. Biological medical products have fundamental differences from synthetic medicines, due to their source - alive cells which are usually used in their production process. Each production cycle results in a unique <b>finished</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> and minimal differences in the modes of production can significantly effect on the properties of biological medical products. Therefore, even if the physical, chemical and biological properties of the product thoroughly studied and described, it does not guarantee therapeutic equivalence of two biological products which are manufactured in different conditions. One of the most important issues today is the problem of maintaining properties and quality of biological medicines. These issues are actively resolving on the native pharmaceutical market: quality control system are developing and implementing in accordance with international standards in order to maintain maximum efficiency of biological medicines and to protect consumers from defective products. Biological products require special conditions of storage and transportation. In order to save physical, chemical and therapeutic properties, strict compliance with the relevant conditions of packaging, transport and intermediate storage, related to deviations in temperature during transportation and storage is needed. The production process consists of the following stages: preparing of the solution for bottling, sterilizing filtration, washing and sterilizing of the bottles, aseptic filling, freeze drying and plugging, seaming, continuous monitoring in bulk. After getting the quality certificate and declaration of conformity products are transferred to the storage place for finished products.

40|$|PhD (Pharmaceutics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 This {{study focused}} on two active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredients (APIs) {{that are used to}} treat two of the most notorious diseases in Africa, i. e. human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and malaria. It is well known that many African countries lack effective regulatory control over medicines and patients are subsequently at risk of receiving sub-standard treatments. This study set out to investigate how the modification of the crystal packing (i. e. polymorphism) of these APIs may impact on their quality, safety and efficacy. Efavirenz (an antiretroviral) and Pyrimethamine (an antimalarial) were selected as the two model APIs for investigation during this study. It was found that a novel amorphous form (Form A) of Efavirenz had been prepared during this study through quench cooling. Form A was extensively characterised and compared to the preferred crystalline Form I, with the aim of providing a means of distinguishing between these two Efavirenz forms. In contrast to popular belief (that amorphous form should have improved dissolution and solubility properties over the crystalline counterpart), the powder dissolution of Form A was significantly lower than that of Form I. Further investigation indicated that this was due to the occurrence of agglomeration and phase-mediated transformation. This observation had led to the belief that Form A had poor thermodynamic stability. The glass transition temperature and the crystallisation activation energy, required for the recrystallisation of Form A, were subsequently determined in an attempt to elucidate its thermodynamic stability. The glass transition temperature of Form A was found to be unfeasibly low, hence confirming its tendency towards agglomeration. The crystallisation activation energy of Form A was determined by non-isothermal determinations, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hot stage microscopy (HSM) and capillary melting point (CMP) analysis. These studies not only elucidated the required activation energy for the conversion of Form A into Form I, but it also found that the results from CMP were {{similar to those of the}} universally accepted DSC technique, allowing for the proposal of CMP as a cost-effective alternative to DSC for the quantitative measurement of the crystallisation of Efavirenz. Isothermal studies revealed that Form A had a short half-life, which, together with its poor dissolution performance, exemplified why this form was unsuitable for pharmaceutical use. The Pyrimethamine {{study focused on}} recrystallisation as a means of modifying its crystal packing and on an evaluation of the effect that such crystal modification may have on its safety and manufacturability. Anhydrous Pyrimethamine was recrystallised, using methanol, acetone, n-propanol, ethanol, N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide. Ethanol, acetone and n-propanol altered the crystal habit of Pyrimethamine, without any modification of its crystal lattice. The different habits exhibited clear differences in flowability and compressibility, which could in turn affect manufacturing and therefore the quality of the <b>finished</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>product</b> (FPP). These habits were subsequently extensively characterised by means of in-silico molecular modelling predictions. It was found that recrystallisation from methanol, N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide had resulted in solvatomorphism. These solvatomorphs contained their respective solvents in concentrations exceeding the allowed residual solvent limits, as set by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. These undesirable solvatomorphs were also comprehensively characterised as a service to the pharmaceutical industry, in order to identify the distinct characteristics that distinguish these forms from the preferred non-toxic form, and to provide techniques for transforming the toxic forms into the non-toxic form.
