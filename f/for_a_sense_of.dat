25|$|According to Wood his {{character}} had long hankered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> normality that other characters {{on the show}} have. He said that finding love had changed {{his character}}'s priorities. Grace had become Trevor's main focus and the gangster business played second. In one story, Grace has Trevor arrested for her father's murder. Wood believed that Trevor was understanding of the betrayal because she was grieving. He added that Trevor's understanding was the reason {{they were able to}} move on in their relationship.|$|E
25|$|Phaedrus {{believes}} {{that one of}} the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.|$|E

25|$|With {{regard to}} other {{necessary}} reforms, the new president, Allan McEvey, {{set up a}} new review committee of two, Dom Serventy and himself. Serventy, a scientist with the CSIRO, was the principal writer of the review report and he addressed both the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> what the RAOU should be doing, and the structure that would allow it to do so. Although there was considerable vocal opposition to the reform proposals (including cutting the number of people on Council from an unwieldy forty to just nine) the report was ratified by Council in April 1969 and adopted at an Extraordinary General Meeting in June 1969, with the vote being over 80% in favour. Later that year came the first issue of the RAOU Newsletter, a publication that would evolve to become the magazine Wingspan.|$|E
25|$|The storm which {{dominates the}} opening chorus is portrayed vividly by the orchestra. Rapidly {{changing}} sixteenth notes {{played by the}} lower strings and woodwinds create {{an image of a}} turbulent sea while rising and descending scales in the upper woodwinds represent the unpredictable patterns of the wind in the tempest. Frequent interjections from the brass and percussion portray the bolts of lightning and thunder which accompany the storm. Otello's first entrance is marked by brass instruments <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> grandeur. Verdi adds to the anxiety by having the organ hold its three lowest notes in a cluster (C–C–D) through the entire scene. At the end, the woodwinds gradually calm down to portray the fading of the storm, and finally the release of the low organ discord completes the feeling of relief. When the chorus sings of their joy, the high woodwinds now portray the sparkling, cheerful flames.|$|E
500|$|This final stanza {{lost its}} {{significance}} with {{the completion of}} the later poems in the series, and the revision allowed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> anticipation at the poem's close and helped draw the audience into the story of the remaining [...] "Lucy poems". Of the other changes, only the description of the horse's movement is important: [...] "My horse trudg'd on" [...] becomes [...] "With quickening pace my horse drew nigh", which heightens the narrator's vulnerability to fantasies and dreams in the revised version.|$|E

500|$|McCay {{married in}} 1891, and the {{marriage}} was not a happy one. [...] According to McCay biographer John Canemaker, McCay depicts marriage in Rarebit Fiend as [...] "a minefield of hypocrisy, jealousy, and misunderstanding". [...] McCay was a short man, barely five feet (...) tall. [...] He was dominated by his wife, who stood as tall as he was. [...] Images of small, shy men dominated by their taller or fatter wives appear frequently in Rarebit Fiend. [...] Gigantism, with characters overwhelmed by rapidly growing elements, was another recurring motif, perhaps as compensation on McCay's part <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smallness. [...] McCay's brother Arthur had been put in a mental asylum, which may have inspired the themes of insanity that are common in the strip.|$|E
500|$|Kabuto is the titular {{creature}} of the game, {{and the only one}} of his race. In his back-story, the Reapers created him as their guardian, but found him beyond control. Creative Director, Tim Williams gave the [...] "Citizen" [...] title to Kabuto for its allusion to the character's wish <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging to the Island. The game developer modeled Kabuto's attacks after those of giant monsters in classic monster movies, allowing him to use professional wrestling attacks and aerial techniques such as elbow drops, foot stomps, and the [...] "butt flop" [...] described as [...] "like the body slam, but with less dignity". To balance his strength, a weak point at his waist inflicts heavy damage when struck. Players playing the giant monster can assume a perspective through his mouth to target prey.|$|E

[...] Jake expands on Jean-Paul Sartre's famous existentialist line [...] "existence precedes essence", saying [...] "existence not only precedes essence: {{in the case of}} human beings it rather defies essence." [...] The Doctor tells Jake, [...] "Choosing is existence: to the extent that you don't choose, you don't exist." [...] To cope with inability to make decisions, the Doctor prescribes three therapies: the arbitrary principles of Sinistrality ("If the alternatives are side by side, choose the one on the left"), Antecedence ("if they're consecutive in time, choose the earlier") and Alphabetic Priority ("choose the alternative whose name begins with the earlier letter of the alphabet").|$|E

500|$|Rhinehart {{comments}} {{that those who}} have taken part in the est training feel the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community: [...] "Most graduates indicate that the value of the seminar series depends not so much on it's ostensible data content or on the processes introduced, but on the sharing on an intimate basis with others." [...] He notes that some of the graduates of the est training [...] "treat him [...] with the love and awe normally associated with that of disciples for spiritual teachers". He likens Erhard's relationship to his staff members {{to the way in which}} a guru interacts with disciples: [...] " [...] the essentially eastern phenomenon of a powerful being [...] (usually a guru or a spiritual teacher) attracting other powerful beings who nevertheless choose to channel their power through their leader." [...] Rhinehart argues that est [...] "may be seen as in many ways the culmination to date of the 'Easternization of America', a process that first became notable in the late fifties and early sixties".|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the later}} part of American history, and into modern times, the {{relationship}} between American and European music has been a discussed topic among scholars of American music. Some have urged for the adoption of more purely European techniques and styles, which are sometimes perceived as more refined or elegant, while others have pushed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> musical nationalism that celebrates distinctively American styles. Modern classical music scholar John Warthen Struble has contrasted American and European, concluding that {{the music of the}} United States is inherently distinct because the United States has not had centuries of musical evolution as a nation. Instead, the music of the United States is that of dozens or hundreds of indigenous and immigrant groups, all of which developed largely in regional isolation until the American Civil War, when people from across the country were brought together in army units, trading musical styles and practices. Struble deemed the ballads of the Civil War [...] "the first American folk music with discernible features that can be considered unique to America: the first 'American' sounding music, as distinct from any regional style derived from another country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Connected to {{the concept}} of holding is what Winnicott called the anti-social tendency, {{something}} which he argued [...] "may be found in a normal individual, or in one that is neurotic or psychotic". The delinquent child (Winnicott thought) was looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> secure holding lacking in their family of origins from society at large. He considered antisocial behaviour as a cry for help, fuelled by a sense of loss of integrity, when the familial holding environment was inadequate or ruptured.|$|E

2500|$|Huxley's humanism {{came from}} his {{appreciation}} that mankind {{was in charge of}} its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather T. H. Huxley, when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian's thinking went along these lines: [...] "The critical point in the evolution of man… was when he acquired the use of … Man's development is potentially open… He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which… largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change". Both Huxley and his grandfather gave Romanes Lectures on the possible connection between evolution and ethics. (see evolutionary ethics) [...] Huxley's views on god could be described as being that of an agnostic atheist.|$|E
2500|$|Many of Winnicott's {{writings}} {{show his}} efforts to understand what helps {{people to be able}} to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, [...] "Peek-a-boo!" [...] when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her. [...] Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that [...] "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure". [...] "Potential space" [...] was Winnicott's term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).|$|E
