5|$|A {{commission}} {{to create a}} portal for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.|$|E
5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> landscapes and on still lifes, working in both pen and ink and oil on canvas. His still lifes of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, {{in common with the}} other members of the Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>On</b> a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E

5|$|Ravenpaw's Path {{is another}} trilogy which is centred around former ThunderClan {{apprentice}} Ravenpaw and <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> the farm with the farm cat Barley {{after the events}} of The Darkest Hour.

The three books are Shattered Peace, A Clan in Need, and The Heart of a Warrior, which were released on 3 August 2010.|$|E
5|$|Alderson enjoyed {{an active}} retirement, {{becoming}} Colonel Commandant of the Royal West Kent Regiment and pursuing hunting and yachting with fervour, being an active master of foxhounds of the South Shropshire Hunt {{and member of}} the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club. He was also very concerned that the growing popularity of motor sports would result in the demise of these traditional pastimes and expended much energy promoting them. After living the last few years of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> a houseboat moored in Oulton Broad, he died in December 1927 of a sudden heart attack at Lowestoft and was buried at Chesterton, Oxfordshire, survived by his wife. She later arranged for his private papers to be given to the nation and they are currently stored at British Library and the National Archives of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>On</b> January 25, 1938, {{he was arrested}} after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police. Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness {{in the face of}} racial antagonism. While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian. Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bennett volunteered to serve with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and, after securing his release from AMP on full pay, was appointed second-in-command of the 6th Battalion, {{which was part of}} the 2nd (Victorian) Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 1st Division. After a short period of training, the 1st Division began to embark for Europe. Just prior to his departure overseas, Bennett became engaged to Bess Buchanan, who he had met at a dance in Canterbury. As an engagement gift, Bess bought her betrothed a miniature photo of herself, set in a gold frame. Bennett carried the picture in his jacket pocket while serving overseas and it later saved <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> the Western Front, deflecting a German bullet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1825, White was en route {{to serve on the}} court of Loudoun County and stayed the night at a tavern along the Shenandoah River. He was {{discovered}} by the proprietor the following morning suffering with paralysis. White remained stricken with paralysis for several weeks and returned to his home in Winchester on a litter. His position as judge of the tenth judicial district was assumed by two judges: William Brockinbough and John Scott. White remained paralyzed for the remainder of <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>On</b> July 1, 1825, White gave power of attorney to his son, John Baker White, for the management of his affairs. White later died at his residence in Winchester on March 9, 1831.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Hawaii, Brown was {{licensed}} to practice law before the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 28, 1875.

Starting a private practice, he was representing clients in circuit court {{by the end of}} 1875, and in the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaii by 1876.

5|$|Although Domnall {{had earlier}} opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster, he possessed strong {{familial}} {{connections with the}} Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach. In fact, the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals {{that at least two}} apparent members of Echmarcach's family were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann. As a result of their demise, Domnall may well have become the leading male representative of his mother's family. From the standpoint of the Uí Briain, the union of Domnall's parents would, therefore, seem to have been orchestrated in the context of extending Uí Briain authority into the Isles. In 1096, the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, lost <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> Mann, apparently whilst supporting Domnall's undertaking in the Isles. This source not only corroborates Uí Briain intervention in the Isles, but suggests that Domnall {{and the rest of the}} Meic Taidc faced significant opposition there, possibly in the form of Lagmann's adherents. The chronicle credits Domnall with an oppressive three-year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him, and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Liz drinks {{poisoned}} punch which Julian's ex-wife Rebecca Hotchkiss {{had intended}} for Eve. Liz accuses Eve of deliberately {{giving her the}} punch, and Eve is arrested for attempted murder. T. C. proposes to Liz, but she becomes increasingly paranoid over his romantic feelings for Eve. Liz attempts to force Julian {{to have sex with}} her {{in the middle of an}} earthquake and tsunami, and stabs him in the back when he does not comply. At this point, Liz lies to Julian by saying that he had raped her in the past. T. C. later breaks off his engagement with Liz after reconciling with his ex-wife's past and rebukes all of her efforts to seduce her way back into <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>On</b> the eve of Eve's trial, Liz offers her adoptive sister a deal: she will rescind her accusation and not testify if Eve promises to leave Harmony forever. Eve considers the deal before ultimately refusing it. Near the end of Eve's trial, Julian agrees to give Rebecca anything she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with the vial of poison. Tabitha Lenox's daughter Endora Lenox magically casts the jury into a fake flashback, matching Rebecca's testimony, and the judge declares a mistrial.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan Brotherhood {{was officially}} inaugurated on January 1, 1977. Naming this first group the Knossos Grove coven, it {{initially}} began at his and Geraci's shared flat, {{where they were}} joined by their friend Joseph Cupolo. Setting up a lineage recording system to take into account which new initiates were being brought into the Brotherhood, the first man to be welcomed in was Kim Schuller, who was soon followed by Bruce-Michael Gelbert. Not long after, Cupolo moved to New Orleans, where he founded a second coven, known as Phaistos Grove. In 1977, Buczynski began attending the Sheridan Square Gym, and it was here that he met Gene Muto the following year. A stage director and part-time bartender, Muto entered into a sexual relationship with Buczynski, which Geraci accepted as per the rules of their open relationship. However, when Buczynski announced that he {{had fallen in love with}} Muto, it marked the end of his relationship with Geraci, who decided to move back to New Orleans in February 1979. Muto proceeded to move in with Buczynski at his apartment on West 13th Street, but did not share his boyfriend's magico-religious beliefs, instead being a far left atheist. He felt that Buczynski was wasting <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> Witchcraft, and encouraged him to aim for an academic education; Buczynski proceeded to attain a graduate equivalency diploma (GED). The Knossos Grove had meanwhile begun to deteriorate, rarely meeting from late-1978 through early 1979. He did however bring in Tony Fiara in late 1979, who would go on to play a significant role in the Minoan tradition, which was then being eclipsed in size by the Radical Faerie movement. That year, Buczynski decided to stop using his flat as a covenstead, which he moved to the Earth Star Temple, the back room of The Magickal Childe, Herman Slater's new shop.|$|E
