5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon die if he could not have her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E

500|$|Reducing {{the amount}} of food waste has been deemed {{critical}} if the UK <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill. Equally great emphasis has been placed on the reduction of food waste, across all developed countries, as a means of ending the global food crisis that leaves millions worldwide starving and impoverished. In the context of the 2007–2008 world food price crisis, food waste was discussed at the 34th G8 summit in Hokkaidō, Japan. UK prime minister Gordon Brown said of the issue [...] "We must do more to deal with unnecessary demand, such as by all of us doing more to cut our food waste".|$|E

500|$|Since 1974, a bypass {{has been}} {{planned for the}} {{congested}} part of US 206 through Hillsborough. [...] In [...] 2002, the NJDOT modified plans for the bypass. The bypass is to be mostly four lanes wide and run {{to the east of}} Hillsborough, with the southernmost portion only being two lanes; one interchange was planned with CR 514. The road <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> a Smart Growth goal by preserving land and eliminating two planned interchanges that would have increased congestion. In July 2009, it was announced that construction of the US 206 Hillsborough bypass, which is projected to cost $148 million, would start in 2010. On June 24, 2010, a contract was given to Carbro Constructors Corporation to build the first phase between CR 514 and Hillsborough Road. Construction on this portion, planned to cost $43 million, began on August 18, 2010 and opened on October 28, 2013. This section is currently designated US 206 Bypass. In spring 2015, work on grading and utility relocation for the ends of the bypass was slated to be completed. Work on constructing the northern and southern ends of the US 206 bypass of Hillsborough is planned to begin in spring 2017, but may be delayed as the state's Transportation Trust Fund is anticipated to run out of money in 2016. The Hillsborough Bypass is named for Peter J. Biondi, a former Assemblyman and Hillsborough mayor who died in 2011.|$|E
