5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|The Western Chalukya {{decorative}} inventiveness {{focused on}} the pillars, <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> lintels (torana), domical roofs in bays, outer wall decorations such as Kirtimukha (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans {{does not have any}} distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a cornice top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the dravida tiered type, and in the nagara style they were made in the latina (mono aedicule) and its variants; the bhumija and sekhari.|$|E

25|$|The {{seats and}} <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were also redesigned. The new <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> {{contained}} integrated armrests, with the controls {{for the power}} windows and locks mounted flat on its frontal part, allowing the driver to operate them without moving their arm. These switches, along {{with all of the}} main controls, would become illuminated when the headlights were turned on, allowing the driver to easily see them at night.|$|E

25|$|The colour layout {{on these}} trains are also {{different}} from their earlier counterparts. Cars 1 and 6 use a sort of pinkish-purple color on the seats, while cars 2 and 5 use a different shade of blue, and the middle cars using a bluish-green.

25|$|After {{the end of}} {{production}} of the Grand National, a new sporting LeSabre appeared in form of the LeSabre T-Type, which was offered from 1987 until 1989. The LeSabre T-Type had many unique options that were styled after the Regal Grand National and Regal T-Type models. Some of those options included blacked-out trim, gray-on-black seats (1987 only), gray-on-black <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> gray dash and trim, and T-Type specific front and rear spoilers.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} V70 was an improved {{development on the}} basis of the Volvo 850 estate. Overall design became more rounded doing away with the 850's square edges. Among the many changes were a completely revised front end, fully painted bumpers and side trim and clear indicator lenses all around. Most of the interior was redesigned, with new seats, <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> and dashboard. According to Volvo a total of 1800 changes were made.|$|E

The glove compartment door, trunk lid, front fender, and hood featured Cassini's signature.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the bold vertical lines of the exterior, the principal interior rooms and corridors are very ornate. Many of the interior's original furnishings survive to this day and again are Art Deco in style, including the windows, staircase rails, <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> and radiator screens. Many of the features recall images from the town's coat of arms, which is displayed above the main entrance: the bee, the wheatsheaf, the rose and the thistle.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} DIN {{doors are}} defined in DIN 18101 (published 1955-07, 1985-01, 2014-08). The door sizes are also {{given in the}} construction standard for wooden <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> (DIN 68706-1). The DIN commission was also responsible for the harmonized European standard DIN EN 14351-1 for exterior doors and DIN EN 14351-2 for interior doors (published 2006-07, 2010-08), which defines the requirements for the CE marking giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix.|$|E

[...] The <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> typically incorporates other parts {{that contribute to the}} appearance, functionality, and ergonomics of the vehicle. These include armrests, switches or other controls for windows and the locking mechanism, convenience lights, audio speakers, storage compartments, and other features.|$|R
40|$|The paper "DOWSETT, A. [...] . et al., 2016. Experimental {{testing of}} <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> {{boundary}} conditions to determine NVH variability‚Äù was submitted to and {{was presented at}} the 23 rd International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV 23) held in Athens, Greece, from 10 to 14 July 2016. It was published in the ICSV 23 Conference Proceedings under the copyright of the International Institute of Acoustics and Vibration (IIAV.) The variability of measured frequency response functions (FRFs) from nominally identical structures is a well-known phenomenon and trying to eradicate it increases the design challenge for automotive manufacturers. In this paper a vehicle door is experimentally tested in order to assess the effect of variability in the attachment boundary conditions between the door structure and trim components upon measured FRF data. Plastic clips can be used to hold the trim to the <b>door</b> <b>panel,</b> so individual clips were systematically removed and then replaced in order to generate a set of measured FRFs that demonstrate how individual property changes can influence the global structure. Point and transfer FRFs, with corresponding normalised standard deviations, were measured by exciting the <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> and measuring the response both on the <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> and on the attached trim. The door response was found to vary by up to 10...|$|R
