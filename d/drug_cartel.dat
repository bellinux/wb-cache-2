50|$|Mexican Drug War (2006-present) - {{an armed}} {{conflict}} fought between rival <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> and government forces in Mexico. Although Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>cartels,</b> or <b>drug</b> trafficking organizations, have existed {{for quite some}} time, they have become more powerful since the demise of Colombia's Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> now dominate the wholesale illicit drug market in the United States.

5|$|Veracruz is {{the most}} {{dangerous}} place in Mexico for journalists; at least nine journalists have been killed since Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa took office in 2010, many of them by the Los Zetas <b>drug</b> <b>cartel.</b> Most of these reporters were killed under unclear circumstances, and few arrests have been made in their respective investigations. Given the high levels of corruption, criminal impunity, and drug-related attacks against the press all across Veracruz, many local journalists have decided to leave the state and relocate in other parts of Mexico. The atmosphere in Veracruz has also forced many media outlets to self-censor and stop reporting on the drug violence. With traditional reporting being too dangerous and intimidating, social media and blogs are often the only outlets for reporting serious crimes.|$|E
