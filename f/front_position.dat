40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present some {{improvements}} in the metrology of forest fire flames by coupling image processing and radiative heat flux measurement. A new metrological tool using a visual video camera and a specific multiple thermal sensors is proposed. By means of an appropriate segmentation algorithm and the Direct Linear Transformation, the image processing methodology gives the forward or the backward fire <b>front</b> <b>positions</b> as input data to a radiative heat flux approach. Using a simplified flame model, this technique provides fire <b>front</b> <b>positions</b> versus time, and average values for the flame length, flame depth, flame tilt angle, apparent flame temperature and flame emissivity. The rates of spread, obtained by a linear regression of the determined fire <b>front</b> <b>positions,</b> as well as the thermal and radiative properties of the flame, are compared favorably to those given in the literature...|$|R

25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by rear position lamps (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. Rear position lamps may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the rear position lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying rear position lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|By {{the morning}} of 2 July, X Corps had gained a small {{foothold}} in the Leipzig Salient {{and part of the}} German front line opposite the 36th Division. The extent of British casualties north of the Albert–Bapaume road was not known at the Fourth Army headquarters and General Henry Rawlinson ordered that attacks were to continue. X Corps and VIII Corps to the north, were to capture the German <b>front</b> <b>position</b> and the intermediate line from Mouquet Farm to Serre. Gough was sent to take over command of X Corps and VIII Corps and the 25th Division (Major-General Guy Bainbridge) was transferred from reserve to X Corps. Gough had intended to attack Thiepval with the 49th and 32nd divisions and the 48th Division of VIII Corps but eventually changes of plan, led to the attack being reduced to two brigades of the 32nd Division.|$|E
25|$|The first intimation {{that the}} British {{received}} that a withdrawal had begun was when British patrols probing German outposts towards Serre, found them unoccupied. They then began a slow follow-up but unreadiness, the decrepitude {{of the local}} roads and the German advantage of falling back on prepared lines behind rearguards of machine-gunners, meant that the Germans completed an orderly withdrawal. The new defences were built on a reverse slope (Hinterhanstellung) where there were positions behind the defences, from which artillery observers could see them, experience having showed that infantry equipped with machine-guns needed a field of fire {{only a few hundred}} yards/meters deep. Unfortunately, General Ludwig von Lauter and Colonel Kramer from OHL ignored the new thinking and in much of the new line, artillery observation posts in the front line or in front of it and the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> was on forward slopes, near crests or at the rear of long reverse slopes.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, Coventry was {{selected}} to play his first senior game for Collingwood against St Kilda. He did not make an immediate impact and at times looked clumsy, but did enough to ensure he kept his spot after two valuable seasons. His brother, Syd Coventry was also be welcomed at the club, in 1922. Gordon had kicked 32 goals in those first two seasons, but played in his prime position in the losing grand final side of 1920 where he kicked {{more than half of}} Collingwood's score. In 1922 Coventry moved closer to goals and as the team continued its dominance, Coventry became a focal point, and in 1923 would win the club's goal kicking with 42 goals. Coventry did not possess the phenomenal skills of his predecessor Dick Lee or the aerial prowess of his successor Ron Todd, but relied on tremendous strength and a vice-like grip when marking the ball, a combination that made him almost unstoppable once he had <b>front</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{battle was}} the British {{part of the}} Third Battle of Artois, an Anglo-French {{offensive}} (known to the Germans as the Herbstschlacht (Autumn Battle). Field Marshal Sir John French and Haig (GOC First Army), regarded the ground south of La Bassée Canal, which was overlooked by German-held slag heaps and colliery towers, as unsuitable for an attack, particularly given the discovery in July, that the Germans were building a second defensive position behind the <b>front</b> <b>position.</b> At the Frévent Conference on 27 July, Field Marshal French failed to persuade Ferdinand Foch that an attack further north offered greater prospects for success. The debate continued into August with Joffre siding with Foch and the commanders being over-ruled by Herbert Kitchener, the British Secretary of State for War, on 21 August. On 3 May, the British decided upon use of poison gas in military operations in France. At a conference on 6 September, Haig announced to his subordinates that extensive use of chlorine gas might facilitate success despite the terrain, if the French and British were {{able to keep the}} attack secret and advance on a line towards Douai and Valenciennes.|$|E
25|$|The third {{position}} was incomplete {{and the second}} {{position was}} not as elaborate as the defences to the north but all available labour was absorbed in keeping the first position in repair during the preparatory bombardment. In the 12th Division area, the second position was only a shallow trench and work had only begun on the third position. The <b>front</b> <b>position</b> had been made more formidable, with the strong points of The Castle, along with Glatz and Pommiers redoubts, made by blocking trenches and encircling them with barbed wire. Montauban had been fortified and a trench dug around the south side. Bavarian Infantry Regiment 6, of the 10th Bavarian Division held the German front line from the north bank of the Somme to the road between Montauban and Carnoy, {{with the rest of}} the division in reserve near Bapaume or in the line near Thiepval. The 12th Division was in support, Infantry Regiment 63 opposite the French XX Corps and Infantry Regiment 62 behind Montauban. Reserve Infantry Regiment 109 of the 28th Reserve Division held the line from the Carnoy road westwards to Mametz.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June, British heavy {{artillery}} bombarded German communications {{behind the front}} line {{as far back as}} Bapaume and then continued intermittently until the evening of 22 June. At dawn on 24 June, a shrapnel barrage began on the German <b>front</b> <b>position</b> and villages nearby. At noon more accurate fire began and in the evening a light rain turned the German positions into mud. On 25 June, {{heavy artillery}}-fire predominated, smashing trenches and blocking dug-outs, setting fire to supply dumps and causing large explosions in Montauban. Variations in the intensity of fire indicated likely areas to be attacked, the greatest weight of fire occurring at Mametz, Fricourt and Ovillers; during the night the German commanders prepared their defences around the villages and ordered the second line to be manned. After an overnight lull, the bombardment increased again on 26 June, then suddenly stopped. The German garrisons took post and fired red rockets to call for artillery support and a German barrage was fired into no man's land. Later in the afternoon, huge mortar bombs began to fall, destroying shallower dug-outs and a super-heavy gun bombarded the main German strong-points, as smaller guns pulverised the villages close to the front line, from which civilians were hurriedly removed.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of premixed ammonia air flames, burning at atmospheric pressure under strain-stabilized conditions on a porous-plug burner, {{has been investigated}} using laser-diagnostic methods. Profiles of OH, NH, and NO were acquired by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and quantitative concentrations of OH and NO were retrieved using a concept for calibration versus absorption utilizing the LIF-signal itself, whereas NH concentrations were evaluated employing a saturated fluorescence signal. In addition, temperatures and relative oxygen concentrations were measured by rotational Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS). The new experimental data for flames with equivalence ratios of 0. 9, 1. 0, and 1. 2 were used to validate and rank the performance of four contemporary detailed kinetic models. Simulations were carried out using experimental temperature profiles {{as well as by}} solving the energy equation. Two models of the same origin, developed by Mendiara and Glarborg (2009) and by Klippenstein et al. (2011), in most cases showed good agreement in terms of radical concentrations, however, the model of Mendiara and Glarborg had better prediction of temperatures and flame <b>front</b> <b>positions.</b> The model by Shmakov et al. (2010) had comparable performance concerning radical species, but significant discrepancies appeared in the prediction of flame <b>front</b> <b>positions.</b> The model of Duynslaegher et al. (2012), in addition to the flame <b>front</b> <b>positions,</b> deviated from experiments or other models in terms of NH and NO concentrations. A sensitivity analysis for the Mendiara-Glarborg mechanism indicated that remaining uncertainties of the rate constants implemented in the recent H/N/O models are difficult to scrutinize unambiguously due to experimental uncertainties.

500|$|From mid-1917, {{the area}} east of Ypres was defended by six German {{defensive}} positions the <b>front</b> <b>position,</b> Albrecht Stellung (second position), Wilhelm Stellung (third position), Flandern I Stellung (fourth position), Flandern II Stellung (fifth position) and Flandern III Stellung (under construction). In between the German positions lay the Belgian villages of Zonnebeke and Passchendaele. After their defensive success on 9 October, the Germans brought fresh divisions into the line but the tempo of British operations caused considerable anxiety among German commanders. The 18th Division {{took over in}} the Poelcappelle area; on a } front, the division had 17 heavy machine-guns and large numbers of MG 08/15 machine-guns distributed among its infantry companies. Ludendorff's defensive changes had been implemented {{in some parts of}} the front, despite a certain reluctance among some of the local commanders.
