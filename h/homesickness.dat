5|$|In 1878, Lorne was {{appointed}} Governor General of Canada. Louise became viceregal consort, but her stay was unhappy {{as a result}} of <b>homesickness</b> and dislike of Ottawa. Following Victoria's death in 1901, Louise entered the social circle established by her brother, the new king, Edward VII. Louise's marriage survived thanks to long periods of separation; the couple reconciled in 1911 and she was devastated by her husband's death in 1914. After the end of the First World War in 1918, at the age of 70, she began to retire from public life, undertaking few public duties outside Kensington Palace, where she died at age 91.|$|E
5|$|With {{the team}} in the Premier League, {{there was a need}} to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was {{recruited}} for a fee of £1.2 million. Shortly after arriving at the club, however, he became unhappy, citing <b>homesickness</b> from his native Oxford as the reason. Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds' further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player. Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000 which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000 in the deal.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} Hayden {{moved to}} Detroit {{to work for}} Dodge but returned to Kentucky after the first summer because of <b>homesickness.</b> During the 1922-23 basketball season he coached at Kentucky Wesleyan College which was in Winchester at the time. In his one season at Kentucky Wesleyan he went 8-1. He then taught and coached at George Rogers Clark High School while taking {{a job in the}} insurance business in Richmond, Kentucky. In 1926 he was called to replace Ray Eklund as the head basketball coach at the University of Kentucky but was given only one week to prepare for the task with a team made up of unskilled members. The squad consisted primarily of football players, many of whom lacked the incentive to fully participate. The team finished with a 3–13 record, winning once against the University of Florida and twice against Centre College. When Harry Gamage was named the new head coach of the university's football squad, he had Hayden replaced with John Mauer. The team would not have another losing season until 1988–89 under Eddie Sutton.|$|E
5|$|As the Messi {{family had}} {{relatives}} in Catalonia, {{they sought to}} arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but {{the board of directors}} hesitated; {{at the time it was}} highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from <b>homesickness</b> after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.|$|E
5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, <b>homesickness</b> after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|Recalling his <b>homesickness</b> and {{loneliness}} {{the last time}} he had ventured abroad, for his next foreign trip Etty travelled in the company of Richard Evans, who had been a fellow student of Thomas Lawrence. Despite warnings that Italy would be uncomfortably hot, the two men set out on 23June 1822 with the aim of reaching Rome. Crossing to France by means of the recently developed steamboat, they arrived in Paris on 26June. They stayed in Paris for two weeks, visiting Versailles and the city's public art galleries; they also visited the much-reduced remaining exhibits of the Louvre. The Louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern French painting at the time, at which Etty felt a great dislike for the quality of portraiture in France, but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by the permanent collections, in particular Rubens's Marie de' Medici cycle, elements of which he would later reuse in many of his own works.|$|E
5|$|In Part 2, Phoebe {{tries to}} contact someone by phone to warn them about Rachel, {{eventually}} getting through to Joey {{at the hotel}} and stirring up <b>homesickness</b> in him. At the rehearsal dinner, Ross introduces his parents, Jack and Judy (Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles) to Emily's, Steven and Andrea (Tom Conti and Jennifer Saunders). Jack and Judy have volunteered to pay for half of the wedding expenses but when they discover extravagant costs Ross spends much of the evening trying to bargain down his future in-laws. Chandler makes a toast that is not well received by the guests and Monica is taken aback when a drunken guest mistakes her for Ross's mother. She and Chandler console each other over alcohol and wake up in bed together the next morning. Rachel eventually boards a plane, after forgetting her passport, and annoys other passengers (including guest star Hugh Laurie) by telling them about her relationship with Ross. At the hall, she sees how happy Ross is with Emily and just wishes him luck. Phoebe phones Joey to hear the wedding, to the annoyance of Ross. As Ross says his vows, he accidentally says Rachel's name rather than Emily's, registrar to ask Emily if he should continue, while the camera shoots from character to character, settling on a shocked Rachel.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September {{the family}} moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace, Brighton on the south coast of England where tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with the revolutionary Europe left behind. Parliamentary figures, {{particularly}} Disraeli, travelled down to visit them, as did Metternich's former friend Dorothea Lieven (Melanie led a reconciliation between the two). Expecting a visit from Metternich's daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline, {{the family moved}} to a suite of rooms at Richmond Palace on 23 April 1849. Visitors included Wellington, who still watched out for Metternich; Johann Strauss, the composer; and Dorothea de Dino, sister of Metternich's former lover Wilhemine of Sagan; and former lover Katharina Bagration. Metternich was showing his age, and his frequent fainting was cause for worry. The ex-Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor Franz Joseph I and his government. Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact, and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph; sincere or not, it buoyed Metternich considerably. From mid-August Melanie began to push for a move to Brussels, a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs. They arrived in October, staying overnight in the Hotel Bellevue. With revolution subsiding, Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna. Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited for an opportunity to re-enter Austrian politics. It was a pleasant enough (and cheap) stay, first in the Boulevard de l'Observatoire and later in the Sablon area—filled with visits from politicians, writers, musicians and scientists. For Metternich, however, the tedium and <b>homesickness</b> only increased. In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna, Prince Schwarzenberg, to ask if he might return if he promised not to interfere in public affairs. In April he received an affirmative reply, authorised by Franz Joseph.|$|E
5|$|Rush {{returned}} to Liverpool {{for the start}} of the 1988–89 season, due to <b>homesickness.</b> Liverpool struggled at the start of the season and by January they were nine points behind leaders Arsenal; by April the teams were level on points, and Arsenal were ahead on goal difference. By this time, Liverpool had reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989. Within six minutes the match was abandoned; overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end of the ground resulted in the death of ninety-six people, as they were crushed against perimeter fencing. Ninety-four fans died, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster, that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later and the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness. Liverpool won the replay 3–1 to reach the final against Everton. They led for the majority of the match from an Aldridge goal. Stuart McCall scored in the 89th minute to take the game into extra-time. Substitute Rush scored in the 95th minute, but McCall scored again in the 102nd minute to level the match. Another goal from Rush two minutes later secured a 3–2 victory for Liverpool. Once again, Liverpool had a chance at the double. Their final match of the season was against second-placed Arsenal, who were three points behind. The game had originally been scheduled for 23 April, but Liverpool's FA Cup commitments meant it was postponed and rearranged for 26 May. Arsenal needed to win the match by two clear goals to win the league championship. They took the lead in the 52nd minute when striker Alan Smith scored. With the match in injury time, Michael Thomas scored to give Arsenal a 2–0 victory. The result meant Arsenal won the championship on goals scored.|$|E

25|$|In September 2005, Turner {{signed with}} Finnish team Salon Vilpas Vikings for the 2005–06 season. However, he parted ways with Salon on November 2 and {{returned}} to Ireland due to <b>homesickness.</b> In six games for the team, he averaged 27.5 points, 14.0 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 3.3 steals and 2.7 blocks per game.|$|E
25|$|In that year, {{his father}} Giovanni came to public {{attention}} for his campaigning again the fascist plebiscite, and was condemned {{to remain in}} exile. Nevertheless, he managed {{to work on the}} restoration of the church at Costalissoio. Zanzotto, attending third grade at the time, joined him during summer vacation, but suffered <b>homesickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brâncuși held a large {{spectrum}} of interests, from science to music. He {{was a good}} violinist and he would sing old Romanian folk songs, often expressing by them his feelings of <b>homesickness.</b> After the installment of communism, he never considered moving back permanently to his native Romania, but he did visit it eight times.|$|E
25|$|To Laura's {{surprise}} and delight, homesteader Almanzo Wilder (with whom she became acquainted in Little Town on the Prairie) {{appears at the}} end of her first week of school in his new two-horse cutter to bring her home for the weekend.

25|$|Anne took {{lessons from}} Charlotte, after she {{returned}} from Roe Head. Charlotte returned to Roe Head {{as a teacher}} on 29 July 1835 accompanied by Emily as a pupil; her tuition largely financed by Charlotte's teaching. Within a few months, Emily unable to adapt to life at school, was physically ill from <b>homesickness.</b> She was withdrawn from school by October, and replaced by Anne.|$|E
25|$|It was at Cornell {{that she}} {{first began to}} write, {{as a way to}} combat <b>homesickness.</b> She {{submitted}} a short story, titled Sing to the Dawn, to the Council for Interracial Books for Children for its annual short story contest.

25|$|When he {{was only}} 16, Weiser's father agreed to a chief's {{proposal}} for him {{to live with the}} Mohawks in the upper Schoharie Valley. During his stay with them in the winter and spring of 1712-1713, Weiser endured hardships of cold, hunger and <b>homesickness,</b> but he learned {{a great deal about the}} Mohawk language and the customs of the Iroquois. Conrad Weiser returned to his own people towards the end of July 1713.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} interlude {{was provided}} by Hibs' participation as the Toronto-based franchise in the United Soccer Association. The team was known as Toronto City and eventually finished a 13-game summer league third in their division. Hibs opened the season by drawing 1–1 against Cerro Porteno at Yankee Stadium. Pat Stanton later praised the organisation and facilities provided by the league, although conceding {{that it was a}} long trip, causing some tiredness (it was played between domestic league seasons) and <b>homesickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Forgoing {{a trip to}} Australia due to <b>homesickness,</b> the Grants left Japan sailing on City of Tokio {{escorted by}} a Japanese warship, crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco in September 1879, greeted by cheering crowds, with factory {{whistles}} blowing and the cannons of Fort Point reporting. Grant was also greeted by various city officials who boarded a tugboat which came up alongside Grant's transport out in the bay, while scores of private vessels came close {{to get a glimpse}} of Grant.|$|E
25|$|Born in Ponta Delgada, São Miguel Island in the Azores, Pauleta {{started his}} career with local clubs in his native region, before turning {{professional}} in the lower leagues. He was part of FC Porto's youth team for a brief stint yet left soon due to <b>homesickness,</b> signing his first professional contract with Clube União Micaelense in 1994 and spending one year there. He then moved to second division's G.D. Estoril Praia in 1995, helping them to the 12th position in his first and only season.|$|E
25|$|Harmison {{disappointed}} with {{the ball on the}} 2004–05 England tour of South Africa, taking just 9 wickets in the Test series at the extremely high average of 73.22. During this series, he spoke frankly about his <b>homesickness</b> on foreign tours. However, his solid performances with the bat, including an innings high score of 42 in the 3rd Test, led some commentators to note, not altogether jokingly, that he was now making a case to be considered a tail all-rounder. Despite these disappointments, he was still named as one of five cricketers of the year by Wisden Cricketer's Almanack in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 Weekes {{accepted}} {{an offer of}} £500 to play as the professional for Bacup in the Lancashire League. When he first arrived in Bacup, Weekes was greatly affected by the cold and took to wearing an army great coat everywhere, to the extent it became part of his League image. His <b>homesickness</b> for Barbados was tempered by his landlady's potato pies {{and the presence of}} Worrell and Walcott, who were playing for League clubs Radcliffe and Enfield respectively. The three Ws would regularly meet at Weekes's house midweek for an evening of piano playing and jazz singing.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} {{high school}} which ended at Grade 11, Muriel attended the Ontario Ladies College, a Methodist girls' school in Whitby, Ontario. Her aunt, Abbie Ball, taught there {{and offered to}} pay Muriel's fees. The College provided instruction in languages, history, mathematics and piano but little science. The 15-year-old Muriel was too shy to participate in drama even though her aunt was the school's drama coach. She also suffered from <b>homesickness.</b> Once a month, guest speakers, usually from the United Church of Canada addressed the student assembly. Muriel especially remembered James Endicott, then a missionary in China, {{who went on to}} become a prominent church leader and a lifelong acquaintance.|$|E
25|$|Steinbeck {{returned}} from the war {{with a number of}} wounds from shrapnel and some psychological trauma. He treated himself, as ever, by writing. He wrote Alfred Hitchcock's movie, Lifeboat (1944), and the film, A Medal for Benny (1945), with screenwriter Jack Wagner about paisanos from Tortilla Flat going to war. He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of Lifeboat, because he believed {{the final version of the}} film had racist undertones. In 1944, suffering from <b>homesickness</b> for his Pacific Grove/Monterey life of the 1930s, he wrote Cannery Row (1945), which became so famous that Ocean View Avenue in Monterey, the location of the book, was renamed Cannery Row in 1958.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} her successes, Blankers-Koen nearly failed to start in the semi-finals of the 200m, held the day after hurdles final. Shortly before the semi-final, she broke down because of <b>homesickness.</b> After a long talk by her husband, she decided to run anyway, and {{qualified}} for the final with great ease. The final, on 6 August, was again held in the pouring rain, but Blankers-Koen completed the inaugural Olympic 200m for women in 24.4, seven tenths of a second ahead of runner-up Audrey Williamson—still the largest margin of victory in an Olympic 200m final. Audrey Patterson, the first African American woman to win an Olympic medal placed in third, although a finish photo discovered decades later indicates Shirley Strickland should have won the bronze.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterwards, Brian {{travels to}} America to study. By a strange twist of fate, he rooms with Peter Parker (the hero Spider-Man) at Empire State University. A brief {{misunderstanding}} caused Brian to battle Spider-Man, {{before the two}} of them were captured by the assassin Arcade. They then tackled various challenges in Murderworld, rescued Brian's love interest Courtney who was kidnapped and placed in a sealed cocoon with limited air, and became the first victims to survive Murderworld. Near the end of this stay, <b>homesickness</b> and stress saw him drink heavily. He stopped after, when drunk and embarrassed by a defeat, he beat a supervillain so badly she was put in hospital; ashamed, Brian paid for her hospital bills and therapy.|$|E
25|$|Hudson {{was born}} on September 12, 1981, in Chicago, Illinois. She is the third and {{youngest}} child of Darnell Donnerson (November 7, 1950 – October 24, 2008) and Samuel Simpson (died 1999). She was raised as a Baptist in Englewood and attended Dunbar Vocational High School, from which she graduated in 1999. She cites Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, and Patti LaBelle as her overall biggest influences and inspiration. At the age of 7, she got her start in performing by singing with the church choir and doing community theater {{with the help of}} her late maternal grandmother, Julia. She enrolled at Langston University but she left after a semester due to <b>homesickness</b> and unhappiness with the weather, and registered at Kennedy–King College.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{attending}} the Flames training camp, Hand {{went to the}} Edmonton Oilers' training camp after they had selected him in the 12th round (252nd and last overall) of 1986 NHL entry draft. There he survived the full fourteen days of camp without being cut, despite breaking his one and only stick {{on the first day}} and having to borrow one from Marty McSorley. Playing alongside players such as Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier, he impressed coach Glen Sather and was offered a contract to play Junior Hockey for a year. Suffering from <b>homesickness,</b> Hand turned it down but agreed to return the following year. Hand was the first of only two British born and trained player ever to have been drafted by an NHL team (the second being Colin Shields).|$|E
25|$|Tana Umaga {{was born}} in Lower Hutt to Samoan {{immigrant}} parents, and grew up playing rugby league. Umaga played for the Wainuiomata Lions and rose through the ranks, making the Wellington U-16 and U-17 sides, and was eventually named in the Junior Kiwi side of 1991.The side also featured future National Rugby League stars Joe Vagana, Ruben Wiki and Gene Ngamu. That same year he signed with the Newcastle Knights but within three weeks {{was back on the}} plane to New Zealand because of <b>homesickness.</b> He never did play a First-Grade NRL game. In 1993 Tana's brother Mike, who played rugby union for Manu Samoa, persuaded him to take up rugby union in 1994. The brothers played on opposite teams in a Test match between Samoa and New Zealand in 1999 during which Tana Umaga scored two tries (the All Blacks won 71–13).|$|E
25|$|On {{his arrival}} in Sydney, Blacket possessed a small library of {{architectural}} books, and he kept abreast of the latest trends by subscribing to journals. Although {{there were a number}} of buildings with Gothic details in the colony at the time, in particular the existing south transept of the new cathedral, these structures had strongly Classical elements beneath their medieval detailing. Blacket was the first architect in Australia who truly understood the principles of the Gothic style and who could design a church that would satisfy the august societies of Oxford and Cambridge. Since it was the wish of so many colonials, not the least of whom was the Bishop, to assuage their <b>homesickness</b> by at least attending a church that reminded them of one in Cornwall, Yorkshire or East Anglia, Edmund Blacket was to become a very popular man.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, a {{much better}} paying job enticed Wood to leave West Texas {{for the first time}} as a head coach. He landed in Victoria, Texas where he reunited with Assistant Coach Morris Southall. That year, Wood also hired Kenneth West as an {{assistant}} coach. West had played for Wood at Stamford in 1951. The two grew to be longtime friends and coached together for twenty years. Their first season at Victoria, Wood, Southall, and West shocked many Victoria fans and brought the team a 6-4 winning season. Then Coach Wood brought Victoria another winning season in 1959 with six wins, three losses, and one tie. Wood was getting paid well in Victoria, making about $10,000, but a lack of fan support and <b>homesickness</b> for West Texas convinced him to move back west. He left Victoria with twelve wins, seven losses, and one tie.|$|E
25|$|The {{loss of a}} {{significant}} person in one's life will typically initiate a grief response; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while {{in the company of}} others. Loneliness may also occur after {{the birth of a child}} (often expressed in postpartum depression), after marriage, or following any other socially disruptive event, such as moving from one's home town into an unfamiliar community, leading to <b>homesickness.</b> Loneliness can occur within unstable marriages or other close relationships of a similar nature, in which feelings present may include anger or resentment, or in which the feeling of love cannot be given or received. Loneliness may represent a dysfunction of communication, and can also result from places with low population densities in which there are comparatively few people to interact with. Loneliness can also be seen as a social phenomenon, capable of spreading like a disease. When one person in a group begins to feel lonely, this feeling can spread to others, increasing everybody's risk for feelings of loneliness. People can feel lonely even when they are surrounded by other people.|$|E
25|$|As First Officer of Venezuela's Foreign Secretariat {{after the}} coup on April 19, 1810, {{he was sent to}} London with Simón Bolívar and Luis Lopez Mendez serving as Diplomatic Representative to procure funds for the revolutionary effort until 1813. Bello landed at Portsmouth as an attache to Bolivar's mission in July 1810. Bello had an admittedly hard life {{throughout}} his stay in England, though he managed to further develop his ideas and took a particular interest in England's social changes from the industrial and agricultural revolution. In order to earn a living while in London, Bello taught Spanish and tutored Lord Hamilton's children. In London, he met Francisco de Miranda and became a frequent visitor of his library in Grafton Way, {{as well as of the}} British Museum. During his lengthy stay in England, he curbed his feelings of <b>homesickness</b> and became contemporaries with thinkers and intellectuals such as José María Blanco White, Bartólome José Gallardo, Vicente Rocafuerte to name a few. He stayed in London for nineteen years acting as a secretary to legations and diplomatic affairs for Chile and Colombia. In his free time he was involved in study, teaching and journalism.|$|E
25|$|Growing up {{in a poor}} {{family in}} the Cwmbwrla {{district}} of Swansea alongside elder brother John and three other siblings, John and Mel Charles seemed destined to begin their careers at local club Swansea Town. However manager Billy McCandless was unwilling to test youngsters in the unforgiving waters of the Third Division South, so the boys were not signed up to the club. This proved costly to Swansea, {{and the result was}} that John signed with Leeds United, and fourteen-year-old Mel also followed him to Elland Road {{to become one of the}} ground staff. Despite fitting in well at the club, he was unable to settle in Leeds; due to his poor background he was unable to afford trips back to Wales to visit his family and he was also illiterate so could not write home. After a young apprentice, also from Swansea, failed to impress at Leeds, manager Major Frank Buckley asked Charles to accompany him on the trip back to his hometown. However, due to his <b>homesickness,</b> Charles never returned to Yorkshire once he made it back to Swansea. Instead Swansea Town scout Joe Sykes persuaded Charles to join the club's ground staff.|$|E
25|$|Clerk and {{his fellow}} Caribbean missionaries were self-motivated and adapted quickly despite the initial <b>homesickness</b> and learnt the {{indigenous}} languages of Akan and Ga. The missionaries composed new local language hymns, translated church hymns into Ga and Akan from English and German, built stone houses, wells and schools, set up large farms and taught the local people {{to read and write}} vastly improving literacy in the region. In 1848, thirty-seven girls, twenty-five boys and seven children of the West Indians attended the newly set-up, United Akropong School with Clerk as a founding schoolmaster. The West Indian children who were taught at the school included Andrew Hall, Rosina Miller, Robert Miller, Catherine Miller, Elizabeth Mullings, Ann Rochester and John Rochester. The girls’ school was later transferred to Aburi in 1854 to become the Girls’ Senior School, predecessor to the present-day Aburi Girls’ Secondary School. Clerk and other missionaries also trained native catechists to help them in their evangelical work and play significant roles in the Basel Mission at the then newly established Basel Mission Training College in 1848 (now Presbyterian Training College of Education) as the second oldest higher educational institution in West Africa after Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Freetown, Sierra Leone.|$|E
25|$|Freddie Welsh {{was born}} in Pontypridd on 5 March 1886, to John Thomas and his wife Elizabeth Thomas (née Hall). In the late 19th century, Pontypridd was a growing coal mining town, which {{attracted}} not only those wishing {{to make a living}} down the mines, but also middle-class professionals who saw an opportunity to make a living in a thriving community. Welsh's father was one such commercial immigrant, setting up a business on Taff Street as an auctioneer. They moved into 17 Morgan Street in the town, and Welsh was born there. He had two younger siblings, a brother, Arthur Stanley and a sister, Edith Kate. Unlike most boxers of the period, Welsh had a privileged upbringing, at the age of four he attended Mr Mclune's Grammar School in Pontypridd and was privately educated at Long Ashton College in Clifton, Bristol. A few months after Welsh was born, his mother persuaded her husband to buy the Bridge Inn Hotel on Berw Road, and the family moved there. Welsh's mother was the daughter of a hotelier from Merthyr, and the Bridge Inn was her responsibility, as John Thomas was often away from home. When Welsh was ten, his father died, his mother, faced with running the hotel alone, sent Kate and Stanley to an aunt in Merthyr, while Welsh was sent to his maternal grandfather in Radyr. After a year, suffering from <b>homesickness,</b> Welsh returned home to Pontypridd. His mother later remarried, to Richard Williams, an innkeeper from Aberdare.|$|E
