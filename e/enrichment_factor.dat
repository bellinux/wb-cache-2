Different <b>enrichment</b> <b>factors</b> (ɛ) for carbon (range of − 1. 9 to − 3. 6 ‰) and hydrogen (range of − 29 to − 79 ‰) fractionation were observed during biodegradation of benzene under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic conditions.

These LFERs predict that isotopic light compounds sorb {{more strongly than}} their heavy counterparts.

Hydrogen <b>enrichment</b> <b>factors</b> for sorption of 14 different compounds were between - 2. 4 and - 9. 2 parts per thousand. For perdeuterated hydrocarbons the predicted <b>enrichment</b> <b>factors</b> ranged from - 19 +/- 5. 4 parts per thousand. (benzene) to - 64 +/- 30 parts per thousand (cyclohexane). Equilibrium sorption experiments with a soil and activated carbon as sorbents were performed in the laboratory for perdeuterocyclohexane and perdeuterotoluene. The measured D/H enrichments agreed with the LFER prediction for both compounds and both sorbents within the uncertainty estimate of the prediction. The results of this work suggest that equilibrium sorption does create only very small isotope shifts for C- 13 in groundwater pollutants in aquifers.

40|$|One {{difficulty}} in using bioremediation at a contaminated site is demonstrating that biodegradation is actually occurring in situ. The stable isotope composition of contaminants may help with this, since they {{can serve as}} an indicator of biological activity. To use this approach it is necessary to establish how a particular biodegradation pathway affects the isotopic composition of a contaminant. This study examined bacterial strains expressing three aerobic enzymes for their effect on the 13 C/ 12 C ratio when degrading both trichloroethene (TCE) and cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (c-DCE) : toluene 3 -monoxygenase, toluene 4 -monooxygenase, and toluene 2, 3 -dioxygenase.

40|$|This paper investigates pervaporation, a {{membrane}} separation {{process for the}} removal of sulfur-containing components from jet fuel. To this end, one type of commercial membrane from PolyAn GmbH was applied. The influence of the crucial reaction parameters of the pervaporation process, such as feed temperature, permeate pressure, and permeate temperature, on the characteristic pervaporation measures such as permeate flux and <b>enrichment</b> <b>factor</b> was tested experimentally. Fuels with different sulfur mass fractions were applied and the long-term stability of the membranes used was studied. Different spectroscopic methods were applied to investigate correlations between membrane performance and material properties of the membrane. It was found that an increased feed temperature had a positive effect on the permeate flux while it had a negative effect on the <b>enrichment</b> <b>factor.</b> At 100 degrees C, the permeate flux amounted to 5. 44 kg/(h m(2)), while it was only 1. 16 kg/(h m(2)) at a feed temperature of 80 degrees C. At a feed temperature of 80 degrees C, the <b>enrichment</b> <b>factor</b> was 0. 47, while it amounted to 0. 64 at a feed temperature of 100 degrees C. In the case of the permeate pressure, the trends were also antagonistic. Low permeate pressure enhanced the permeate flux but deteriorated the <b>enrichment</b> <b>factor.</b> At a value of 20 mbar, the permeate flux amounted to 5. 44 kg/(h m(2)), while it was only 0. 16 kg/(h m(2)) at 100 mbar. The <b>enrichment</b> <b>factor</b> was 0. 64 at 20 mbar and decreased to 0. 35 at 100 mbar. Different permeate temperatures and sulfur mass proportions had only a minor effect on the permeate flux and the <b>enrichment</b> <b>factor.</b> Experiments on the long-term stability of the membranes used showed that fortunately the pervaporation process could be run for more than 500 h using membranes from PolyAn GmbH while still showing a measurable permeate flux and a remarkable reduction of the sulfur mass fraction in the permeate. However, a significant deactivation with time on stream was observed. The permeate flux continuously decreased from 3. 5 kg/(h m(2)) to 0. 5 kg/(h m(2)) after 532 h of time on stream. The <b>enrichment</b> <b>factor</b> increased from 0. 5 to 0. 6. Long-term experiments with pretreated membranes revealed that interaction between the hydrocarbon matrix in kerosene Jet A- 1 and the membrane material itself was not responsible for the observed degradation of performance. Spectroscopic investigations were used to show that the reduction of the permeate flux was probably caused by an irreversible inclusion of polar - mostly aromatic - molecules in the polymeric separation layer of the membrane. The probable influence of unknown additives on the permeate flux could not be proven but should be considered. No degradation of the membrane material itself was found. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
