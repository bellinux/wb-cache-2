5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of <b>high-impedance</b> and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the <b>high-impedance</b> sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E
25|$|Direct inject (DI) is {{a device}} for {{connecting}} an unbalanced, <b>high-impedance,</b> low-level signal (commonly a guitar pickup's signal) into audio equipment {{designed for a}} low-impedance balanced signal (such as a DAW) or audio consoles. Reverse-DI means running this same device or technique in reverse – connecting a high-level (typically balanced, low-impedance) signal into audio equipment that was designed for low-level, unbalanced, <b>high-impedance</b> signals, such as a guitar amplifier.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a <b>high-impedance</b> microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance. The other is that long <b>high-impedance</b> cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation iPod had a weak bass response, {{as shown}} in audio tests. The {{combination}} of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter, which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors {{were used in the}} fourth-generation iPods. The problem is reduced when using <b>high-impedance</b> headphones and is completely masked when driving <b>high-impedance</b> (line level) loads, such as an external headphone amplifier. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.|$|E
25|$|The {{usual way}} of {{limiting}} sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power. This has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of {{the efficiency of}} the headphones; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency, <b>high-impedance</b> equipment, while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient earphones.|$|E
25|$|Historically, many {{headphones}} had {{relatively high}} impedance, often over 500ohms {{in order to}} operate well with <b>high-impedance</b> tube amplifiers. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external headphone amplifier may be beneficial.|$|E
25|$|In the {{independent}} slave configuration, {{there is an}} independent chip select line for each slave. A pull-up resistor between power source and chip select line is highly recommended for each independent device to reduce cross-talk between devices. This is the way SPI is normally used. Since the MISO pins of the slaves are connected together, {{they are required to}} be tri-state pins (high, low or <b>high-impedance).</b>|$|E
25|$|Distribution {{power systems}} may be solidly grounded, with one circuit {{conductor}} {{directly connected to}} an earth grounding electrode system. Alternatively, some amount of electrical impedance may be connected between the distribution system and ground, to limit the current that can flow to earth. The impedance may be a resistor, or an inductor (coil). In a <b>high-impedance</b> grounded system, the fault current {{is limited to a}} few amperes (exact values depend on the voltage class of the system); a low-impedance grounded system will permit several hundred amperes to flow on a fault. A large solidly grounded distribution system may have thousands of amperes of ground fault current.|$|E
25|$|Headphones are {{available}} with low or high impedance (typically measured at 1kHz). Low-impedance headphones {{are in the range}} 16 to 32ohms and <b>high-impedance</b> headphones are about 100-600ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered CMOS-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum Tube Voltmeters or valve {{voltmeters}} (VTVM, VVM) {{were used}} for voltage measurements in electronic circuits where high input impedance was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed input impedance of typically 1megohm or more, usually through use of a cathode follower input circuit, and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic <b>high-impedance</b> analog transistor and field effect transistor voltmeters (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.|$|E
25|$|With {{advances}} in power semiconductors, it became possible to output high voltage {{directly from the}} output stage of the amplifier. For example, in 1967, Crown International introduced the DC300 amplifier, which is capable of directly driving 70-volt lines, as well as traditional speaker loads, thanks to its overall power of 500W. In 1987, Crown introduced the Macrotech 2400, capable of driving 100-volt lines directly. Since that time, further developments in high-power amplifier technology have widened the choices; many manufacturers make amplifiers capable of direct connection to a <b>high-impedance</b> constant-voltage speaker line. High-voltage audio amplifiers have almost become a one chip solution. For example, National Semiconductor's LME49810 (and similar products LME49811 and LME49830) can output 100 V peak to peak signals, but have relatively low current output, so a standard circuit includes a Darlington or FET discrete output stage.|$|E
2500|$|Capacitive {{coupling}} is {{the mechanism}} used by electrical tester pen devices. [...] Because the capacitance between an object and a current source is typically small, only very small currents can {{flow from the}} energized source to the coupled object. [...] <b>High-impedance</b> digital or analog voltmeters may measure elevated voltages from non-energized objects due to this coupling, in effect providing a misleading reading. [...] For this reason, <b>high-impedance</b> voltage measurements of normally non-energized objects must be verified.|$|E
2500|$|However, in this circuit V− is a {{function}} of Vout because of the negative feedback through the R1 R2 network. [...] R1 and R2 form a voltage divider, and as V− is a <b>high-impedance</b> input, it does not load it appreciably. [...] Consequently ...|$|E
2500|$|Ungrounded metal objects {{close to}} {{electric}} field {{sources such as}} neon signs or conductors carrying alternating currents can have measurable voltage levels caused by capacitive coupling. [...] Since voltages detected by <b>high-impedance</b> instruments disappear or become greatly reduced when a low impedance is substituted, the effect is sometimes called [...] phantom voltage (or ghost voltage). The term is often used by electricians, and might be seen, for example, when measuring the voltage at a lighting fixture after removing the bulb. [...] It is not unusual to measure phantom voltages of 50–90 volts when testing the wiring of ordinary 120V circuits with a <b>high-impedance</b> instrument. While the voltage produced may read almost to the full supply voltage, the capacitance or mutual inductance between the wires of building wiring systems is typically quite low and incapable of supplying significant amounts of current.|$|E
2500|$|Constant-voltage speaker systems {{refer to}} {{networks}} of loudspeakers which {{are connected to}} an audio amplifier using step-up and step-down transformers to simplify impedance calculations and to minimize power loss over the speaker cables. They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only {{in the sense that}} at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant-voltage speaker systems are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or <b>high-impedance</b> speaker systems. [...] In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100V.|$|E
2500|$|Today Schumann {{resonances}} are recorded at many separate research {{stations around the}} world. The sensors used to measure Schumann resonances typically consist of two horizontal magnetic inductive coils for measuring the north-south and east-west components of the magnetic field, and a vertical electric dipole antenna for measuring the vertical component of the electric field. A typical passband of the instruments is 3–100Hz. [...] The Schumann resonance electric field amplitude (~300 microvolts per meter) is {{much smaller than the}} static fair-weather electric field (~150 V/m) in the atmosphere. Similarly, the amplitude of the Schumann resonance magnetic field (~1 picotesla) is many orders of magnitude smaller than the Earth's magnetic field (~30–50 microteslas). Specialized receivers and antennas are needed to detect and record Schumann resonances. The electric component is commonly measured with a ball antenna, suggested by Ogawa et al., in 1966, connected to a <b>high-impedance</b> amplifier. The magnetic induction coils typically consist of tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of turns of wire wound around a core of very high magnetic permeability.|$|E
2500|$|Any meter will {{load the}} circuit under test to some extent. For example, a {{multimeter}} using a moving coil movement with full-scale deflection current of 50 microamps, the highest sensitivity commonly available, must draw at least 50 microamps from the circuit under {{test for the}} meter {{to reach the top}} end of its scale. This may load a <b>high-impedance</b> circuit so much as to affect the circuit, thereby giving a low reading. The full-scale deflection current may also be expressed in terms of [...] "ohms per volt". The ohms per volt figure is often called the [...] "sensitivity" [...] of the instrument. Thus a meter with a 50 microampere movement will have a [...] "sensitivity" [...] of 20,000 ohms per volt. [...] "Per volt" [...] refers {{to the fact that the}} impedance the meter presents to the circuit under test will be 20,000 ohms multiplied by the full-scale voltage to which the meter is set. For example, if the meter is set to a range of 300 volts full scale, the meter's impedance will be 6 megohms. 20,000 ohms per volt is the best (highest) sensitivity available for typical analog multimeters that lack internal amplifiers. For meters that do have internal amplifiers (VTVMs, FETVMs, etc.), the input impedance is fixed by the amplifier circuit.|$|E

5000|$|Using low-loss, <b>high-impedance</b> feedline with an ATU {{results in}} very little loss, even with {{multiple}} reflections. However, if the feedline-antenna combination is ‘lossy’ then an identical high SWR may loose a considerable {{fraction of the}} transmitter's power output. High impedance lines [...] - [...] such as most parallel-wire lines [...] - [...] carry power mostly as high voltage rather than high current, and current alone determines the power lost to line resistance.

For that reason, radio operators can be more casual about using tuners with <b>high-impedance</b> feedline.|$|E
50|$|The <b>high-impedance</b> {{state of}} a given node in a circuit cannot be {{verified}} by a voltage measurement alone.
