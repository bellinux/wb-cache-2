Electricity demand was recorded at half-hourly intervals for each dwelling over a six month period from 1 st July 2009 to 31 st December 2009. Descriptive statistics are shown for each electrical parameter such as mean, maximum demand, load factor and time of use (ToU) of electricity consumption. The mean power demand and daily mean load factor {{of the sample was}} 0. 512 kW and 23. 43 % respectively for all dwellings over the monitoring period. A mean <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> of 2. 5 kW was recorded for the sample.

40|$|In Australia, {{residential}} electricity {{peak demand}} has risen steeply in recent decades, leading to higher prices as new infrastructure {{was needed to}} satisfy demand. One way of limiting further infrastructure-induced retail price rises is via 2 ̆ 7 cost-reflective 2 ̆ 7 electricity network pricing that incentivises users to shift their demand to non-peak periods. Empowering consumers with knowledge of their energy usage is critical to maximise {{the potential benefits of}} cost-reflective pricing. This research consulted residential electricity consumers in three Australian states on their perceptions and acceptance of two cost-reflective pricing scenarios (Time-of-Use and Peak Capacity pricing) and associated technologies to support such pricing (smart meters, in-home displays and direct load control devices). An energy economist presented information to focus groups on the merits and limitations of each scenario, and participants 2 ̆ 7 views were captured. Almost half of the 53 participants were agreeable to Time-of-Use pricing, but did not have a clear preference for Peak Capacity pricing, where the price was based on the <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>demand.</b> Participants recommended further information to both understand and justify the potential benefits, and for technologies to be introduced to enhance the pricing options. The results have implications for utilities and providers who seek to reduce peak demand...|$|E

40|$|Investment {{expenditures}} in natural gas distribution pipelines account for 70 % {{of the rate}} base of Société en Commandite Gaz Métropolitain (SCGM), the natural gas utility which serves most customers {{in the province of}} Québec. In allocating these costs to rate payers, the regulatory process divides costs into an access fee which reflects the fixed costs of planning and implementing the system that is to be divided equally over all users and a user or variable cost fee reflecting the capacity they use. In this paper we estimated a cost function to provide information to regulators on how these tariffs should be set. We use a unique data set of 131 observations which represent natural gas extension projects realized by SCGM in four Québec regions (Trois-Rivières, Sherbrooke, Québec and Chicoutimi) in the eighties and early nineties, to analyze the main determinants of capital costs. It is found that capital cost is not separable into a fixed and a variable component, that the elasticity with respect to <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> <b>demand</b> is not significant, and that the elasticity with respect to pipe length is slightly less than one. <b>Maximum</b> <b>daily</b> <b>demand</b> by each consumer class and consumer density per kilometer play no statistically significant role. ...|$|R

The estimation of the <b>maximum</b> water <b>demand</b> is a crucial aspect in both the design and management processes. Studies in the past have tackled this issue with deterministic approaches, even if peak phenomena are distinctly random. In this work, probabilistic models have been developed to study and forecast the <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> residential water <b>demand.</b> Some probability distributions have been tested by means of statistical inferences on different data samples related to three monitored WDS. The parameter estimations of the proposed equations have been related to the number of supplied users.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Electric {{demand charge}} {{is a large}} portion (usually 40 %) of {{electric}} bill in residential, commercial, and manufacturing sectors. This charge {{is based on the}} greatest of all demands that have occurred during a month recorded by utility provider for an end-user. During the past several years, electric demand forecasting have been broadly studied by utilities on account {{of the fact that it}} has a crucial impact on planning resources to provide consumers reliable power at all time; on the other hand, not many studies have been conducted on consumer side. In this thesis, a novel <b>Maximum</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Demand</b> (MDD) forecasting method, called Adaptive-Rate-of-Change (ARC), is proposed by analysing real-time demand trend data and incorporating moving average calculations as well as rate of change formularization to develop a forecasting tool which can be applied on either utility or consumer sides. ARC algorithm is implemented on two different real case studies to develop very short-term load forecasting (VSTLF), short-term load forecasting (STLF), and medium-term load forecasting (MTLF). The Chi-square test is used to validate the forecasting results. The results of the test reveal that the ARC algorithm is 84 % successful in forecasting <b>maximum</b> <b>daily</b> <b>demands</b> in a period of 72 days with the P-value equals to 0. 0301. Demand charge is also estimated to be saved by $ 8, 056 (345. 6 kW) for the first year for case study I (a die casting company) by using ARC algorithm. Following that, a new <b>Maximum</b> <b>Demand</b> Management (MDM) method is proposed to provide electric consumers a complete package. The proposed MDM method broadens the electric consumer understanding of how MDD is sensitive to the temperature, production, occupancy, and different sub-systems. The MDM method are applied on two different real case studies to calculate sensitivities by using linear regression models. In all linear regression models, R-squareds calculated as 0. 9037, 0. 8987, and 0. 8197 which indicate very good fits between fitted values and observed values. The results of proposed demand forecasting and management methods can be very helpful and beneficial in decision making for demand management and demand response program...|$|R

Studies based mainly on model organisms {{have tended to}} focus on responses to average temperatures or short-term heat stress, which overlooks the potential impact of daily fluctuations, including stressful daytime periods and milder night-time periods. Here, we focus on <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> temperatures, while holding night-time temperatures constant, to specifically investigate the effects of high temperature on demographic parameters and fitness in the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. We then compared the observed effects of different <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> temperatures with predictions from constant temperature-performance expectations. Moderate <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> temperatures depressed aphid performance while extreme conditions had dramatic effects, even when mean temperatures were below the critical maximum. Predictions based on daily average temperature underestimated negative effects of temperature on performance by ignoring <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> temperature, while predictions based on daytime maximum temperatures overestimated detrimental impacts by ignoring recovery under mild night-time temperatures.

From a surface energy balance perspective, the summer mean <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> temperature change can be affected by changes in solar heating {{that are associated with}} cloud cover change and changes in surface evaporative cooling caused by different precipitation and land surface wetness, but little is known about regional cloud cover and precipitation feedbacks to decadal temperature trends. Changes in cloudiness and precipitation and their connections with summer mean <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> temperature variations in NA were investigated using observation-based products of temperature and precipitation and satellite-derived cloud cover and radiation products. Results show that summer mean <b>daily</b> <b>maximum</b> temperature variance is largely explained by changes in cloud cover and precipitation. Cloud cover effect dominates at the high and middle latitudes of NA, and precipitation is a more dominant factor in the southern United States.
