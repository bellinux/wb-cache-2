5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. <b>Intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|This {{scale has}} been {{modified}} by Claassen and coworkers, reflecting the additive risk from SAH size and accompanying <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (0 - none; 1 - minimal SAH w/o IVH; 2 - minimal SAH with IVH; 3 - thick SAH w/o IVH; 4 - thick SAH with IVH);.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E

40|$|Inconsistency of {{the current}} {{classification}} of cerebral <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> is discussed in the article. The author explains divergence of including of the subependymal (1 st stage) and intracerebral (4 th stage) hemorrhages into this classification. A new classification of cerebral <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> including their origin, phases and stages is offered. The most common origin of <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> is subependymal hemorrhage (82, 2 %). Two phases of hemorrhage were distinguished: bleeding phase and resorption phase. Stages of <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> reflecting the blood movement after the onset of bleeding are the following: 1 — infill of the up to ½ of the lateral ventricles without their enlargement; 2 — infill of more than ½ of the lateral ventricles with their enlargement; 3 — infill of the IV ventricle, of the cerebellomedullary cistern and its dislocation into the subarachnoid space of the cerebellum, pons varolii, medulla oblongata and spinal cord. </p...|$|R
50|$|Epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhages are extra-axial bleeds, {{occurring}} {{outside of}} the brain tissue, while intra-axial hemorrhages, including intraparenchymal and <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages,</b> occur within it.|$|R
25|$|Cerebral {{hemorrhage}} (also {{known as}} intracerebral hemorrhage), {{which is basically}} bleeding within the brain itself (when an artery in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood), due to either intraparenchymal hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain tissue) or <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (bleeding within the brain's ventricular system).|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists officially {{endorsed}} delaying clamping of {{the umbilical}} cord for 30–60 seconds with the newborn held {{below the level of}} the placenta in all cases of preterm delivery based largely on evidence that it reduces the risk of <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in these children by 50%. In the same committee statement, ACOG also recognize several other likely benefits for preterm infants, including [...] "improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, and decreased need for blood transfusion". In January 2017, a revised Committee Opinion extended the recommendation to term infants, citing data that term infants benefit from increased hemoglobin levels in the newborn period and improved iron stores in the first months of life, which may result in improved developmental outcomes. ACOG recognized a small increase in the incidence of jaundice in term infants with delayed cord clamping, and recommended policies be in place to monitor for [...] and treat neonatal jaundice. ACOG also noted that delayed cord clamping is not associated with increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Massive {{intracerebral}} and <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> require {{aggressive and}} rapid management to decrease intracranial hypertension.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the etiology of}} hydrocephalus present at birth, i. e. of fetal hydrocephalus. Both inherited and dysraphic major malformations are very rare. <b>Intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> and viral infections during pregnancy are among the proposed etiologies; they are supported more by anatomical, physiopathological and experimental findings than by clinical evidence. Cases of fetal <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> cited in the literature are anecdotical, and the reports fail to identify maternal or fetal predisposing factors. The role of viruses in the etiology of connatal hydrocephalus has been postulated {{on the basis of}} epidemiological considerations in human pathology and of a considerable amount of experimental studies in animals. Investigations were generally focused on aqueduct ependyma, but research should also address other structures involved in the genesis of hydrocephalus (choroid plexus, extraventricular CSF pathways, including arachnoid villi). Furthermore, experimental evidence has emerged concerning a number of toxins and of drugs administered during pregnancy, which are thought {{to be involved in the}} genesis of hydrocephalus: once more, the conclusions reached in these experimental trials lend further credence to the human epidemiological data linking pregnancy disturbances with fetal hydrocephalus.

Hyperacute subarachnoid and <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> (SAH and IVH) were more clearly visualized {{as an area}} of decreased signal intensity on GRE T 2 *-weighted sequences than on FLAIR sequences in all three patients. These preliminary results suggest that acute SAH and IVH with GRE T 2 *-weighted imaging can be reliably diagnosed at 3 T.

5000|$|This type of {{hemorrhage}} {{is particularly}} common in infants, especially premature infants {{or those of}} very low birth weight. [...] The cause of IVH in premature infants, unlike that in older infants, children or adults, is rarely due to trauma. Instead it is thought to result from changes in perfusion of the delicate cellular structures that {{are present in the}} growing brain, augmented by the immaturity of the cerebral circulatory system, which is especially vulnerable to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The lack of blood flow results in cell death and subsequent breakdown of the blood vessel walls, leading to bleeding. While this bleeding can result in further injury, it is itself a marker for injury that has already occurred. Most <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> occur in the first 72 hours after birth. The risk is increased with use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in preterm infants.|$|R

Conventional surgery using image guidance technologies is also becoming common and is referred to as surgical navigation, computer assisted surgery, navigated surgery, stereotactic navigation.

40|$|Abstract ______________________________________________________________ Antenatal {{anticipation}} of problem pregnancies {{and improvements in}} resuscitation and care of newborns have led to increasing survival of babies born prematurely. Nevertheless, the potential for neurologic handicaps is significant in this population of children, and the prevention of intracerebral, peri- and <b>intraventricular</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> and associated brain lesions remains a high priority. In this review, we consider (1) the clinical problem of periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage; (2) means of diagnosis; (3) the EEG and periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage; (4) sequelae; (5) hypotheses of pathogenesis; (6) experimental approaches to understanding periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage; (7) agents being tested for use in preventing hemorrhage; and (8) future areas for research toward the prevention of hemorrhage and other neonatal brain lesions.
