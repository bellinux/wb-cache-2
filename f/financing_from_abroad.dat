50|$|While Dragon Tiger Gate was in post-production, Donnie Yen had {{announced}} that {{plans for a}} sequel to SPL: Sha Po Lang had already begun, with Mandarin Films set to finance the film. Production was planned to begin in May or June 2006. Yen and his management company later clarified that the team behind SPL would be working together again on a new film, but due to copyright issues, {{they would not be}} making a sequel to the 2005 film. Yen lobbied for an American-based studio to co-produce the new film, tentatively known SPL 2, with Mandarin Films. With <b>financing</b> <b>from</b> <b>abroad,</b> Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen decided to raise the budget of the film to HK$50 million. Yip reportedly intended to have Aaron Kwok join the cast, but Kwok declined the role and Louis Koo had already agreed to join the cast. With Yen and Koo now cast as the lead actors, Yen and Yip had also pondered on their supporting cast for the film, even with an incomplete script. Zhang Jingchu and Rene Liu were considered as female leads.|$|E
30|$|According to {{the model}} results in Table  29, GERD <b>financing</b> <b>from</b> <b>abroad</b> (GERD_ABROAD_FINANCE) and gross {{expenditure}} on R&D by higher education sector (GERD-HIGH-PERFORM) have negative coefficients. This {{is the case with}} business (BERD) and government expenditures (GOVERD) as well. Of the variables, government expenditure has the largest influence on patent ownership by foreign residents since a unit increase in government expenditure on R&D is associated with a decrease of 27.94 [*]units in patents owned by foreign residents. This depicts a large impact.|$|E
40|$|Why are foreigners {{willing to}} invest over $ 2 Â trillion {{per year in the}} United States? This paper tests various {{hypotheses}} and finds that standard portfolio allocation models and diversification motives are poor predictors of foreign holdings of U. S. liabilities. Instead, foreigners hold greater shares of their investment portfolios in the United States if they have less developed financial markets. The magnitude of this effect decreases with income per capita. Countries that trade more with the United States also have greater portfolio shares in U. S. equity and bond markets. These results support recent theoretical work on the role of financial development in sustaining global imbalances and have important implications for whether the United States can continue to attract sufficient <b>financing</b> <b>from</b> <b>abroad</b> without major changes in asset prices and returns, especially in bond markets.

30|$|Fourth, {{there is}} a {{negative}} correlation between R&D expenditure being <b>financed</b> <b>from</b> <b>abroad</b> and patents owned by foreign residents. This reflects the necessity for countries to ramp up internal financing for R&D so as to encourage local innovation.|$|R
40|$|Israel {{has been}} {{increasingly}} criticised for violating substantive democratic principles. The trigger {{was a series}} of decisions and initiatives. In July 2016, the Knesset adopted a stricter transparency law for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) <b>financed</b> <b>from</b> <b>abroad,</b> as well as a law empowering it to divest its members of their mandate. For weeks and months, government had made various suggestions for closer oversight of cultural and media institutions (for instance). There has also been repeated disapproval of Supreme Court judgements, which went hand in hand with calls for Parliament to be enabled to overrule its verdicts. These advances have had negative repercussions not just in Israel, but internationally as well. (author's abstract...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the factors influencing the globalisation of R&D, {{with a particular}} focus {{on the role of}} tax policy, using panel data for 25 OECD countries over the period 1980 - 2005. Two measures of globalisation are considered - R&D directly <b>financed</b> <b>from</b> <b>abroad</b> and R&D expenditure by affiliates of US multinational enterprises (MNEs). The econometric analysis, which controls for other determinants of inter-country differences in R&D investment, finds no evidence that host country tax policy is an important determinant of MNE location decisions or in attracting cross-border contract R&D. There is evidence that affiliate fixed capital stock and total sales are strong determinants of R&D performed by affiliates of US MNEs. Controlling for these variables, host country attributes seemed to be less important. In the case of cross-border contract R&D, host country expenditure on R&D via institutions of higher education is also found to be important.

40|$|Some theory {{suggests}} that budget deficits and greater public spending will raise real interest rates and crowd-out private investment; other {{theory suggests}} there is no effect. We attempt to test this in the Thai economy between the years 1978 and 1994. We find that budget deficits did appear to raise real interest rates during our sample period. Our estimates also suggest that, holding the deficit constant, Thai government current and construction expenditure did not raise real interest rates and that Thai government equipment expenditure lowered them. We try to explain the last result with a framework similar to Barro's (1981) but expanded to include foreign trade and borrowing. Foreign borrowing alleviates the pressure on real interest rates to rise, and, under certain conditions, allows them to fall. We find support for this hypothesis from regression results that suggest that, during our sample period, Thai government equipment expenditure was heavily <b>financed</b> <b>from</b> <b>abroad.</b> The results imply that public investment programs in developing countries that do not boost budget deficits and obtain some foreign financing may not crowd-out private investment and could be a promising means of promoting capital formation. ...|$|R

50|$|Although she {{continued}} to direct films in the 1980s, with later releases such asRacines noires and Elsie Haas, femme peintre et cinéaste d'Haiti in 1985 and Tesito in 1989, her films, often because of controverisal subject matter from a domestic viewpoint, her films were shown in Europe and rarely being shown in Senegal or Africa.After 1983 Senegalese cinema experienced a significant decline, partly {{due to lack of}} domestic funding. Directors such as Sembene were wealthy enough to continue making films, following on with Camp de Thiaroye (1987), and Guelwaar (1992) but the country lacked the domestic resources and finance needed to develop the industry and fulfill its potential. Even today in Senegal there are many cinematographers and people who have knowledge of film production, particularly in Dakar but have not the resources to develop the industry fully. Any films which have been produced since have almost entirely been <b>financed</b> <b>from</b> <b>abroad</b> and exhibited at international film festivals rather than in Senegal, which still has many cinemas standing from the golden era of the 1970s which by African standards are still advanced.Sembène would, however, continue to direct several more feature films, but only due to the ongoing investment in his films by American film companies such as New Yorker Films. In 2000 he directed Faat Kiné which provided an important critical insight into modern, post-colonial Senegal and {{the role of women in}} that society. The film addresses themes of pregnancy out of wedlock and adultery and also examines the contrasts between the middle and lower classes and poverty with the uneven distribution of wealth and modernity, and struggles in values between past and present in Senegal. Sembène directed his final film in 2004 with his feature, Moolaadé. It won awards at the Cannes Film Festival and the FESPACO Film Festival in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The film, set in a small African village in Burkina Faso, explored the controversial subject of Female circumcision.|$|R
40|$|The paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of foreign currency borrowing {{by the private sector}} in the new member states of the European Union. The authors find that striking differences in patterns of foreign currency borrowing between countries are explained by the extent to which domestic banks <b>finance</b> credit expansion <b>from</b> <b>abroad,</b> the level of deposit dollarization, and the interest rate differential. Joining the EU appears to have played an important role, by providing direct access to foreign funding, offering hedging opportunities through greater trade openness, lending credibility to exchange rate regimes, and raising expectations of imminent euro adoption. The empirical evidence suggests that regulatory policies to slow foreign currency borrowing have had only limited success. foreign currency borrowing, new EU member states, Central and Eastern Europe...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of tax laws on foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) and direct investment abroad (DIA), distinguishing in each case between investment financed by retained earnings and investment <b>financed</b> by transfers <b>from</b> <b>abroad.</b> We find that tax policy, through its effect on the rate-of-return available in the U. S., has an important effect on the international location of investment. FDI in the U. S. is very sensitive to after-tax rates-of-return available here. U. S. direct investment abroad is also affected, although to a lesser extent. We use these estimates to examine {{the effects of}} the 1981 - 82 tax changes on the international location of investment. We estimate that the tax changes lowered annual DIA by $ 0. 5 billion to $ 1. 0 billion (2 % to 4 % of its 1980 value), and raised annual FDI by $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion (11 % of 20 % of its 1980 value). We also discuss the welfare effects of tax policy toward international investment. Our results suggest that the tax effects on the international location of investment are important. Tax policies, such as ACRS andthe ITC, which raise the after tax rate-of-return on new investment without losing revenue from previous investment, not only stimulate domestic fixed investment, but also attract additional investment <b>from</b> <b>abroad.</b> The additional investment supplements the domestic investment impact on productivity and raises corporate tax revenue. However, our results should be taken as preliminary estimates, not as definitive statements about the long-run impacts of tax policy. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{comparing}} and assessing the policy measures Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus took {{in response to}} the impact of the U. S. subprime crisis (2007) and of the Great Recession (2008 – 2009). Being most dependent on cross-border capital inflows, Kazakhstan was most affected by, and reacted most intensively to, the subprime turmoil, followed by Russia. In contrast, all four countries responded to the second crisis with a panoply of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate and other measures. After sharp across-the-board devaluations in late 2008 and early 2009, and accompanying the recovery of the oil price, the currencies of the oil exporters Russia and Kazakhstan soon stabilized, whereas the currencies of the oil importers Ukraine and Belarus stayed under pressure – giving rise to intermittent interventions. Opposing – if hitherto successful – macrofinancial restabilization strategies have been conducted: Oil exporters employed their oil stabilization funds to deliver generous fiscal stimuli, whereas oil importers took recourse to IMF Stand-By Arrangements and exchange controls. With respect to the banking turmoil and restructuring since late 2007, the following can be concluded: Although measuring recapitalization costs is not unproblematic, systems dominated by state-owned banks (Russia, Belarus) appear to have fared better in precisely this time span {{in the sense that they}} have incurred less crisis-triggered recapitalization spending than systems dominated by private domestic or even foreign-owned capital (Kazakhstan, Ukraine). One of the reasons that might explain this result is the (with hindsight) excessive pre-crisis credit booms in the privately dominated banking systems, <b>financed</b> largely <b>from</b> <b>abroad,</b> coupled with the possibly even weaker rule of law outside the sphere of direct state control in the CIS region.
