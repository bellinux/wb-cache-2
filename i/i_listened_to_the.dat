He then clarified that he still believes in God, but not in religion. On June 26, 2016, Duterte said he's Christian, but also said that he believes [...] "in one god Allah".|$|E
2500|$|During the {{sessions}} for [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", Lillywhite encouraged drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. {{to use a}} click track, but Mullen was firmly against the idea. [...] A chance meeting with Andy Newmark (of Sly & the Family Stone) – a drummer who used a click track religiously – changed Mullen's mind. [...] Mullen used the click track to stay in time for other songs on the album. Mullen said of the album in a 1983 interview, [...] "I think the drumming has always been pretty simple, I don't think {{it needs to be}} flashy. For War I use a click track, something I haven't used before, it's a way of keeping time in my headphones. When <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music in time with the click track I knew I had to bring it down to the real basics. Hopefully for the next LP it will be more complicated, I'll move on. I {{think of it as a}} musical progression for myself because I learned a lot recording this album, just about my own style and that's what I wanted to do. I think there is a definite style on War where there isn't on the previous albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|McKee {{continued}} {{working on}} the song the following days. She explained, [...] "I thought about my own adolescent years, my own first love. I thought about watching Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo and Juliet' and putting on a little mini disco ball light and just dreaming of Leo. I thought about me and my friends sitting around at slumber parties in the 90's, giddy even just THINKING about boys..... I thought about what Benny said and <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> song again, and I was like The Teenagers..... that's such a great word, Teenager. It is a very descriptive word; it packs a lot of emotion and imagery into three syllables..... I couldn't believe after all of our agonizing over 'youth' themes, that we had overlooked such an obvious one – the teenage condition." [...] The following week, Perry invited McKee, Luke, and Martin to write at her hometown of Santa Barbara, California. McKee tried to approach Luke about her idea, but he was upset {{about the amount of}} time he had spent working in the chorus, so he banned them from changing it. They started {{working on the}} verses, where Perry had already prepared most of the imagery.|$|E

2500|$|Melba's first {{recordings}} {{were made}} around 1895, recorded on cylinders at the Bettini Phonograph Lab in New York. A reporter from Phonoscope magazine was impressed: [...] "The next cylinder was labelled 'Melba' and was truly wonderful, the phonograph reproducing her wonderful voice in a marvellous manner, especially the high notes which soared away above {{the staff and}} were rich and clear." [...] Melba was less impressed: [...] "'Never again,' I said to myself as <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scratching, screeching result. 'Don't tell me I sing like that, or I shall go away and live on a desert island.'" [...] The recordings never reached the general public– destroyed on Melba's orders, it is suspected– and Melba would not venture into a recording studio for another eight years. Melba can be heard singing on several Mapleson Cylinders, early attempts at live recording, made by the Metropolitan Opera House librarian Lionel Mapleson in the auditorium there during performances. These cylinders are often poor in quality, but they preserve something {{of the quality of}} the young Melba's voice and performance that is sometimes lacking from her commercial recordings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to his opposition to decentralization, the Yugoslav government removed Ranković from office in 1966 on various claims, including that he was spying on Tito. The process began with Tito ordering {{the investigation of the}} UDBA, however one of the most vocal and outspoken condemnations of Ranković came from members within the League of Communists of Serbia that was considered too extreme of a condemnation by Tito who held them in dismay, and was deeply unpopular amongst Serbs, who in general were supportive of Ranković. The major condemnation came from within the League of Communists of Serbia and particularly its provincial branch in Kosovo, the League of Communists of Kosovo, whose report declared that the security forces in Kosovo under the leadership of Ranković actively persecuted those of Albanian nationality and said that [...] "The ideological foundation of such policy under the competence of Serbia is nationalism and chauvinism." [...] Upon listening at a meeting to the claims of Rankovic's abuse of power and abuse of Albanians as reported by Veli Deva, the Secretary of Kosovo's Regional Committee; Mihailo Švabić, a Serbian member of the LCS Central Committee famously said that he was [...] "ashamed - as a communist, as a Serb, and as a man - as <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presentation of comrade Deva". Serbian Communist Spasenija Babović called for Ranković to be expelled from the party, and the LCS Central Committee agreed to this request.|$|E
2500|$|On September 16, 2013, Nipsey Hussle {{announced}} he would release a new mixtape titled, Crenshaw hosted by DJ Drama, on October 8, 2013. He explained the title saying, [...] "This is my area. This is my home town. This is really like where I {{spent a lot of}} my time as a youth. Crenshaw is a foundation to my personality and my story. It’s where it took place at." [...] He explained the mixtape consists of mostly leftover tracks, [...] "I recorded a lot of songs for the Victory Lap project, and I got a certain vision I'm going for with the project, and I just did a lot of work and I think I got what I was looking for with the Victory Lap album, and I still got a lot of great records. So I'm like, I don't wanna sit on the songs, and <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> playlist and it kinda sounded like Crenshaw, it sounded like the environment, like my upbringing. So I went in and did a couple more records, put a couple skits and just really themed it, and I'm like I'ma give them the mixtape first just to excite the streets again and remind people what the sound is, give 'em an idea of what the album might sound like. And really kinda like, create the question in their mind, 'if this is the mixtape, what is gunna be on the album?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Frames has {{received}} positive reviews. Luke Bryan of the Chicago Sun-Times extolled the album, suggesting {{that those who}} had previously been detractors of DeWyze {{would have to take}} notice as [...] "gorgeous lyrics tell one soulful story after another." [...] Jeff Dodge of BuddyTV concurred that the album was likely to win over new fans and wrote, [...] "It doesn't have the safe pop-y sounds of his debut; he's now with a record label that supports his musical efforts and he's able to showcase who he is as an artist." [...] People Magazine gave the album three stars out of four and called it [...] "a strong folk-pop effort." [...] Gerry Galipault of The Sarasota Herald-Tribune gave the album a B+, writing that DeWyze is [...] "more confident, lyrically and vocally." [...] In her review for the Daily Reporter, Kate Padilla noted a maturity in DeWyze's voice that she did not feel had been present in his previous recordings. While specifically mentioning [...] "Like I Do", [...] "Frames", and [...] "Silver Lining" [...] as some of the album's standout tracks, she also wrote that she had already listened to the album as a whole [...] "Too many times to count" [...] since it had been released a week earlier. Lamenting the album's low debut on the Billboard Album 200 Chart, Mark Franklin of The York Dispatchs blog, Idol Chatter, wrote that [...] "three of the first four songs on Frames are probably better than anything on [...] Live It Up". Joseph Brownell of David Atlanta wrote that the album contains [...] "DeWyze's most personal tracks to date" [...] and lives up to the expectations that his previous album had failed to meet, while freelance music journalist Kevin Oliver wrote on his blog that Frames [...] "may just be the most surprisingly good album ever from a past [...] winner". [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album three stars out of five, feeling that DeWyze had drawn inspiration from Mumford & Sons and The Lumineers to reinvent himself on many of the tracks. He wrote that DeWyze [...] "eagerly throws himself into the fray, roaring these songs like a true believer", but felt that the album's highlights were actually the pop songs [...] "You Don't Know Me" [...] and [...] "The Ride". In a review for Broken Records Magazine, Cindy Athanaseas called the album [...] "a brilliant piece of work" [...] by [...] "an artist whose music needs to be heard." [...] She praised DeWyze's voice, which she noted ranges from [...] "soft & tender" [...] to [...] "rough & sultry" [...] and wrote, [...] "Each song tells an individual story, but the collection of songs paints a beautiful picture of life’s highs and lows...As <b>I</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album, each song became my favorite … until I heard the next one." ...|$|E
