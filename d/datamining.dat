Nishimura was the former administrator of 2channel between 1999 and 2014, the website forming the basis for anonymous posting culture which influenced later websites such as Futaba Channel and 4chan; Nishimura lost the rights for 2channel to ex-US Army officer Jim Watkins following financial difficulties and a series of scandals involving Nishimura's alleged <b>datamining</b> and sales of 2channel personal user data to political parties.|$|E

After zooming in far enough, the imagery transitions into different imagery of the same area with finer detail, which varies in date and time from one area to the next. The imagery is retrieved from satellites or aircraft. Before the launch of NASA and the USGS's Landsat 8 satellite, Google relied partially on imagery from Landsat 7, which suffered from a hardware malfunction that left diagonal gaps in images. In 2013, Google used <b>datamining</b> to remedy the issue, providing what {{was described as a}} successor to the Blue Marble image of Earth, with a single large image of the entire planet. This was achieved by combining multiple sets of imagery taken from Landsat 7 to eliminate clouds and diagonal gaps, creating a single [...] "mosaic" [...] image. Google now uses Landsat 8 to provide imagery in a higher quality and with greater frequency.|$|E

2500|$|Radical economists point out, that a {{considerable}} portion of incomes and expenditures is not {{captured by the}} GDP concept because it falls outside the defined production boundary, while incomes/expenditures within the production boundary are allocated to categories which are substantially misleading. Not only are GDP data frequently revised after first publication, but the popular idea that GDP equals [...] "the whole economy" [...] is a fallacy. The more that the national accounts system has been revised across fifty years, and the more that economic theory and practice has changed, the less meaningful national accounts aggregates have become in capturing {{what is happening in}} reality. Analysts end up doing a lot of detailed disaggregate research to figure out what is going on, because the official national accounts aggregates don't tell them what they want to know (more detailed data is increasingly available, because official statisticians make available digital data warehouses, enabling <b>datamining).</b> The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard national accounts tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of capital finance, but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA national accounts were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things because who exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} related to the trend of the {{industrial}} internet of things. There exists a fair number of product and service examples where a manufacturer has a need for usage data harvesting. The gathered usage data can be used, e. g., in product development. In this thesis the product is mining equipment and its maintenance. Sending the data straight from the mining equipment to the manufacturer is problematic, since mines often lack Internet connection. In some cases mines have local area networks, but in other cases those are not available. The only method of gathering the data can be transportating via USB flash drives or similar. The way the data is moved with the flash drive from the mining equipment to a location with Internet connection is called aided mine network. This location can be, e. g., an office building near the mining area. The core problem of the thesis is the gathering, moving, and synchronization of the usage data using the aided mine network. In this thesis, a plan to implement the gathering of the data is developed. The solution is called <b>DATAMiNe,</b> i. e., Data Aggregation Through Aided Mine Network. The network consists of three parts. The parts are a Manager, an Edge Relay, and a Data Aggregator. <b>DATAMiNe's</b> architecture is designed so that it supports an easy replacement of the aided mine network. Replacement can be a local area network, or an integrated Internet connection in the mining equipment. A communication protocol between the Manager and the Edge Relay is designed so that it supports the special needs of the aided mine network. The development of <b>DATAMiNe</b> starts with an initial plan, which bases on the mining equipment manufacturer's vision, and use cases about unified data gathering into a single Data Aggregator. <b>DATAMiNe</b> is developed by ordinary software design methods, by programming a proof of concept test software, and finally by verifying a protocol with the Spin tools. With Spin, it is possible to formally check the interaction between connected state automata. All development steps play a part towards the next implementation phase. That is, the production implementation. The verification model forces attention to the details that otherwise would be ignored in the design phase. The test program implementation helps to choose the cost effective ways in the design...|$|R

Based on data collected from <b>datamining</b> an 'ordinary individual' (everyman) can be constructed (modeled) to develop the best strategy for selling to consumers. Reader models are used by corporations to direct consumer behaviour to their products. Marketing, advertising, and product placement use reader models as a central part of their planning and source the reader model by using focus groups. In plain language a reader model is used by corporations to predict who will buy the better mousetrap. The 'everyman' is used by commercial musicians, writers, and the movie industry trying to make money from a product that will appeal to a mass audience. These industries use the reader model to try to gauge and predict the consumer market in an effort to create and profit from a hit single, best seller, or a box office hit movie. A well-known example is the success of Jaws (novel), the Jaws (film), and the theme music Jaws (soundtrack).|$|E
