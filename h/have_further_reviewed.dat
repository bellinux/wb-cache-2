40|$|Neurodegenerative {{disorders}} {{are not only}} characterized by specific patterns of cell loss but the presence and accumulation of various pathological proteins—both of which correlate with disease evolution. There is now mounting {{evidence to suggest that}} these pathological proteins present with toxic, at times prion-like, properties and can therefore seed pathology in neighboring as well remotely connected healthy neurons as they spread across the brain. What is less clear, at this stage, is how much this actually contributes to, and drives, the core pathogenic events. In this review, we present a comprehensive, up-to-date summary of the reported in vitro studies that support the spreading and seeding capacities of pathological proteins, with an emphasis on mutant huntingtin protein in the context of Huntington's disease, although in vivo work remains to be performed to validate this theory in this particular disease. We <b>have</b> <b>further</b> <b>reviewed</b> these findings in light of their potential implications for the development of novel therapeutic approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{to gain an}} understanding of the speed of entry into high-tech industries by "latecomers," private and national firms from late-industrializing countries. While entry is traditionally measured with R&D performance, we have approached it from the perspective of skill formation. Accordingly, we have investigated how some latecomers have quickly learned new skills and connected their existing technical knowledge with a new stock of knowledge, defining the speedy (latecomer) entrant as the first latecomer (for an initial entry) and the first-to-market (for subsequent entries), respectively. Specifically, we have conceptualized that a fast entry requires a continuous search for new markets and adaptation to a new environment. In this regard, the speed of entry into the high-tech industries, based on the experience in the mid-tech industries, indicates of dynamic capability and, accordingly, becomes a competitive asset in the context of late-industrializing countries. Theories in economics, management, or geography, which our hypotheses for speed of entry are drawn from, have explained factors or mechanism that enable a firm to perform better. We have first examined how literature envisages the effects of business groups, a form of firms prevalent particularly in late-industrializing countries, in association with speed of entry. However, relevant theories tend to compete and the overall theoretical predictions are not clear. Second, we <b>have</b> <b>further</b> <b>reviewed</b> literature in technology management and expected integration to occur both externally and internally when entry is executed. Third, given that the relevant theories highlight geographic proximity for generating externalities, we have suggested different measurements of geographic proximity for international learning, a distance from the headquarters of the partner firm and an international joint venture. (cont.) Based on the literature review, we have postulated that business groups, integration capability, and geographic proximity are significantly associated with the speed of entry by latecomers and have constructed three hypotheses: H 1. Speed of entry by latecomers is related to business groups; H 2. Speed of entry by latecomers is related to integration capability; and H 3. Speed of entry by latecomers is moderated by the relationship between their integration capability and geographic proximity. In order to test these hypotheses, we have adopted two methodologies, which are case study and regression analysis. Next, we have selected the thin film transistor liquid crystal diode (TFT-LCD) and wireless handsets industries. The TFT-LCD and wireless handset industries tend to have complementary features: TFT-LCD has a relatively short history compared to other electronics industries and is capital-intensive. In contrast, the wireless handsets are consumer goods and connected with the telecommunication service industry. Reviewing the histories of both industries, we have identified latecomer entrants and have subsequently collected their data by accessing available archives and interviewing managers and engineers. From the case studies, we have found in the fast latecomers several interesting points regarding entry dynamics: first, the owners of these latecomers continuously tried to upgrade their industrial technologies into more sophisticated ones by closely benchmarking the Japanese firms. Second, the fast latecomers mobilized managerial know-how from their firms and properly redeployed it to the necessary posts. Third, while managerial knowledge was possible to acquire within a firm, technical knowledge had to be externally supplied; but acquisition of the updated technical knowledge was extremely difficult. Fourth, due to the difficulties, latecomers accessed whatever sources they could and used whatever channels were available. (cont.) Therefore, no single path to acquiring the necessary knowledge was dominant. Unique aspects in skill formation and knowledge acquisition by latecomers have also been observed: while acquiring technical knowledge from outside sources, both the first latecomer and the first-to-market successfully relocated their skills from prior industries to the new ones quickly, for example, from semiconductor manufacturing to TFT-LCD or from beeper/car phone/cordless phone manufacturing to wireless handsets. Finally, in the TFT-LCD industry, the first latecomer and the first-to-market took advantage of business cycles and aggressively increased capital investment during downturns. In the wireless handset industry, these latecomers, associated with the government research institute, developed an alternative communication technology and quickly mass-produced it. However, not all counter-cycle investment strategies by latecomers in the TFT-LCD industry succeeded. Similarly, not all governmental efforts to incubate technologies were successful. Based on findings from case studies, we have also empirically tested our hypotheses. A brief summary of our regression analysis is that our first hypothesis is partially supported. The factors related to business groups are not necessarily significantly related to becoming the first latecomer or to making subsequent entries (the first-to-market performance) fast. In contrast, our second hypothesis is supported. The result indicates that the first latecomer performance and the first-to-market performance require different types of integration capability. Specifically, becoming the first latecomer is determined by efficiency in external learning, while the speed of subsequent product entries is driven primarily by internal efficiency. (cont.) We interpret that the relative weight of external learning may decrease over time, once a latecomer has entered. Finally, our third hypothesis is partially supported. Geographic proximity to the headquarters of the partner firm increases speed of entry, perhaps by facilitating communication and diffusing best practices, but international joint venture between a latecomer and a leading incumbent firm does not necessarily enhance integration with sources and does not expedite speed of entry. by Jooyoung Kwak.

40|$|UK Policy for the {{certification}} {{and operation of}} UAV Systems, both military and civil, {{was first published in}} CAP 722 [1] in May 2002. Under this policy, the principles established for civil manned aircraft are extended to civil UAV systems, including the need for system to be certificated to a code of airworthiness and organisations involved in the design, manufacture, maintenance or operation of a civil UAV system to be approved for the purpose. Since publishing CAP 722, the CAA <b>has</b> <b>further</b> <b>reviewed</b> and developed its UAV policy, both in the light of recent experiences {{and as a result of}} changes in regulatory responsibilities since the formation of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The regulations governing civil UAV Systems below 150 kg have in particular been targeted in this review, as the responsibility for both airworthiness and operations remains vested with national aviation authorities. The CAA also recognised that this category of UAV has potential for early applications, and yet may find difficulty in complying with the principles of CAP 722. To address civil light UAV Systems, the UK CAA has developed a new policy, and it is this policy that is the subject of this paper. The UK Light UAV Systems Policy will ensure that acceptable safety standards are maintained whilst providing a route for the routine operation of light civil UAV Systems. Exemptions to UK national regulations may be granted to civil UAV Systems that can demonstrate compliance with the policy and show equivalence in terms of safety risk to existing model aircraft. Not all civil UAVs below 150 kg will meet the applicability criteria or qualify for an exemption under the Light UAV Systems policy. For those UAVs, the general policy contained in CAP 722 will still apply. 1...|$|R
