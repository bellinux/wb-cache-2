5|$|Several {{features}} of the tooth are only known <b>from</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the family Dromaeosauridae of theropod dinosaurs.

It is unlikely that a genus would survive for 60million years; Dromaeosauroides lived during the Early Cretaceous, and Dromaeosaurus during the Late Cretaceous. The differences between their denticles also indicate they should be kept separate.|$|E
