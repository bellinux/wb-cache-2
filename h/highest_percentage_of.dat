40|$|This brief {{considers}} {{whether the}} concentration of beginning teachers in a district {{is associated with the}} district 2 ̆ 7 s poverty rate, racial composition, or urbanicity. Authors Douglas Gagnon and Marybeth Mattingly report that poor communities have moderately <b>higher</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> beginning teachers than communities with lower poverty rates and that a higher concentration of minority students in a district is associated with a <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> beginning teachers. Large cities, remote towns, and rural districts have <b>higher</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> beginning teachers than midsized-small cities, suburbs, and fringe-distant town districts. The combined impact of poverty, race, and urbanicity has a substantial effect on the probability that a district has a critically <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> beginning teachers. A <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> beginning teachers likely reflects higher teacher turnover in the district, and could suggest issues of teacher quality. The brief uses combined data from the 2009 - 2010 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), the 2009 Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), and the 2010 U. S.
