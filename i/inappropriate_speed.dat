40|$|Speed {{is a major}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} accidents. Several studies indicate that speed is a contributing factor in about 30 % of all accidents. It is however {{not so easy to}} make firm statements on simple accident causes, because in a majority of accidents more factors are involved. Drivers driving above existing speed limits are using 'excess' speeds. Excess speeds are strongly related to accident risk. However, drivers driving below a speed limit may still drive too fast for the conditions. Such drivers drive at 'inappropriate speeds'. By definition these <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speeds</b> correlate perfectly with accident risks and it is to be preferred to work with <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speeds.</b> A safe speed can be a speed below an existing limit. But in practice it is hardly possible to establish which speed is appropriate and which speed has to be considered as <b>inappropriate.</b> Excess <b>speed</b> is used almost always in speed policies and in related research for practical reasons. A lot of literature is available on the speed problem. (Author/publisher...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The full {{proceedings}} of ESV 2009 are freely available at: [URL] involving either illegal or <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speeding</b> {{play a part}} in a large proportion of accidents involving cars. The types of typical failure generating scenarios found in car accidents where illegal <b>speeding</b> or <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speeding</b> is contributory are compared using the detailed human functional failure methodology developed in the European TRACE project (TRaffic Accident Causation in Europe), funded by the European Commission. Using on-scene cases from the UK ‘On The Spot’ database (funded by the UK Department for Transport and Highways Agency), a sample of cases where speed is contributory have been analysed. An overview of speeding cases from the 4, 000 in-depth cases available in the dataset is also presented. The results highlight not only the differences between <b>inappropriate</b> and illegal <b>speeding</b> cases, but also the differences in the functional failures experienced by both the ‘at fault’ and ‘not at fault’ road users in both types of speed-related accidents. The results form a unique base of knowledge for future work on the human-related issues associated with speeding of both types, for all crash participants. Also considered is how new technologies can address speeding accidents...|$|R
50|$|According to {{the police}} report, the crash was caused due to <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speed</b> for the very rainy weather, and an {{investigation}} into possible manslaughter was opened.

50|$|When using {{overdrive}} gearing, the car's {{engine speed}} drops, reducing wear and normally saving fuel. Since 1981 U.S. corporate {{average fuel economy}} (CAFE) legislation, virtually all domestic vehicles have included overdrive to save fuel. One should refer to the car's owner's manual for the proper speed to run at overdrive. All engines have a range of peak efficiency and it is possible for the use of overdrive to keep the engine out of this range for {{all or part of the}} time of its use if used at <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speeds,</b> thus cutting into any fuel savings from the lower engine speed.|$|R

On behalf of the Department for Transport, TRL has developed and tested alternative traffic calming techniques that make greater use of psychological (non-physical) measures, but are intended to still have a significant speed-reducing capability. Psychological theories that provide insight into how specific road design measures might reduce driving speeds are reviewed. Ideas for traffic calming based on these principles are illustrated using photomontage and evaluated by means of focus groups, a questionnaire survey, on the TRL Driving Simulator and finally in on-road trials...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, a {{considerable}} amount of lives lost in traffic accidents is due to <b>inappropriate</b> vehicle <b>speed</b> or <b>inappropriate</b> headway.

In addition, rear-end and chain accidents, which are mainly caused by inappropriate headways, altogether account for another 15 % of all road accidents. In order to improve driving safety it is therefore of great importance to develop an intelligent system that helps the driver in reducing risky and dangerous situations related to the aforementioned factors.

40|$|Measures {{for speed}} {{management}} {{are essential for}} limiting {{the negative effects of}} driving too fast and at <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speeds.</b> To begin with, safe and credible speed limits need to be determined. Dynamic and variable speed limits that take into account the current circumstances, such as weather conditions and traffic situation, can be of use here. In addition, it is important that road users always know the local speed limit. Increasingly, this can be achieved by in-vehicle information. Where necessary, local infrastructural measures such as speed humps must be used to enforce a safe speed. These infrastructural measures require a logical location and good implementation. This approach will put a stop to most speeding offences. Enforcement remains essential for the group of drivers that continues to speed. Public information campaigns and education should accompany all these measures and, in a more general sense, inform road users about the importance of speed management. Furthermore, a large effect on safety is expected of Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) ...|$|R
40|$|Perception sensors (cameras, laser, radar…) {{are being}} {{introduced}} into certain vehicles. These sensors {{have been designed}} to operate within a wide range of situations and conditions (weather, luminosity, etc.) with a prescribed set of variation thresholds. Effectively detecting when a given operating threshold has been surpassed constitutes a key parameter in the creation of driving assistance systems that meet required reliability levels. With this context in mind, an atmospheric visibility measurement system may be capable of quantifying the most common operating range of onboard exteroceptive sensors. Such information comes handy to adapt the way the sensors are operated, and the way the data they record is processed, or to warn the driver that the onboard assistance system is momentarily inoperative. Moreover, a system capable of either detecting the presence of fog or estimating visibility distances constitutes in itself a driving aid, because people actually tend to overestimate headway distances in foggy weather [1], and to drive at <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speeds.</b> In the framework of the French project ARCOS [2], we have developed such a system using onboard CCD cameras, devoted to the first type of the previously mentioned applications.

40|$|<b>Inappropriate</b> <b>speed</b> and {{speeding}} {{are among}} the highest causes of crashes in the heavy vehicle industry. Truck drivers are subjected to {{a broad range of}} influences on their behaviour including industrial pressures, company monitoring and police enforcement. Further, drivers have a high level of autonomy over their own behaviour. As such {{it is important to understand}} how these external influences interact with commonly shared beliefs, attitudes and values of heavy vehicle drivers to influence their behaviour. The present study uses a re-conceptualisation of safety culture to explore the behaviours of driving at an <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speed</b> and speeding in the heavy vehicle industry. A series of case studies, consisting of interviews and ride-along observations, were conducted with three transport organisations to explore the effect of culture on safety in the heavy vehicle industry. Results relevant to <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speed</b> are reported and discussed. It was found that organisational management through monitoring, enforcement and payment, police enforcement, customer standards and vehicle design factors could all reduce the likelihood of driving at inappropriate speeds under some circumstances. However, due to weaknesses in the ability to accurately monitor appropriate speed, this behaviour was primarily influenced by cultural beliefs, attitudes and values. Truck drivers had a tendency to view speeding as relatively safe, had a desire to speed to save time and increase personal income, and thus often attempted to speed without detection. When drivers saw speeding as dangerous, however, they were more likely to drive safely. Implications for intervention are discussed...|$|E
30|$|Finally, it is {{interesting}} to note that drivers wishing higher speed limits in built up areas are those breaking speed limits more often. <b>Inappropriate</b> <b>speed</b> limits are common justifications of all those breaking speed limits; this was fortunately found significant only for urban roads. This finding leads to the conclusion that in non urban roads all those exceeding speed limits are aware that they are breaking limits they consider appropriate.|$|E
40|$|Speed {{has been}} {{identified}} {{for a long time}} as a key risk factor in road traffic: <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speeds</b> contribute to a relevant part of traffic accidents. Many literature studies have focused on the relationship between speed and accident risk. Starting from this consideration this paper investigates traffic accident risk by analysing the travelling speeds recorded by real tests on the road. A survey was conducted to collect experimental speed values in a real context. A specific road segment, belonging to an Italian rural two-lane road, was repeatedly run by 27 drivers in order to collect the instantaneous speed values for each trajectory. Smartphone-equipped vehicles were used to record continuous speed data. The recorded data were used to calculate: the average speed, 50 th and 85 th percentile speed for each geometric element of the analysed road segment. The main result of the research is the classification of car users’ driving behaviour based on the speed values. By using the above mentioned ranges of speed, the classification provides three types of driving behaviour: safe, unsafe, and safe but potentially dangerous. It was found that only four drivers feature “safe” behaviour, driving in a safe manner on most of the road elements. However, the major part of drivers, even if they feature safe behaviour, could be dangerous for other drivers because they drive at very low speeds...|$|R
40|$|Excessive and <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speeding</b> is [...] {{according}} to the ACPO 2 Road Policing Strategy [...] {{one of the four}} key behaviours which contribute to avoidable deaths and injury by making collisions more likely, and by making the resultant injuries worse. 3 Although the imposition of a specific speed limit is a matter for legisla-tion 4 (either primary or in regulations and orders), the enforcement of those limits is an operational matter for the police force involved. Since the Road Traffic Act 1991, increasing reliance has been placed on the use of automatic devices for detecting speeding offences. 5 One of these devices, the speed camera, does not enjoy universal popularity; its use tends to evoke strong emotive feelings whether they are of support or condemnation. The camera detects and gathers the initial evidence which is then used to initiate the process of prosecution and punishment. A fixed penalty ticket procedure is available for offences of speeding detected by a camera, and it is common for the alleged offender never to experience any form of real human interaction with the prosecuting authorities from the moment of offending through to the conclusion, whatever that may be. 6 The details of the offence are provided by the output of the machine and it is the machine that proves the facts of the offence.

30|$|Speeding is {{considered}} one of the principal determinants of traffic safety affecting not only the risk of being involved in a road accident but also the severity of the consequences of these accidents [19, 22, 27, 28]. The establishment of safe speed limits has contributed to the reduction of fatal accidents and accidents with serious trauma, nonetheless speeding remains on the top of the accidents’ causality list [17, 32]. It is also reported that compliance with speed limits is positively related to improvement of traffic safety [7, 23]. In addition, the understanding of the behaviour to exceed speed limits may be also useful for the development of the necessary regulations to reduce <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speed</b> choice [4, 20, 21]. The factors that compose the speeding issue are related to social attitudes and road behaviours as well as the road and vehicle characteristics [8, 11, 29].

40|$|Abstract—Speeding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} contributing factors in traffic crashes. The prediction of speeding is important for reducing excessive speeds and preventing speeding-related traffic accidents and injuries. Speeding (either intentional or unintentional) is a consequence of <b>inappropriate</b> <b>speed</b> control. This work extends a previous mathematical model of driver speed control to provide quantitative predictions of intentional and unintentional speeding. These predictions consist of the time at which the driver exceeds the speed limit and the magnitude of speeding. Based on these modeling predictions, this work develops an intelligent speeding prediction system (ISPS) to prevent the occurrence of speeding. An experimental study using a driving simulator is conducted to evaluate ISPS. We find no significant difference between modeled predictions and experimental results in terms of the time and magnitude of intentional speeding. Also, ISPS can successfully predict the majority of unintentional speeding instances, with only a small portion of unnecessary speeding warnings (false alarms). Applications of the ISPS to reducing driving speed, and preventing the real-time occurrence of speeding and speeding-related traffic accidents are discussed.

40|$|Due to {{the massive}} {{character}} of <b>speeding</b> and <b>inappropriate</b> travel <b>speeds,</b> speed management {{continues to be an}} important and challenging policy area. Estimates are that in about a quarter to one third of fatal crashes excessive speeds are involved, making speed one of the crucial factors in road safety. Management of speeds of drivers of motorized vehicles has a high safety potential. Until now this has been done mostly by road design, setting speed limits, and enforcing these limits. Speed limits should be safe and credible. Speed enforcement is reported to be effective (5 - 35 % reduction in casualties) and cost-beneficial. Use of modern technologies, such as safety cameras, laser guns, section control, etc., have made speed enforcement more effective and efficient. In the future, new intelligent vehicle technology will create new possibilities for speed management. This new technology can operate independent of, or integrated with, police checks. This paper reviews the scientific evidence about the effects of modern speed enforcement methods and discusses some new technologies for speed management and their potential impact on crashes.

50|$|The {{intensity}} of the vibration refers to the amplitude {{and the frequency of}} the vibration. It can affect the screening performance in many aspects. Amplitude is defined as the distance travelled by the screen in one circle. In the Tumbler Screening case, the screening is moving in three dimensions. The movement of the particles is determined by the vibration. <b>Inappropriate</b> vibration <b>speed</b> will lead to segregation, resulting in uneven distribution of the particles on the screen. Small particles will be over oversized particles and not being sieved. This will decrease the screening efficiency significantly. Another reason why vibration intensity is important is that it will affect the contacts number of particles with screening. If the vibrating speed is too fast, the particle will go forward along the screen, reducing the possibility that the particles will pass through. But a high number of contact attempts will increase the screening effect as the residual time of the particles will be reduced. When the screen is moving too slow, it will cause fluctuation, which will decrease the efficiency. The common speed range is 180 to 280 min-1, and the common amplitude applied to the screener is 60 to 80 mm horizontally and 5 to 40 mm vertically.|$|R
