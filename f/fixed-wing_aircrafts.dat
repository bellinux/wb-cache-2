The <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts</b> rely {{mainly on}} thrust {{generated}} by engine and lift produced by wings to keep flying, {{so there are}} strict requirements on their speeds and angle of attack. The flappers can hover freely {{in the air like}} insects because they have different flight principles and forms compared with <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> The flapper is consisted of the flapping-wing, the flapping-wing mechanism and the drive. The flapping-wing is used to generate lifts and thrusts while the wing mechanism and the drive provide main power to the flapping wing. Traditionally, flapper uses rigid wing to provide lift and thrust force. The researches of the insect flapping wing process indicate insect wings would produce certain flexibility and umbrella effect in this process. Based on the above research, the compression molding is employed to manufacture the bionic flexible wing in this article. What’s more, in order to imitate the umbrella deformations at the wing tips, IPMC (Ionic Polymer Metal-Composites) are fixed on the flexible wings to achieve umbrella deformations...|$|E

We have developed a method for the detection of both generic flight neighbouring aircrafts and those on a collision course. Our approach employs a sliding window linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature representation. An extension of this approach to the spatio-temporal domain is also considered and we demonstrate its advantage for the detection of aircrafts on a collision path. We evaluated our approach for the detection of both small rotorcraft and larger <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts</b> in challenging video sequences. Our results show that aircrafts on a collision course can be detected more reliably than when assuming a generic flight path. This is very interesting in practice, since this case is of critical importance. We also show that our spatio-temporal approach improves the detection accuracy with respect to conventional singleframe approaches. ...|$|E

Some of the popular examples of such robots include unmanned aerial ve-hicles/systems (UAV/UAS), be it conventional <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts</b> (CTOL- a con-ventional take-off and landing vehicle), various rotorcrafts, such as single, or multi-rotor helicopters (VTOL- a {{vertical take-off and landing}} vehicle), autonomous un-derwater vehicles (AUV), unmanned cars (UGV- a unmanned ground vehicle), or unattended ground sensors (UGS), such as various acoustic, seismic and chemical sensors, or cameras.

40|$|Fram Strait is {{the main}} gateway for sea ice export out of the Arctic Ocean, and {{therefore}} observations there give insight into the composition and properties of Arctic sea ice in general and how it varies over time. A data set of ground-based and airborne electromagnetic ice thickness measurements collected during summer between 2001 and 2012 is presented here, including long transects well into {{the southern part of}} the Transpolar Drift obtained using <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> The primary source of the surveyed sea ice leaving Fram Strait is the Laptev Sea and its age has decreased from 3 to 2  years between 1990 and 2012. The thickness data consistently also show a general thinning of sea ice for the last decade, with a decrease in modal thickness of second year and multiyear ice, and a decrease in mean thickness and fraction of ice thicker than 3 m. Local melting in the strait was investigated in two surveys performed in the downstream direction, showing a decrease in sea ice thickness of 0. 19 m degree − 1 latitude south of 81 ° N. Further north variability in ice thickness is more related to differences in age and deformation. The thickness observations were combined with ice area export estimates to calculate summer volume fluxes of sea ice. While satellite data show that monthly ice area export had positive trends since 1980 (10. 9   ×[*] 10 3 km 2 decade − 1), the summer (July and August) ice area export is low with high uncertainties. The average volume export amounts to 16. 78 km 3. Naturally, the volume flux estimates are limited to the period when airborne thickness surveys are available. Nevertheless, we could show that the combination of satellite data and airborne observations can be used to determine volume fluxes through Fram Strait and as such, can be used to bridge the lack of satellite-based sea ice thickness information in summer...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} to {{implementing}} an autopilot system on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) involves first to characterize the UAV’s dynamics using a mathematical model. To accomplish this accurately for the particular UAV, the process of system identification, which is the estimation of {{the parameters of the}} equation of motion, is essential. However, experimental data is generally noisy and thus presents a challenging problem. In this research project, we are presented with several sets of flight test data of the UAV (a quarter scale model of a Cessna 182) and we wish to provide an accurate estimation of the system model parameters. Specifically, we apply and compare several different machine learning algorithms to the flight data including General Least Squares, Coordinate Descent, Recursive Estimation with Gaussian Noise, and Learn-Lagged-Linear. It is customary to evaluate a dynamic model by comparing its simulated state trajectories with experimental state trajectories. As a result, the dynamic models computed here are evaluated based on how well the simulated model trajectories compare with the flight data. Finally, an algorithm is suggested as a basis for in-flight updating of the system dynamics model in pseudo-real-time. 1 Vehicle Dynamical Model In order to perform system identification, it is necessary to start first with an intended model of the system. Flight dynamics of <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts</b> are reasonably well understood and there exist many literatures on the topic such as [1] and [2]. As suggested by [2], the dynamics in general are characterized by a set of non-linear differential equations in 8 states. However, under special circumstances and with specific assumptions, such {{as in the case of}} straight and steady flight, these equations of motion can be decoupled into lateral and longitudinal dynamics involving 4 states each.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{aerodynamic}} airfoils are optimized for certain conditions. For instance, {{the shape of}} the wings of <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts</b> are designed and optimized for a certain flight condition (in terms of altitude, speed, aircraft weight, etc.). However, these flight conditions vary significantly during the flight. Currently, aircraft are provided with control surfaces such as flaps, slat and ailerons, normally governed by powerful but heavy hydraulic mechanisms. These moving parts allow the aircraft to fly under many different flight conditions, although usually with non-optimal performance. Moreover, these mechanisms introduce hinges and surface discontinuities between parts which cause undesirable effects such as turbulences and noise or a decrease of the lift-to-drag ratio. This issue motivates the research and development of the so-called ‘morphing aircraft’ or ‘morphing wings’. Ideally, a morphing aircraft is able to modify quickly the shape of its wings in-flight, thus reaching optimum aerodynamic performance under any flight condition. This idea is applicable to any other aerospace applications such as rotorcraft or wind turbines. Morphing applied to aerodynamic airfoils brings along interesting benefits: reduction of mechanical fatigue which has a special importance in wind turbines and rotorcrafts (by minimizing vibrations on the structure), reduction of the wing root bending moment, reduction of fuel consumption of flying machines and increase of the performance of wind turbines by increasing the lift-to-drag ratio of the wings or blades, and the reduction of generated noise. This dissertation gives an introduction on the concept of morphing applied to aerodynamic airfoils and describes the benefits and challenges brought by morphing structures. Subsequently, the potential of smart materials to develop novel actuation systems is introduced. The description of the motivation for this work leads to the purpose of this research, which aims at developing a prototype of a general-purpose morphing flat surface based on embedded shape memory alloy wires with increased working frequency for morphing airfoils. In order to achieve this purpose, the research is divided into two research objectives. The first research objective is to develop a profound understanding of the behaviour of shape memory alloys (SMAs) and, subsequently, to devise a method to increase their actuation frequency. The second research objective is to develop novel control algorithms and actuator technology as well as an integration technology for the SMA wires with increased actuation frequency. Following the introduction, this thesis describes the potential of smart materials in general, and SMAs in particular, to develop novel smart actuators for morphing wings. The main differences between conventional and smart actuators are explained together with their advantages and introduced challenges in terms of design and control. The selection of SMAs is justified as the best candidates to achieve the research objectives. A detailed description, working principles, features, capabilities, limitations and applications of SMA based actuators is given as well. In order to fulfill the first research objective, a series of logical steps were followed. Once the requirements of the SMA based actuator were stated, a commercial SMA wire was chosen and characterized (i. e., the phase diagram of the SMA wire was obtained) which shows the phase composition of the SMA when it is subjected to different levels of stress and temperature. The phase diagram was obtained from data collected from isothermal, isobaric and differential scanning calorimeter tests. During an isothermal test, the temperature is kept constant and the SMA wire is subjected to increasing and decreasing levels of stress in order to find those stresses at which the SMA’s phase transforms. Similarly, an isobaric test keeps the stress on the SMA constant over time and the temperature is increased and decreased to find those at which the SMA’s phase transforms. Subsequently, the functional fatigue of the SMA wire was studied by training the SMA wire. This training process consist in applying repetitive heating and cooling cycles in an isobaric configuration. High repeatability was found on the results. After an average of 7289 training cycles, the wire was able to recover only 77 % of its original recoverable length for the tested conditions of applied current, heating time, cooling time and applied stress. Subsequently, an SMA model for SMA wires is implemented in a finite element analysis software. The equations that describe the model and their physical meaning are explained. One of the advantages of the chosen model is the ease of obtaining the parameters required by the model, which can be obtained from a few experiments. In addition, and also {{as a part of the}} model’s required parameters, the characteristics of the forced cooling system are studied here, and the heat transfer coefficient of such airflow for different airflow rates is measured. Finally, the model is satisfactorily validated. One of the limitations of SMA based actuators is their poor actuation frequency (usually lower than 0. 1 Hz). This is due to the fact that they are thermally activated, normally by Joule heating, which is a quick process. However, they must be cooled before the next actuation cycle, which normally happens by natural convection. This cooling process can be accelerated by means of active cooling systems. In this research, an active cooling airflow at room temperature is used. The effects of applying different heating and cooling rates on the time that it takes for the wire to contract and elongate (respectively) were experimentally measured using an isobaric configuration. In addition, the same experiments were simulated by the model for SMA wires implemented previously. There is an overall quantitative disagreement between the results yielded by the simulations and by the experiments. However, the results are useful qualitatively. It is found that the contracting and the cooling times are significantly decreased as the applied power and airflow is increased. More importantly, it is found that when the wire works at low working frequencies, the heating rate is the limiting factor whereas the cooling rate is the limiting factor when it works at high working frequencies. In addition, these experiments show that increasing the level of applied stress results in slightly higher working frequencies of the SMA wire. The knowledge acquired in the previous experiments and simulations leads to the development of a method to improve the attainable actuation frequency of the SMA wires. This method is based on the idea that, in many SMA based applications, the SMA wires do not work throughout their full recoverable strain but they work only within a portionofit. Taking advantage of the nonlinearity of the strain-temperature relationship for SMAs, the method proposed here is able to increase the SMA’s actuation frequency by three and a half times just by making the SMA wire work within the most suitable range of strains, without varying the heating, cooling and stress conditions. The development of this method fulfills the first research objective. Later on in this thesis, the design, manufacturing and assembling processes of the SMA based actuator as well as their challenges are detailed. First, a beam-like module of the SMA based actuator was conceived, designed and manufactured. Subsequently, the design was expanded in the spanwise direction, thus obtaining a modular SMA based actuator that forms a morphing plate. The morphing plate was tested by heating the SMA wires embedded in the actuator. This test revealed an unexpected behaviour of the plate. The expected behaviour was that it would bend upwards when the wires on the top side were heated. However, instead of bending uniformly along the spanwise direction, the center of the plate bended upwards and the sides downwards. A similar response was observed when the wires on the bottom side were heated. This was found to be caused by inhomogeneous thermal expansion (in the spanwise direction) through the thickness of the plate. Due to the unexpected response observed on the morphing plate, a single beamlike module SMA based actuator was controlled under two different control strategies, fuzzy logic control (FLC) and proportional-integrative-derivative (PID) control. In both cases, the SMA based actuator was made to track sinusoidal and step signals in order to measure its performance. The overall performance of the system under FLC is better than that under PID. Under FLC, it reaches actuation frequencies above 0. 6 Hz for working at amplitudes of up to 6 mm, and frequencies above 1 Hz for amplitudes of up to 3 mm while tracking the reference signal accurately (maintaining relative error below 10 %). Under PID control, it reaches actuation frequencies above 0. 5 Hz when working at amplitudes up to 3 mm, and frequencies above 0. 7 Hz for amplitudes up to 2 mm. The actuator is able to track step signals (that is, to reach and maintain a constant deflection over time) under both types of controller, although under FLC it is significantly more stable. These developed design, manufacture, assembly and control methods fulfill the second research objective. This thesis presents novel methods aiming to increase the accuracy and actuation frequency of SMA based actuators. In particular, this work is focused on the development of a morphing surface intended to be integrated in morphing airfoils. However, the methods and ideas developed in this research are applicable to other SMA based applications, especially those which require fast, cyclic and accurate actuation.
