5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. <b>In</b> <b>plants,</b> RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; <b>in</b> <b>plants,</b> miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E
5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). <b>In</b> <b>plants,</b> cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur <b>in</b> <b>plants,</b> C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E

40|$|Herbivory is a {{fundamental}} process that controls primary producer abundance and regulates energy and nutrient flows to higher trophic levels. Despite the recent proliferation of small-scale studies on herbivore effects on aquatic plants, there remains limited understanding {{of the factors that}} control consumer regulation of vascular <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> aquatic ecosystems. Our current knowledge of the regulation of primary producers has hindered efforts to understand the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and to manage such ecosystems effectively. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the outcomes of plant-herbivore interactions using a data set comprised of 326 values from 163 studies, in order to test two mechanistic hypotheses: first, that greater negative changes <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance would be associated with higher herbivore biomass densities; second, that the magnitude of changes <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance would vary with herbivore taxonomic identity. We found evidence that plant abundance declined with increased herbivore density, with plants eliminated at high densities. Significant between-taxa differences in impact were detected, with insects associated with smaller reductions <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance than all other taxa. Similarly, birds caused smaller reductions <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance than echinoderms, fish, or molluscs. Furthermore, larger reductions <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance were detected for fish relative to crustaceans. We found a positive relationship between herbivore species richness and change <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance, with the strongest reductions <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance reported for low herbivore species richness, suggesting that greater herbivore diversity may protect against large reductions <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance. Finally, we found that herbivore-plant nativeness was a key factor affecting the magnitude of herbivore impacts on plant abundance across a wide range of species assemblages. Assemblages comprised of invasive herbivores and native plant assemblages were associated with greater reductions <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance compared with invasive herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and invasive plants, native herbivores and mixed-nativeness plants, and native herbivores and native plants. By contrast, assemblages comprised of native herbivores and invasive plants were associated with lower reductions <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance compared with both mixed-nativeness herbivores and native plants, and native herbivores and native plants. However, the effects of herbivore-plant nativeness on changes <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> abundance were reduced at high herbivore densities. Our mean reductions <b>in</b> aquatic <b>plant</b> abundance are greater than those reported in the literature for terrestrial plants, but lower than aquatic algae. Our findings highlight the need for a substantial shift in how biologists incorporate plant-herbivore interactions into theories of aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning. Currently, the failure to incorporate top-down effects continues to hinder our capacity to understand and manage the ecological dynamics of habitats that contain aquatic plants...|$|R
