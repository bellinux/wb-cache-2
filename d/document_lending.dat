Preparations and needs for introducing information technology before 1982 are also mentioned. In 1982 the historic decision for cooperation with the University of Maribor Computer Centre on the field of software development was made. It was also decided that <b>document</b> <b>lending</b> should be the first library service to be computer supported. In 1985 there was another turning point – the decision that the bibliography and cataloguing software will be based on the UNIMARC format. Shortly afterwards the system of research evidences, the union cataloguing of monographs, serials, and non-book materials; local history documentation; library materials acquisition, and the interlibrary loan were information technology supported, too. In 1985 our users had access to the first version of OPAC. In parallel with the introduction of information technology to individual library processes and services, information technology was used in searching domestic and foreign databases. These searches were in the beginning made on-line; followed by off line CD-ROM searches and network attached CD-ROM searches. In 1992 a users’ Online Guide to University Libraries in the Alps-Adriatic Working Group was also published. <br /...|$|E

Currently, influential policy <b>documents</b> <b>lend</b> credence {{to the notion that}} qualitative methods are inherently inferior to quantitative ones. In this paper, several of the questions about qualitative research raised in recent policy documents in the U. S. are examined. Each question is addressed by drawing upon examples from existing statistics education research. The examples illustrate that qualitative methods can be used profitably to study statistical teaching and learning, and that in some cases qualitative methods are preferable to quantitative ones. By using the examples presented, qualitative researchers in statistics education can begin to more strongly situate their work within scholarly discourse about empirical research...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the debate and {{discourse}} within the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) about poverty and the social policies, broadly conceived, suggested to reduce poverty in Latin America. In particular, it focuses on the ideas guiding the Bank’s strategies, actions, and policy advice since its renewed commitment in the mid- 1990 s to reducing poverty and promoting social equity. Based on analyses of various IDB <b>documents,</b> <b>lending</b> data, research and studies sponsored and/or conducted by IDB, annual reports, yearly reports on lending and non-lending activities specifically oriented toward poverty reduction, and scholarly work on IDB, it is evident that the income approach to poverty reduction continues to be dominant in the Bank. The approach is premised on the idea that poverty reduction will come about by increasing the income opportunities of the poor. This market-based approach to poverty reduction is echoed in the updated 2003 poverty reduction strategy. Although there is a greater emphasis today on issues of equity and its relation to the low impact that economic growth has had on poverty reduction, there has not been a major change or shift in the ideas which guide the Bank’s actions and advice as they relate to poverty reduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} probe tilt angle {{on the quality}} of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) {{measurements}} was explored. A small but consistent improvement in slope accuracy was <b>documented</b> <b>lending</b> some support to the effort to develop a new, five-axis STM capable of tilting in a controlled manner while scanning. The objective of such a machine would be to allow its probe to trace the sample's contour with greater accuracy than the currently available three-axis STM can. It is postulated that an STM with a probe that can change its roll and pitch in addition to its position along the traditional x, y, and z axes would be capable of reducing imaging errors produced as a result of geometric constraints, lateral electron discharge effects, and the tendency for the tip to bend during scanning due to electrostatic surface forces. In order to quantify the effects of incorporating probe tilt into the scanning process, a traditional, three-axis STM was manipulated in a way that allowed a standard sample grid to be imaged using a probe that was placed at seven different angles of tilt ranging from- 13 to + 13 degrees. Twenty-five different cavities in a standard STM scanning sample were scanned at these seven angle...|$|R

First, I <b>document</b> that <b>lending</b> rates are more asymmetric in economies with poor financial systems. Second, I explain this finding by introducing agency costs into a model with endogenous flow of information about the aggregate state of the economy. High monitoring costs magnify the size of crises and restrict the generation of information that fuels recoveries. Finally, by calibrating the model, I show that cross-country differences in the asymmetry of lending rate fluctuations are well explained by differences in these financial frictions. ...|$|R

This paper investigates the determinants of creditor concentration for German firms using a comprehensive bank-firm level dataset for the time period between 1993 and 2003. We <b>document</b> that <b>lending</b> is very often concentrated and, consequently, that relationship lending is important, {{not only for the}} small firms but also for the larger firms in our sample. However, we also find that risky, illiquid, large and leveraged firms spread their borrowing more evenly between multiple lenders. On the other hand, the degree of concentration increases with the profitability of the relationship lender. Relationship lending may spur financing provided by other banks, especially if the relationship lender is a public sector bank and if the other banks are large or do not have to tie up additional funds in capital.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} subsidising {{the cost of}} capital restricts {{the ability of the}} poorest to {{participate}} in the group lending mechanisms that include saving opportunities. We <b>document</b> the group <b>lending</b> mechanism used by a typical microfinance lender in Haryana, India. Individuals can participate in the group either as a borrower or a saver. The lender requires that the borrower partly self-finance their project with their own cash wealth. Consequently, a borrower requires a minimum amount of cash wealth to borrow. The poorest participate in the group by co-financing the borrower's project with their meagre savings. In return, they obtain higher than market returns on their savings. Subsidising the cost of capital reduces the cash wealth required to participate in the group as a borrower. Conversely, it increases the cash wealth required to participate as a saver, thus curtailing the opportunity for the poorest to enrich themselves.

40|$|We exploit {{a unique}} monthly dataset of bank balance sheets to <b>document</b> the <b>lending</b> {{behaviour}} of euro area banks that {{were subject to}} the EBAs 2011 / 12 Capital Exercise. This exercise was announced in October 2011 and required large European banking groups to meet a higher Tier 1 capital ratio by June 2012, after accounting for an unprecedented temporary bu¤er against exposure to sovereign debt. Given the unex-pected nature of the EBA Exercise and the short time frame during which banks had to increase their capital bu¤ers, this episode comes close to a natural experiment and provides a valuable insight into the capital-lending relationship. Controlling for bank characteristics and demand {{at the level of}} country of residence, we 8 ̆ 5 nd that banks in a banking group that had to increase its capital by 1 percent of risk-weighted assets tended to have annualized loan growth (over the 9 month period of the exercise) that was 1. 1 percent lower than for banks in groups that did not have to increase their capital ratio. We 8 ̆ 5 nd, however, that the timing of this e¤ect is limited to the recapitalisation period. We also look at aggregate e¤ects at the country level and 8 ̆ 5 nd that banks that did not have to recapitalize did not substitute for more constrained lenders.
