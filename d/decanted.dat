5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were <b>decanted,</b> the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A new {{unpowered}} decanter {{system was}} designed to lift the <b>decanting</b> sink only by the dynamic provided by liquid level difference. The system arranged the float tank pools symmetrically in {{both ends of the}} <b>decanting</b> sink. The system was run by the difference of liquid level between float tank pool and reaction pool. When the level difference got small, the float tank would rise and hence lift up the <b>decanting</b> sink in the reaction pool to up above the liquid level; when the level difference got large, the float tank no longer received the buoyance so the <b>decanting</b> sink would float in the reaction pool and <b>decant.</b> The testing results of the experiment device showed that by means of difference of liquid level to lift the <b>decanting</b> sink was feasible. The new system is simple in structure, so that the construction and maintenance cost is not high. It also does not consume electricity. It provides a new decanter model...|$|R

25|$|The {{amount of}} helium {{that must be}} <b>decanted</b> is very simple to calculate: Multiply the desired gas {{fraction}} of helium (FHe) by the total filling pressure (Ptot) to get partial pressure of helium (PHe). In {{the case of the}} Tx 20/40, in a 230 bar cylinder, this would be 230bar x 40% = 92bar (or for a 3,000psi fill, it would require 3,000 x 40% = 1,200 psi of helium).|$|E
25|$|Gas {{blending}} of trimix involves decanting oxygen and helium into the diving cylinder and then topping up the mix with air from a diving air compressor. To ensure an accurate mix, after each helium and oxygen transfer, the mix {{is allowed to}} cool, its pressure is measured and further gas is <b>decanted</b> until the correct pressure is achieved. This process often takes hours and is sometimes spread over days at busy blending stations.|$|E
25|$|Fermentation starts spontaneously {{under the}} action of the natural yeasts from the grapes. The {{winemaker}} can choose to use a commercially available active dry yeast. It can help to express the characteristics of a variety or a method of manufacture. For a dry white wine fermentation continues until the sugar runs out. The wine is then usually <b>decanted</b> to eliminate the lees. When fermentation is done in barrels the temperature often exceeds 20°C or even 25°C.|$|E

The pericarp is then removed, leaving the endosperm of the grain {{with or without the}} germ, depending on the process. This hulling is performed by hand, in traditional or very small-scale preparation, or mechanically, in larger scale or industrial production.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{pressure}} blending using pure oxygen <b>decanted</b> {{into the}} cylinder before topping up with air may involve very high oxygen fractions and oxygen partial pressures during the decanting process, which constitute {{a relatively high}} fire hazard. This procedure requires care and precautions by the operator, and decanting equipment and cylinders which are clean for oxygen service, but the equipment is relatively simple and inexpensive. Partial pressure blending using pure oxygen {{is often used to}} provide nitrox on live-aboard dive boats, but it is also used in some dive shops and clubs.|$|E
25|$|Static {{settling}} {{consists of}} leaving the must to let the debris settle: after pressing, the must is left to stand in a tank away from air. Suspended particles precipitate {{to the bottom of}} the tank. This is facilitated by the addition of pectolytic enzymes which are long chain carbons composed of pectic compounds. These pectins give a high viscosity to the juice, cut the suspended particles into shorter chains, and accelerate precipitation. Refrigeration of the wort is needed: if the fermentation starts, the release of bubbles of carbon dioxide would spread suspended particles throughout the wort preventing their deposition. After the wort is clarified it is <b>decanted</b> for fermenting.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{reason for}} <b>decanting</b> wine is to aerate it, or {{allow it to}} [...] "breathe". The {{decanter}} is meant to mimic the effects of swirling the wine glass to stimulate the oxidation processes which trigger the release of more aromatic compounds. In addition it is thought to benefit the wine by smoothing some of the harsher aspects of the wine (like tannins or potential wine faults like mercaptans). Many wine writers, such as author Karen MacNeil in the book The Wine Bible, advocate <b>decanting</b> {{for the purposes of}} aeration, especially with very tannic wines like Barolo, Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon, Port, and Rhône wines while noting that <b>decanting</b> could be harmful for more delicate wines like Chianti and Pinot noir.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} obtain alum from alunite, it is {{calcined}} and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor <b>decanted,</b> and the alum allowed to crystallize. The alum schists employed {{in the manufacture of}} alum are mixtures of iron pyrite, aluminium silicate and various bituminous substances, and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate, a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of aluminium sulfate of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until ferrous sulfate crystallizes on cooling; it is then drawn off and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, <b>decanted</b> from any sediment, and finally mixed with the calculated quantity of potassium sulfate, well agitated, and the alum is thrown down as a finely divided precipitate of alum meal. If much iron should be present in the shale then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.|$|E
25|$|Pepe {{incorporates}} {{some elements}} of traditional winemaking, including crushing his organically grown grapes by foot similar to the traditional Port wine tradition of using a large stone vats called lagares to tread on wine grapes. He also shuns {{the use of any}} fining and filtration aids as well as the use of the sulfur dioxide for preserving and protecting the wine oxidation. However, instead of using oak barrels or stainless steel fermentation tanks, Pepe ferments and ages everything in glass (from using glass lined fermentation vessels, to storing the wine in bottles). When the wines are ready to be released, they are <b>decanted</b> off their sediments and repackaged in a new wine bottle.|$|E
25|$|Where land is {{in short}} supply sewage may be treated by {{injection}} of oxygen into a pressured return sludge stream which is injected into {{the base of a}} deep columnar tank buried in the ground. Such shafts may be up to 100 metres deep and are filled with sewage liquor. As the sewage rises the oxygen forced into solution by the pressure {{at the base of the}} shaft breaks out as molecular oxygen providing a highly efficient source of oxygen for the activated sludge biota. The rising oxygen and injected return sludge provide the physical mechanism for mixing of the sewage and sludge. Mixed sludge and sewage is <b>decanted</b> at the surface and separated into supernatant and sludge components. The efficiency of deep shaft treatment can be high.|$|E
40|$|Transport of {{fuel from}} distillation/storage plant to {{different}} parts of the world has always been challenging task for Engineers. Different methods have been proposed over the time for transporting fuel efficiently and at low cost which include Marine vessels, Pipelines, Rail Cars and Trucks. In order to transport useful amount of fuel in a reasonably sized tank, we have to liquefy it. While few fuels are easy to liquefy there are great number of fuels which liquefy only under extreme pressure/temperature conditions. Methane has a boiling point of - 161. 7 °C at atmospheric pressure which means it has to be cooled to a much lower temperature in order to turn it into to liquid that can be stored in a tank. In short, Methane is not stored in household tanks because it is hard to liquefy. So large carbon epoxy fiber tanks were developed to transport Methane around the world in gaseous state at high pressures. But when the tank <b>decanting</b> was done in places where ambient temperatures were well below 0 °C, it was found that ideal conditions for Methane liquefaction were formed. Gaseous Methane has to lose a lot of energy to liquefy which means that liquid Methane would be much colder than its gaseous counterpart. Now the liquid Methane would cool the tank walls more rapidly than its gaseous counterpart present in the tank and thus this difference in temperature would impart additional thermal stresses on the tank walls. These thermal stresses are result of uneven contraction/expansion of the tank walls and may lead to crack formation in the wall surface which we intend to avoid in all circumstances. The present study is concentrated in identifying different tank <b>decanting</b> conditions where there may arise favorable conditions for liquid Methane formation. Tank <b>decanting</b> simulations were performed for different system temperatures ranging from - 50 °C to 20 °C and flow rates of 0. 064 kg/s, 0. 11975 kg/s and 0. 3 kg/s respectively were selected for each system temperature. A similar study on Biogas tank <b>decanting</b> was performed and different system conditions were identified where possibility of liquefaction arouse within the tank. Through the tank <b>decanting</b> study carried out on Methane and biogas fuels, few <b>decanting</b> conditions were identified where there was a possibility of liquefaction within the tank. If the <b>decanting</b> was continued from these points of liquefaction, the tank walls would experience immense thermal stresses and there may arise a point where cracking in the tank wall takes place. The tank <b>decanting,</b> either has to be stopped or the <b>decanting</b> flow rate should be reduced further at these points. As the <b>decanting</b> flow rate is reduced the tank wall would have enough time to pump heat into the system and thus avoiding liquefaction within the tank. This process can continue only until the tank wall temperature and the fuel temperature within the tank reaches equilibrium or the fuel temperature reaches its critical point, whichever comes earlier. After this, <b>decanting</b> has to be stopped because any further temperature drop would result in liquefaction which has to be avoided under any circumstances as this would in turn result in tank liner failure.

25|$|Bridgeton's most {{successful}} times were now behind them, {{and though they}} maintained their league status for the next 20 years, they never challenged for major honours again. In 1960, New Barrowfield was subject to another housing CPO by the city fathers and Waverley were again forced to move, this time to Carntyne Stadium a mile to the north, which was more suited to greyhound racing and speedway. By this point, many of the local Junior clubs were in financial difficulty; distractions of modern living had made attending matches less appealing, and Glasgow's housing improvement programme was in full swing, {{with much of the}} population of the crowded, substandard tenements <b>decanted</b> to new overspill estates on the edge of town – for East End residents this typically meant Easterhouse and Cranhill, although no new Junior teams were established in these vast schemes. Shawfield had folded in 1960, and Bridgeton Waverley followed in 1962. They would not be the last, with Parkhead ceasing operations in 1963, Strathclyde in 1965 and Dennistoun Waverley in 1968. Housing was never built on New Barrowfield as had been planned; it became the training ground for Celtic for the next 40 years and still contains football pitches. Housing now occupies the Carntyne site as well as the Dennistoun ground, the hospital and the Strathclyde ground (which formed part of the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games), while the Parkhead site is a public park and the Shawfield F.C. ground was bulldozed for the M74 motorway extension.|$|E
500|$|The {{hill was}} {{constructed}} using mostly {{the fragments of}} large globular [...] vessels from Baetica (the Guadalquivir region of modern Spain), of a type now known as Dressel 20. It also included smaller numbers of two types of amphorae from Tripolitania (Libya) and Byzacena (Tunisia). All three types of vessel were used to transport olive oil. However, {{it is not clear}} why Monte Testaccio was built using only olive oil vessels. The oil itself was probably <b>decanted</b> into bulk containers when the amphorae were unloaded at the port, {{in much the same way}} as other staples such as grain. There is no equivalent mound of broken grain or wine amphorae and the overwhelming majority of the amphorae found at Monte Testaccio are of one single type, which raises the question of why the Romans found it necessary to dispose of the amphorae in this way.|$|E
5000|$|However, the {{effectiveness}} of <b>decanting</b> is a topic of debate, with some wine experts such as oenologist Émile Peynaud claiming that the prolonged exposure to oxygen actually diffuses and dissipates more aroma compounds than it stimulates, {{in contrast to the}} effects of the smaller scale exposure and immediate release that swirling the wine in a drinker's glass has. [...] In addition {{it has been reported that}} the process of <b>decanting</b> over a period of a few hours does not have the effect of softening tannins. The softening of tannins occurs during the winemaking and oak aging when tannins go through a process of polymerization that can last days or weeks; <b>decanting</b> merely alters the perception of sulfites and other chemical compounds in the wine through oxidation, which can give some drinkers the sense of softer tannins in the wine. In line with the view that <b>decanting</b> can dissipate aromas, wine expert Kerin O'Keefe prefers to let the wine evolve slowly and naturally in the bottle, by uncorking it a few hours ahead, a practice suggested by wine producers such as Bartolo Mascarello and Franco Biondi Santi.|$|R
