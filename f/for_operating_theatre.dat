40|$|Abstract. The {{planning}} of surgical operations forms a substantial element of hospital management. It {{is characterized by}} high complexity, which {{is caused by the}} uncertainty between the capacity offered and the true demand. Also, as emergency cases occur the planning requirements change. In our approach the proposals for the schedules are made {{with the help of the}} heuristics. In order for a schedule to be accepted by those involved, it should take account of the interests and preferences of all the human actors. Existing systems do not do this and therefore suffer from levels of non-acceptance of their resulting schedules. In this paper we discuss suitable heuristics <b>for</b> <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> scheduling, the limits to which preferences can be considered in the scheduling process, and the validation of the approach in an experimental set of hospital scenarios. ...|$|E

The benefits may include the opportunity {{to improve the quality}} of care by providing more specialist services and greater expertise, more attractive working conditions with a larger pool of specialists providing the on-call rota and an enhanced opportunity for training. Concentration will produce greater volumes of patients in the selected specialties with the possibility of various economies of scale. A series of simulation experiments explored the potential for efficiencies associated with the increasing volume of non-elective patients in an orthopaedic specialty. As the annual volume of patients increases so the relative variability of the demand <b>for</b> <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> time declines: concentrating non-elective orthopaedic activity could offer considerable savings in the theatre time allocated to trauma patients. However, the impact on the wards is much less significant, with concentration having a negligible effect on the requirement for beds...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we analyse factors that {{predispose}} to risk and we value the importance of quality and reliability into operating theatre. Patient safety result from ability to plan and manage organizations able to reduce probability of mistakes (Prevention) and to recover and contain their consequences (Protection). The principal motives of mistakes are: - deficiency of sharing procedures between different professional figures for risk prevention; - deficiency of an effective integration between professional figures in operating theatre; - deficiency of charitable precise run to guarantee the continuity of interventions on patient.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{critical analysis of}} risk management in maternity care and the hidden {{costs associated with the}} practice in healthy women. Issues of quality and safety are driving an increased emphasis by health services on risk management in maternity care. Medical risk in pregnancy is known to benefit 15 % or less of all pregnancies. Risk management applied to the remaining 85 % of healthy women results in the management of risk in the absence of risk. The health cost to mothers and babies and the economic burden on the overall health system of serious morbidity has been omitted from calculations comparing costs of uncomplicated caesarean birth and uncomplicated vaginal birth. The understanding that elective caesarean birth is cost-neutral when compared to a normal vaginal birth has misled practitioners and contributed to over use of the practice.

The Audit Commission Report <b>for</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Theatres</b> involving 70 National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in the UK in 2002 [1] identified that while an ideal, elective theatre unit can work 41  h/week, its average output is only 24.3  h (range 8.3 – 57  h), with only 70 % of available theatre time being utilized for scheduled lists. Furthermore, only 73 % of the time allocated for planned lists was actually used for surgery.

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} a rich multi-day {{surgical}} case scheduling problem considering generalized resource constraints and desiderata from the surgical staff. The aim is to schedule as many surgical cases in as few operating theatres as possible, within regular operating theatre opening hours and under limited resource availability. In addition, secondary objectives such as makespan and other measures of resource efficiency are optimized. Surgical cases may specify both required and optional dependencies on different resource types during different phases of the surgical procedure. To be eligible to be scheduled at a certain time, sufficient resources for required resource types must be present during the surgical phase they are required for. Optional resource type requirements are preferably met, but do not prohibit a surgical case to be planned. Furthermore, surgical staff may denote collaboration preferences that should be satisfied as much as possible. To this end, we developed a heuristic algorithm employing a list decoding procedure for generating feasible schedules. The procedure makes extensive use of interval tree data structures, to allow for fast schedule generation, with infinite precision. This list decoding procedure is used within a local search algorithm to find good quality schedules in limited time. In a second phase, optional resources are assigned in a greedy fashion. The problem description and the algorithm {{is the result of}} a collaboration with a software company developing a software solution <b>for</b> <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> planning and scheduling.

40|$|Abstract Nurses' {{perceptions}} {{and experiences of}} communication in the operating theatre: a focus group interview Background Communication programmes are well established in nurse education. The focus of programmes is most often on communicating with patients with less attention paid to inter-professional communication or skills essential for working in specialised settings. Although there are many anecdotal reports of communication within the operating theatre, there are few empirical studies. This paper explores communication behaviours for effective practice in the operating theatre as perceived by nurses {{and serves as a}} basis for developing training. Methods A focus group interview was conducted with seven experienced theatre nurses from a large London teaching hospital. The interview explored their perceptions of the key as well as unique features of effective communication skills in the operating theatre. Data was transcribed and thematically analysed until agreement was achieved by the two authors. Results There was largely consensus on the skills deemed necessary for effective practice including listening, clarity of speech and being polite. Significant influences on the nature of communication included conflict in role perception and organisational issues. Nurses were often expected to work outside of their role which either directly or indirectly created barriers for effective communication. Perceptions of a lack of collaborative team effort also influenced communication. Conclusion Although fundamental communication skills were identified for effective practice in the operating theatre, there were significant barriers to their use because of confusion over clarity of roles (especially nurses' roles) and the implications for teamwork. Nurses were dissatisfied with several aspects of communication. Future studies should explore the breadth and depth of this dissatisfaction in other operating theatres, its impact on morale and importantly on patient safety. Interprofessional communication training <b>for</b> <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> staff based in part on the key issues identified in this study may help to create clarity in roles and focus attention on effective teamwork and promote clinical safety. ...|$|E
40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia has {{introduced}} a nursing unit which focuses on the care of patients during the period surrounding their surgical procedure. Referred to as Perioperative Nursing Care, the unit introduces students {{to the operating room}} specialty through a unique teaching – learning method. Notre Dame is the only university in Western Australia to include this area in a compulsory unit which specifically addresses the shortage of perioperative nurses. Valuable exposure to the specialty is gained in a clinical workshop organised between the University and St John of God Hospital (Subiaco) and Fremantle Hospital, two of Western Australia’s major hospitals. The coordinator and lecturer, Ms Karen Clark-Burg explains, “During the clinical workshop, students have the opportunity with tutors to consolidate theory learnt during the semester to the actual environment. “ Students are assessed on essential operating room skills in a ‘real Operating Room (OR) setting’, preparing them to work confidently in operating theatre which is an important aspect of their clinical placement. “There was overwhelming positive feedback from students,” Ms Clark-Burg said. “They felt that it was an invaluable experience to be learning in an actual OR. ” Professor Selma Alliex, Dean of the School of Nursing said that this hands-on opportunity enhances the chances of students working in the long term in the operating room. “In the current climate of nursing shortage, a shortage which is more acutely felt in speciality areas, this strategy to immerse students in the operating room ensures that students are familiar with every facet of practice in this area. “Karen has provided the University with an excellent learning opportunity. In fact, she won an award for her paper on the unit at 2008 National Conference <b>for</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Theatre</b> Nurses (ACORN) where she presented in May this year.

40|$|Cardiothoracic surgery {{planning}} involves different {{resources such}} as <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> time, beds, IC beds and nursing staff. In practice the planning in the Thorax Centre focuses on optimal use of <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> time, though {{the performance of the}} Thorax Centre as a whole is often more limited by the capacity of the IC. <b>For</b> <b>operating</b> <b>theatres</b> a master surgical schedule is used to allocate <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> resources at tactical level for a longer period. Operational schedules at weekly level are derived from this master schedule. Within cardiothoracic surgery different categories of patients can be distinguished on behalf of their requirement of resources. The mix of patients is, therefore, an important decision variable for the Thorax Centre to manage the use of these resources. In the paper we will consider the planning problem to generate a master operation schedule that realises a given target of patient throughput and optimises an object function for the utilisation of resources. This problem can be mathematically approached by mixed integer programming. We will discuss the mathematical model developed for this planning problem, the implementation in a decision support model for tactical surgery planning, the results obtained and the way the model can help to broaden the focus of planning of cardiothoracic patients...|$|R

40|$|Background Centralization {{of complex}} {{healthcare}} services into specialist high-volume centres {{is believed to}} improve outcomes. For injured patients, few studies have evaluated the centralization of major trauma services. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how a regional trauma network affected trends in admissions, case mix, and outcomes of injured patients. Methods A retrospective before–after study was undertaken of severely injured patients attending four hospitals that became major trauma centres (MTCs) in March 2012. Consecutive patients with major trauma were identified from a national registry and divided into two groups according to injury before or after the launch of a new trauma network. The two cohorts were compared for differences in case mix, demand on hospital resources, and outcomes. Results Patient volume increased from 442 to 1326 (200 per cent), operations from 349 to 1231 (253 per cent), critical care bed-days from 1100 to 3704 (237 per cent), and total hospital bed-days from 7910 to 22 [*] 772 (188 per cent). Patient age increased on MTC designation from 45 · 0 [*]years before March 2012 to 48 · 2 [*]years afterwards (P[*]=[*] 0 · 021), as did the proportion of penetrating injuries (1 · 8 versus 4 · 1 per cent; P[*]=[*] 0 · 025). Injury severity fell as measured by median Injury Severity Score (16 versus 14) and Revised Trauma Score (4 · 1 versus 7 · 8). Fewer patients required secondary transfer to a MTC from peripheral hospitals (19 · 9 versus 16 · 1 per cent; P[*]=[*] 0 · 100). There were no significant differences in total duration of hospital stay, critical care requirements or mortality. However, there was a significant increase, from 55 · 5 to 62 · 3 per cent (P[*]<[*] 0 · 001), in the proportion of patients coded as having a ‘good recovery’ at discharge after institution of the trauma network. Conclusion MTC designation leads to an increased case volume with considerable implications <b>for</b> <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> capacity and bed occupancy.

40|$|This report {{finds that}} NSW public {{hospitals}} are treating patients within national clinical timeframes, however increased operations {{will be required}} as targets increase and demand grows. Summary:“Thousands more people could be operated on in the NSW public health system if operating theatres ran more efficiently,” said Mr Achterstraat. “Waiting times for elective surgery {{will continue to increase}} if NSW Health does not improve its management of operating theatres,” he added. On the positive side NSW public hospitals are performing more elective surgery than in previous years and are treating patients substantially within national clinical timeframes. However, more operations will be needed as targets are getting tighter and demand is growing.  There is capacity to do more elective surgery using existing resources. If NSW Health met its own theatre utilisation targets for elective surgery an estimated 20, 000 more operations could be achieved each year.  “Hospitals just need to start the first operations of the day on time, stay on time and reduce the numbers of cancellations,” said Mr Achterstraat.  “Less than half the scheduled first operations started on time over the past three years,” said Mr Achterstraat. “In some hospitals less than 10 per cent of first operations start on time, yet in other hospitals over 95 per cent start on time,” he added.  The problem {{is that it is not}} always clear who is in charge. Operating theatre managers have limited authority or influence over day-to-day theatre efficiency.  “Someone clearly needs to be in charge of the operating theatre; with the same authority and skill as the matrons of the past,” said Mr Achterstraat. “They should be backed up by strong, active operating theatre committees bringing together surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and hospital executives,” he added.  “I am pleased that NSW Health is developing best practice guidelines <b>for</b> <b>operating</b> <b>theatre</b> management and governance,” said Mr Achterstraat.  To really manage operating theatres well, hospitals need far better information on costs and productivity. A greater understanding is required of the number of theatre hours and operations funded and the degree of spare capacity.  Hospitals should also question why over a quarter of theatre cases are non-surgical, such as endoscopies and colonoscopies which could be done in procedure rooms rather than using up valuable operating theatre time.  The cost of elective surgery varies considerably between hospitals. For example, NSW Health needs to better understand why the average cost of knee replacements in some local health districts is $ 13, 177 and in others is $ 22, 638...|$|E
