The development of these modulations during the time-of-flight and their dependence with the disorder are investigated. We render an account of this effect using numerical and analytical calculations.

40|$|Quasi one {{dimensional}} Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in elongated traps exhibit significant phase fluctuations even {{at very low}} temperatures. We present recent experimental results on the dynamic transformation of phase fluctuations into <b>density</b> <b>modulations</b> during time-of-flight and show the excellent quantitative agreement with the theoretical prediction. In addition we confirm that under our experimental conditions, in the magnetic trap <b>density</b> <b>modulations</b> are strongly suppressed even when the phase fluctuates. The paper also discusses our theoretical results on control of the condensate phase by employing a time-dependent perturbation. Our results set important limitations on future applications of BEC in precision atom interferometry and atom optics, {{but at the same}} time suggest pathways to overcome these limitations.

50|$|Delta-sigma {{modulation}} converts {{the analog}} voltage into a pulse frequency and is alternatively known as Pulse <b>Density</b> <b>modulation</b> or Pulse Frequency modulation. In general, frequency may vary smoothly in infinitesimal steps, as may voltage, and both {{may serve as}} an analog of an infinitesimally varying physical variable such as acoustic pressure, light intensity, etc. The substitution of frequency for voltage is thus entirely natural and carries in its train the transmission advantages of a pulse stream. The different names for the modulation method {{are the result of}} pulse frequency modulation by different electronic implementations, which all produce similar transmitted waveforms.|$|E

The Zurich group placed a Bose-Einstein condensate inside two optical resonators, which enhanced the atomic interactions until they start to spontaneously crystallize and form a solid that maintains the inherent superfluidity of Bose-Einstein condensates. The MIT group exposed a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential to light beams that created an effective spin-orbit coupling.

5000|$|A class-D {{amplifier}} or {{switching amplifier}} is an electronic amplifier {{in which the}} amplifying devices (transistors, usually MOSFETs) operate as electronic switches, and not as linear gain devices as in other amplifiers. The signal to be amplified is a train of constant amplitude pulses, so the active devices switch rapidly {{back and forth between}} a fully conductive and nonconductive state. The analog signal to be amplified is converted to a series of pulses by pulse width modulation, pulse <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> or other methods before being applied to the amplifier. After amplification, the output pulse train can be converted back to an analog signal by passing through a passive low pass filter consisting of inductors and capacitors.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{studies of}} the {{dynamics}} of longitudinal space-charge waves in space-charge dominated beams propagating through a transport channel with a long solenoid are performed. First, some basic models of space-charge waves behaviors are reviewed. Second, WARP simulations on generating either pure fast waves or pure slow waves are presented. Then experimental studies on the energy <b>modulations</b> converted from <b>density</b> <b>modulations</b> are reported. By changing the working conditions of the electron gun, pure initial <b>density</b> <b>modulations</b> are generated. Energy perturbation waveforms are measured by a high resolution energy analyzer. Finally, the experimental results are compared with both the linear theory and the WARP simulation results. Good agreements are achieved for the relationship between the energy and current perturbation strengths. The notable exception is a large discrepancy between experiment and theory for the speed of sound at differing perturbation strengths, which remains to be investigated in future work...|$|R
40|$|Radiative {{feedback}} from massive stars {{is a key}} process to understand how HII regions may enhance or inhibit star formation in pillars and globules at the interface with molecular clouds. We aim to contribute to model the interactions between ionization and gas clouds {{to better understand the}} processes at work. We study in detail the impact of modulations on the cloud-HII region interface and <b>density</b> <b>modulations</b> inside the cloud. We run three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations based on Euler equations coupled with gravity using the HERACLES code. We implement a method to solve ionization/recombination equations and we take into account typical heating and cooling processes at work in the interstellar medium and due to ionization/recombination physics. UV radiation creates a dense shell compressed between an ionization front and a shock ahead. Interface modulations produce a curved shock that collapses on itself leading to stable growing pillar-like structures. The narrower the initial interface modulation, the longer the resulting pillar. We interpret pillars resulting from <b>density</b> <b>modulations</b> in terms of the ability of these density modula- tions to curve the shock ahead the ionization front. The shock curvature is a key process to understand the formation of structures at the edge of HII regions. Interface and <b>density</b> <b>modulations</b> {{at the edge of the}} cloud have a direct impact on the morphology of the dense shell during its formation. Deeper in the cloud, structures have less influence due to the high densities reached by the shell during its expansion. Comment: Accepted by A&A 03 / 11 / 201...|$|R

5000|$|If {{there is}} a foreign atom {{embedded}} in the metal or semiconductor, a so-called impurity, the electrons that move freely through the solid are scattered by the deviating potential of the impurity. During the scattering process the initial state wave vector ki of electron wave function is scattered to a final state wave vector kf. Because the electron gas is a Fermi gas only electrons with energies near the Fermi level can participate in the scattering process because there must be empty final states for the scattered states to jump to. Electrons that are too far below the Fermi level EF can't jump to unoccupied states. The states around the Fermi level that can be scattered occupy a limited range of k-values or wavelengths. So only electrons within a limited wavelength range near the Fermi level are scattered resulting in a <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> around the impurity like ...|$|E
40|$|We report {{generation}} of <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> at terahertz (THz) frequencies in a {{relativistic electron beam}} through laser modulation of the beam longitudinal phase space. We show that by modulating the energy distribution of the beam with two lasers, <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> at the difference frequency of the two lasers can be generated after the beam passes through a chicane. In this experiment, <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> around 10 THz was generated by down-converting the frequencies of an 800 nm laser and a 1550 nm laser. The central frequency of the <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> can be tuned by varying the laser wavelengths, beam energy chirp, or momentum compaction of the chicane.

40|$|Electron beams with {{periodic}} longitudinal <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> {{may produce}} terahertz radiation in linear accelerators. In this study, simulations {{are used to}} understand how the density and energy modulations of an electron bunch evolve as the beam is transported through a linac system. It is instructive to simulate beams that have only <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> and beams that have only energy modulation. The former is useful for learning how to keep the desired <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> for beams intended to create terahertz radiation, the latter for learning how to suppress unwanted energy modulation, which may have originated as <b>density</b> <b>modulation.</b> The simulations in this study are performed using PARMELA in conujnction with other software codes.

40|$|Typically the {{superconducting phase}} weakens at several points with the {{increase}} in disorder before it is distroyed in the 2 d-thin films. This may lead to an inhomogeneous superconducting state without a continuous phase. Here we present scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements at 0. 1 K in the disordered polycrystalline film of TiN describing the nanoscale size features of the superconducting state. The imaging shows imcommensurate charge <b>density</b> <b>modulations,</b> originating at the crystalline bounadries, and intercepted on large scale by the beat patterns in the regions of overlap. Electronic coherence is maintained over length scale minimum of crystalline sizes, and suffers scattering across low angle crystalline boundaries. The superconducting state fluctuates at the positions of the charge <b>density</b> <b>modulations</b> and zones of the weak phase appear {{in the vicinity of the}} beats. Our data shows that the BCS-like behavior evolves into the V-shaped density of states in such inhomogeneous regions as a result of the competition between the superconducting correlations with that of the strong electron-electron repulsive interactions assisted by the inelastic scattering at the crystalline boundaries.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} tunable transverse rectification in a density-modulated two-dimensional {{electron gas}} (2 DEG). The <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> is induced by two surface gates, running in parallel along a narrow stripe of 2 DEG. A transverse voltage {{in the direction of}} the <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> is observed, i. e. perpendicular to the applied source-drain voltage. The polarity of the transverse voltage is independent of the polarity of the source-drain voltage, demonstrating rectification in the device. We find that the transverse voltage $U_{y}$ depends quadratically on the applied source-drain voltage and non-monotonically on the <b>density</b> <b>modulation.</b> The experimental results are discussed in the framework of a diffusion thermopower model.

40|$|Confinement by walls usually {{produces}} a strong modulation in {{the density of}} dense liquids near the walls. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we {{examine the effects of}} the <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> on the spatially resolved dynamics of a liquid confined between two parallel walls, using a resolution of a fraction of the interparticle distance in the liquid. The local dynamics is quantified by the relaxation time associated with the temporal autocorrelation function of the local density. We find that this local relaxation time varies in phase with the <b>density</b> <b>modulation.</b> The amplitude of the spatial modulation of the relaxation time can be quite large, depending on the characteristics of the wall and thermodynamic parameters of the liquid. To disentangle the effects of confinement and <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> on the spatially resolved dynamics, we compare the dynamics of a confined liquid with that of an unconfined one in which a similar <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> is induced by an external potential. We find several differences indicating that <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> alone cannot account for all the features seen in the spatially resolved dynamics of confined liquids. We also examine how the dynamics near a wall depends on the separation between the two walls and show that the features seen in our simulations persist in the limit of large wall separation.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} non-degenerate four-wave mixing in a cold sample of 4 -level atoms. An {{integral part of the}} four-wave mixing process is a collective instability which spontaneously generates a periodic <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> in the cold atomic sample with a period equal to half of the wavelength of the generated high-frequency optical field. Due to the generation of this <b>density</b> <b>modulation,</b> phase-matching between the pump and scattered fields is not a necessary initial condition for this wave-mixing process to occur, rather the <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> acts to "self phase-match" the fields {{during the course of the}} wave-mixing process.

We present current design, status of equipment acquisition and estimates for the expected beam parameters. We use a dogleg to merge the electron and ion beams. The ions 'imprint' their distribution into the electron beam via a space charge <b>density</b> <b>modulation.</b> The modulation is amplified in an FEL comprised of a 7 -m long helical wiggler. The ions are co-propagating with electron beam through the FEL. The ion's average velocity is matched to the group velocity of the wave-packet of e-beam <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> in the FEL. A three-pole wiggler at the exit of the FEL tune the phase of the wave-packet so the ion with the central energy experience the maximum of the e-beam <b>density</b> <b>modulation,</b> where electric field is zero.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{build a new}} spin-orbit {{coupling}} experiment to observe the supersolidlike stripe phase. The phase diagram of a 1 -dimensional spin-orbit coupled Bose- Einstein condensate shows several interesting phases including the stripe phase. We find the stripe phase particularly interesting because the condensate develops a <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> in free space while remaining superfluid, which are the signature of supersolidity. In order to observe the stripe phase, we develop a novel spin-j basis which uses the orbital bands of an optical superlattice. Our choice of pseudo-spin basis allows the condensate components to remain miscible at high enough spin-orbit coupling strengths to observe the stripe phase. The superlattice constitutes a chain of spins which develop an antiferromagnetic spin texture and a <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> at twice the lattice spacing. Breaking the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice while maintaining superfluidity indicates {{the formation of a}} lattice supersolid which we detected with Bragg scattering. Finally, the <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> of the stripe phase is measured with a Bragg reflected beam and a camera setup to resolve the angular spread of the beam. An angle resolved, coherent Bragg beam is direct evidence of the stripe phase <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> in free space. The formation of a free space <b>density</b> <b>modulation</b> in a superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate breaks the continuous spatial translation symmetry of space; fulfilling the definition of supersolidity.
