40|$|Mandibular {{condylar}} {{trauma is}} {{the most common cause of}} temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis. The pathogenesis of this condition is typified by fibrous or bony tissue replacement of the two articular surfaces, resulting in an inability to open the mouth. Treatment includes joint interpositional arthroplasty to remove the ankylosed tissue and meniscus. After smoothing the ankylotic joint surface, autogenous or alloplastic material is used to replace the meniscus. We present a case of TMJ ankylosis treated with interpositional arthroplasty and a Silastic graft. The patient suffered joint trauma that was treated with intermaxillary fixation and insufficient <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> mouth <b>opening</b> exercise. The patient subsequently developed Type II bony ankylosis in left TMJ, which was diagnosed on clinical examination, and computed tomography. Interpositional arthroplasty with a Silastic autopolymerizing membrane was performed through a preauricular approach. Postoperatively, mouth opening improved significantly from an interincisal distance of 3 - 28 mm. Surgical and physical therapy accomplished good wound healing without re-ankylosis after two years of follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Diseases causing trismus or {{pain of the}} {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) include temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJD), trauma, tumors and an inflammation. This report describes {{two cases}} of masticator space abscesses causing trismus and TMJ pain, which were initially diagnosed as TMJD. The first case was a 62 -year-old female suffering from trismus and right-TMJ pain without swelling or redness, which was diagnosed as TMJD with MRI (TMJ region) findings of bilateral anterior disc displacement without reduction. However, five days later the right-TMJ pain became more severe and MRI (maxillofacial region) revealed a right masticator space abscess. She was treated with antibiotics and underwent an intraoral incision following hospitalization. She recovered well and was discharged from the hospital on the 15 th day. The second case was a 68 -year-old female having trismus and left-TMJ pain, which was diagnosed as TMJD at another hospital. She received <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> jaw <b>opening</b> training, but visited our hospital because her symptoms were not improved. At the first visit, the mouth opening range was 18 mm and an anterior dislocation of the left condylar process was found by X-ray imaging. CT-scan revealed an abscess in th...|$|R

The Inert Atmosphere Confinement was designed to prevent this sudden liberation of energy by opening the material in an inert argon atmosphere instead of the normal glovebox atmosphere. The IAC is located in glovebox HC- 21 A, room 230 B of the 234 - 5 Z Building at the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) in the 200 -West Area of the Hanford Site...|$|R
