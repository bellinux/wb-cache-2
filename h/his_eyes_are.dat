5|$|The gilding and monumentality of {{the cross}} link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is {{reflective}} of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Velázquez to Francis Bacon.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> open, and {{his skin}} is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E
60|$|And she {{was aware}} that in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>was</b> no longer any of the ingenuousness of youth she remembered.

5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{their time}} at the academy, {{astronaut}} candidates must overcome numerous physical and mental trials. Readers discover from a pre-serialization story that Asumi's mother dies following the Lion disaster, {{but this is not}} known to Asumi's friends until Kei discovers the obituary listing in a newspaper article. Marika is revealed to be the genetic copy of a deceased Marika Ukita despite a standing ban on human cloning. Fuchuya suffers from red-green color blindness after <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> exposed to an exploding firework at close range in a childhood accident. Unknown to the group, Shu suffers from hereditary hemoptysis (coughing up of blood) and dies from the condition soon after his selection as an exchange student to the American space program. This tragedy reveals Kei's feelings for him, which she keeps hidden for much of the series.|$|E
25|$|The double-dome mask. This {{was invented}} by HydroOptix. Double-dome masks allow a wider field of view and avoid the {{refraction}} error in perceived distance and size of objects. Underwater the curved mask windows make the diver's vision effectively more hyperopic, or less myopic, and the diver must wear special contact lenses to compensate (unless <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> myopic to the right amount to compensate exactly for the refraction at the curved mask windows). The diver's vision will become myopic when he puts {{his head out of}} water with the contact lenses in.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 live-action {{short film}} , {{directed}} by Kevin Tancharoen, Scorpion, addressed therein by his real name, {{is depicted as}} a voluntary prisoner being questioned by Deacon City police captain Jackson Briggs regarding an underground tournament hosted by Shang Tsung. Sonya Blade shows up late in the film with a confidential document stating that Scorpion had killed Sub-Zero's brother. Knowing that Sub-Zero will enter Shang Tsung's deadly tournament, Scorpion agrees to participate and leave no one alive. He was played by Ian Anthony Dale and appears as a normal human, though <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> completely white and his signature spear weapon also appears.|$|E
25|$|The Emperor {{is about}} five feet ten inches in height, and of a slender but elegant form; his {{complexion}} is comparatively fair, though <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> dark; his nose is rather aquiline, and the whole of his countenance presents a perfect regularity of feature, which, by no means, announce the great age {{he is said to}} have attained; his person is attracting, and his deportment accompanied by an affability, which, without lessening the dignity of the prince, evinces the amiable character of the man. His dress consisted of a loose robe of yellow silk, a cap of black velvet with a red ball on the top, and adorned with a peacock's feather, which is the peculiar distinction of mandarins of the first class. He wore silk boots embroidered with gold, and a sash of blue girded his waist.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort is {{initially}} only heard, possessing the scratchy, weak voice {{heard in the}} first film. By the film's climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by Ralph Fiennes. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone and the handle appears {{to be made of}} bone; his finger nails are long and pale blue while his toe nails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> blue, because producer David Heyman felt that his evil {{would not be able to}} be seen and would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh of his nose significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes' nose was not covered in makeup on the set, but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.|$|E

60|$|Maraton, too, {{had risen}} to his feet. He had turned {{slightly}} and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> fixed upon the door through which Elisabeth had passed.

The immobility of his features was at last disturbed. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> wonderfully bright, <b>his</b> lips were a little parted.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> right <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{blue and}} <b>his</b> left <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> green, a {{congenital}} condition known as heterochromia.|$|R
500|$|Because the American {{title was}} different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name {{had to be}} re-shot, once with the actors saying [...] "philosopher's" [...] and once with [...] "sorcerer's". The {{children}} filmed for four hours and then did three hours of schoolwork. They developed a liking for fake facial injuries from the makeup staff. Radcliffe was initially meant to wear green contact lenses as <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> blue, and not green like Harry's, but the lenses gave Radcliffe extreme irritation. Upon consultation with Rowling, {{it was agreed that}} Harry could have blue eyes.|$|E
500|$|New York {{plastic surgeon}} Dr. Pamela Lipkin, {{who has never}} treated Jackson or {{reviewed}} his medical records, said, [...] "when {{you look at the}} other features, the skin bleaching sort of goes along with what I think was his quest for beauty, so I have to wonder what came first? Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose is getting thinner every six months. His lips are getting thinner. His eyebrows are getting higher. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> getting wider every time. His cheekbones are getting bigger." ...|$|E
500|$|Dürer's father wears a dark shirt, russet {{coat and}} a black hat lined with fur. His skin is slack at the mouth and chin, and he has small, {{intelligent}} eyes, which Von Fircks describes as [...] "dark and serious". Their curves echo those of the heavy lids beneath. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> lined with crow's feet and shadowed with brown hatched paint. His facial features are built from brush strokes more typical of drawing than painting—at this young age Dürer was a far more skilled draughtsman than painter. Technical analysis carried out in 2013 by Dagmar Hirschfelder revealed a detailed background which was over-painted by the artist. The abandoned interior space consisted of a corner of a room with an arched window looking out to a countryside view. This type of interior {{can be traced to}} the Netherlandish tradition, and is rare in German portraiture of the period.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 23, 1910. It states: [...] "John Russell, an unsuccessful playwright, is in straitened circumstances, but is generous despite his poverty. When a poor woman falls exhausted at his doorway he takes her in, and after her death he cares for her child. This kind of action seems to bring him luck, for a play {{that he had been}} unable to dispose of is sold for a good sum and he starts on the high road to prosperity. Ten years later when the girl is grown to womanhood, John finds that he is deeply in love with his ward, but does not betray his passion, believing that it is hopeless. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> opened, however, by Will, who is in love with Grace, and is told by her when she refuses him that she loves John. When John hears this he promptly proposes and is as promptly accepted by the girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Nimoy, in {{addition}} to his directing duties, appears {{towards the end of the}} film as Spock, but only appears in the opening credits as the director. Nimoy found the most difficult scene to direct was one in which Leonard McCoy talks to the unconscious Spock in sickbay, en route to Vulcan. Nimoy recalled that not only was he in the scene, but <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> closed, making it difficult to judge the quality of the shot or the actor's performance: [...] "It drove DeForest Kelley crazy. He swears that I was trying to direct him with the movement and flutter of my eyelids." [...] Nimoy was thankful the story required him to appear in a minimal number of scenes. The rapidly aging Spock, at the ages of 9, 13, 17, and 25, was portrayed successively by Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis. Frank Welker provided Spock's screams, and Steve Blalock doubled for Nimoy, so that a total of seven actors contributed to the role.|$|E
500|$|Vincent {{is shown}} as a tall, lean {{young man with}} long black hair and a ragged red cloak and mantle over black underclothes. He wears a metallic, golden {{gauntlet}} on his left forearm. Vincent's cloak covers {{the lower half of}} his face and is held closed by a series of buckles. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> naturally red. His crimson cloak was added to symbolize the idea of Vincent carrying a heavy weight connected to death. While other characters were given simple costumes in Advent Children, Vincent was given something more complex. Nomura felt that changing his design to something complicated would [...] "conflict with his personality," [...] which is relatively straightforward, and he was thus given attire consisting of [...] "various, complex parts." [...] His cloak was difficult to animate due to it being very organic; the overall complexity of Vincent's design led to his scenes being [...] "especially hard to create." [...] These scenes were constantly being adjusted so as [...] "to convey [...] elusive nature of seemingly having shape, but not." [...] These adjustments concluded six months before the films completion.|$|E

500|$|By 1836, the Duchess's brother, Leopold, who {{had been}} King of the Belgians since 1831, hoped to marry his niece to his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Leopold, Victoria's mother, and Albert's father (Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) were siblings. Leopold {{arranged}} for Victoria's mother to invite her Coburg relatives to visit her in May 1836, {{with the purpose of}} introducing Victoria to Albert. William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of Prince Alexander of the Netherlands, second son of the Prince of Orange. Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes. According to her diary, she enjoyed Albert's company from the beginning. After the visit she wrote, [...] " [...] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful." [...] Alexander, on the other hand, was [...] "very plain".|$|E
500|$|By 1836, {{the idea}} of {{marriage}} between Albert and his cousin, Victoria, had arisen {{in the mind of}} their ambitious uncle Leopold, who had been King of the Belgians since 1831. At this time, Victoria was the heiress presumptive to the British throne. Her father, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III, had died when she was a baby, and her elderly uncle, King William IV, had no legitimate children. Her mother, the Duchess of Kent, was the sister of both Albert's father—the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha—and King Leopold. Leopold arranged for his sister, Victoria's mother, to invite the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his two sons to visit her in May 1836, with the purpose of meeting Victoria. William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of Prince Alexander, second son of the Prince of Orange. Victoria was well aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes. She wrote, [...] " [...] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful." [...] Alexander, on the other hand, she described as [...] "very plain".|$|E
500|$|Siegfried Kracauer said by {{coupling}} {{a fantasy}} in which Francis overthrows a tyrannical authority, with {{a reality in}} which authority triumphs over Francis, Caligari reflects a double aspect of German life, suggesting they reconsider their traditional belief in authority even as they embrace it. A contrast between levels of reality exists {{not only in the}} characterizations, but in the presentation of some of the scenes as well. This, as Barlow writes, [...] "reveals a contrast between external calm and internal chaos". For example, flashback scenes when Francis reads Dr. Caligari's diary, in which the doctor is shown growing obsessed with learning hypnotic powers, take place as Dr. Caligari is sleeping peacefully in the present. Another example is the fair, which on the surface appears to represent fun and escapism, but reveals a lurking sense of chaos and disaster in the form of Dr. Caligari and Cesare. The visual elements of the film also convey a sense of duality, particularly in the contrasts between black and white. This is particularly prevalent in the sets, where black shadows are set against white walls, but also in other elements like the costumes and make-up. For instance, Dr. Caligari wears mostly black, but white streaks are present in his hair and on his gloves. Cesare's face is a ghostly white, but the darks of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> heavily outlined in black. Likewise, Jane's white face contrasts with her deep, dark eyes.|$|E
