5|$|The {{surrounding}} area {{is dominated by}} mainly conifer forest, with broad-leafed birch and alder woods {{on some of the}} steeper banks and streams. An early 20th century analysis of vegetation cover in Kajaani county recorded 385 different species of vascular plants. Talaskangas Nature Reserve, with nearly pristine natural forest and about 50 different wildlife species, is in the Vieremä and Sonkajärvi local area. Logging was planned in the 1980s, but <b>environmental</b> <b>activists</b> prevented exploitation through lobbying. The reserve was formally established in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Matt {{looks for}} {{information}} about his sister Lisa and finds her zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains he and Lisa were <b>environmental</b> <b>activists,</b> and Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Queen's chamber, and the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit. To force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown. As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before getting killed. The group reaches safety, but Kaplan is bitten and separated.|$|E

25|$|The {{export of}} trees felled by {{cyclones}} is permitted, opening a loophole {{since the government}} never inventories downed trees. Thus, the timber barons export logs that have been harvested previously, claiming they were a result of storm damage—a technique historically employed by loggers in the United States and elsewhere. The high density of rosewood prevents them from blowing over in cyclones, leading <b>environmental</b> <b>activists</b> to believe the only purpose is to facilitate illegal logging.|$|E

Its original route has never been formally demapped, however. NY440 was realigned to follow the Willowbrook Expressway by 1970.|$|E
