40|$|Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits (GMWB) {{are popular}} riders in {{variable}} annuities with withdrawal guarantees. With withdrawals {{spread over the}} life of the annuities contract, the benefit promises to return the entire initial annuitization amount irrespective of the market performance of the underlying fund portfolio. Treating the dynamic withdrawal rate as the control variable, the earlier works on GMWB have considered the construction of a continuous singular stochastic control model and the numerical solution of the resulting pricing model. This paper presents a more detailed characterization of the pricing properties of the GMWB and performs a full mathematical analysis of the optimal dynamic withdrawal policies under the competing factors of time value of fund, optionality value provided by the guarantee and penalty charge on excessive withdrawal. When a proportional penalty charge is applied on any withdrawal amount, we can reduce the pricing formulation to an optimal stopping problem with lower and upper obstacles. We then derive the integral equations for the determination of a pair of optimal withdrawal boundaries. When a proportional penalty charge is applied on the amount that is above the contractual withdrawal rate, we manage to characterize the behavior of the optimal withdrawal boundaries that separate the domain of the pricing models into three regions: no withdrawal, continuous withdrawal at the contractual rate and an immediate withdrawal of a finite amount. Under certain limiting scenarios such as a high policy fund value, the time close to expiry, or a low value of <b>guarantee</b> <b>account,</b> we manage to obtain analytical approximate solution to the singular stochastic control model of dynamic withdrawals.

40|$|Although {{bank loans}} {{themselves}} are somewhat illiquid because of private information, {{most of their}} cashflows are not. Recent financial innovations allow commercial loans to be liquefied via credit derivatives and actual and synthetic securitizations. The loan originating bank holds the remaining illiquid equity tranche containing the concentrated credit risk, private information rent and the 'excess spread' that incentivize the bank to continue to monitor and service the loans. Empirically, {{we find that the}} average size of the equity tranche is about 3 % for the representative commercial loan portfolios in our sample. The liquefaction of bank loans makes possible a banking system that restricts the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>accounts</b> to be backed by 100 % reserves and the non-guaranteed deposits to be backed by liquid securitized loan tranches, while retaining the deposit-lending synergy. Such a system is perfectly safe without deposit insurance and it renders banks bankruptcy-remote without sacrificing a bank's traditional role as a financial intermediary.

40|$|Partial {{government}} {{guarantees of}} private financing {{can be an}} effective tool for maintaining public-private partnerships. Loan guarantees that cover {{some or all of the}} risk of repayment are frequently used by governments to pursue policy objectives–supporting priority infrastructure projects or corporations in financial distress. Studies show that guarantees are extremely valuable–the value of a guarantee increases with the risk of the underlying asset or credit, the size of the investment, and the time to maturity. The flip side of a guarantee’s value to a lender is a cost to the Government. Such a cost is not explicit, but is nevertheless real. To the extent, these liabilities have a subsidy component, careful risk sharing, valuation, and accounting mechanisms are important. This paper describes methods of guarantee valuation, reports estimates of guarantee values in different settings, and summarizes methods of <b>guarantee</b> <b>accounting</b> and their implications. While the old method recorded guarantees only when a default occurred, new methods seek to anticipate losses, create reserves, and channel funds through transparent accounts to ensure that costs of guarantees are evident to decision makers.

40|$|The aging {{populations in}} industrialized nations make it {{inevitable}} {{that social security}} systems {{will have to be}} restructured by 2020. This study examines models of privatized social security with and without government guarantees and inflation indexing as alternatives or addendums to the current system in the United States of America. We examine privatized social security {{from the perspective of a}} participant. If there are no guarantees, the participant is likely to invest in some diversified mix of stock and bond funds. Using an option pricing model we show that if the government guarantees the principal, rational participants will shift their entire contribution to the riskiest fund available for investment, which in turn will maximize the cost of providing the guarantee. We find that the cost of the guarantee is substantially lower for younger participants than for older participants if the guaranteed principal is not indexed for inflation, but the difference is small if the guaranteed principal is indexed for inflation. Our findings suggest that the government needs to offer only one mix of funds for investment in <b>guaranteed</b> <b>accounts,</b> and to minimize guarantee costs, it would guarantee only the principal. Alternatively, it could take a more age-neutral approach by guaranteeing the inflation-indexed principal...|$|R

40|$|The {{functionality}} of packet processing applications {{is often}} partitioned into pipeline stages; these stages are allocated {{a subset of}} the multiple processors available in a packet processing system. The workload, and hence the processing requirement, for each pipeline stage fluctuates over time. Adapting processor allocations to pipeline stages at run-time can improve robustness of the system to traffic fluctuations, can reduce processor provisioning requirement of the system, and can conserve energy. In this paper, we present an on-line algorithm for adapting processor allocations while ensuring that the additional delay suffered by packets as a result of adaptation is deterministically bounded. The resulting Processor Allocation Algorithm (PAL) is simple, but it allocates only as many processors to stages as needed to meet packet delay <b>guarantees,</b> <b>accounts</b> for system reconfiguration overheads, and copes with the unpredictability of packet arrival patterns. A key contribution of PAL is its generality; it captures the adaptation opportunities in the system as a finite state automaton (FSA) —the methodology for constructing the FSA can be applied to a variety of application requirements and system configurations. We demonstrate that for a set of trace workloads PAL can reduce processor provisioning level by 30 - 50 %, reduce energy consumption by 60 - 70 % while increasing the average packet processing delay by less than 150 µs. We describe our prototype implementation for Intel’s IXP 2400 -based packet processing system. ...|$|R
