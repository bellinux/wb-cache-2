40|$|In the {{political}} climate in Australia today, collective guilt is an explosive issue, with varying strong opinions on both sides. However, research {{suggests that it is}} an important issue. In the American setting, it has been linked with support for compensatory affirmative action (Iyer et al., 2003). In the Australian setting, it has been linked with support for a government apology to Indigenous- Australians, as well as to perceived non-Indigenous responsibility for harsh treatment of Indigenous people (McGarty, et al., under review). Regardless of the above relationships, studies indicate that relatively few people report feeling a sense of collective guilt; therefore the ‘guilt’ angle may be an uphill battle. However, what I will argue is that if activists do engage in discussions about collective guilt, they need to specify the level of guilt they are referring to. There is a clear difference between <b>feeling</b> personally <b>guilty</b> for committing injustices against Indigenous-Australians, and <b>feeling</b> collectively <b>guilty</b> for the injustices Australia has - and is - committing.
