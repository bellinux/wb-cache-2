5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El País. The comedian turned mayor of Reykjavík, Iceland, Jón Gnarr, has gone so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that he would not}} enter a coalition government with anyone who has not watched the series.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears a {{striking}} resemblance to that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic accident in a small town, is sentenced to work at the town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} talk of {{building}} a replica of the memorial. On 31 May 2008 on Anzac Parade, Canberra, the formal dedication of a site in which will be placed a new national Boer War memorial was held. A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: going so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that {{they would be willing to}} accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.|$|E

5000|$|However, the {{breaking}} point comes when Katie is crying and screaming almost nonstop for about two days, and Scott can't figure out why, going <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> {{walking out of the}} room on her saying, [...] "I don't know what you want!" [...] He takes her into the hospital the next day to find out she had been suffering from a hernia. After being probed by the doctor on why she wasn't brought in sooner, he confessed he didn't know what to do, going so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> he thought she was just being fussy. The doctor then asked him if he realizes what could've happened to her had he ignored her one more day. A look of fear comes over his face as realization sets in.|$|R
5|$|On 22 July 2010, reports {{surfaced}} {{suggesting that}} English club Newcastle United {{were looking to}} sign Ben Arfa. After being questioned, Newcastle's manager Chris Hughton denied the reports. Five days later, Ben Arfa's agent declared that Newcastle were indeed interested in the player, along with German clubs Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen, Turkish club Galatasaray, and Italian club A.C. Milan. On 9 August, a season-long loan with an option to make the move permanent was reportedly being negotiated between the two clubs. However, a loan-fee for the deal {{could not be reached}} with Newcastle offering £650,000; £350,000 short of what Marseille wanted. On 12 August, Marseille president Jean-Claude Dassier announced that Ben Arfa would not be moving to Newcastle and even went as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that an offer from the club had not even existed.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{sense in}} which this kind of {{additivity}} expresses a fundamental postulate that goes beyond the simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{was killed}} during the coup, both the CUP and Freedom and Accord claimed {{that they had been}} {{planning}} to give Minister of the Navy Nazım Pasha a position in their next cabinet.

6000|$|The old man grumbled a {{good deal}} at first, but was finally so <b>far</b> mollified <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> less testily, while {{he put on his}} hat, [...] "I warrant me, young man, you are come on some wild-goose chase to this out-o'-the-way region of the land in search of the picturesque--eh?--a dauber on canvas?" ...|$|R

25|$|Many {{midwives}} of {{the time}} bitterly opposed the involvement of men in childbirth. Some male practitioners also opposed the involvement of medical men like themselves in midwifery, and even went as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that men-midwives only undertook midwifery solely for perverse erotic satisfaction. The accoucheurs argued that their involvement in midwifery was to improve the process of childbirth. These men also believed that obstetrics would forge ahead and continue to strengthen.|$|E
25|$|In September 1640 he {{conveyed}} {{to the king}} at York the petition of the London clergy against the 'etcetera oath', and succeeded in getting it dispensed with. Clarendon in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the influence of Burges and Stephen Marshall was greater with both houses of parliament than that of Laud had ever been with the court, a statement which, as Edmund Calamy the Elder observes, 'carries a pretty strong figure in it'.|$|E
25|$|Scotland Office {{minister}} David Mundell, {{the only}} Scottish Conservative MP, initially {{said that it}} would 'take a very great deal of convincing' to make him support the idea, however later came out in stark opposition to the plan, calling it 'betrayal' and stated that he would still run as a Conservative at the next general election whether or not Fraser was successful. Several other senior Conservative figures, including Norman Tebbit and Daniel Hannan supported Fraser's plan, and Daily Mail journalist Peter Hitchens went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this idea should be adopted by the whole UK Conservative Party in order to re-claim support.|$|E
60|$|You {{must know}} that English people had lived in this land of Virginia before we came here in 1606, and while it does not concern us of Jamestown, except as we are {{interested}} in knowing the fate of our countrymen, it should be set down, lest we so <b>far</b> forget <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that those of us who}} have built this village are the first settlers in the land.|$|R
5000|$|Christine's 3-year-old cousin. Momoka often rides her tricycle, {{and she is}} in {{love with}} Ruu, declaring that he is her boyfriend, going <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> that she wants to get married to him. Momoka has a grudge against Miyu and other older girls; she often calls them obā-chan, or [...] "Madam" [...] - a title used for an elderly woman or a grandmother, which infuriates Miyu. She appears to like Kanata very much, however, admitting he is cute and calling him [...] "Kanata onii-chan". Momoka learns Miyu and Kanata's secret about aliens in their house in the episode [...] "Momoka's Passport", when she saw Ruu fly up to {{recapture}} a balloon. From Episodes 4 to 30, she insists that men and women, no matter what their ages are, do not cry, but in Episode 31, it may be revealed that she was lying about that, saying that it's all right to cry, and viewers can tell by {{the look on her face}} when she cried with Ruu and Wannya, who are dressed as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus, respectively, in the show's first Christmas episode.|$|R
5000|$|Channel 4 news {{stated that}} [...] "boys [...] have gone {{well beyond the}} {{curriculum}} {{to take part in}} cutting-edge scientific experiments; plasma physics, space satellites and medical research", and even went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the school had [...] "outwitted NASA" [...] with the LUCID project.|$|R
25|$|If {{a search}} or seizure is {{unlawful}} under the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 {{then it is}} also likely to be considered an unreasonable search or seizure. However, the concepts of unlawfulness and unreasonableness are independent and it is therefore possible that, for example, a lawful search can be unreasonable. Despite this, the courts have said that in terms of the most common remedy of exclusion of evidence an unlawful search should usually be considered an unreasonable search. Elias CJ went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that unlawful searches should automatically be unreasonable. An exception is that where the search is only unlawful on minor or technical grounds it may still be reasonable.|$|E
25|$|When the American Civil War broke out, the Blackwell sisters aided {{in nursing}} efforts. Blackwell sympathized heavily with the North {{due to her}} {{abolitionist}} roots, and even went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> she would have left the country if the North had compromised {{on the subject of}} slavery. However, Blackwell did meet with some resistance {{on the part of the}} male-dominated United States Sanitary Commission. The male physicians refused to help with the nurse education plan if it involved the Blackwells. In response to the USSC, Blackwell organized with the Woman's Central Relief Association. The WCRA worked against the problem of uncoordinated benevolence, but ultimately was absorbed by the USSC. Still, the New York Infirmary managed to work with Dorothea Dix to train nurses for the Union effort.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{violence}} of the second intifada and the political success of Hamas (a group dedicated to Israel's destruction) have convinced many Israelis that peace and negotiation are not possible and a two state system is not the answer. Hardliners believe that Israel should annex all Palestinian territory, or at least all minus the Gaza Strip. Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and do not trust Palestinian leadership to maintain control. In fact, Pedahzur goes as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that suicide terrorism succeeded where peace negotiations failed in encouraging withdrawal by Israelis from cities in the West Bank. A common theme throughout the peace process has been a feeling that the Palestinians give too little in their peace offers.|$|E

Bill and Carolyn were astounded by Lee's poor business logic, but Trump stated (after the boardroom) that he admired Lee for his loyalty.|$|R
5000|$|Official Xbox Magazine (UK) {{gave the}} game a 1 out of 10, calling it an [...] "astroturd" [...] of a game.

60|$|On my {{rising in}} the morning my {{preparations}} were soon made; or, rather, there were practically no preparations to make. I had but to supply myself with a camera, my one necessity in the woods, and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> my friends. Even this last ordeal I wished <b>to</b> make <b>as</b> brief as possible. I {{had no wish to}} arouse their anxiety over the dangerous, perhaps foolhardy, project that I had in mind.

25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he thought Darwin was right.|$|E
25|$|It is {{considered}} to be an outstanding edible species with a distinctively sweet or nutty flavor. However, great caution must be exercised to properly identify it, as the deadly Amanita ocreata (and occasionally Amanita phalloides) is also found in the same habitat at the same time of year, and can often be found in close proximity to each other. A. ocreata and A. phalloides have thin universal veil remnants, a sac-like volva, an annulus, a non-striate pileus margin, and a pileus that is a different color than A. velosa. These differences can fade as the fruiting body ages, making it important to collect only specimens that have all of their identifying characteristics intact. Some authorities go so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no Amanita should be considered for eating.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{the extent}} of his empire vary greatly. The Burmese and Thai chronicles report an empire which covered the present-day Burma and {{northern}} Thailand. The Thai chronicles assert that Anawrahta conquered the entire Menam valley, and received tribute from the Khmer king. One states that Anawrahta's armies invaded the Khmer kingdom and sacked the city of Angkor, and another one goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Anawrahta even visited Java to receive his tribute. However, Western historians (Harvey, Hall, et al) present a much smaller empire, consisted of the Irrawaddy valley and nearer periphery. His victory terracotta votive tablets (emblazoned with his name in Sanskrit) have been found along the Tenasserim coastline in the south, Katha in the north, Thazi in the east and Minbu in the west.|$|E

25|$|Traditionalist Catholics {{other than}} sedevacantists {{recognize}} as legitimate {{the line of}} Popes leading to and including Pope Francis. Some of them hold that {{one or more of}} the most recent popes have held and taught unorthodox beliefs, but do not go so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that they have been formal heretics or have been widely and publicly judged to be heretics. Sedevacantists, on the other hand, claim that the infallible Magisterium of the Catholic Church could not have decreed the changes made in the name of the Second Vatican Council, and conclude that those who issued these changes could not have been acting with the authority of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, they hold that Pope Paul VI and his successors left the true Catholic Church and thus lost legitimate authority in the Church. A formal heretic, they say, cannot be the Catholic pope.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the troops}} types, {{it is unknown}} {{whether or not the}} Persian {{infantry}} engaged in the battle. It is most likely Cyrus and the cavalry he had escaped with from Media fought directly with the Median cavalry Astyages had sent to bring Cyrus back. Cyrus might have known he needed all his men when fighting Astyages's best cavalry, for when battle had started, Cyrus with his will and superior numbers had the advantage. Nicolas goes as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Cyrus first displayed his bravery in this battle. Nevertheless, Cyrus's tactics proved successful in maintaining the war. In Herodotus' Histories, he hints the first battle between the Persians and Medes, which Harpagus goes over to Cyrus, and most of the Medes either joined Cyrus or were killed, with a small force escaping back to Media. This seems to go in accordance with Nicolaus' account of the first battle.|$|E
25|$|A brief {{notice on}} Boudet's book, written by French prehistorian {{specialist}} Émile Cartailhac, {{a member of}} the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude and of the Société archéologique du Midi de la France was published in 1892 in the Revue des Pyrenées. Unsympathetic to Boudet's works, Cartailhac asked the local archeologists to be cautious about the claims of a gullible priest, author he said of the ridiculous book La Vrai langue celtique. In 1893, Cartailhac's notice was used by Gaston Jourdanne for his introduction of Boudet's book to the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude. Citing various renowned authorities, including a work by his friend, a well known Celtic expert, Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Jourdanne demonstrated the errors of Boudet's researches and conclusions. Jourdanne's harsh criticism went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Boudet's study was worthy at most of publication in the British satirical magazine Punch.|$|E
60|$|HER HUSBAND. Don't overdo it, old chap.

Come! own up. You wrote those poems to my wife. [An internal struggle prevents Henry from answering]. Of course you did. [He throws the poems on the table; and goes to the hearthrug, where he plants himself solidly, chuckling a little and waiting for the next move].|$|R

The paragraph was probably inspired, but it spoke plainly, going so <b>far,</b> even, <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the loan had probably averted a revolution. The man who had saved the monarchy of an ancient nation was Rosario. One of his rewards, I think, was to have been a title and a distinguished order; it was understood among us that this was the real bait. Rosario's actual reward you know of." ...|$|R
