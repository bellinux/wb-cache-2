500|$|Shortly after Xenogears was released, {{there was}} {{speculation}} of a sequel being released, although this never occurred. In 1999, Tanaka {{said that a}} project related to Xenogears was being developed. He also revealed that a sequel to Xenogears was initially planned, but never came to be. While Xenogears has never had an official sequel or prequel, there was wide speculation that Namco and Monolith Soft's Xenosaga was a prequel {{when it was first}} announced. Tetsuya Takahashi was the director and writer for both Xenogears and Xenosaga and has noted that [...] "with our relation between Square, I think it is difficult <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it is a direct sequel or prequel". Approximately twenty members of the Xenosaga development staff had previously worked on Xenogears.|$|E

[...] The quality of the music, the precision of its drills, and the fine image that it portrays have made it unnecessary <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more than, 'This is the Auburn University Band.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{song on the}} album, [...] "Let God Be God", {{was written}} by Dan Dean in {{response}} to global instability. Dean stated that [...] "This is the perfect time <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Don't panic. God is in control. Jesus asks in Luke 12:25: Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?" [...] One of the edgier songs the band has recorded, the song even has a James Brown scream, which Dean originally recorded to be funny, but it eventually stuck.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the purpose}} of this appeal it is enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> merely <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Parliament may amend the Constitution in any way they think fit, {{provided}} they comply with all the conditions precedent and subsequent regarding manner and form prescribed by the Constitution itself.|$|R

5000|$|On 9 February, Ghonim {{addressed}} the crowds in Tahrir Square, telling the protesters: [...] "This {{is not the}} time for individuals, or parties, or movements. It's a time <b>for</b> all of <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just one thing: Egypt above all." ...|$|R
2500|$|Additional {{television}} commercials {{are expected to}} follow the Super Bowl spot, which are to demonstrate Switch's use cases among different demographics, as well as [...] "casual" [...] and [...] "core" [...] gaming audiences. Such ad venues included the 2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, and on programming blocks for Nickelodeon, Adult Swim, and Comedy Central. Chavez emphasized that Nintendo's overall marketing for Switch would not be [...] "just a six to eight week launch campaign", but [...] "really a 15 month campaign <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing of our plans for 2018".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was here}} once before when we bailed out Mexico with the NAFTA treaty. The peso was falling apart. I {{was down in}} Mexico doing shows, drug dealers and cartels everywhere, {{and we were going}} to lend them billions of dollars. [...] And I went to President Clinton myself and then Attorney General Janet Reno, and I said we need one thing. If we are going to bail Mexico out, let us make them sign an {{extradition}} treaty of fugitives, murders, criminals and get our kids back from Mexico. Right? Did not happen. What a perfect time <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we are going to save your entire country, we are going to lend you billions of dollars and shore up your economy, but you know what, since that meeting with President Clinton we now have on record over 3,000 murders and fugitives down there and we do not know how many kids".|$|E
2500|$|Voltairine de Cleyre was an anarchist without {{adjectives}} {{who initially}} identified {{herself as an}} individualist anarchist but later espoused a collectivist form of anarchism, while refusing to identify herself {{with any of the}} contemporary schools. ("The best thing ordinary workingmen or women could do was to organise their industry to get rid of money altogether [...] [...] [...] Let them produce together, co-operatively rather than as employer and employed; let them fraternise group by group, let each use what he needs of his own product, and deposit the rest in the storage-houses, and let those others who need goods have them as occasion arises.") She commented that [...] "Socialism and Communism both demand a degree of joint effort and administration which would beget more regulation than is wholly consistent with ideal Anarchism; Individualism and Mutualism, resting upon property, involve a development of the private policeman not at all compatible with my notion of freedom" [...] although she stopped short of denouncing these tendencies as un-anarchistic. ("There is nothing un-Anarchistic about any of [...] until the element of compulsion enters and obliges unwilling persons to remain in a community whose economic arrangements they do not agree to.") [...] Errico Malatesta was another proponent of anarchism without adjectives, stating that [...] "t is not right <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the least, to fall into strife over mere hypotheses." ...|$|E
6000|$|All things considered, I {{could not}} help looking upon Taloo as {{offering}} [...] "a splendid opening" [...] <b>for</b> <b>us</b> adventurers. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> nothing of the facilities presented for going to sea in the whaler, or hiring ourselves out as day labourers in the sugar plantation, there were hopes to be entertained of being promoted to some office of high trust and emolument about the person of her majesty, the queen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I might {{differ from}} you there, {{and say that}} the higher blonde types like the Anglo-Saxon--to say nothing of the wily Greeks--were the {{deceitful}} races: it might be difficult <b>for</b> any of <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what a sly and deceitful man should be like"-- ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seems an}} easy thing <b>for</b> <b>us</b> here <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'I believe in God.' We have learnt from our {{childhood}} that there is but one God. It seems <b>to</b> <b>us</b> strange and ridiculous that people anywhere should believe in more gods than one. We never heard of any other doctrine, except in books about the heathen; and there are perhaps not three people in this church who ever saw a heathen man, or talked to him.|$|R
6000|$|It {{would not}} have been safe <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he was mistaken, but we knew he was. Nikolaus said, [...] "We ask pardon for the mistake, but we meant to say seven." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will {{certainly}} be the best plan," [...] Pinkerton agreed; [...] "but I {{think it would be}} as well <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he has left for family reasons, and that it is nothing in any way connected with himself, and that we hope that he will be back again next term." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no use {{standing}} here {{talking about that}} Kelly boy," [...] Maria Gilman said, at last. [...] "The bell will ring, and we sha'n't have anything settled. The question is, {{what are we going}} to do? Of course it is foolish <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that we can have very much of 'a party if all the boys stay away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{notion of}} turning schoolmaster," [...] said Young, {{with a faint}} smile; [...] "it was your notion, Adams. However, I've no {{objection}} to fall in with it, and I quite agree about carrying the Bible home with <b>us,</b> <b>for,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> truth, I don't feel the climbing of the mountain as easy as I used to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{could hardly}} love any one better; {{there is nothing}} but what I love you for." [...] She paused a little while, and then added: [...] "But {{it will be better}} <b>for</b> <b>us</b> not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> any more about it, won't it, dear Philip? You know we couldn't even be friends, if our {{friendship}} were discovered. I have never felt that I was right in giving way about seeing you, though it has been so precious to me in some ways; and now the fear comes upon me strongly again, that it will lead to evil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He stopped, though, at {{the place}} he had fixed on; {{and held out his}} hand to me, and said these words: 'I've done my duty by you, Zack, as brother should by brother. The time's come at last <b>for</b> <b>us</b> two <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Good-bye. You're going back over the sea to your friends, and I'm going inland by myself on the tramp.' I had heard him talk of our parting in this way before, but had never thought it would really take place; and I tried hard, as you may imagine, to make him change his mind, and sail for England with me. But it was useless.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is well <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so, lad; but, as I tell you, white honor {{will not}} always conform to reason {{or to the}} will of God. I have passed days {{thinking}} of these matters, out in the silent woods, and I have come to the opinion, boy, that, as Providence rules all things, no gift is bestowed without some wise and reasonable end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's easy done, Mr. Montgomery," [...] {{said the}} fat-voiced publican. [...] "But before sayin' {{anything}} {{we had to}} wait and see whether, in a way of speakin', there was any need <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything at all. Mr. Wilson thinks there is. Mr. Fawcett, who has the same right to his opinion, bein' also a backer and one o' the committee, thinks the other way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has sold}} out {{and left the}} district. The old devil left a note <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he had rather be a free {{crossing}} sweeper in New York than a large mine owner under {{the power of a}} ring of blackmailers. By Gar! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us! I guess he won't show his face in this valley again." ...|$|E
60|$|A strict regard <b>for</b> truth obliges <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} few women whom {{we saw that}} day looked {{exceedingly}} pinched up. They had prominent chins and noses, having lost all their teeth, and a sharp W would represent their profile. They were not so well preserved as their husbands; or perchance they were well preserved as dried specimens. (Their husbands, however, were pickled.) But we respect them not the less for all that; our own dental system is far from perfect.|$|R
60|$|As for the Esquimaux, {{they gave}} {{themselves}} up, {{during the first}} night, to feasting and rejoicing. During the short time {{that they had been}} at the fort, they had converted the promontory on which they were encamped into a scene of the utmost confusion and filth. A regard <b>for</b> truth constrains <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that although these poor creatures turned out to be honest, and simple, and kind-hearted, they did not by any means turn out to be cleanly; quite the reverse.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Luther {{distinguished}} {{this doctrine}} {{from that of}} transubstantiation and impanation in this way: ... we do not make Christ's body out of the bread ... Nor do we say that his body comes into existence out of the bread impanation. We say that his body, which long ago was made and came into existence, is present when we say, [...] "This is my body." [...] <b>For</b> Christ commands <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> not, [...] "Let this become my body," [...] or, [...] "Make my body there," [...] but, [...] "This is my body." ...|$|R

Judgin' from the way you speak, you don't know who we are, or you'd be jumpin' up to shake hands an' offer us seats. Kings usually treat us pretty well, in the great big Outside World where we come from, but in this little kingdom--which don't amount to much, anyhow--folks don't seem to 'a' got much culchure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it's our business--my business. We {{allowed her}} to get in for it. She's quite right about it. We must not let him commit himself to her till he knows the thing that most puts her to shame. It isn't enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that it was really}} no shame. She feels that it casts a sort of stain--you know what I mean, Sarah, and I believe I can make this young man know. If I can't, so much the worse for him. He shall never see Ellen again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was needless <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything, {{to explain}} {{the state of our}} {{feelings}} toward each other. That tale was told by the delight with which we met. When I asked her how she came to be there, she told me that about an hour before, while sitting in front of her father's mansion, she had felt something gently pulling at her skirts; and, although at first frightened, she was at length impelled to obey the impulse, and, without knowing whether it was the wind or some supernatural force which had led her here, she had come.|$|E

We shared some technology with Naughty Dog way back when, and that was great, but we are a company that puts stock in developing specialized technology {{and we will continue to}} do so."

6000|$|... 'It is easy <b>for</b> <b>us</b> now <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that some}} of the early English Missions, without {{thinking}} at all about it, in all probability, sought to impose an English line of thought and religion on Indians and Africans. Even English dress was thought to be almost essential, and English habits, &c., were regarded as part of the education of persons converted through the agency of English Missions. All this seems to be burdening the message of the Gospel with unnecessary difficulties. The teacher everywhere, in England or out of it, must learn to discriminate between essentials and non-essentials. It seems to me self-evident that the native scholar must be educated up to the highest point that is possible, and that unless one is (humanly speaking) quite sure that he can and will reproduce faithfully the simple teaching he has received, he ought not to teach, much less to be ordained.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, {{the movie}} Brother 2 (Brat 2) was released, with Bodrov again playing Danila Bagrov. Critics {{attacked}} the movie {{as they had}} its predecessor, saying that it expressed racist ideas, threatened national security and insulted the Ukrainian and American nations. Bodrov responded: What was important <b>for</b> <b>us</b> was not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that all Americans are jerks, but the opposite, {{that we are not}} freaks. This is a fairly simple idea, so it is strange that not everyone understands it. The Americans make movies about Russians where Schwarzenegger as a policeman tears off a mafioso's wooden leg and drugs fall out of it, and bears are walking in the streets. In other words, we Russians are complete lame-brains. So why don't we have the right make a joke {{at the expense of the}} Americans? ...|$|R
6000|$|Mother Anastasia gave a sigh. [...] "The {{unreasonableness}} of men {{is something}} inexplicable. Perhaps you think I am {{not old enough}} to give you advice, but I will say that, for your own sake, you ought to crush and obliterate the feelings you have toward our sister; {{and if you do}} not choose to do it for your own sake, you ought to do it for her sake and that of our sisterhood. It makes it extremely awkward <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the least of it, to {{know that there is a}} gentleman in the village who is in love with one of the sisters of the House of Martha." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{mentioning}} some {{of these}} nests, it will be needless <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> much of those with which we are all familiar. In our rambles together we must try and see as many novelties as possible, for we may not always have the chance of wandering freely into {{any part of the}} world to which our fancy may lead us. I remember a little girl who used to come to our house when I was a boy, and who never cared for anything at table that was not something of a novelty to her. When offered potatoes, she would frankly say: [...] "No, thank you; I can get them at home." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{indebted to}} Marian's quick {{perception}} for meeting this necessity at once {{by the best}} and simplest means. She proposed to write to the farm near Limmeridge (Todd's Corner), to inquire whether Mrs. Clements had communicated with Mrs. Todd {{during the past few}} months. How Mrs. Clements had been separated from Anne it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but that separation once effected, it would certainly occur to Mrs. Clements to inquire after the missing woman in the neighbourhood of all others to which she was known to be most attached--the neighbourhood of Limmeridge. I saw directly that Marian's proposal offered us a prospect of success, and she wrote to Mrs. Todd accordingly by that day's post.|$|E
5000|$|Part Four of [...] "Some Informal Remarks" [...] is {{the novel}} Neveryóna, and Part Five is the AIDS novella, [...] "The Tale of Plagues and Carnivals". Starting with Trouble of Triton, the “Informal Remarks” are {{constituted}} by the sections {{in which the}} doubling (discussed earlier in this article) has most to do with writing. In [...] "Closures and Openings” (in Return to Nevèrÿon), section 15 discusses the Modular Calculus directly, for those who need a helping hand or who have not carefully pursued the notion for themselves through all the [...] "Informal Remarks". As Delany puts it in another interview, [...] "The Second Science Fiction Studies Interview", he quotes from [...] "The Informal Remarks, Part II" [...] (the second appendix to Trouble on Triton), [...] "How can one relational system model another? [...] [...] [...] What must pass from system-A <b>to</b> System-B <b>for</b> <b>us</b> (system-C) <b>to</b> be able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that system-B now contains some model of system-A? [...] [...] [...] Granted the proper passage, what must be the internal structure of system-B <b>for</b> <b>us</b> (or it) <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it contains any model of system-A?”. In the interview Delany goes on to answer his own question: “The question encompasses the semiotic situation, since {{the answer to the}} second part of the question ("What must pass from system-A to System-B...") is some form of the answer ‘signs’; and the answer to the third part ("...what must be the internal structure of system-B <b>for</b> <b>us</b> (or it) <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it contains any model of system-A?”) is: [...] "Clearly it must be of an internal structure that allows it to interpret signs—i.e., its internal structure must be one that allows it to perform some sort of semiosis." [...] To the extent that Return to Nevèrÿon deals with narrativity and writing, this would explain one of Delany's most often quoted comments about this major project, that Return to Nevèrÿon was conceived as [...] "a child’s garden of semiotics." ...|$|R
6000|$|To {{the good}} Dame's astonishment {{and that of}} Mr. Delaplaine, Kate spoke up very promptly.

After all, it might be as safe <b>for</b> <b>us</b> on board his ship as to be on a {{merchantman}} and be captured by pirates, which would be likely enough in those regions where we are obliged to go; and so I say let us see the man, and if he don't frighten us too much let us sail with him and get my father and Dickory." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Royal Coachman {{was first}} made by John Haily a {{professional}} fly dresser living in New York City. In writing of other matters, he enclosed this fly <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see, <b>saying</b> [...] "A gentleman {{wanted me to}} tie up some Coachman {{for him to take}} to the north woods and to make them extra strong, so I have tied them with a little band of silk in the middle to prevent the peacock bodies from fraying out. I have also added a tail of the barred feathers of the wood-duck, and I think it makes a very handsome fly." [...] A few evenings later, a circle of us were together [...] "disputing the fly in question", one of the party claiming that numbers were [...] "quite as suitable to designate the flies as so many nonsensical names". The others did not agree with him, but he said: [...] "What can you do? Here is a fly intended to be a Coachman; {{but it is not the}} true Coachman; it is quite unlike it and what can you call it?" [...] Mr. L. C. Orvis, brother of Mr. Charles Orvis, who was present said: [...] "Oh that is easy enough; call it the Royal Coachman it is so finely dressed!" [...] And this name in time came to be known and used by all who are familiar with the fly.|$|R
