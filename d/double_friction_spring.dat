Specifically, two new airless polyurethane foam tires (circular and tapered cross-section) {{were compared to}} both a molded polyisoprene tire and a rubber pneumatic tire. Rolling resistance, coefficient of static <b>friction,</b> <b>spring</b> rate, tire roll-off, impact absorp-tion, wear resistance, and resistance to compression set were the characteristics considered for the basis of comparison. Although the pneumatic tire is preferred by many wheelchair users, the two new polyurethane foam tires were found to offer a performance similar to the high-pressure pneumatic tire. In addition, the foam tires are less expensive and lighter in weight than the other tires tested.

These nonlinearities need to be to estimated either for better control or to use the parameters for diagnosis of the system. There {{is a lot of}} work done within system identification and mainly within the field of iterative parameter estimation. This thesis considers recursive grey-box identification for a nonlinear model of the transmission in an industrial robot. The nonlinearities that are identified are <b>friction,</b> <b>spring</b> stiffnes, hysteresis and backlash. These nonlinearities {{are a part of the}} models that are presented in this thesis. Apart from models there is a need for some sort of algorithm for the identification and some different recursive algorithms are presented. The main subject of this thesis is the identification of parameters and the excitation signals needed for the identification of each parameter. The models and algorithms presented in this thesis work in a principle point of view. Despite this they work in varying extent for the different types of parameters. Estimation of linear and nonlinear <b>friction</b> and linear <b>spring</b> stiffnes works relatively well. Nonlinear spring stiffnes and hysteresis have not been possible to estimate. Backlash which is estimated with a hybrid variant of a RPEM which is not fully recursive works best. When it is not possible to identify the parameters suggestions on other solutions are given, such as for example extension of the model, use of other algorithms or optimization of the excitation signal...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Typically, freecoasters {{are used}} in BMX street-riding applications. The freecoaster is a {{mechanism}} found in the rear hub of a bicycle which allows a bicycle to roll backwards without the bikes' pedals having to move along with it. This may not seem important for the casual bike rider, but this is crucial for the successful completion of many BMX tricks. Currently the mechanism that performs this action is accomplished through an unreliable <b>friction</b> <b>spring,</b> coupled with a cone and driver. These components along with others and combined with hardware such as nuts and bearings comprise the rear hub of the bicycle. Therefore, {{the focus of our}} design will be primarily to increase the reliability of this design.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and design of}} a multiple residential building, seismically protected by a base isolation system incorporating <b>double</b> <b>friction</b> pendulum sliders as protective devices, are presented in the paper. The building, situated in the suburban area of Florence, is composed of four independent reinforced concrete framed structures, mutually separated by three thermal expansion joints. The plan is L-shaped, with dimensions of about 75 [*]m in the longitudinal direction and about 30 [*]m along the longest side of the transversal direction. These characteristics identify the structure as the largest example of a base-isolated “artificial ground” ever built in Italy. The base isolation solution guarantees lower costs, a much greater performance, and a finer architectural look, as compared to a conventional fixed-base antiseismic design. The characteristics {{of the building and}} the isolators, the mechanical properties and the experimental characterization campaign and preliminary sizing carried out on the latter, and the nonlinear time-history design and performance assessment analyses developed on the base isolated building are reported in this paper, along with details about the installation of the isolators and the plants and highlights of the construction works...|$|R

Though a significant improvement over the extractor of the Model 1865 Springfield Rifle, the Model 1866 extractor was still excessively complicated and the extractor spring somewhat prone to breakage. However, it is a misconception that a broken extractor disabled the weapon. In the official 1867 government user booklet “Description and Rules for the Management of the Springfield Breech-Loading Rifle Musket, Model 1866”, the following is stated regarding a broken extractor and/or ejector: “It should be understood that the ejector and <b>friction</b> <b>springs</b> are convenient rather than necessary, and that the piece is not necessarily disabled if {{one or both of}} them should break, for the shell can be easily removed by the fingers after being loosened by the extractor hook.” Furthermore, the “ramrod” of the rifle can be used quite effectively to remove a stuck case in an emergency. Thus it is clear that this weapon is not as easily disabled as is sometimes believed.|$|R

The building was assumed as a benchmark structure for a Research Project financed by the Italian Department of Civil Protection, and is representative of several similar public edifices designed with earlier Technical Standards editions, in Italy {{as well as in}} other earthquake-prone European countries. The two solutions refer to the alternative earthquake protection strategies based on the concepts of supplemental damping and seismic isolation, respectively. Namely, they consist in the installation of: (1) a dissipative bracing system incorporating pressurized fluid viscous spring-dampers; and (2) a base isolation system including <b>double</b> <b>friction</b> pendulum sliding bearings. The structural characteristics of the building, and a synthesis of the investigation campaigns developed on it, are initially presented. The mechanical parameters, dimensions, locations and installation details of the constituting elements of the two protective systems are then illustrated, along with the performance assessment analyses carried out in original and rehabilitated conditions according to a full non-linear dynamic approach. The results of the analyses show a remarkable enhancement of the seismic response capacities of the structure for both retrofit hypotheses. This allows reaching the mutual high performance levels postulated in the two rehabilitation designs with remarkably lower costs and architectural intrusion as compared to traditional rehabilitation interventions designed for the same objectives. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
