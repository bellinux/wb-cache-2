5|$|It {{is usually}} easy to {{recognise}} {{that a particular}} insect is a bee. They differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (bristles), combs on the forelimbs <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> their antennae, small anatomical differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings, and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can improve}} {{strategies}} for monitoring {{the impact of}} pollutants on ecosystems and <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> up contaminated environments. Increased understanding of how microbial communities cope with pollutants improves assessments of the potential of contaminated sites to recover from pollution and increases the chances of bioaugmentation or biostimulation trials to succeed.|$|E

5|$|Other {{characters}} {{developed by}} Barbery {{in the novel}} include Kakuro Ozu, the cultured Japanese businessman, and Manuela, a Portuguese cleaner. Ozu, a tenant, shares Paloma's fascination with Renée's masked intelligence and brings {{her out of her}} shell (and also happens to set the entire book in forward motion), while Manuela is responsible <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> the apartments' toilets and is Renée's only real friend.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush. The size of these would be appropriate <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{products}} {{closely related to}} shoe polish, but not strictly considered as such.

5|$|In July 1995, the {{sculpture}} {{was removed from}} its pedestal and shipped to Stellar Artworks in Van Nuys, California <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> and restoration. It received a glassbead peening to remove the effects of birds, human hands, pollution and precipitation, plus a coat of incralac, a lacquer-based acrylic resin coating. The restoration was funded by an anonymous donor and involved Art Work Fine Art Services, Industrial Craters & Packers, O'Neill Transfer Co., Smith Masonry Contractors and the Regional Arts & Culture Council. This marked {{the sculpture}}'s first restoration since 1985. Allow Me receives cold wax coatings each year to maintain its shine.|$|E
5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> rather than doing it at home. Before {{the invention of the}} steam laundry machine in the mid-19thcentury, women did most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines. Steam-driven washing machines, and equipment for starching, ironing, and related tasks made industrial laundries feasible {{by the turn of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} (plural – proboscises) {{is formed}} from maxillary galeae and is adapted for sucking nectar. It {{consists of two}} tubes held together by hooks and separable <b>for</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families and are often folded.|$|E

5|$|The thorax {{has three}} segments, {{each with a}} pair of robust legs, and a pair of {{membranous}} wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus {{did not have to be}} broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> up the site prior to building anew.|$|E
5|$|Application {{of social}} {{sustainability}} requires stakeholders {{to look at}} human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues {{should be considered in}} production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E

5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and {{electrical}} supply lines arose. Because these were not factored into the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor costs incurred by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{all work}} units were {{continuously}} beaten by {{the guards and}} often shot or hanged at the gallows. Only the strongest men were selected from new arrivals daily to obtain the necessary replacements. There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the Holzfällerkommando ("woodcutter unit") cut and chopped firewood, and the Tarnungskommando ("disguise unit") camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> the common areas. The Camp 1 Wohnlager residential compound contained barracks for about 700 Sonderkommandos which, when combined with the 300 Totenjuden living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and the leaves of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E

5|$|Khandoba is {{described}} as doing odd jobs under Banai's orders. Banai first assigns him the task of sweeping the entire vada. He is responsible <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> the sheep pens and taking the sheep and lambs for grazing. He completes all tasks by spreading his magical bhandara. The shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals. Their vanity is crushed. Banai assigns him the additional responsibility {{of taking care of}} five hundred children. She commands if any sheep or lamb is lost or a child cries, she will not give him his food. But Khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara. She assigns him the job of washing the sheep and lambs. Instead, Khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and Banai. He skins the sheep and separates the meat. A repentant Banai begs his forgiveness; he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that Banai marries him. Khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronometer}} {{was returned}} to Greenwich 6 February 1826 and then sent to its makers for servicing. It did not come back to Greenwich for nearly two years. On 4 March 1828 it was issued to Captain J. Bolder in command of HMS Hecla. At this time Hecla was a famous ship: {{under the command of}} George Francis Lyon she had been part of Parry's second expedition to find the Northwest Passage. Over 6,000 members of the public visited the ship at Deptford while she waited to set out on Parry's third expedition in 1824. The attempt was abandoned in 1825 after the leading ship, HMS Fury was abandoned due to ice damage. Parry used Hecla again in an 1827 attempt to reach the North Pole. Parry unwillingly gave up Hecla when the admiralty sent her to survey the West African coast under the command of Bolder. In July 1830 the chronometer was returned from Hecla and went <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> to Robert Molyneux in London. It {{was returned to}} Greenwich in November but not immediately issued to another ship.|$|E
