5000|$|The {{resolution}} of a <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> {{is measured in}} lines per inch (lpi). This {{is the number of}} lines of dots in one inch, measured parallel with the screen's angle. Known as the screen ruling, the {{resolution of}} a screen is written either with the suffix lpi or a hash mark; for example, [...] "150 lpi" [...] or [...] "150#".|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> were {{generated}} by inked lines on two sheets of glass that were cemented together at right angles. Each {{of the color}} separation films were then exposed through these screens. The resulting high-contrast image, once processed, had dots of varying diameter depending {{on the amount of}} exposure that area received, which was modulated by the grayscale separation film image.|$|R
40|$|Introduction In {{numerous}} {{digital imaging}} applications, {{there is a}} need to maintain the highest quality perceived image, while utilizing a printer or display that can only achieve a limited number of output states. Common examples of this include the use of ink jet printers to make video hardcopy, and the display of images from web pages. In the historic evolution of printed images, photographic <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> were used to render the illusion of gray scale with binary (black ink on white paper) printers. Gray regions were printed as a mosaic of black and white sub-regions, since the properties of the human visual system (HVS) would tend to create a perception of gray. In modern digital imaging applications, digital <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> or algorithms are employed to generate precisely defined patterns for halftoning. In cases where a limited number of intermediate states are achievable, the process is sometimes referred to as multitoning. In this focus paper, we provide a short s...|$|R
40|$|Undesired moiré {{patterns}} {{may appear}} in colour printing for various reasons. One {{of the most}} important reasons is interference between the superposed <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> of the different primary colours, due to an improper alignment of their frequencies or orientations. In this article we explain the superposition moiré phenomenon using a spectral model which is based on Fourier analysis. After examining the basic case of cosinusoidal grating superpositions we advance, step by step, through the cases of binary gratings, square grids and dot screens, and discuss the implications on moirés between <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> in colour separation. Then, based on these results, we focus on the moiré phenomenon from a different angle, the dynamic point of view: we introduce the moiré parameter space, and show how changes in the parameters of the superposed layers vary the moiré patterns in the superposition. This leads us to an algorithm for moiré minimization which provides stable moiré-free screen combinations for colour separation...|$|R
50|$|Gradation {{can also}} be useful in {{composing}} photographs. The {{early decades of the}} development of photography involved much effort and experimentation aimed at improving gradation detail in photographs. Different materials were tested in producing lithographs and early photographs, with steady improvement in producing detailed gradation. In 1878, one photographer wrote: A major innovation was the development of halftone photography in the late 19th century. Halftone photography involves creating a reproduction of an original photograph by taking an image of it using a Photomechnical transfer camera (PMT), with a <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> as an intermediary tool to create gradation in the final reproduction. Halftone screens are a plate or film, made up of a continuous pattern of small dots, and when used in a photomechanical transfer camera, the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> serves as an image filter. The invention of halftone photography was an important milestone, allowing photographs to be reproduced for mass publication in newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{different}} kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades. One of the well known attempts was by Stephen H. Horgan while working for the New York Daily Graphic. The first printed photograph was an image of Steinway Hall in Manhattan published on December 2, 1873. The Graphic then published [...] "the first reproduction of a photograph with a full tonal range in a newspaper" [...] on March 4, 1880 (entitled [...] "A Scene in Shantytown") with a crude <b>halftone</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Screenless {{lithography}} is a reprographic {{technique for}} halftoning dating to 1855, when the French chemist and civil engineer Alphonse Poitevin discovered the light-sensitive properties of bichromated gelatin and invented both the photolithography and collotype processes. After {{the invention of}} the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> in the 1880s, screenless lithography was abandoned. Until the end of World War II, two kinds of photomechanically made plates were used in lithography: albumin plates and deep-etch plates. Presensitized plates appeared in the 1950s, and wipe-on plates appeared in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|In {{security}} printing various {{methods such as}} void pantograph are used to create patterns {{that are hard to}} copy exactly and when copied inexactly produces an easily detectable image. This can include <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> that are affected by the copying process, fine line patterns in different directions that are differently affected by copying and hence produce a mark, metallic inks causing diffraction or reflection.|$|R
50|$|Paper at {{this point}} is uncoated. Coated paper has a thin layer of {{material}} such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to one or both sides {{in order to create a}} surface more suitable for high-resolution <b>halftone</b> <b>screens.</b> (Uncoated papers are rarely suitable for screens above 150 lpi.) Coated or uncoated papers may have their surfaces polished by calendering. Coated papers are divided into matte, semi-matte or silk, and gloss. Gloss papers give the highest optical density in the printed image.|$|R
50|$|The Approval was {{designed}} to mimic the quality of Printing presses using high resolution imaging (2,400 or 2,540 DPI similar to the printing plate) and <b>halftone</b> <b>screening</b> to accurately reflect what would be seen on press. Stochastic screening (or FM screening) {{can also be used}} to proof print runs with this screening technique. Being able to simulate screening effects with high fidelity makes it possible to detect undesirable screening artifacts (i.e. Moiré patterns) before going to press, consequently saving customers time and money.|$|R
50|$|Another device, {{called an}} electrostencil machine, {{sometimes}} {{was used to}} make mimeo stencils from a typed or printed original. It worked by scanning the original on a rotating drum with a moving optical head and burning through the blank stencil with an electric spark in {{the places where the}} optical head detected ink. It was slow and produced ozone. Text from electrostencils had lower resolution than that from typed stencils, although the process was good for reproducing illustrations. A skilled mimeo operator using an electrostencil and a very coarse <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> could make acceptable printed copies of a photograph.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the example}} above, {{which is a}} closeup of a strip of 1996 [...] "flag over porch" [...] {{self-adhesive}} stamps, {{we can see a}} plate number comprising five digits, one for each color layer. The digits are quite small, and often hard to read because they are blurred by the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen.</b> Also, in this example, the numbers on the left, known as micro-printing, usually denote the year the issue is copyrighted or printed and, therefore, should not be mistaken as the plate number. While there are other factors such as condition and centering, the philatelic value of a PNC single or strip highly depends on its plate numbers with some plate numbers commanding higher catalog values due to their rarity and strong collector interest.|$|E
5000|$|On December 5, 1901 American {{inventor}} Frederic Eugene Ives {{presented his}} [...] "parallax stereogram" [...] at the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania. He {{claimed that he}} first had the idea 16 years earlier while working with the line screen {{in a study of}} [...] "the dioptrics of half-tone screen photography". At the time he didn't think it was important enough to spend his time on. In 1901 Ives realized that he could easily adapt his Kromolinoskop color photo camera to create the stereogram and thought it would be an interesting scientific novelty worthy of presentation at the Franklin Institute. The [...] "parallax stereogram" [...] was a photo shot through two apertures behind the lens with a [...] "transparent-line screen, consisting of opaque lines with clear spaces between them" [...] in front of the sensitive plate, slightly separated from it. The line screen had 200 parallel lines per inch (...) and was contact-printed from an original factory <b>halftone</b> <b>screen.</b> The technique received U.S. patent 725,567 on April 14, 1903 (application filed on September 25, 1902).|$|E
5000|$|A {{halftone}} dithering matrix {{produces a}} look {{similar to that}} of <b>halftone</b> <b>screening</b> in newspapers. This is a form of clustered dithering, in that dots tend to cluster together. This can help hide the adverse effects of blurry pixels found on some older output devices. The primary use for this method is in offset printing and laser printers. In both these devices the ink or toner prefers to clump together and will not form the isolated dots generated by the other dithering methods.|$|R
50|$|Stochastic {{screening}} or FM <b>screening</b> is a <b>halftone</b> process {{based on}} pseudo-random distribution of halftone dots, using frequency modulation (FM) {{to change the}} density of dots according to the gray level desired. Traditional amplitude modulation <b>halftone</b> <b>screening</b> {{is based on a}} geometric and fixed spacing of dots, which vary in size depending on the tone color represented (for example, from 10 to 200 micrometres). The stochastic screening or FM screening instead uses a fixed size of dots (for example, about 25 micrometres) and a distribution density that varies depending on the color’s tone.|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} of stochastic screening, which has existed since the seventies, {{has had a}} revival in recent times thanks to increased use of computer-to-plate (CTP) techniques. In previous techniques, computer to film, during the exposure {{there could be a}} drastic variation in the quality of the plate. It was a very delicate and difficult procedure that was not much used. Today, with CTP during the creation of the plate you just need to check a few parameters on the density and tonal correction curve. When you make a plate with stochastic screening you must use a tone correction curve, this curve allows one to align the tone reproduction of an FM screen to that of an industry standard.Given the same final presswork tone value, an FM screen utilizes more halftone dots than an AM/XM screen. The result is that more light is filtered by the ink and less light simply reflects off the surface of the substrate. The result is that FM screens exhibit a greater color gamut than conventional AM/XM <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> frequencies.The creation of a plate with stochastic screening is done the same way as is done with an AM/XM screen. A tone reproduction compensation curve is typically applied to align the stochastic screening to conventional AM/FM tone reproductions targets (e.g. ISO 12647-2).|$|E
40|$|The <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> {{with fine}} {{vertical}} gratings {{is often used}} to modulate images in the printing technology. When the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> is disturbed by the jitter in horizontal direction we observe the lattice fringe (called banding) in the horizontal direction. Surprisingly, any frequency component does not exist in the spatial frequency domain of the banding. Also, the banding is detected even when the spatial frequency of the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> exceeds the frequency limit of the visual sensitivity, where the gratings (carrier) are the longitudinal waves of the horizontal direction and the jitter (side band) are transversal waves of the vertical direction. A doubly periodic function takes place above as etiology, and then higher harmonics occur. This complicates an argument. We validated the banding appearance by the carrier grating of the single frequency (69 cpd) and jitter (5. 2 cpd) as the side band that removed higher harmonics, to find a response curve by 2 AFC in experiment. The correlation between the response curve and the cross term of the jitter spectrum and grating spectrum is absolutely high. So the presence of the nonlinear response is indicated in the early stage. We applied a nonlinear function to the above stimulation to evaluate nonlinearity. As a result, we think the banding spectrum is generated by the configuration of nonlinearity and the spatial frequency characteristic in the early stage...|$|E

We {{refer to}} the {{halftone}} cells in which black dot-clusters are surrounded by a white background as highlight cells (H) because they typically represent highlight tones in a halftone image. The growing order {{of the size of}} both highlight and shadow cells is specified by the <b>halftone</b> <b>screen.</b> In other words, the spatial arrangement of the thresholds in a screen defines a unique family of binary patterns (called dot profile patterns) that are used to render each constant gray value level.|$|E
40|$|<b>Halftoning</b> by <b>screening</b> is {{a popular}} {{technique}} because of its computational simplicity. The screen matrix is very determining {{for the quality of}} the generated halftone patterns. In this paper we will introduce a novel screen design framework for the generation of multilevel AM <b>halftoning</b> <b>screens.</b> A first important novelty is the support for multilevel screens. The screen design is targeted towards multilevel electropholographic print technologies, where the intermediate output levels are not as reproducible as the outer levels. In this case it is important to control the so called hardness of the screen, which comes down to the fraction of pixels with intermediate levels in the halftone patterns. In the proposed algorithm we can control this hardness directly. Another novelty is that the framework isn't limited to the classical orthonormal AM halftoning grids. The geometrical foundation of the algorithm is based on the concept of Voronoi tessellation. This approach makes it possible to handle for example slanted AM grids or grids with different ruling in the main directions...|$|R

40|$|The {{halftone}} {{process has been}} the conventional means of reproducing photographic artwork on newsprint. The use of relatively coarse screen rulings, dictated by the paper characteristics, produces an image with a noticeable dot pattern. Furthermore, the printing process is susceptible to extreme dot gain variation, which affects tone reproduction and the pictorial communication of the image. There were good reasons to suspect that a random dot screen could give more consistent tone rendition than a conventional <b>halftone</b> <b>screen.</b> A comparative study of the consistency of perception of conventional and randomly screened images when printed on newsprint {{has not yet been}} reported. The present study is an attempt to determine which screen can reproduce more consistently perceptible images when extreme dot gain occurs. To test this comparison, an original black and white photographic image, composed of geometric shapes of varying densities superimposed on backgrounds of varying densities, was reproduced from a computer generated slide. This test target, designed to encourage objective answers from observers, was photographed through 65 -and 85 -line conventional halftone screens, and 75 -and 150 - line mezzotint (random dot) screens. The production of film, plate, and the press run were the same for the four screened images. The pressman purposely varied the ink film thickness to simulate dot gain. Selected samples of minimum, average, and maximum dot gain were presented to observers, who were asked to identify geometric shapes on 12 printed images. The recorded responses were averaged, and the collected data was represented in graphs. In this manner it was possible to determine which screens can reproduce more consistent tonal distinctions. The results of the experiment proved that the random dot screens are not capable of reproducing more consistently perceptible images. The 65 -line conventional <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> produces more consistent perceptual responses in the highlights, while the 85 -line conventional <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> produces more consistent responses in the midtones...|$|E

5000|$|In {{graphic arts}} and prepress, the usual {{technology}} for printing full-color images involves the superimposition of <b>halftone</b> <b>screens.</b> These are regular rectangular dot patterns—often four of them, printed in cyan, yellow, magenta, and black. Some kind of moiré pattern is inevitable, but in favorable circumstances {{the pattern is}} [...] "tight"; that is, the spatial frequency of the moiré is so high {{that it is not}} noticeable. In the graphic arts, the term moiré means an excessively visible moiré pattern. Part of the prepress art consists of selecting <b>screen</b> angles and <b>halftone</b> frequencies which minimize moiré. The visibility of moiré is not entirely predictable. The same set of screens may produce good results with some images, but visible moiré with others.|$|R
40|$|In the {{printing}} industry, {{one of the}} most common methods for reproducing halftone images using bilevel printing devices is clustered-dot ordered dithering. The images produced using this method are quite faithful to the original and are visually pleasing. Nevertheless, only rational angles are attainable with clustered-dot dithering, due to the discrete nature of the grids. This phenomenon can become detrimental in the case of four-color printing, when different screen angles and maybe even different screen frequencies are used for separate color planes, thus producing a so-called Moiré phenomenon. Another important drawback, the so-called banding or contouring effect, is related to the limited area of basic screen elements used in traditional dithering. In order to deal with these problems, we have developed, within the scope of our research, several new techniques for digital halftoning: (1) pseudo-random <b>halftone</b> <b>screening,</b> (2) a new method for generating clustered-dot halftone images having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size (CombiScreen), (3) rotated clustered-dot dithering, based on discrete one-to-one rotation, and (4) rotated dispersed-dot dither. A new method of pseudo-random <b>halftone</b> <b>screening</b> is described. It starts by obtaining the quasi-random distribution of tile centers according to some well-defined spectral characteristics. We then obtain the desired tesselation of the output device space by applying the Voronoi polygonization process. Then, an analytic black-dot curve is calculated according to the resampled input signal level and the area of each given tile. This analytic curve is scan-converted to obtain the blackened pixels. In the second approach, we associate threshold values to all pixels inside every tile according to some specially tailored analytic spot function. Then, the standard threshold comparison process is applied. Unlike known error-diffusion techniques, the pseudo-random <b>halftone</b> <b>screening</b> technique can be applied to a high resolution printing process. The characteristic screen element size can be properly chosen so as to ensure the best trade-off between {{the printing}} process constraints and the most precise printing. The described halftone algorithm seems to be appropriate for high-resolution color and black&white devices (above 1000 dpi). A new method (CombiScreen) is proposed for generating clustered-dot halftone images on raster printing devices having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size. The dither tiles generated by this method may contain several screen elements having any rational orientation and size. Threshold values are distributed among the cells of the dither tile so as to produce a large range of gray values, while at the same time preserving the clustered-dot behavior of individual screen elements. When rendering images at smoothly increasing intensity levels, this new method generates few contouring effects and other visible artifacts. The method works equally well for quadratic, rectangular, parallelogram and hexagonally shaped screen elements. Resulting dither tiles are generally either of parallelogram or of hexagonal shape. Since CombiScreen enables the screen dot frequency or orientation to be chosen independently of the number of gray levels, it has proven to be specially effective when printing at resolutions between 150 to 600 dpi with ink jet printers and at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi with xerographic printers. A new operator of discrete one-to-one rotation is described. It offers means previously unknown in the art for generating rotated screens which approximate irrational angles with high-precision, producing much less disturbing interferences and artifacts than other methods. Therefore, a carefully prepared dither tile incorporating screen elements with the desired period, initial orientation, and dither threshold values defining their screen dot shape growth behavior can be rotated by discrete one-to-one rotation and keep the desired screen element period, the number of cells per screen element and the threshold values associated with each screen element cell, thereby preserving the screen dot shape growth behavior of the original dither tile. Several different discrete one-to-one rotation variants are described: a small angle rotation technique valid for a subset of rational rotation angles, a rigid band technique and a technique based on discrete shearing transformations. The high-quality of the so rotated dither tile is due to the fact that discrete one-to-one rotation preserves the exact number of elementary cells per screen element and their exact dither threshold values. The described method provides a new range of solutions for obtaining high-quality digital angled <b>halftone</b> <b>screens.</b> High-quality solutions can be found for generating three digital angled <b>halftone</b> <b>screens,</b> each 30 ° apart from each other, as known from traditional photographic colour screening techniques. Further solutions minimizing Moiré effects may be obtained by <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> whose first order frequency component vectors sum up to zero. This new method has turned out to be particularly effective when printing with color ink jet printers at resolutions between 150 and 800 dpi as well as with xerographic printers at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi. Rotated dispersed-dot dither is based on the discrete one-to-one rotation of a Bayer dispersed-dot dither array. The halftone patterns produced by the rotated dither method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts than the horizontal and vertical components present in most of Bayer's halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges produced by rotated dither, texture changes at consecutive gray levels are much smoother than in error diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods, thereby avoiding contouring effects. Due to its semi-clustering behavior at mid-tones, rotated dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone reproduction behavior on printers having a significant dot gain, while maintaining the high detail rendition capabilities of dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms. This technique has successfully been applied to in-phase color reproduction on ink-jet printers as well as to black and white reproduction on laser printers...|$|R

40|$|In {{conventional}} lithography, a <b>halftone</b> <b>screen</b> {{is used to}} photographically {{convert the}} continuous- tone image of the original into a grid of very small, closely spaced dots of constant density but varying areas. Screenless or continuous-tone lithography is a printing process capable of reproducing images with gradated tones {{without the use of}} a <b>halftone</b> <b>screen.</b> Screenless lithography has a high quality potential because it has few of the inherent problems that limit the quality of the halftone process. This thesis investigates the image mechanisms in screenless lithography and in particular the role of variable water receptivity. It was hypothesized that in screenless lithography which uses a particular image carrier known as the Association Products plate, the continuous-tone image is due to selective emulsification of the ink resulting in a varying ink layer thickness and therefore varying densities. It was theorized that the plate has a water receptivity which varies with exposure to light and that this results in varying degrees of water-in-ink emulsification when the plate is dampened and inked. When transferred to paper and dried this results in an ink layer of varying thickness, which in turn causes a variation in optical density. A mathematical relationship was developed relating optical density, percentage of emulsified water, and ink layer thickness. This relationship allowed prediction of the amount of water-in-ink emulsification necessary to produce a given density range and a prediction of the amount of emulsification expected on a given plate area associated with a particular printed density. Testing proved that these predicted values were not present in actual printing from the plates. It was concluded that the hypothesis is invalid...|$|E

This study focused on the press performance of the FM halftone printing on newsprint. The fineness of conventional <b>halftone</b> <b>screens</b> can be described by indicating the screen rulings (lines per inch or lpi), and the fineness of FM screens {{is measured by the}} size of the micro dots ([micron] or 10 ~ 6 m). It is difficult to equate the microdot size in FM screen to the screen ruling in the conventional halftone. This research uses the concept of the total border length per unit area on a given % film dot area as a common parameter to characterize both FM and conventional screens. By comparing the border length difference between a number of FM screens to the 85 -lpi conventional screen, the results show that the higher the border length ratio, the higher the dot gain of the screen in question. In addition, the maximum border length ratio for a given screen is where the maximum dot gain difference occurs. This research also investigated if there is significant color variation between FM and conventional screens when solid ink densities are varied. The Specifications for Non-Heat Advertising Printing (SNAP) recommends an 85 - lpi conventional screen for newsprint. UGRA recommends 40 [micron] FM screen for newspaper printing. Therefore, in this study the 85 -lpi conventional screen (AGFA Balanced screen) was used as the reference screen. The 42 [micron] FM screen (UGRA Velvet screen) was used for the color stability test. The test run was conducted on the Rockwell positive-feed keyless Newsliner newspaper press. Five inking levels were tested in the experiment with two inking levels lowered and two inking levels increased over the normal inking condition. The normal inking condition was set to conform to SNAP specifications.
