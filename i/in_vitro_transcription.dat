25|$|P-TEFb was {{identified}} and purified {{as a factor}} needed for the generation of long run-off transcripts using an <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>transcription</b> system derived from Drosophila cells. It is a cyclin dependent kinase containing the catalytic subunit, Cdk9, and a regulatory subunit, cyclin T in Drosophila. In humans there are multiple forms of P-TEFb which contain Cdk9 and one of several cyclin subunits, cyclin T1, T2, and K. P-TEFb associates with other factors including the bromodomain protein BRD4, and is found associated with a large complex of proteins called the super elongation complex. Importantly, for the AIDS virus, HIV, P-TEFb is targeted by the HIV Tat protein which bypasses normal cellular P-TEFb control and directly brings P-TEFb to the promoter proximal paused polymerase in the HIV genome.|$|E
25|$|During in vivo evolution, {{each cell}} (usually {{bacteria}} or yeast) is transformed with a plasmid containing a different {{member of the}} variant library. In this way, only the gene of interest differs between the cells, with all other genes being kept the same. The cells express the protein either in their cytoplasm or surface where its function can be tested. This format {{has the advantage of}} selecting for properties in a cellular environment, which is useful when the evolved protein or RNA is to be used in living organisms. When performed without cells, DE involves using <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>transcription</b> translation to produce proteins or RNA free in solution or compartmentalised in artificial microdroplets. This method has the benefits of being more versatile in the selection conditions (e.g. temperature, solvent), and can express proteins that would be toxic to cells. Furthermore, in vitro evolution experiments can generate far larger libraries (up to 1015) because the library DNA need not be inserted into cells (often a limiting step).|$|E

2500|$|This unfortunate lack of scope would {{eventually}} be overcome largely because of two major advancements in nucleic acid research: the identification of ribozymes, {{and the ability to}} produce them via <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>transcription.</b> [...] Subsequent to Tom Cech's publication implicating the Tetrahymena group I intron as an autocatalytic ribozyme, and Sidney Altman's report of catalysis by ribonuclease P RNA, several other catalytic RNAs were identified in the late 1980s, including the hammerhead ribozyme. [...] In 1994, McKay et al. published the structure of a 'hammerhead RNA-DNA ribozyme-inhibitor complex' at 2.6 Ångström resolution, in which the autocatalytic activity of the ribozyme was disrupted via binding to a DNA substrate. [...] In addition to the advances being made in global structure determination via crystallography, the early 1990s also saw the implementation of NMR as a powerful technique in RNA structural biology.

2500|$|For a {{considerable}} time following the first tRNA structures, {{the field of}} RNA structure did not dramatically advance. [...] The ability to study an RNA structure depended upon the potential to isolate the RNA target. [...] This proved limiting to the field for many years, in part because other known targets - i.e., the ribosome - were significantly more difficult to isolate and crystallize. [...] Further, because other interesting RNA targets had simply not been identified, or were not sufficiently understood to be deemed interesting, there was simply a lack of things to study structurally. [...] As such, for some twenty years following the original publication of the tRNAPHE structure, the structures {{of only a handful}} of other RNA targets were solved, with almost all of these belonging to the transfer RNA family.

40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} {{transcription}} factors contain so-called zinc finger domains for the interaction with their cognate DNA sequence. It {{has been shown}} that removal of the zinc ions complexed in these zinc fingers abrogates DNA binding and transcription activation. Therefore we wanted to test the hypothesis that the activity of transcription factors could be regulated by physiological chelators of zinc. A prominent candidate for such a chelator is the Cys-rich protein thionein (apometallothionein) that is inducible by heavy metal loads, and by other environmental stimuli. Here we show with DNA binding and <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>transcriptions</b> assays that thionein indeed can inactive the zinc finger-containing Spl in a reversible manner. By contrast, transcription factor Oct-l, which binds DNA via a homeo-domain, i. e. a helix-turn-helix motif not involving zinc ions, is refractory to thionein action. We propose that modulation of intracellular thionein concentration is used for the coordinated regulation of a large subset of genes whose transcription depends on zinc finger proteins...|$|R
2500|$|A {{recently}} described {{method by}} Ehrich et al. further {{takes advantage of}} bisulfite-conversions by adding a base-specific cleavage step to enhance the information gained from the nucleotide changes. [...] By first using <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>transcription</b> of the region of interest into RNA (by adding an RNA polymerase promoter site to the PCR primer in the initial amplification), RNase A {{can be used to}} cleave the RNA transcript at base-specific sites. [...] As RNase A cleaves RNA specifically at cytosine and uracil ribonucleotides, base-specificity is achieved by adding incorporating cleavage-resistant dTTP when cytosine-specific (C-specific) cleavage is desired, and incorporating dCTP when uracil-specific (U-specific) cleavage is desired. [...] The cleaved fragments can then be analyzed by MALDI-TOF. [...] Bisulfite treatment results in either introduction/removal of cleavage sites by C-to-U conversions or shift in fragment mass by G-to-A conversions in the amplified reverse strand. [...] C-specific cleavage will cut specifically at all methylated CpG sites. [...] By analyzing the sizes of the resulting fragments, it is possible to determine the specific pattern of DNA methylation of CpG sites within the region, rather than determining the extent of methylation of the region as a whole. [...] This method demonstrated efficacy for high-throughput screening, allowing for interrogation of numerous CpG sites in multiple tissues in a cost-efficient manner.|$|E
