5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E

In {{the event of}} water mains rupturing {{and a loss of}} pressure, it may also become <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.|$|E

DIN 18032 defines {{a range of}} traction which should suit most activities. These type floors should also be smooth, and a slide should not cause carpet burn. This means it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them becoming slippery when wet.|$|E
25|$|CyberBunker {{was given}} a court {{injunction}} on 17 May 2010, taking the site offline briefly; later that day, hosting was restored by Sweden's Piratpartiet (The Pirate Party). Former spokesman for the Pirate Bay, Peter Sunde, commented that it would now be very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the site because it would now be seen as political censorship if anyone tries to shut it down.|$|E
25|$|Non-medical use of {{fentanyl}} {{by individuals}} without opiate tolerance {{can be very}} dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths. Even those with opiate tolerances {{are at high risk}} for overdoses. Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> its course {{because of the nature of}} absorption. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.|$|E

50|$|High-level {{platforms}} for high-floored buses {{makes it}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> have <b>stops</b> outside dedicated platforms, {{or to have}} conventional buses stop at high-level platforms, so these BRT stops are distinct from street-level bus <b>stops.</b> Similar <b>to</b> rail vehicles, {{there is a risk}} of a dangerous gap between bus and platform, and is even greater {{due to the nature of}} bus operations. Kassel curbs or other methods may be used to ease quick and safe alignment of the BRT vehicle with a platform.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} a whistle on a {{locomotive}} exists because trains move on fixed rails and thus are uniquely susceptible to collision. This susceptibility is exacerbated by a train's enormous weight and inertia, which make it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>stop</b> when encountering an obstacle. Hence a means of warning others of the approach of a train from a distance is necessary. As train whistles are inexpensive compared to other warning devices, the use of loud and distinct whistles became the preferred solution for railway operators.|$|R
25|$|Consumed in bitter wars {{with the}} Persian Sasanian Empire in the east, the Byzantines had little {{resources}} {{to confront the}} Slavs. The Slavs came in large numbers {{and the lack of}} political organisation made it very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them because there was no political leader to defeat in battle and thereby force their retreat. As the wars with Persia persisted, the 610s and 620s saw a new and even larger migration wave with the Slavs penetrating further south into the Balkans, reaching Thessaly, Thrace and Peloponnese and raiding some islands in the Aegean Sea. The Byzantines held out Salonica and a number of coastal towns but beyond these areas the imperial authority in the Balkans disappeared.|$|E
25|$|The Drammen Line {{past the}} site of Høvik Station opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872. The area of Jong was at first served by Sandvika Station and from 1873 also by Slependen Station. The need for a station serving Jong was first {{articulated}} during the early 1930s by the manager of Fru Hjorts Pleiehjem, who served 300 patients and 60 employees at the nursing home. The residents' association for Jongåsen joined in on the effort through {{a letter to the}} Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in April 1935. They argued that some passengers taking the bus would switch to the train. They met with NSB' director the following year, without success. NSB responded that this would increase travel time for the trains, that it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> because of the hill {{and that it would be}} difficult to fit into the schedule.|$|E
25|$|Seventh-seeded West Virginia {{began the}} second round of the tournament by {{defeating}} Duke, the second seed, 73-67. The Mountaineers trailed until about eight minutes into the second half, when they took a 43-40 lead. They outrebounded the Blue Devils 47-27, which, combined with several three-point shots, aided in the win. This loss marked Duke's second consecutive loss before the Sweet Sixteen round. West Virginia's Sweet Sixteen opposition in Phoenix, Arizona was #3 Xavier, who defeated Purdue, 85–78. Xavier trailed as late as the 5:30 mark of the second half, but a widespread showing of talent from the Musketeers proved too <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> as four Xavier players scored in double figures, with two more tied at eight points each. Later that day, the top-seeded UCLA Bruins defeated ninth-seeded Texas A, 51–49. The Bruins trailed by as much as ten early in the first half, but slowly chipped away at the lead as the half progressed. The winning basket was scored with 9.5 seconds left on a lay-up by Darren Collison. Texas A had one final chance to tie it, but Donald Sloan's drive to the basket was stopped by two UCLA players (pictures show that they both appear to be grabbing Sloan, in what could have been a foul called on UCLA). The ensuing dunk by UCLA's Russell Westbrook was later waved off by officials as occurring after time had expired, making the final score 51–49. The Bruins then played WKU, a #12 seed who beat #13 seed San Diego by a 73–62 score. San Diego trailed by as much as 15 in the second half, but an 18–2 run gave them a one-point lead with 6-and-a-half minutes remaining. WKU, however, managed to pull ahead once again for the win, making this tournament only the third in history to feature at least two 12-or-lower seeds in the Sweet 16.|$|E

So Peggotty said; but I am afraid the chat was all on her own side, and of immoderate length, as she was very <b>difficult</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> God bless her! when she had me for her theme.|$|R
50|$|Railway {{signalling}} is {{a system}} used to direct railway traffic and keep trains clear of each other at all times. Trains move on fixed rails, making them uniquely susceptible to collision. This susceptibility is exacerbated by the enormous weight and inertia of a train, which make it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>stop</b> when encountering an obstacle. In the UK, the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 introduced a series of requirements on matters such as the implementation of interlocked block signalling and other safety measures {{as a direct result}} of the Armagh rail disaster in that year.|$|R

500|$|While Deny Flight was {{relatively}} successful in stopping flights of fixed-wing aircraft, NATO forces {{found it very}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> helicopter flights, which presented a more complicated challenge. All sides in the conflict used helicopters extensively for non-military purposes, {{and some of these}} flights were authorized by the UN. Under the operation's rules of engagement, NATO fighters were only authorized to shoot down helicopters that committed a hostile act. Otherwise, NATO fighters issued orders to [...] "land or exit", in other words, land the aircraft or leave the no-fly zone. Typically, helicopters in Bosnian airspace complied with these orders by landing, but then took off again after NATO forces departed. None of the parties in the conflict respected the ban on helicopter flights, as evidenced when Ratko Mladić responded to a BBC journalist's question about his violation of the ban with the statement, [...] "The commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces does not ride on a donkey." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the limited}} threat of attack, the United States {{military}} {{took steps to}} protect the B-29 bases in the Mariana Islands. The USAAF's Seventh Air Force played the most important role, and continuously attacked the Japanese-held islands until just {{before the end of}} the war. United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) aircraft and XXI Bomber Command B-29s also occasionally participated in these attacks. The Seventh Air Force also provided air defence for the Mariana Islands; this task was assigned to the 318th Fighter Group, which was equipped with P-47Thunderbolt fighters, and the 6th Night Fighter Squadron which flew Northrop P-61 Black Widows. The Thunderbolts were also responsible for suppressing the Japanese-held Mariana Islands, though it proved <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the 3,600-man garrison from repairing the airfield on Pagan. In addition, the US Army stationed elements of eight anti-aircraft gun battalions and two searchlight battalions on Saipan between July 1944 and February 1945. The head of the USAAF General [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold, who also directly commanded the Twentieth Air Force, was concerned about whether these defenses were sufficient, particularly given the high cost of the Superfortress bombers. Accordingly, he allocated a Microwave Early Warning (MEW) radar to protect the bases on Saipan. This advanced radar was not immediately installed, however, as the local commanders believed that the island's air defenses were adequate.|$|E
50|$|Trains move on fixed rails, {{making them}} uniquely {{susceptible}} to collision. This susceptibility {{is exacerbated by}} the enormous weight and inertia of a train, which make it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>stop</b> when encountering an obstacle. Also, trains generally do not stop at grade crossings (level crossings), instead relying upon pedestrians and vehicles to clear the tracks when they pass. Therefore, from their beginnings locomotives have been equipped with loud horns or bells to warn vehicles or pedestrians that they are coming. Steam locomotives had steam whistles, operated from steam produced by their boilers.|$|R

2500|$|Subsequent to {{an order}} from the Lahore High Court on May 19, 2010, the {{government}} of Pakistan, through its agency the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), indefinitely banned Facebook in the country, {{in response to the}} impending May 20 date at the focus of the protest movement. The order to carry out the shut down of Facebook in Pakistan was given by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, which also publicized an email address and phone number and requested individuals contact the agency to let them know about [...] "all similar URLs where such objectionable material is found". Representative Khoram Ali Mehran of the Pakistan agency stated to CNN, [...] "Obviously it (the blocking of Facebook) is related to the objectionable material that was placed on Facebook. That is why it is blocked. We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides to unblock it then that's what we will do." [...] The agency was responding to an action by a group of Islamic attorneys based in Pakistan, who had acted to get the court order due to a Facebook group [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammad Day—May 20". Azhar Siddique had filed the petition to the Lahore High Court on behalf of the organization, the Islamic Lawyers Forum. The government faced pressure from public protests against Facebook. In its petition to the government, the Islamic Lawyers Forum described the [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] event as [...] "blasphemous". Siddique told The Times, [...] "The court has also ordered the foreign ministry to investigate why such a competition is being held." [...] The lawyers succeeded in getting the government to block the Facebook group itself individually on May 18, but the Islamic lawyers requested a full block of the entirety of the Facebook site, because the organization had permitted the posting of the particular group on its site. They argued that unless the entire Facebook website were blocked, it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the protest movement campaign on the site. The Lahore court carried out this request, and ordered the government to issue a temporary block on Facebook to stand until May 31, 2010. Justice Ejaz Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court issued the ruling of the court. The court's ruling determined that the content of the protest movement on Facebook would damage the religious beliefs of the 45million users of the website in Pakistan. The force of the ban was effective immediately after the ruling of the court. Those present for the court's ruling included many religious clerics, attorneys, and students. The court held an in-depth hearing on the matter on May 31, 2010.|$|E
