5|$|In Super Metroid, {{just after}} giving the {{hatchling}} to a Federation research station, Samus tracks the hatchling (stolen by Ridley) to a newly rebuilt Space Pirate base on Zebes. She travels deep underground, eventually finding the now-fully-grown Metroid, then battling a newly rebuilt {{and more powerful}} Mother Brain. The Metroid hatchling sacrifices itself to save Samus, and Samus in turn defeats Mother Brain and escapes as the <b>entire</b> <b>planet</b> is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Star Fox Adventures {{features}} {{both the}} established main {{characters of the}} Star Fox series—Fox, Falco Lombardi, Slippy Toad and Peppy Hare (though Falco is absent from {{the majority of the}} game), as well as a host of new characters, including a mysterious blue fox named Krystal and the small dinosaur Prince Tricky.

5|$|Many millennia {{after the}} Knights of Cybertron had left their home planet, its {{population}} had become separated into tribes, each {{led by a}} Prime. At some point, these tribes came into conflict with each other, resulting in a devastating war raging across the <b>entire</b> <b>planet.</b> In the end, the warrior most instrumental in ending the conflict was Galvatron, of the tribe of Megatronus. He defeated many other tribes, until finally joining forces with another warrior, now without a master, called Nova Major. Together they ended the war with an armistice and united the survivors under them, with Nova taking the role of leader, and the title of Prime.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the <b>entire</b> <b>planet</b> through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E
5|$|Cryptum {{takes place}} {{approximately}} 100,000 {{years before the}} present day in the Halo universe, {{telling the story of}} the Forerunners before their disappearance. It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar, and two humans, Chakas and Morning Riser, and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior, the Didact. The Forerunners are a type-three civilization on the Kardashev scale; they can build artificial planets and control stars. Forerunners are divided into classes by occupation, they are (in order of rank): Builders, the architects of the Forerunners' megastructures, Miners, Lifeworkers, experts in medicine and biology, and Warriors. Bornstellar's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy, enabling them to own an <b>entire</b> <b>planet.</b> Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4.|$|E

5|$|Now activated, Omega Supreme pursues Megatron and his minions relentlessly. Megatron, Soundwave and Breakdown {{devise a}} plan to lure Omega Supreme to a rooftop defended with turrets, where the giant Transformer is ambushed. Omega Supreme sustains heavy damage and plummets to Cybertron's lower levels. The Decepticons follow Omega Supreme and engage him in a lengthy final battle, in which Omega Supreme is finally defeated, {{infected}} with Dark Energon, and captured by the Decepticons. Megatron forces Omega Supreme {{to open the door}} to Cybertron's core and travels there with his minions. Upon arrival he infects the core of Cybertron, also a Transformer, with Dark Energon, which then begins to spread over the <b>entire</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Katarn met Jan Ors (Julie Eccles), a Human Rebel working {{undercover}} as {{a double}} {{agent in the}} Empire. Ors uncovered the real information about Katarn's parents' death; that the Empire was behind it. The Empire eventually discovered that Ors {{was working for the}} Rebels and she was taken prisoner. Katarn helped her escape, thus ending his career with the Empire. He soon became a mercenary and, due to his hatred of the Empire for killing his parents, he began to take on jobs from the Rebel Alliance. Dark Forces begins with Katarn being recruited by the Rebel Alliance to recover the plans to the Death Star, a heavily armed space station capable of destroying an <b>entire</b> <b>planet.</b> The Alliance uses the plans to find a weakness in, and subsequently destroy, the Death Star.|$|E
5|$|While the Chief and Cortana {{head to the}} Autumn, Alpha Base is evacuated. Silva {{decides to}} retake the Truth and Reconciliation and pilot the ship away {{in order to avoid}} being on Halo when the Autumn blows. The ship is taken successfully, but McKay realizes that Silva is blinded by the thought of {{promotion}} and glory to the danger of the Flood; if even one Flood specimen escaped containment on Earth, the <b>entire</b> <b>planet</b> could fall. Jenkins draws McKay's attention to a vital energy line on the ship, and realizing that the destruction of the Flood is more important than Silva's promotion, cuts the cable, sending the Truth and Reconciliation crashing into Halo, killing all aboard.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{instances}} of ignoring science {{in favor of}} art can be seen when movies present environmental effects as portrayed in Star Wars and Star Trek. <b>Entire</b> <b>planets</b> are destroyed in titanic explosions requiring mere seconds, whereas an actual event of this nature takes many hours.|$|R

5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either {{an accident or}} another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the <b>entire</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the Arbiter {{remains a}} playable {{character}} in Halo 3 during cooperative gameplay (the second {{player in a}} game lobby controls him), the game's story never switches {{to the point of}} view of the Arbiter, as in Halo2. For much of Halo 3, the Arbiter assists human forces in their fight against hostile Covenant forces alongside John-117. After the Flood arrive on Earth, the Arbiter persuades Rtas 'Vadum not to glass the <b>entire</b> <b>planet</b> to quell the infestation. Along with a group of humans and Elites, the Arbiter follows the Prophet of Truth's forces through a slipspace portal to the Ark, where he kills the Prophet. The Master Chief decides to activate the Halo under construction at the Ark to destroy the local Flood while sparing the galaxy at large; the Arbiter helps to retrieve the artificial intelligence Cortana so that the installation can be fired. During the escape, the ship he and the Master Chief are on split in two; while the Master Chief is presumed lost, the Arbiter crashes safely to Earth. After attending a ceremony honoring the dead, the Arbiter and the rest of the Elites leave for their homeworld.|$|E
5|$|The next case {{given to}} Sam and Max {{involves}} {{dealing with a}} computer crisis that is causing the world economy to collapse. They discover {{the problem is a}} virtual reality program called Reality 2.0, powered by the Internet (which has gained sentience), which is hypnotizing people so they never want to leave the program. Sam and Max access the program themselves and introduce a computer virus that crashes Reality 2.0 and deletes the digital embodiment of the Internet. Prior to expiring, the Internet reveals that it was following the plans of one Roy G. Biv. Sam eventually deduces that Roy G. Biv is actually Hugh Bliss, a character seemingly in the background of all their previous cases. The Freelance Police travel to Bliss' Prismatology retreat on the Moon, where Bliss is preparing a device to hypnotize the <b>entire</b> <b>planet.</b> Bliss reveals himself as a colony of sentient bacteria that feeds off of the endorphins produced by human happiness; by hypnotizing the planet, Bliss assures himself of a permanent supply of nourishment. Bliss activates the device, but is killed when Sam tricks him into a tank of water and boils it using the rocket engine of a lunar lander. Returning to Earth, Max takes great pleasure in reversing the hypnotism by personally knocking everyone on the planet unconscious.|$|E
50|$|In the Star Trek fictional universe, shields {{refer to}} a 23rd and 24th century {{technology}} that provides starships, space stations, and <b>entire</b> <b>planets</b> with limited protection against damage.

25|$|The {{geomagnetic}} activity {{levels of the}} Earth are measured by the fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field in SI units called teslas (or in non-SI gauss, especially in older literature). The Earth's magnetic field is measured around the planet by many observatories. The data retrieved is processed and turned into measurement indices. Daily measurements for the <b>entire</b> <b>planet</b> are made available through {{an estimate of the}} Ap-index, called the planetary A-index (PAI).|$|E
25|$|A large {{satellite}} {{also increases}} the likelihood of plate tectonics through the effect of tidal forces on the planet's crust. The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the continental crust would cover the <b>entire</b> <b>planet,</b> leaving no room for oceanic crust. It is possible that the large scale mantle convection needed to drive plate tectonics could not have emerged in the absence of crustal inhomogeneity.|$|E
50|$|Due to Explorer-class ships {{dominating}} the exploration field, they {{are equipped with}} the latest in sensor and communications technology, allowing greater ease in contacting and communicating with different alien species.
