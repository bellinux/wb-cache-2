[...] Scholars have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> avoiding men's romantic advances. Rosaline in Love's Labours Lost constantly rebuffs her suitor's advances and Romeo's Rosaline remains distant and chaste in his brief descriptions of her. [...] These similarities have led some to wonder whether they are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the Dark Lady described in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this connection.|$|E
500|$|Jackson stated {{several times}} that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was based on the}} groupies he and his {{brothers}} encountered while part of The Jackson 5. [...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers." [...] The reason for this was due to the fame of the Jackson 5, and wanting to have their money in order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> living.|$|E
500|$|Most notably, Harlan dissented from Supreme Court rulings restricting {{interrogation}} techniques used {{by law enforcement}} officers. For example, he dissented from the Court's holding in Escobedo v. Illinois, that the police could not refuse to honor a suspect's request to consult with his lawyer during an interrogation. Harlan called the rule [...] "ill-conceived" [...] and suggested that it [...] "unjustifiably fetters perfectly legitimate methods of criminal law enforcement." [...] He disagreed with Miranda v. Arizona, which required law enforcement officials to warn a suspect of his rights before questioning him (see Miranda warning). He closed his dissenting opinion with a quotation from his predecessor, Justice Robert H. Jackson: [...] "This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> collapsing when one story too many is added." ...|$|E

Williams {{wrote in}} his 1965 book, This Is My Country Too, {{that he did not}} believe [...] "white {{travelers}} have any idea of how much nerve and courage it requires for a Negro to drive coast to coast in America." [...] He achieved it with [...] "nerve, courage, {{and a great deal of}} luck," [...] supplemented by [...] "a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and Travelguide, a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse." [...] He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible on the front seat and pretend they were delivering a car for a white person. Along the way, he had to endure a stream of [...] "insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars."

500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{received}} generally mixed to positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 19 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". [...] Some writers noted and praised the heavy use of electronic, bass and funk beats, while others suggest The Neptunes {{were unable to}} blend R and rock. Anthony Henriques of PopMatters lauded the production, saying that [...] "their signature drums and spaced-out samples sound as good as ever here", going on to say [...] "he overall balance between live and electronic instrumentation is also the best they have managed {{on any of the}} N.E.R.D. albums". He compared the album to M.I.A.'s Kala as [...] "one of the best genre-blurring club records". However, Andy Kellman of Allmusic felt the songs [...] "still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> seeming as easy and carefree as the moments when N.E.R.D. are simply bashing away…blowing off steam, and talking ridiculous nonsense". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian pointed out that the songs were [...] "largely about sex", calling it [...] "wearisome". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media called the album a [...] "baffling, obnoxious mess". Adrian Ruhi of Okayplayer gave the album a score of 88 out of 100 and called some of the songs [...] "a dynamic mess", but noted it was [...] "a good thing".|$|E
