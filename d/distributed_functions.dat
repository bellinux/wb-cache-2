50|$|Palladio's villas - that is {{the houses}} of estate owners - met {{a need for a}} new type of country residence. His designs implicitly {{recognise}} that it was not necessary to have a great palace in the countryside, modelled directly on city palaces, as many late fifteenth-century villas (like the huge villa da Porto at Thiene) in fact are. Something smaller, often with only one main living floor was adequate as a centre for controlling the productive activity from which much of the owner's income probably derived and for impressing tenants and neighbours as well as entertaining important guests. These residences, though sometimes smaller than earlier villas, were just as effective for establishing a social and political presence in the countryside, and for relaxing, hunting, and getting away from the city, which was always potentially unhealthy. Façades, dominated by pediments usually decorated with the owner's coat of arms, advertised a powerful presence across a largely flat territory, and to be seen {{did not need to be}} as high as the owner's city palace. Their loggie offered a pleasant place to eat, or talk, or perform music in the shade, activities which one can see celebrated in villa decoration, for instance in the villa Caldogno. In their interior Palladio <b>distributed</b> <b>functions</b> both vertically and horizontally. Kitchens, store-rooms, laundries and cellars were in the low ground floor; the ample space under the roof was used to store the most valuable product of the estate, grain, which incidentally also served to insulate the living rooms below. On the main living floor, used by family and their guests, the more public rooms (loggia, sala) were on the central axis, while left and right were symmetrical suites of rooms, going from large rectangular chambers, via square middling sized rooms, to small rectangular ones, sometimes used as by the owner as studies or offices for administering the estate.|$|E

40|$|The EM- 4 is {{a highly}} {{parallel}} daiaflow machine that will eventually have more than 1, 000 processing elements (PEs). This paper presents load balancing methods by function distribution in the EM- 4 and their evaluations on the EM- 4 prototype, which con-sists of 80 PEs. The EM- 4 can <b>distribute</b> <b>function</b> in-stances statically by using several different allocation functions, including a method exploiting the locality of the network. Furthermore, the EM- 4 can dynami-cally <b>distribute</b> <b>function</b> instances using MLPE packets which circulate through the PEs and detect the local-minimum load PE. These function distn’bution meth-ods are evaluated by executing a divide-and-conquer program and a game tree searching program, and ex-amining its dynamic characteristics on every PE. ...|$|R
40|$|In the <b>distributed</b> <b>function</b> {{computation}} problem, dichotomy theorems, {{initiated by}} Han-Kobayashi, seek to classify functions by whether the rate regions for function computation improve on the Slepian-Wolf regions or not. In this paper, we develop a general approach to derive converse bounds on the <b>distributed</b> <b>function</b> computation problem. By using this approach, we recover the sufficiency part, i. e. the conditions {{such that the}} Slepian-Wolf regions become optimal, of the known dichotomy theorems in the two-terminal distributed computing. Furthermore, we derive an improved sufficient condition on the dichotomy theorem in the multiterminal distributed computing for the class of i. i. d. sources with positivity condition. Finally, we derive the matching sufficient and necessary condition on the dichotomy theorem in the multiterminal distributed computing for the class of smooth sources.

System functionality is represented {{by a set of}} complex <b>distributed</b> <b>functions,</b> i. e., functions that are spread across several system components. This chapter presents a novel automated modelbased testing approach for <b>distributed</b> <b>functions</b> that uses informal system requirements and component behavior models.

40|$|Today's software-intensive {{systems are}} {{characterized}} {{by the use of}} third party components and <b>distributed</b> <b>functions</b> which are realized by component interactions. In this article an automated model-based approach for testing <b>distributed</b> <b>functions</b> of component-based systems is presented. The approach allows the validation of distributed system functions against the system requirements. The main advantages of our approach are the systematic construction of dedicated test models from system requirements, the high degree of automation, and the high flexibility by using heterogeneous models. The heterogeneous test models used in our approach efficiently describe the high level system view of <b>distributed</b> <b>functions</b> with their execution conditions and the low level event-driven view of stimuli and responses. The completeness and consistency of the different models are assured by applying existing static analysis techniques for the chosen modeling notations.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{some aspects}} of the general problem of information transfer and <b>distributed</b> <b>function</b> computation in wireless networks. Many applications of wireless technology foresee networks of autonomous devices executing tasks that can be posed as <b>distributed</b> <b>function</b> computation. In today's wireless networks, the tasks of communication and (distributed) computation are performed separately, although an efficient network operation calls for approaches in which the information transfer is dynamically adapted to time-varying computation objectives. Thus, wireless communications and function computation must be tightly coupled and it is shown in this paper that information theory may {{play a crucial role in}} the design of efficient computation-aware wireless communication and networking strategies. This is explained in more detail by considering the problem of computing ℓ_p-norms over multiple access channels. Comment: submitted to IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>distributed</b> <b>function</b> computation problem in asymmetric communication scenarios, where the sink computes some deterministic {{function of the}} data split among N correlated informants. The <b>distributed</b> <b>function</b> computation problem is addressed as a generalization of distributed source coding (DSC) problem. We are mainly interested in minimizing the number of informant bits required, in the worst-case, to allow the sink to exactly compute the function. We provide a constructive solution for {{this in terms of}} an interactive communication protocol and prove its optimality. The proposed protocol also allows us to compute the worst-case achievable rate-region for the computation of any function. We define two classes of functions: lossy and lossless. We show that, in general, the lossy functions can be computed at the sink with fewer number of informant bits than the DSC problem, while computation of the lossless functions requires as many informant bits as the DSC problem.

40|$|In this paper, we make an {{investigation}} of the receptivity of boundary layer flows to Gortler vortex modes. A study by Denier, Hall, and Seddougui (1991) of the generation of vortices by wall roughness elements concluded that such elements are extremely poor as mechanisms to stimulate short wavelength modes, but that analysis was in error. We re-examine this problem and demonstrate how the form of the wall roughness is crucial in determining the vortex stability characteristics downstream of the roughness. In particular, we investigate the cases of both isolated and <b>distributed</b> forcing <b>functions</b> and show that, in general, a <b>distributed</b> <b>function</b> is much more important in generating vortices than are either isolated roughness or freestream disturbances...|$|R

40|$|For high-dimensional {{and massive}} data sets, {{traditional}} centralized gene expression programming (GEP) or improved algorithms {{lead to increased}} run-time and decreased prediction accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new improved algorithm called <b>distributed</b> <b>function</b> mining for gene expression programming based on fast reduction (DFMGEP-FR). In DFMGEP-FR, fast attribution reduction in binary search algorithms (FAR-BSA) is proposed to quickly find the optimal attribution set, and the function consistency replacement algorithm is given to solve integration of the local function model. Thorough comparative experiments for DFMGEP-FR, centralized GEP and the parallel gene expression programming algorithm based on simulated annealing (parallel GEPSA) are included in this paper. For the waveform, mushroom, connect- 4 and musk datasets, the comparative {{results show that the}} average time-consumption of DFMGEP-FR drops by 89. 09 %%, 88. 85 %, 85. 79 % and 93. 06 %, respectively, in contrast to centralized GEP and by 12. 5 %, 8. 42 %, 9. 62 % and 13. 75 %, respectively, compared with parallel GEPSA.

40|$|Function {{secret sharing}} (FSS) scheme is a {{mechanism}} that calculates a function f(x) for x in { 0, 1 }^n which is shared among p parties, by using <b>distributed</b> <b>functions</b> f_i:{ 0, 1 }^n -> G, where G is an Abelian group, while the function f:{ 0, 1 }^n -> G is kept secret to the parties. Ohsawa et al. in 2017 observed that any function f {{can be described}} as a linear combination of the basis functions by regarding the function space as a vector space of dimension 2 ^n and gave new FSS schemes based on the Fourier basis. All existing FSS schemes are of (p,p) -threshold type. That is, to compute f(x), we have to collect f_i(x) for all the <b>distributed</b> <b>functions.</b> In this paper, as in the secret sharing schemes, we consider FSS schemes with any general access structure. To do this, we observe that Fourier-based FSS schemes by Ohsawa et al. are compatible with linear secret sharing scheme.
