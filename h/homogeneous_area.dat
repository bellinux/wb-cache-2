The north and northeastern {{parts of the}} South China Sea formed their rifts earlier in the Paleocene. The south and southwestern parts of the South China Sea showed a later rifting around the Eocene or later. The difference in rifting and time gap between the northeastern and southwestern regions indicate the South China Sea is not a geologically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area,</b> and its lithosphere could {{be divided into two}} areas, southwest and northeast according to its tectonic evolution. The reasons behind these differences in its rifting stage could be various, such as impact from different plates and different distribution of plumes under the crust.

The results of forestation activities indicate the need to adopt a operational tools to promote the extension of forest surface at regional and sub-regional levels. In this view, with the aim to produce useful tools for forest plantation planning, the entire regional area was analysed and ecologically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>areas</b> have been identified to join and target arboriculture and/or forestation plantation activities, to choose tree and shrub species for different environments and to identify priority areas of intervention.

5000|$|His son Hiripan {{continued}} the expansion {{into the area}} surrounding Lake Cuitzeo. In 1460 the Purépecha state reached the Pacific coast at Zacatula, advanced into the Toluca Valley, and also, on the northern rim, reached into the present-day state of Guanajuato. In the 15th century the Purépecha state was {{at war with the}} Aztecs. Many Nahua peoples who had until then lived side by side with Purépecha speakers were relocated outside of the Tarascan frontiers, whereas speakers of Otomi, fleeing the Aztec expansion, resettled on the border between the two polities. This created a fairly <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area</b> of Purépecha speakers with no other languages spoken in the core area around Lake Pátzcuaro.With the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Purépecha state was at first peacefully incorporated into the realm of New Spain, but with the killing of Cazonci Tangaxuán II by Nuño de Guzmán the relation became one of Spanish dominance by force. Exceptions to this were the Hospital communities of Vasco de Quiroga, such as Santa Fé de la Laguna, where Purépecha could live with a degree of protection from Spanish domination. Through Spanish friars, the Purépecha learned to write in the Latin script, and Purépecha became a literary language in the early colonial period. There is a body of written sources in Purépecha from this period, including several dictionaries, confessionaries, and land titles. Among the most important colonial works are the grammar (1558) and dictionary (1559) of Fray Maturino Gilberti, and the grammar and dictionary (1574) by Juan Baptista de Lagunas ...|$|E

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper The statistical {{homogeneity of}} rock mass {{has always been}} an important issue in rock mass engineering. The rock mass of national underground oil storage in Huang Island is analyzed in this study with focus on the division of a statistically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area.</b> Trace length is a basic element in determining crack features. The rock mass of different track lengths differs widely in terms of mechanics and deformation characteristics. This study includes trace length information in the division of a statistically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area</b> and considers the variances and mean values of crack samples in different regions separately by F-test and T-test to determine if the samples have statistically similar trace length information. Numerous crack samples are required to divide a statistically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area.</b> This study adopts the Watson test to divide a statistically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>area</b> and considers data on crack occurrence to achieve the purpose of obtaining fewer samples for occurrence comparison. Crack occurrence and trace length information are considered by integrating F-test, T-test, and Watson test to gather adequate basic information on cracks and obtain objective and reasonable results for statistical homogeneity...|$|E

The method uses an indirect approach to estimate, based on a combination of planning parameters and characteristics of the area that contribute to the formation of market values of building sites. It does not provide a point estimate, relative to assets specifically identified, but produces average market values of the building sites to separate <b>homogeneous</b> <b>areas,</b> for intended use and for building ratio...|$|R
