40|$|Misbehavior is a {{research}} topic that most researchers investigate from teachers 2 ̆ 7 points of view. This study, in contrast, was designed to explore misbehavior from the students 2 ̆ 7 and the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s perspectives, using Doyle 2 ̆ 7 s ecological approach. A male teacher, Mr. Softball, and 14 seventh and eighth graders (ten males and four females) volunteered to participate during a two-week basketball unit. Data were collected through shadowing the teacher, critical incidents, student and teacher interviews, videotaped class sessions, and audiotaped stimulated recall sessions with the videotapes. Data from all sources were analyzed using constant comparison to identify common themes. Findings indicated that Mr. Softball 2 ̆ 7 s classes included overlapping instructional, managerial, and social task systems (Doyle, 1986; Siedentop, 1991) and his overall program of action {{could be classified as}} casual. Misbehavior was situation specific and occurred throughout these overlapping task systems. Students and the teacher noticed few misbehaviors during the actual classes and the misbehaviors recognized did not interrupt the flow of his teaching. When they noticed misbehavior incidents, either during class or when reviewing videotapes, they reacted differently from case to case based on who misbehaved, when it happened, and how it affected them or the class. Misbehaviors were common events in Mr. Softball 2 ̆ 7 s classes and most students admitted that they misbehaved. Misbehaviors could be classified as verbal, physical, or rules, routines, and expectations (RRE) -related. These students defined misbehavior as doing something that they were not supposed to do or not doing something that they were supposed to do. Mr. Softball 2 ̆ 7 s (a) weak RREs, (b) lack of effectiveness in organizing and delivering instructional tasks, and (c) loose accountability and the lack of intervention, allowed many opportunities for students to misbehave. Further, he created a class environment in which students engaged more often in social agendas at the expense of completing instructional and managerial tasks. Finally, the norm of this workplace did not support Mr. Softball in helping students learn or <b>in</b> maintaining <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> that students were on-task and well-behaved. In summary, less effective teaching appeared to be the major issue that encourages students to misbehave. ...|$|R

40|$|NASA goals include {{long-term}} International Space Station (ISS) {{missions and}} the ambitious objective of eventually sending astronauts to Mars.

Therefore, NASA is seeking a ground-based animal model to study the long-term effects of unloading on bone <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> better <b>insure</b> the health and mission capability of astronauts. The hindlimb unloaded (HU) rat model was used to study the effects of multiple unloading exposures and aging on bone properties. Six month old, adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into the following groups: baseline (BL, sacrificed when received at 6 months age), aging cage control (AC, normal weight-bearing cage activity), 1 HU 7 (unloaded for 1 month starting at 7 months of age and allowed to recover for 3 months), 1 HU 10 (normal cage activity until 10 months of age, unloaded for 1 month, recovered for 2 months), and 2 HU 10 (unloaded for 1 month at 7 months of age, allowed to recover for 2 months, unloaded again for 1 month at 10 months of age, followed by 2 months of recovery). Every 28 days a subset of animals (n= 15) were euthanized and both femurs were excised. A peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scanner was used to collect densitometric and geometric properties at the right and left femoral neck and at the left femoral midshaft. Mechanical testing (axial and lateral compression of the femoral neck and 3 pt bending of the midshaft) was performed at each location and strength indices based on pQCT parameters were calculated. Femoral neck properties decreased due to HU but recovered with respect to increase over HU, BL, and AC {{by the end of the}} recovery periods. Femoral midshaft properties were relatively unaffected, but did show slight decreases for older animals at month 10, which recovered during the two month recovery period. Femoral neck geometry exhibited increased endocortical resorption and periosteal apposition of the cortical shell which suggests that trabecular bone plays an important role in how the total bone is affected by HU. Densitometric properties were affected less by HU with respect to BL than were mechanical strength values. Results suggest that femoral neck is more affected by unloading than midshaft, particularly for multiple exposures of unloading. Also, aging does not appear to be a critical factor for bone loss due to HU for either femoral neck or midshaft...|$|R
40|$|The chief aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to develop a}} clearer {{understanding}} of the factors which affect a state leadership's tendencies to behave in particular ways towards other states. It seeks to compare and contrast the effect of different security policy choices upon the Swedish and Norwegian leaders' attitudes, approach and diplomatic style towards the Soviet Union. The aim is to observe important differences and similarities in the responses to largely equivalent stimuli across a cross-section of issue areas most relevant for the Scandinavians' respective bilateral relationships with the Soviet Union. More precisely, what difference does Sweden's choice to pursue neutrality and Norway's decision to become a member of NATO make in their respective relations to a superpower. Based upon the secondary literature on alliances and neutrality, several working hypotheses which are proposed to affect Sweden's and Norway's relationship with the Soviet Union were generated: most important to a neutral power is that it be seen to pursue a credible policy of indifference in relation to the East-West Cold War; actions which may be interpreted as being partial to either side of East-West conflict will be avoided; as a neutral Sweden must defend its territorial integrity. Finally, Sweden's neutrality can also be promoted through playing the role of impartial mediator in conflict situations, advocating disarmament in international fora, and resorting to international norms and organisations in its relationship with the Soviet Union. NATO member Norway must make sure that it pursues policies which are partial to its alliance members. Much of what Norway does with respect to the Soviet Union is motivated by a desire to demonstrate NATO's credibility as a cohesive, credible deterrent force to the Soviet threat. Here, demonstrations of loyalty to alliance ideals and solidarity with alliance partners are key to understanding why Norway acts as it does in relation to the Soviet Union. Policy co-ordination and consultation between NATO members are important parts of maintaining a cohesive viable deterrent against the Soviet Union. Finally, Norway has shunned arrangements which could result in isolation from fellow NATO members <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> further <b>insure</b> NATO credibility and its position within the NATO organisation. The body of the thesis examines crucial bilateral issues in two time periods: 1947 - 1949 and 1987 - 1991. In 1947 - 1949 the Swedish and Norwegian decisions to participate in the Marshall Plan and general trade questions are discussed. Also examined in this period are both leaderships' reactions to the Communist coups in Eastern Europe, and Norwegian and Swedish interpretations of Finland's destiny. In the period 1987 - 1991 the Norwegian and Swedish leaderships are contrasted over their handling of the Nordic Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Proposal, border security issues, legal-maritime disputes, the Baltic recognition question, trade, environmental and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union. Finally, Swedish and Norwegian interpretations of the changing Soviet military threat are also compared and contrasted. The thesis concludes that although commitments to neutrality and alignment provide powerful explanations for why Swedish and Norwegian leaders behave in observed ways, they can only provide one such explanation. The hypotheses provided at the outset are, in the main confirmed, and help to illuminate the junctures where neutrality and alignment actually do play important roles in determining Swedish and Norwegian attitudes, diplomatic style and approach toward the Soviet Union...|$|R

40|$|Sir : I {{have the}} honor to {{transmit}} herewith for publication a bulletin [...] containing some suggestions to pioneer farmers in Alaska, prepared [...] by Prof. C. C. Georgeson, {{special agent in}} charge of Alaska investigations. [...] The bulletin is devoted mainly to a discussion of the preliminary [...] operations of selecting and preparing land for cultivation [...] under Alaska conditions, indicating briefly the kinds of crops which [...] have been found to succeed in Alaska and the methods of manuring [...] which may be used with advantage in certain cases. The advice given [...] is based upon the results of investigations carried on in the Territory [...] since 1893, and it is believed that it will prove timely and useful to [...] the increasing number of persons who are undertaking the home [...] production of some of the necessities of life in Alaska. [...] Very respectfully, [...] A. C. True, [...] Director. A study of the agricultural resources and capabilities of Alaska [...] was begun under authority of Congress in 1898. Results of the earlier [...] preliminary surveys seemed to justify the continuation and extension [...] of the work and its establishment on a more definite and permanent [...] basis. This has been carried out by the organization of a system of [...] stations for observation and experiment at different points in the [...] Territory which seem best adapted to the purposes in view. Stations [...] have now been established at Sitka (the headquarters), Kenai, and [...] Rampart on the Yukon. Five reports giving the results of the agricultural [...] investigations in Alaska have been issued as Congressional [...] documents and bulletins of the Office of Experiment Stations, U. S. [...] Department of Agriculture. [...] Those who have received these reports and who have noted the [...] letters which are published in them from settlers in nearly all parts [...] of the territory south of the Arctic Circle can doubt no longer that [...] Alaska has agricultural possibilities. These letters bear testimony [...] that hardy vegetables have been grown with marked success almost [...] everywhere in Alaska where they have been tried, and that, likewise, [...] early maturing grains have been grown successfully in many places [...] (Pls. I and II). Potatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, peas, lettuce, [...] turnips, ruta-bagas, and radishes have been grown at nearly every [...] white settlement in the coast region and in many places in the interior [...] (Pls. Ill and IV). Early maturing varieties of barley, oats, and spring [...] wheat have yielded well at Dawson, in the Yukon territory, and at [...] Eagle, Alaska, near the Canadian boundary. At Rampart, on the sixty-fifth [...] parallel, a station was established by the Department of Agriculture [...] in the summer of 1900. Winter rye seeded there in August of that [...] year lived through the winter under a good covering of snow; although [...] the temperature fell to 70 degrees below zero, it came out in the [...] spring in perfect condition and matured grain by the 1 st of August, [...] 1901. Barley seeded at this station in May was ripe by the middle [...] of August. At the headquarters station, at Sitka, spring wheat has [...] matured with good results for three years past, and barley and oats [...] have been grown there for four years. These grains have likewise [...] been grown successfully at the experiment station at Kenai, on Kenai [...] Peninsula. Barley, oats, and wheat have prospered well at Copper [...] Center, in the Copper River country, and oats have been grown to [...] maturity on Steele Creek, a tributary of the Fortymile, in latitude [...] 64 °. Oats and barley have been matured at Skagway; Killisnoo, on [...] the coast, and at Selkirk, on the Upper Yukon. [...] The reports referred to give data from many other parts of the [...] Territory which are proof that it is possible to farm successfully in [...] Alaska if one understands the conditions and proceeds in his methods [...] of work in accordance with the teachings of experience in Alaska. [...] The pioneer who comes to Alaska to farm often finds that it is not [...] safe to follow the customs with which he is familiar in regions farther [...] south. The season is shorter than it is in the States and he must, <b>in</b> [...] <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> success, select early maturing varieties of both vegetables [...] and grains. In the coast region the climate is wet and the soil [...] is often water-logged, making drainage necessary in many places; [...] Again, the pioneer soon learns that new soil, which contains more [...] or less vegetable matter, does not yield satisfactory crops until it has [...] been cultivated for two or three years. When he sows good seed on [...] what appears to be rich soil, and the crop makes only an indifferent [...] growth, he is apt to blame the climate for the result, when, as a matter [...] of fact, the partial failure is due, in most cases, to the condition of the [...] soil and not to the climate. These peculiarities in Alaska should be [...] well understood at the outset, and it is chiefly to point out the causes [...] of failure to those who have had little or no experience in Alaska, and [...] to call attention to practical methods of doing the work, that these [...] suggestions are offered...|$|R
