5|$|Unknown {{before the}} Apollo 15 mission, there are {{parallel}} linear {{patterns on the}} faces of the mountains in the area. Although they appeared to be occurrences of fracturing or layering appearing through the regolith, determining this is made difficult by the lighting circumstances during the mission. A <b>dark</b> <b>band</b> on Mount Hadley, believed to be a marking left by lava after receding, was observed by the Apollo 15 crew.|$|E
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} in several ways. It {{is larger than the}} lesser yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and <b>dark</b> <b>band</b> vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E
5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a <b>dark</b> <b>band</b> between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E
50|$|The workers, the queen, and the drones of A. koschevnikovi are all <b>dark</b> brown <b>banded.</b> The workers, however, have light orange {{abdominal}} bands {{while the}} queen and the drones have light brown abdominal bands. Ko is the gene responsible {{for the expression of}} body color type in A. koschevnikovi. This gene is shown to be sex-linked, since experiments have shown that a cross between a brown, <b>dark</b> <b>banded</b> queen and a brown, <b>dark</b> <b>banded</b> drone results in orange, <b>dark</b> <b>banded</b> workers.|$|R
50|$|The {{banded linsang}} is around 74 cm long {{including}} the tail. It is a pale yellow with 5 <b>dark</b> <b>bands.</b> It has broad stripes on its neck and its tail consists of several <b>dark</b> <b>bands</b> with a <b>dark</b> tip. The <b>banded</b> linsang has very sharp retractable claws and razor sharp teeth. It is the rarest of the civets, and {{is sometimes called}} the tiger-civet.|$|R

25|$|Ovis ammon sheep are colored a dark brown, {{with white}} underparts; the two {{different}} sections are separated by a <b>dark</b> <b>band</b> of hair. There is a white patch on the rump as well, which is not so clearly defined on most subspecies except O. a. polii. As winter approaches, the white hair on males grows longer, until it becomes a prominent ruff, although on O. a. polii the ruff stands out less than other subspecies. Females' coats are lighter than the males', {{and do not have}} such a drastic seasonal change. The Marco Polo sheep's face is lighter colored than the body.|$|E
25|$|The key to {{deciphering}} Uranus's spectrum {{was found}} in the 1930s by Rupert Wildt and Vesto Slipher, who found that the dark bands at 543, 619, 925, 865 and 890nm belonged to gaseous methane. They had never been observed before because they were very weak and required a long path length to be detected. This meant that the atmosphere of Uranus was transparent to a much greater depth compared to those of other giant planets. In 1950, Gerard Kuiper noticed another diffuse <b>dark</b> <b>band</b> in the spectrum of Uranus at 827nm, which he failed to identify. In 1952 Gerhard Herzberg, a future Nobel Prize winner, showed that this band was caused by the weak quadrupole absorption of molecular hydrogen, which thus became the second compound detected on Uranus. Until 1986 only two gases, methane and hydrogen, were known in the Uranian atmosphere. The far-infrared spectroscopic observation beginning from 1967 consistently showed the atmosphere of Uranus was in approximate thermal balance with incoming solar radiation (in other words, it radiated as much heat as it received from the Sun), and no internal heat source was required to explain observed temperatures. No discrete features had been observed on Uranus prior to the Voyager 2 visit in 1986.|$|E

[...] It offers a range of text-based information, typically including news, weather and TV schedules. Paged subtitle (or closed captioning) information is also transmitted within the television signal.|$|E
2500|$|Gubbio is {{also known}} among geologists and palaeontologists as the {{discovery}} place of what was at first called the [...] "Gubbio layer", a sedimentary layer enriched in iridium that was exposed by a roadcut outside of town. [...] This thin, <b>dark</b> <b>band</b> of sediment marks the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, {{also known as the}} K–T boundary or K–Pg boundary, between the Cretaceous and Paleogene geological periods about [...] million years ago, and was formed by infalling debris from the gigantic meteor impact probably responsible for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. [...] Its [...] iridium, a heavy metal rare on Earth's surface, is plentiful in extraterrestrial material such as comets and asteroids. [...] It also contains small globules of glassy material called tektites, formed in the initial impact. [...] Discovered at Gubbio, the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary is also visible at many places all over the world. [...] The characteristics of this boundary layer support the theory that a devastating meteorite impact, with accompanying ecological and climatic disturbance, was directly responsible for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E

2500|$|Spinner {{dolphins}} {{are small}} cetaceans with a slim build. Adults are typically 129–235cm long and reach a body mass of 23–79kg. This species has an elongated rostrum and a triangular or subtriangular dorsal fin. Spinner dolphins generally have tripartite color patterns. The dorsal area is dark gray, the sides light gray, and the underside pale gray or white. Also, a <b>dark</b> <b>band</b> {{runs from the}} eye to the flipper, bordered above by a thin, light line. However, the spinner dolphin has more geographic variation in form and coloration than other cetaceans. In the open waters of eastern Pacific, dolphins have relatively small skulls with short rostra. A dwarf form of spinner dolphin occurs around southeast Asia. [...] In these same subspecies, a dark dorsal cape dims their tripartite color patterns. Further offshore, subspecies {{tend to have a}} paler and less far-reaching cape. In certain subspecies, some males may have upright fins that slant forward. Some populations of spinner dolphin found in the eastern Pacific have bizarre backwards-facing dorsal fins, and males can have strange humps and upturned caudal flukes.|$|E
60|$|Towards 11 p.m., the <b>dark</b> <b>band</b> {{appeared}} to have replaced the luminous arch; the beams were all but gone, a few fragments appearing in the N.E. A southerly wind sprang up, and a diffused light extended along the horizon.|$|E

A small brig of about a hundred tons' burden lay anchored a short distance from the shore. The paint was off in many places, and everywhere blistered by the sun. Her sails hung loosely in the gaskets, and the slackness of her ropes and her general air of untidiness alike showed the absence of any sort of discipline on board.|$|E
