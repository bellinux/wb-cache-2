Using a theoretical framework based upon a European approach to evaluation in higher education known as “tuning,” practitioners’ perceptions {{of the extent to which}} the ABFSE <b>funeral</b> <b>service</b> education curriculum is properly “tuned” to contemporary workforce needs were measured. An on-line survey instrument was developed for this study, and participants were asked to evaluate the importance of approximately one-third of the 170 ABFSE learning objectives for professional practice. For these same objectives, participants were also asked to evaluate a) the extent to which they believe they were adequately prepared by their <b>funeral</b> <b>service</b> education program to master each learning objective and b) their perception of the adequacy of each set of learning objectives, grouped according to curriculum content This study investigated practitioners’ perceptions of the a) importance, b) academic preparation related to, and c) adequacy of, <b>funeral</b> <b>service</b> education at academic programs accredited by the American Board of <b>Funeral</b> <b>Service</b> Education (ABFSE) in the context of changing death care preferences in the United States.

This study found evidence of a significant negative relationship between perceived preparation to take the NBE and perceived qualification to enter the workforce as an entry-level funeral director and/or embalmer. The results also indicated a disparity in annual income for work in <b>funeral</b> <b>service</b> between genders, with women earning significantly less money than men employed in similar positions. Practitioners recommended an expansion of work-related clinical experiences for students as part of their <b>funeral</b> <b>service</b> education, as well as increased efforts to prepare students for the kinds of work-related funeral directing activities they will experience following graduation...|$|R

5|$|Although {{it had its}} own {{branch line}} into Brookwood Cemetery, most of {{the route of the}} London Necropolis Railway ran on the {{existing}} London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Consequently, a site was selected in Waterloo, near the LSWR's recently opened London terminus at Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo). The building was specifically designed for the use of mourners. It had many private waiting rooms, which could also be used to hold <b>funeral</b> <b>services,</b> and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level. Existing railway arches were used for the storage of bodies.|$|E

In any event, McAleer died suddenly on April 29, 1931, shortly after being released from the hospital. He was 66 years old. After private <b>funeral</b> <b>services</b> at Orr's funeral home, McAleer's remains were interred at Oak Hill Cemetery, on Youngstown's near south side.

5|$|In June 1942, Heydrich {{was assassinated}} in Prague in an {{operation}} led by Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, members of Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile who had been trained by the British Special Operations Executive. During the two <b>funeral</b> <b>services,</b> Himmler—the chief mourner—took charge of Heydrich's two young sons, and he gave the eulogy in Berlin. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death. Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of Lidice was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults {{in the village of}} Ležáky were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads. Himmler took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped up the pace of the killing of Jews in Aktion Reinhard (Operation Reinhard), named in Heydrich's honour. He ordered the Aktion Reinhard camps—the first extermination camps—to be constructed at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka.|$|E

William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Sorabji ceased composing, {{because of}} his failing {{eyesight}} and difficulties in holding a pen. His health deteriorated severely in 1986, obliging him to abandon his home and spend several months in a Wareham hospital. In March 1987, together with his companion Reginald Norman Best (1909–1988), he moved into a two-room suite in Marley House Nursing Home, a private nursing home in Winfrith Newburgh, where he was permanently chairbound and received daily nursing care. In June 1988 he suffered a mild stroke, which left him slightly mentally impaired. He died of heart failure on 15 October 1988 at a little after 7pm, at the age of 96. He was cremated in Bournemouth Crematorium on 24 October of that year, and the <b>funeral</b> <b>services</b> took place in Corfe Castle Parish Church on the same day.|$|E
5|$|In 1688, the Spanish sent {{three more}} expeditions, two by sea {{and one by}} land.

Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including {{a woman who had}} been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted <b>funeral</b> <b>services</b> for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, , wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location.|$|E

After questioning Took, police accompanied him home and to the police station again for a polygraph test. On the way, they stopped at a restaurant along Pasir Panjang Road for a meal. While eating, Took said he needed to go to the toilet, escaped, took a taxi to Woodlands and sneaked across the Causeway to Malaysia. Singaporean police searched for him until he turned himself in on 30 October, confessing that he had accidentally strangled Huang Na during a game of hide-and-seek in a storeroom. The following day, Huang Na's body was found at Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Took was charged with her murder. Direct Singapore <b>Funeral</b> <b>Services</b> oversaw her funeral for free. Thousands attended Huang Na's wake and funeral; some gave bai jin and gifts, such as sweets, flowers and her favourite Hello Kitty merchandise. However, some Singaporeans tried to make money from the girl's death by buying 4D numbers associated with her. Others spread rumours that Shuying was having affairs and was greedy for donations.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} the {{terminus}} the mourners would be led either {{to one of the}} dedicated first class waiting rooms (for first and second class funerals) or to the communal third class waiting room. The coffin would be discreetly unloaded from the hearse and sent to the platform level by lift. Those attending first and second class funerals would be permitted to watch the coffins being loaded onto the train if they so wished. (After the relocation to the new London terminus in 1902, some <b>funeral</b> <b>services</b> would be held in a Chapelle Ardente on platform level, for those cases where mourners were unable to make the journey to Brookwood.) Each door of the waiting train would be labelled with the name of the deceased, to ensure all passengers travelled with the correct funeral party; the names of the deceased being carried on the train would be called in turn, and that person's mourners would board the train.|$|E

Soon {{after the end of}} the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space, and the rail tracks in the cemetery were removed.

The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished. The site of the northern station, serving the Nonconformist cemetery, is now heavily overgrown. The site of the southern, Anglican, station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and a shrine to King Edward the Martyr, which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels.|$|E
