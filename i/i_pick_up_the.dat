Spector said that they enjoyed not being attached to an existing franchise, because it meant that they [...] "could basically do whatever they liked". [...] "Underworld I was defined by a little animation lead artist Doug Wike had done, showing the user interface, a monster and some movement. Shock was defined by two little three-paragraph [...] "minute of gameplay" [...] documents. Pretty much everything derived from them somehow." [...] —Doug Church [...] The four collaborated to write numerous [...] "minutes of gameplay" [...] documents, which conveyed how the game would feel. Church later gave the example, [...] "You hear the sound of a security camera swiveling, and then the beep of it acquiring you as a target, so you duck behind the crate and then you hear the door open so you throw a grenade and run out of the way". The documents would [...] "hint" [...] at the gameplay systems involved, and at the emergent possibilities in each situation. Although Neurath was involved in these initial design sessions, he believed that the project [...] "was always Doug Churchs vision at heart". Church and Grossman refined several of the teams documents and defined the games design and direction, and Grossman wrote the games original design document. Grossman built on ideas that he first explored while writing and designing Ultima Underworld IIs tomb dimension, which he later called a [...] "mini-prototype" [...] for System Shock. These concepts included the minimization of dialogue trees and a greater focus on exploration. The team believed that dialogue trees [...] "broke the fiction" [...] of games; Church later commented that the dialogue trees in the Ultima Underworld series were like separate games in themselves, disconnected from main experience of being immersed in the environment. There were also concerns about realism.|$|E

40|$|My {{argument}} is relatively straightforward: the almost {{complete absence of}} Marxism in biblical postcolonial criticism is {{a legacy of the}} wider zone of postcolonial theory itself that has been all too keen to dump Marx. But I also want to show how the gradual forgetting of Marx in postcolonialism and postcolonial theory has distinct ramifications for the engagements with postcolonial theory by biblical critics. So, after outlining the way postcolonial theory has forgotten its own history, a history in which Marxism was the key factor, I select two biblical critics working with postcolonial theory in order not only to make the obvious point about the absence of Marx but also to indicate some of the shortfalls such an absence generates.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{follow up on}} a earlier one (Mendes, 1998) where I {{proposed}} a series of models for forest owners associations represented as organisation made up of two groups of strategically interacting players: the forest owners {{who are members of}} the association and the board of directors they have elected. The directors decide on the amount of services provided by the association which can be public goods (collective representation of the members, promotion of their common interests, diffusion of general information about forest programmes and best forest management practices, etc.) and private goods and services (silvicultural works preventive of forest fires, technical advice, etc.). The models were set up as games in strategic form with complete information and no payoff uncertainty. Here <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> second of, what is called in that previous paper, the "Portuguese" models and extend it in the following directions: - there is payoff risk for the forest owners due to exogenous hazards (forest fires or others); - forest owners can buy private services from the owners which contribute to reduce the losses resulting from those hazards. The main focus in this paper is to derive the comparative static results about the demand of these private services by the forest owners. forest owners’ associations, public and private goods joint supply, game theory...|$|E
40|$|In echoing a {{well-known}} title of some thirty-six years ago (Pike 1947), I {{do not wish}} to suggest that considerations of meaning and grammatical function have been excluded from the study of diachronic phonology. How to characterize the interface between phonology and morphosyntax across time has stimulated perennial debate, having commanded the attention of several generations of historical linguists from Curtius (1870) and Jespersen (1894) to, most recently, Lass (1980 : Ch. 3). With a burgeoning literature on the mechanisms of syntactic change and the renascent interest in morphology, the issue is once more felt to be acute. Our concern, of course, is no longer with the autonomy of one plane from the other. It would seem uncontroversial to assert that grammar plays SOME role in the course of phonological change [...] and vice versa. But how to make sense of this truism remains problematic. Following some general remarks {{on the nature of the}} problem (Part 1), I present in Part 2 a critical assessment of significant approaches to grammatical prerequisites in recent scholarship. <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> debate from roughly the end of ~he classical generative. d 1 perlo. Beside providing a convenient point of departure, this par-ticular time represents something of a benchmark. Applications of generative theory to diachrony and, along another front, enquiries into the propagation of sound change (e. g., Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog 1968) had occasioned the revival of an old question: th...|$|E
