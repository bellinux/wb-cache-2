For example, at 27°C (i.e., a common inlet temperature in the Middle East), rapid <b>film</b> <b>formation</b> and good corrosion protection can be expected within a few hours. At 16°C, it could take 2–3 months for the protection to mature.

These alloys have good resistance to chloride pitting and crevice corrosion and are not susceptible to chloride stress corrosion.|$|E

50|$|Electrofiltration is {{regarded}} as an appropriate technique for concentration and fractionation of biopolymers. The <b>film</b> <b>formation</b> on the filter membrane which hinders filtration can be minimized or completely avoided by the application of electric field, improving filtration’s performance and increasing selectivity in case of fractionation.

50|$|In {{order to}} provide optimal performance, pigment {{particles}} must act independently {{of each other in}} the coating film and thus must remain well dispersed throughout manufacture, storage, application, and <b>film</b> <b>formation.</b> Unfortunately, colloidal dispersions such as the pigment dispersions in liquid coatings are inherently unstable, and they must be stabilized against the flocculation that might occur.|$|E

Temperature control of both the gas and water, as well as level control, affect delivery rate. ALD is increasingly popular for creating thin films for gate dielectrics, capacitor dielectrics and diffusion barriers. Contamination is a high risk in this process because ALD is slower and performed at lower temperatures.|$|E

The <b>film</b> <b>formation</b> mechanism of the simplest examples involve first evaporation of solvents followed by reaction with oxygen from the environment over a period of days, weeks and even months to create a crosslinked network. Classic alkyd enamels would fall into this category. Oxidative cure coatings are catalyzed by metal complex driers such as cobalt naphthenate.|$|E

Drying refers to simple evaporation of the solvent or thinner to leave a coherent film behind. Coalescence refers to a mechanism that involves drying followed by actual interpenetration and fusion of formerly discrete particles. Thermoplastic film-forming mechanisms are sometimes described as [...] "thermoplastic cure" [...] {{but that is a}} misnomer because no chemical curing reactions are required to knit the film. Thermosetting mechanisms, on the other hand, are true curing mechanism that involve chemical reaction(s) among the polymers that make up the binder.|$|E

50|$|Surfactants {{affect a}} wide array of {{physical}} properties in paints. Surfactants affect the behavior of a paint not only during the lifetime of the formed coating but also the initial aggregation and <b>film</b> <b>formation</b> of the paint. Surfactants are also used to stabilize the dispersion of polymer particles during emulsion polymerization in paints and other applications. The mechanical stability, freeze-thaw stability and shelf-life of paints are all improved by the addition of surfactants. The addition of surfactants to paint also allow the paint to coat a surface more easily because surfactants increase the wetting of a solution.|$|E
50|$|In {{water-borne}} coatings, an aqueous polymer dispersion {{creates a}} {{film on the}} substrate once the solvent has evaporated. Surface functionalization of the polymer particles is {{a key component of}} a coating formulation allowing control over such properties as dispersion, <b>film</b> <b>formation</b> temperature, and the coating rheology. Dispersing aids often involve steric or electrostatic repulsion of the polymer particles, providing colloidal stability. The dispersing aids adsorb (as in a grafting onto scheme) onto latex particles giving them functionality. The association of other additives, such as thickeners shown in the schematic to the right, with adsorbed polymer material give rise to complex rheological behavior and excellent control over a coating's flow properties.|$|E
50|$|Electrofiltration is a {{technique}} for separation and concentration of colloidal substances - for instance biopolymers. The principle of electrofiltration is based on overlaying electric field on a standard dead-end filtration. Thus the created polarity facilitates electrophoretic force which is opposite to the resistance force of the filtrate flow and directs the charged biopolymers. This provides extreme decrease in the <b>film</b> <b>formation</b> on the micro- or ultra-filtration membranes and the reduction of filtration time from several hours by standard filtration to a few minutes by electrofiltration. In comparison to cross-flow filtration electrofiltration exhibits not only increased permeate flow but also guarantees reduced shear force stress which qualifies it as particularly mild technique for separation of biopolymers that are usually unstable.|$|E

5000|$|The oldest {{anodizing}} process uses chromic acid. It is widely {{known as the}} Bengough-Stuart process. In North America it is known as Type I {{because it is so}} designated by the MIL-A-8625 standard, but it is also covered by AMS 2470 and MIL-A-8625 Type IB. In the UK it is normally specified as Def Stan 03/24 and used in areas that are prone to come into contact with propellants etc. There are also Boeing and Airbus standards. Chromic acid produces thinner, 0.5 μm to 18 μm (0.00002" [...] to 0.0007") more opaque films that are softer, ductile, and to a degree self-healing. They are harder to dye and may be applied as a pretreatment before painting.

50|$|In general, {{the lower}} the surface tension of a liquid coating, the easier {{it will be to}} form a {{satisfactory}} wet film from it. The difference between the surface tension of a coating and the surface energy of a solid substrate to which a coating is applied affects how the liquid coating flows out over the substrate. It also affects the strength of the adhesive bond between the substrate and the dry film. If for instance, the surface tension of the coating is higher than the surface tension of the substrate, then the coating will not spread out and form a film. As the surface tension of the substrate is increased, it will reach a point to where the coating will successfully wet the substrate but have poor adhesion. Continuous increase in the coating surface tension will result in better wetting in <b>film</b> <b>formation</b> and better dry film adhesion.|$|E
