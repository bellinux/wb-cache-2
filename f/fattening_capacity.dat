40|$|Cattle {{breeding}} {{is one of}} {{the part}} of traditional Czech agriculture. It is a vital part of economy consisting of two main branches - milk and beef production. Beef {{is one of the}} main products of cattle breeding sometimes provided by fattening of heifers, cows and bulls. Producing meat with the highest quality with low costs is the main goal of fattening the cattles. I have tested the influence of selected fators on the <b>fattening</b> <b>capacity</b> and carcass values of Czech Fleckvieh bulls in the control station as well as the economic requirements of the fattening period. I have compared the test period of 530 ? 10 days with period of 610 ? 10 days of fattening using the old and new technology of supplementation. Further fattening was provided by results of growing Charolais, Limousin and Czech Fleckvies x Simmental bulls. The results suggest that the increase of the period of fattening for 80 days had a positive effect on carcass yield (p < 0. 001), assigning in the classification according to SEUROP and profitability of farming. The positiv relationships between breeding value of fathers and carcass yield of their sons was observed. Finally, the positive influence of new technology of fattening on the classification acording to SEUROP was shown...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although {{the content}} of {{intramuscular}} fat (IMF) influences significantly meat quality, it can be estimated only after the slaughter of animals. Variants of the H-FABP gene were suggested as candidate genes influencing the variability of IMF. The effect of H-FABP – HinfI polymorphism on {{the content of}} IMF, backfat thickness, the weight and percentages of major meat parts and of the leg in carcass weight was studied in a group of 97 pigs (46 gilts and 51 barrows) of Large White and Landrace breeds using the test of <b>fattening</b> <b>capacity</b> and carcass value. In the set of experimental animals, the frequencies of genes were H = 0. 75 ± 0. 03 and h = 0. 25 ± 0. 03. Biometric analyses did not corroborate differences among different H-FABP – HinfI genotypes and all the traits under study. Only in genotypes HH and Hh the differences between least-square means of phenotypic IMF values under study were close to the limit of significance (P = 0. 06). Key words: backfat thickness, H-FABP, HinfI, intramuscular fat, meat production, pig. Intramuscular fat content (IMF) is a major determinant of the quality of pork. Significant associations between A-FABP and H-FABP (FABP 3) genotypes determining fatty acid binding protein of adipocyte and heart cells and IMF content in purebred Duroc pigs were identified by GERBENS et al. (1996, 1998, 1999). The analysis of a crossbred Meishan × Dutch White pig population supported the involvement of H-FABP, but not of A-FABP in IMF accretion (GERBENS et al. 2000). GERBENS et al. (2001) studied associations of H-FABP and A-FABP gene expression with IMF. H-FABP statistical analysis showed significant difference...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} leptin gene single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) on cattle internal environment indicators were evaluated. In experiment 58 Czech Pied bulls divided in three groups (TT, CT and CC) according to leptin SNP were investigated. Serum leptin, insulin, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, triacylglycerols and non-esterified fatty acids concentrations were measured. No significant differences in serum T 3, T 4, TAG and NEFA concentrations between experimental groups, were found. Significantly higher concentration of serum insulin was recorded in group of TT bulls compared to CT a CC genotype. No effect of SNP of leptin gene on leptin serum concentration was recorded. No significant correlations between monitored hormones and metabolites in serum of Czech Pied bulls were found. Some differences in comparison with results found in other studies could be given by differences in <b>fattening</b> <b>capacities</b> particular breeds...|$|R
40|$|Pork {{represents}} the largest volume of meat production {{in terms of}} the global market. In the Czech Republic accounted for over 50 % of total meat consumption. Pork is often cited as a food with a high level of fat and unfavorable balance of fatty acids. Intake of dietary fats should contain saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids in a ratio of 0, 6. The PUFA/SFA ratio should be higher than 0, 4 and the n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA ratio should be 5 : 1. To increase awareness of the importance of food to human health has recently been an effort to find ways to produce healthier meat, i. e. with a higher proportion of PUFA to SFA and better ratio of n- 6 and n- 3 PUFA. Pork quality in terms of its composition of fatty acids is currently not very favorable. Fatty acid profile in animal fats can affect by the fat contained in food and change the composition of fatty acids in the fat of pigs through the nutrition. The diploma thesis describes the fats, their importance in human nutrition, a group of fatty acids found in fats, their sources and factors influencing the content and fatty acid profile in muscle and adipose tissue of animals. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the influence of additions of rapeseed and soybean oil, as a major source of unsaturated fatty acids, in pig fattening on the quality and composition of intramuscular fat (IMF) in the pork loin (MLLT). It was also evaluated the effect of the addition of these oils on selected parameters of <b>fattening</b> <b>capacity</b> and carcass value. For a more objective evaluation of the suitability of fat was calculated atherogenic and thrombogenic index. The experiment was included 32 pieces of slaughter pigs for in the final hybrid combinations DanBred. Pigs were throughout the fattening fed ad libitum complete feed mixtures and depending on the feeding divided into three groups, i. e. control group without the addition of oil and an experimental group containing 4 % of rapeseed oil and an experimental group with the addition of 4 % soybean oil. The results show that the group with the addition of soybean oil exhibited simultaneously with the lowest daily intake of feed the best feed conversion. The addition of rapeseed and soybean oil had no significant effect on the physical parameters of the pork loin and backfat. So, technological quality of backfat has not been influenced. Amount of IMF not influenced by any of the oils. However, fatty acid composition in IMF has been influenced, both of oils. Although, SFA has not been influenced neither one of the oil, content of the most represented SFA, palmitic acid, was significantly reduced in the soy diet. Significantly lowest content of MUFA showed group with soybean oil, which was due to a significant reduction of the most represented acid, oleic acid. Treatment with the addition of both oils were significantly increased PUFA and n- 3 PUFA. The PUFA/SFA ratio was also increased, the most by soybean oil. The ratio of n- 6 / n- 3 PUFA was significantly reduced by the rapeseed oil. Content of linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid was significantly increased as rapeseed and soybean oil. Soybean oil increased content of alpha-linolenic acid significantly more than rapeseed, which against significantly increased linoleic acid. Thrombogenic index was significantly reduced by rapeseed and soybean oil, atherogenic index only by soybean...|$|E
