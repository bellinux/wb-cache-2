5|$|The Tosa-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to be armed with a main battery of ten 45-caliber 41-centimeter guns in five twin turrets, four of which were superfiring fore and aft. Numbered one through five from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear,</b> the hydraulically powered turrets had an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The ships were designed to carry 90 rounds per gun, although space was available for 110.|$|E
5|$|The ship mounted four 4.7-inch Mk IX guns {{in single}} mounts, {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear.</b> For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Hero had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5inch Vickers Mk III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 {{shortly after the}} war began. By mid-1940, this had increased to 44 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered twin gun turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear.</b> Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders {{to get in}} one another's way, and preventing the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
30|$|There was no {{passage from}} the <b>front</b> <b>to</b> the <b>rear</b> of the support. Because the rear link bar was fixed {{in the middle of}} the support base, {{operators}} could not go through two supports from the <b>front</b> <b>to</b> the <b>rear</b> of the support. The only way was to go <b>to</b> the <b>rear</b> of the support via face ends, which resulted in difficulties in terms of safety and maintenance.|$|R

5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear,</b> resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E
25|$|The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V·Spec and GT-R V·Spec N1 {{models were}} {{released}} in January 1999. The R34 GT-R was also shorter (from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear),</b> {{and the front}} overhang reduced. The valve covers were painted glossy red (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020), as opposed to black in previous models.|$|E

25|$|The lead {{designer}} at Mazda was Matasaburo Maeda, {{whose son}} Ikuo {{would go on}} to design the Mazda2 and Mazda RX-8. The transition of the Savanna to a sports car appearance reflected products from other Japanese manufacturers. The advantage the RX-7 had was its minimal size and weight, and the compact rotary engine installed behind the front axle, which helped balance the <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear</b> weight distribution, and provide a low center of gravity.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, for the 1954 model year, {{the model}} {{underwent}} a major square-lined redesign. This entailed extensive retooling {{because of the}} way the step-down frame wrapped around the passenger compartment. The front had a simpler grille that complemented the now-functional hood scoop and a new one-piece curved windshield, while the sides gained period-typical fender chrome accents, and the formerly sloped rear end was squared off. The <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear</b> fender line was styled to make the car look longer and taillamps were also redesigned. The interior was also updated with a new dash and instrument cluster that were surprisingly modern.|$|E
25|$|In the interior, {{the central}} passage extends from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear</b> {{through the open}} courtyard, paved in quarry tiles. On the left side {{at the front of}} the building, are two Immigration and Naturalization Service offices. On the right front are two U.S. Department of Agriculture offices. Behind the offices on the left side of the passage is a fine {{enclosed}} stair with two runs and a landing. The remaining first-floor rooms are storage rooms and a shop with concrete floors, several 8' wide masonry openings with slat fanlights (sol truncos). Storage room windows are solid vertical board shutters without sash and with outside metal grilles. Two rooms flanking the passage in the center fill in an original part of the courtyard in a manner similar to the older construction.|$|E
25|$|In plan view, the twin-mainfloats, {{like those}} of the Short N.2B, were square-fronted with a slight {{increase}} in beam from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear,</b> while the stern tapered to a point like a mitred arch. They had a concave bottom (the edges were protected by metal strips) and a sharp step at approximately 3/4 length; a tailfloat was fitted to the fuselage below the conventional tailplane. Attached {{to the rear of the}} tailfloat was a taxying rudder, with an additional drop-plate which improved steering on water, and which, thanks to the hinged mounting at the forward end, would rise up into its recess in the tailfloat on contact with the ground when beaching. Wingtip floats were deemed unnecessary. A detail drawing, which appeared in Flight Magazine in 1920, showed the empennage and tailfloat assembly, including the hinged rudder drop-plate.|$|E

5000|$|Gwynne {{designed}} Vista Point to entirely {{overlook the}} garden. The house has few side windows. Bingham writes: “The house is planned with an hourglass shape, narrowing to a 'waistline' for the staircase core.

Gwynne chose building materials, many of them man-made, to withstand the sea-front climate.” ...|$|R
25|$|The 75 {{featured}} {{some unusual}} technical features, {{most notably the}} fact that it was almost perfectly balanced from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear.</b> This was achieved by using transaxle schema — mounting the standard five-speed gearbox in the rear connected to the rear differential (rear-wheel drive). The front suspension was a torsion bar and shock absorber combination and the rear an expensive de Dion tube assembled with shock absorbers; these designs were intended to optimize the car's handling; moreover the rear brake discs were fitted at the centre of the rear axle, near the gearbox-differential group. The engine crankshaft was bolted directly to the two-segment driveshaft, which ran the length of the underside from the engine block to the gearbox and rotated at the speed of the engine. The shaft segments were joined with elastomeric 'doughnuts' to prevent vibration and engine/gearbox damage. The 2.0 L Twin Spark and the 3.0 Litre V6 were equipped with limited slip differential.|$|E
25|$|Fred Dixon and Tony Rolt {{considered}} {{the possibility of using}} 4WD in circuit racing, and with Harry Ferguson keen to promote the transmission systems of his Ferguson tractor firm work began on the P99 in 1960. With a 50–50 torque distribution <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear</b> the car, Claude Hill's design was built to have an even weight distribution over both axles, which along with the position of the gearbox necessitated a front-engined design despite Cooper's and Lotus's overwhelming recent success with mid-engined cars. Just as the project was nearing completion it was dealt something of a body blow by the governing body's decision {{to reduce the size of}} F1 engines by 40% for , making the extra weight of the 4WD transmission a much bigger penalty. Nevertheless the team persevered and fitted a standard 1.5-litre Climax 4-cylinder engine, mounted at a slant to make room for the front driveshaft. In addition the driving position was moved slightly off-centre to accommodate the gearbox and rear driveshaft to the driver's left hand side.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 Carpenter {{provided}} a diagnosis. Due to his conclusion that Hesperosaurus were rather basal, in it many comparisons {{were made with}} the basalmost known stegosaurian Huayangosaurus, that lost their relevance once {{it became clear that}} the phylogenetic position was in fact quite derived. In 2008 Maidment indicated three autapomorphies: the possession of eleven back vertebrae; the fourth sacral not being fused to the sacrum; back plates that are longer (from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> <b>rear)</b> than tall. Maidment also provided some traits in which Hesperosaurus was more basal than Stegosaurus armatus. In the atlas, even in adult specimens the neural arches are not fused to the intercentrum. The postzygapophyses, the rear joint processes, of the rear neck vertebrae do not prominently protrude upwards. In the back vertebrae, the neural arches, above the level of the neural canal, are not especially lengthened to above. At the hip region ossified tendons are present. The ribs are expanded at their lower ends. The neural spines of the tail vertebrae are not bifurcated. The lower end of the pubic bone is expanded (spoon-shaped in side view). To Carpenter this differential diagnosis was problematic because he considered Stegosaurus armatus, the type species of Stegosaurus, a nomen dubium and rejected Maidment's lumping of all North-American Stegosaurus material into a single species, the great variability of which making it difficult to establish any differences with Hesperosaurus. He considered Stegosaurus stenops, the name historically given to several well-preserved specimens, a separate species and {{provided a}} new differential diagnosis of Hesperosaurus compared to S. stenops. The antorbital fenestra is large instead of very small. The maxilla is short and deep, half as tall as long, instead of having a height a third of the length. The basisphenoid of the lower braincase is short instead of long. Thirteen neck vertebrae are present instead of ten. Thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae are present instead of seventeen. The middle dorsals have a basal form in possessing a low neural arch rather than a high one. The cervical ribs have expanded lower ends. In the front tail vertebrae, the tops of the neural spines are rounded instead of bifurcated. The front edge of the shoulderblade is indented instead of running parallel to the rear edge. The front blade of the ilium diverges strongly sideways instead of weakly. The rear blade of the ilium has a knob-shaped expansion at the rear end. The front end of the prepubic process has an upward expansion. The plates of the hip and tail base are oval and low instead of high and triangular.|$|E

50|$|Several {{distinguishing}} traits {{were established}} in the initial description. The thighbone possesses a distinctive process at the inner side of the lower end. The shinbone has on the upper front side a plate-like cnemial crest, protruding far <b>to</b> the <b>front.</b> The condyles of the astragalus and calcaneum are wide, measured from the <b>front</b> <b>to</b> the <b>rear,</b> and are separated by a deep and narrow groove. The metatarsus has fused with the lower ankle bones into a very elongated and narrow tarsometatarsus, being 25% longer than the thighbone and twenty-five times longer than wide. Of this tarsometatarsus {{the thickness of the}} middle section of the shaft, measured from the <b>front</b> <b>to</b> the <b>rear</b> in a vertical position, is larger than its transverse width. The fourth metatarsal at its underside, if the bone is held in a horizontal position, has a flange along most of the shaft length, being almost as wide as the remainder of the shaft.|$|R
