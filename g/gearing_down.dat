Kennedy Road went to the early lead, while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post. On the backstretch, Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead.

50|$|In 1929 Junkers {{developed}} their successful Junkers L5 6-cylinder inline 4-stroke aircraft engine into the L8 by increasing its rotational speed and <b>gearing</b> <b>down</b> the output shaft. Just as the L55 V-12 {{was made by}} combining two L5s, the L88 combined two L8s into a 60° V-12. This had the same bore, stroke, camshaft operated twin pairs of valves per cylinder, watercooling etc. as the L5, like the L55 driving a common crankshaft in a revised crankcase. An exhaust driven supercharger was added after a year to maintain power at high altitude and this version was named the L88a.|$|E

30|$|Broad {{configurability}} of the Twhirleds clients allows flexible deployment. Variable {{transmission gain}} can scale control:display ratio, <b>gearing</b> <b>down</b> rotation to allow fine control and allowing fast twirling {{to be shared}} as more leisurely turning, or even overdriven to exaggerate such torque. Network transmission may be one-shot (pulsed) or continuous, including thresholded filtering for choked bandwidth, azimuthal (rotation) and/or circumferential (revolution) events, invertible polarity, and wrapped (folding over at 360 °) or unwrapped yaw. Device vertical orientation may be upright or inverted (as was seen in Fig. 2), “trim tabs” are used for calibration, and a modal timer can disable control while spinning {{on the face of}} a tablet, preventing inadvertent change of settings.|$|E

50|$|A {{free-fall}} or gravity drop {{system uses}} gravity to deploy the landing <b>gear</b> into the <b>down</b> and locked position. To accomplish this the pilot activates a switch or mechanical handle in the cockpit, which releases the up-lock. Gravity then pulls the landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> and deploys it. Once in position {{the landing gear}} is mechanically locked and safe to use for landing.|$|R

40|$|Discussed {{here are}} {{computations}} of drag or negative traction of <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> supporting propellers in the downward vertical glide of a helicopter. By means of Frounde's Theory, the maximum {{value of the}} drag of a windmill is calculated. For wooden propellers, the author finds {{that the difference between}} the drag and the weight is proportional to the number of blades and is larger for propellers of small diameter; thus it is 25 kg. for a six blade propeller with a diameter of 2 m. 50. The author notes that if we are to adopt large propellers, we must have recourse to a different method of construction, resulting in large dimension propellers much lighter than those made of wood. In discussing insufficient drag, the author notes that the question of the drag of <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> supporting propellers can only be decided by experiment...|$|R
