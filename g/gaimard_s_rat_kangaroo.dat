40|$|The <b>rat</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (long-nosed potoroo, Potorous tridactylus) is a {{marsupial}} {{native to}} Australia. Cultured <b>rat</b> <b>kangaroo</b> kidney epithelial cells (PtK) {{are commonly used}} to study cell biological processes. These mammalian cells are large, adherent, and flat, and contain large and few chromosomes-and are thus ideal for imaging intra-cellular dynamics {{such as those of}} mitosis. Despite this, neither the <b>rat</b> <b>kangaroo</b> genome nor transcriptome have been sequenced, creating a challenge for probing the molecular basis of these cellular dynamics. Here, we present the sequencing, assembly and annotation of the draft <b>rat</b> <b>kangaroo</b> de novo transcriptome. We sequenced 679 million reads that mapped to 347, 323 Trinity transcripts and 20, 079 Unigenes. We present statistics emerging from transcriptome-wide analyses, and analyses suggesting that the transcriptome covers full-length sequences of most genes, many with multiple isoforms. We also validate our findings with a proof-of-concept gene knockdown experiment. We expect that this high quality transcriptome will make <b>rat</b> <b>kangaroo</b> cells a more tractable system for linking molecular-scale function and cellular-scale dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of vegetation, {{and how this}} structure varies across a landscape, is crucial to understanding the distribution of wildlife species. Between 2002 and 2004, we sampled small mammal communities and measured vegetation structure at 185 locations {{across a range of}} disturbance regimes in a shortgrass prairie ecosystem in southeastern Colorado, USA. At each sampling location, the local disturbance regime was some combination of varying intensity of livestock grazing, military training activity, and fire. Vegetation structural characteristics measured included percent bare ground, basal cover, litter, shrub density, and mean grass and shrub height. Rodent communities were described by richness, diversity, total and per capita biomass, and species abundances.

25|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> live {{in complex}} burrow systems. The burrows have {{separate}} chambers for specific purposes like sleeping, living and food storage. The spacing of the burrows {{depends on the}} number of <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> and the abundance of food. <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> also live in colonies that range from six to several hundred dens. The burrow of a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> is important in providing protection from the harsh desert environment.

When the outside temperature is too hot, a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> stays in its cool, humid burrow and leaves it only at night. To reduce loss of moisture through respiration when sleeping, a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> buries its nose in its fur to accumulate a small pocket of moist air.

40|$|How does range {{expansion}} affect {{genetic diversity}} in species with different ecologies, and do {{different types of}} genetic markers lead to different conclusions? We addressed these questions by assessing the genetic consequences of postglacial range expansion using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing in two congeneric and codistributed rodents with different ecological characteristics: the desert <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> (Dipodomys deserti), a sand specialist, and the Merriam 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> (Dipodomys merriami), a substrate generalist. For each species, we compared genetic variation between populations that retained stable distributions throughout glacial periods and those inferred to have expanded since the last glacial maximum. Our results suggest that expanded populations of both species experienced a loss of private mtDNA haplotypes and differentiation among populations, {{as well as a}} loss of nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) private alleles and polymorphic loci. However, only D. deserti experienced a loss of nucleotide diversity (both mtDNA and nuclear) and nuclear heterozygosity. For all indices of diversity and differentiation that showed reduced values in the expanded areas, D. deserti populations experienced a greater degree of loss than did D. merriami populations. Additionally, patterns of loss in genetic diversity in expanded populations were substantially less extreme (by two orders of magnitude in some cases) for nuclear SNPs in both species compared to that observed for mitochondrial data. Our results demonstrate that ecological characteristics {{may play a role in}} determining genetic variation associated with range expansions, yet mtDNA diversity loss is not necessarily accompanied by a matched magnitude of loss in nuclear diversity...|$|R
25|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> have a {{promiscuous}} mating system. Their {{reproductive output}} is highest in summer following high rainfalls. During droughts and food shortages, {{only a few}} females will breed. It appears that <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> can assess their local conditions and adjust their reproductive efforts accordingly. Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> breed between February and May and produce two or three litters per year. Before mating, {{the male and female}} will perform nasal-anal circling until the female stops and allows the male to mount her. A Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> female will allow multiple males to mount her in a short time, perhaps to ensure greater chances of producing offspring. Mating in banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> involve more chasing and foot drumming in the male before the females allows him to mate. Banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> mate on mounds and the more successful males chase away rival males. The gestation period of <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> lasts 22–27 days.|$|R

25|$|When on {{foraging}} trips, <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> hoard {{the seeds}} that they find. It {{is important for}} a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> to encounter more food items than are consumed, at least {{at one point in}} the year, as well as defend or rediscover food caches and remain within the same areas long enough to utilize food resources. Different species of <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> may have different seed caching strategies to coexist with each other, as is the case for the banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> and Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> which have overlapping ranges. Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> scatterhoard small caches of seeds in numerous small, shallow holes they dig. This is initially done close to the food source, maximizing harvest rates and reducing travel costs, but later redistributed more widely, minimizing theft by other rodents. Banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> larderhoard a sizable cache of seeds within the large mounds they occupy. This could decrease their time and energy expenses; they also spend less time on the surface digging holes, reducing risk of predation.
