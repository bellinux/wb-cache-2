25|$|The Catholic Counter-Reformation group, {{founded by}} theologian , takes the {{position}} that the released text is the complete Third Secret, but refers to Pope John Paul I rather than John Paul II, pointing out that the latter, after all, did not die when he was attacked, while the bishop in the Third Secret did. John Paul <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> Lúcia Santos while he was Patriarch of Venice, and was deeply moved by the experience. In a letter to a colleague after his election, he vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia which Lúcia said Mary had asked for.|$|E
500|$|Fodor (who {{is now a}} close friend) is {{a gentle}} man inside a burly body, and prone to an even burlier style of arguing. He is shy and voluble {{at the same time}} ... a {{formidable}} polemicist burdened with a sensitive soul.... Disagreeing with Jerry on a philosophical issue, especially one dear to his heart can be a chastening experience.... His quickness of mind, inventiveness, and sharp wit are not to be tangled with before your first cup of coffee in the morning. Adding Jerry Fodor to the faculty at Rutgers [...] instantly put it on the map, Fodor being by common consent the leading philosopher of mind in the world today. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> him in England in the seventies and ... found him to be the genuine article, intellectually speaking (though we do not always see eye to eye).|$|E
500|$|During {{this time}} he met [...] "a fine, hard riding young Kansan, who <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> on an Indian raid and whose nerve I greatly admired." [...] The young Kansan, who had been swindled by an unscrupulous {{superintendent}} of mines, had a plan to rustle cattle and horses from the superintendent and sell them to Curly Bill (William Brocius), an outlaw {{with whom he had}} indirectly been in contact. Both men were broke at the time, and the job sounded easy. But Burnham had always rejected the life of a thief and even as a wanted man, he did not view himself as a criminal. Burnham began to see that even though he joined the feud to help his friends, {{he had been in the}} wrong, that [...] "avenging only led to more vengeance and to even greater injustice than that suffered through the often unjustly administered laws of the land." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though he read many of Edgar Rice Burroughs' books, {{he denied}} that the Barsoom novels {{influenced}} his giant spiders: [...] "I did read many of Edgar Rice Burroughs' earlier works, but I developed a dislike for his Tarzan even greater than my distaste for spiders. Spiders <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> long before Burroughs began to write, and I do not think he is in any way responsible for Shelob. At any rate I retain no memory of the Siths or the Apts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1873, Gompers {{moved to}} the cigarmaker David Hirsch & Company, a [...] "high-class shop where only the most skilled workmen were employed". Gompers later called this change of {{employers}} [...] "one {{of the most important}} changes in my life", for at Hirsch's—a union shop operated by an émigré German socialist—Gompers came into contact with an array of German-speaking cigarmakers—"men of keener mentality and wider thought than any <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>met</b> before," [...] he recalled. Gompers learned German and absorbed many of the ideas of his shopmates, developing a particular admiration for the ideas of the former secretary of the International Workingmen's Association, Karl Laurrell. Laurrell took Gompers under his wing, challenging his more simplistic ideas and urging Gompers to put his faith in the organized economic movement of trade unionism rather than the socialist political movement.|$|E
