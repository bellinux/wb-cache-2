40|$|Many {{xenobiotics}} {{have been}} associated with endocrine effects {{in a wide range of}} biological systems. These associations are usually between small nonsteroid molecules and steroid receptor signaling systems. In this report, triclocarban (TCC; 3, 4, 4 ′-trichlorocarbanilide), a common ingredient in personal care products that is used as an antimicrobial agent was evaluated and found to represent a new category of <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substance.</b> A cell-based androgen receptor-mediated bioassay was used to demonstrate that TCC and other urea compounds with a similar structure, which have little or no endocrine activity when tested alone, act to enhance testosterone (T) -induced androgen receptor-mediated transcriptional activity in vitro. This amplification effect of TCC was also apparent in vivo when 0. 25 % TCC was added to the diet of castrated male rats that were supported by exogenous testosterone treatment for 10 d. All male sex accessory organs increased significantly in size after the T+TCC treatment, compared with T or TCC treatments alone. The data presented here suggest that the bioactivity of endogenous hormones may be amplified by exposure to commercial personal care products containing sufficient levels of TCC...|$|E
40|$|Although {{multiple}} reproductive {{tests have}} been developed in small-bodied fish {{to determine the effects}} of endocrine-disrupting substances, few direct comparisons have been made among the available tests. Side-by-side reproductive tests with mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) and fathead minnow (FHM; Pimephales promelas) were conducted with 0, 3, 10, and 30 % effluent from a bleached kraft pulp mill in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. Egg production was significantly increased in mummichog exposed to 3 % combined mill effluent, but no difference was observed in FHM. No differences were found in whole-body testosterone or estradiol levels in mummichog, and whole-body 11 -ketotestosterone levels in males were increased in 3 % exposed fish compared to those in 10 % effluent. Male FHM exposed to 30 % effluent had increased whole-body testosterone levels, and female FHM in 30 % effluent had decreased testosterone. No differences in estradiol or 11 -ketotestosterone were observed in FHM. Relatively limited response occurred in other endpoints. A comparison of the results of the present study to other published studies suggests that current reproductive bioassays are only sensitive for detecting magnitudes of change of greater than 50 % and that differences exist in the sensitivities of fish. Future research should address methods of reducing variability within test populations and focus on understanding the comparative responses among species commonly used for <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substance</b> testing...|$|E
40|$|A SETAC Pellston Workshop® “Environmental Hazard and Risk Assessment Approaches for Endocrine-Active Substances (EHRA) ” {{was held}} in February 2016 in Pensacola, Florida, USA. The primary {{objective}} of the workshop was to provide advice, based on current scientific understanding, to regulators and policy makers; the aim being to make considered, informed decisions on whether to select an ecotoxicological hazard- or a risk-based approach for regulating a given <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substance</b> (EDS) under review. The workshop additionally considered recent developments {{in the identification of}} EDS. Case studies were undertaken on 6 endocrine-active substances (EAS—not necessarily proven EDS, but substances known to interact directly with the endocrine system) that are representative of a range of perturbations of the endocrine system and considered to be data rich in relevant information at multiple biological levels of organization for 1 or more ecologically relevant taxa. The substances selected were 17 α-ethinylestradiol, perchlorate, propiconazole, 17 β-trenbolone, tributyltin, and vinclozolin. The 6 case studies were not comprehensive safety evaluations but provided foundations for clarifying key issues and procedures that should be considered when assessing the ecotoxicological hazards and risks of EAS and EDS. The workshop also highlighted areas of scientific uncertainty, and made specific recommendations for research and methods-development to resolve some of the identified issues. The present paper provides broad guidance for scientists in regulatory authorities, industry, and academia on issues likely to arise during the ecotoxicological hazard and risk assessment of EAS and EDS. The primary conclusion of this paper, and of the SETAC Pellston Workshop on which it is based, is that if data on environmental exposure, effects on sensitive species and life-stages, delayed effects, and effects at low concentrations are robust, initiating environmental risk assessment of EDS is scientifically sound and sufficiently reliable and protective of the environment. In the absence of such data, assessment on the basis of hazard is scientifically justified until such time as relevant new information is available...|$|E

However, {{little is known}} about the capability of triorganotin compounds, such as tributyltin and triphenyltin, to cause disorders in the sexual development and reproductive functions of mammals, including humans and rodents. Moreover, these compounds can act as potential competitive inhibitors of aromatase enzyme and other steroidogenic enzymes, affecting the reproductive capacity of male and female mammals. In this review, we discuss the cellular, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms by which triorganotin compounds induce adverse effects in the mammalian reproductive function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Like {{hardly any}} other issue in ecotoxicology, {{endocrine}} disruption {{has given rise}} to public concern. Reproductive, behavioral, and immunological effects in wildlife were publicly not only understood as possible threats to wildlife populations, but also as early warning signals that human health could be at risk. Above all, the public has been concerned about negative outcomes in reproductive health, and effects like feminization in fish were regarded as evidence for the biological plausibility of the hypothesis that environmental levels of hormonally active chemicals are high enough to affect human reproductive health. Public concern has been mirrored by several parliamentary and governmental decisions emphasizing the need for extensive research and rapid measures to reduce the risk associated with <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substances.</b> Endocrine disruption in wildlife is clearly a priority issue. At least in densely populated areas like Europe, symptoms of endocrine disruption in wildlife cannot only be detected in areas with abnormally high levels of pollution, but have also occurred in main river systems, estuaries, and even in the open sea. Imposex in mollusks and feminization in fish that were clearly related to disturbances in the hormonal system of these organisms by exogenous substance...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{responses}} of fathead minnows (FHM) exposed to known <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substances</b> (EDS) in our labs. As well, we wanted to examine the applicability and sensitivity of the full lifecycle FHM test for use on-site, exposing fish to a complex environmentally relevant Canadian effluent. Fathead minnows exposed from the egg stage to ethinylestradiol (EE 2, 0 – 32 ng/L) or methyltestosterone (MT, 0 – 3200 ng/L) had decreased growth (length, weight) at high concentrations. Development of secondary sex characteristics was a sensitive indicator of exposure to androgen and estrogen. Fish exposed to MT showed premature male sex characteristics such as nuptial tubercles by 30 days post-hatch (dph). These changes were more dramatic in older fish (at 60 and 90 dph), which showed premature male sex characteristics at very low MT concentrations (100 ng/L). Fish exposed to 3. 2 ng/L EE 2 had premature development of ovipositors at 60 dph. As well, exposure to very high MT concentrations (1000 and 3200 ng/L) caused development of ovipositors after 60 days (but not at 20 and 30 dph), presumably due to aromatizatio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} gonad {{development}} in two freshwater gastropod prosobranch snail species (Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Valvata piscinalis). These biological {{models have been}} shown to be sensitive to various reprotoxic substances and are known to be relevant organisms for studying <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substances.</b> Therefore we took up a histological study of their anatomy and the gametogenesis of the two species in order to key into biological elements potentially useful for reprotoxic stress studies. Knowing that P. antipodarum is parthenogenetic, we studied all their gonadogenetic stages, taking caution to clearly describe the different oocyte developmental stages leading to the formation of the copulatory bursa, characterizing neighboring glands. As for V. piscinalis, a hermaphrodite species, all the spermatogenesis development stages were described (spermatocytogenesis and spermiogenesis) as well as specification of nourishing cells and support cells, the objective being to define the species’ reproduction mechanism. This studied was carried out by observing the development of young P. antipodarum and V. picinalis, exposing them to the same experimental conditions for 6 months. Weekly samples were taken for biometric imaging and conventional histology photonics in order to determine the age and to validate the appearance of early gonadogenesis. A fundamental, detailed study on tissue identification was conducted to accomplish this task...|$|R
40|$|The {{histories}} of selected public and environmental hazards, {{from the first}} scientifically based early warnings about potential harm to the subsequent precautionary and preventive measures, have been reviewed by the European Environment Agency. This article relates the “late lessons ” from these early warnings to the current debates on {{the application of the}} precautionary principle to the hazards posed by <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substances</b> (EDSs). Here, I summarize some of the definitional and interpretative issues that arise. These issues include the contingent nature of knowledge; the definitions of precaution, prevention, risk, uncertainty, and ignorance; the use of differential levels of proof; and the nature and main direction of the methodological and cultural biases within the environmental health sciences. It is argued that scientific methods need to reflect better the realities of multicausality, mixtures, timing of dose, and system dynamics, which characterize the exposures and impacts of EDSs. This improved science could provide a more robust basis for the wider and wise use of the precautionary principle in the assessment and management of the threats posed by EDSs. The evaluation of such scientific evidence requires assessments that also account for multicausal reality. Two of the often used, and sometimes misused, Bradford Hill “criteria, ” consistency and temporality, are critically reviewed in light of multicausality, thereby illustrating the need to review all of the criteria in light of 40 years of progress in science and policymaking. Key words: causality, earl...|$|R
40|$|High prevalences of gonadal {{intersex}} {{have been}} observed in wild fish populations in areas affected by domestic and industrial effluents. For this study, fish were collected in 1998 from the Cootes Paradise region of Hamilton Harbour in western Lake Ontario, Canada, to determine whether gonadal abnormalities, including intersex, were present in young of the year (YOY) fish. No gonadal abnormalities were observed in goldfish (Carassius auratus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), brown bullhead (Ictalurus ameiurus), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). However, intersex gonads were observed in 8 of 16 male white perch (Morone americana) examined in this survey. Subsequently, in 1999 and 2000 white perch estimated to be YOY to approximately 2 years of age were collected from Cootes Paradise and from two other sites in the lower Great Lakes region. Gonadal intersex was observed in male white perch collected from the Bay of Quinte (22 - 44 %) and Lake St. Clair (45 %), although the prevalence {{and the extent of}} the intersex condition were lower relative to the 83 % prevalence in white perch collected in Cootes Paradise. Intersex was not observed in hatchery-reared white perch or in white perch collected from an uncontaminated reference site (i. e., Deal Lake) in the United States. An analysis of plasma collected in the spring of 2002 from male adult white perch in Cootes Paradise revealed high concentrations of vitellogenin, ranging from 49 to 1, 711 microg/mL. These observations indicate that male white perch are exposed to estrogenic <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substances</b> that may be responsible for the induction of gonadal intersex...|$|R
40|$|In similar {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} 1996 and 2009, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were stocked into two experimental systems: a demonstration lake where oil sands fine tailings were capped with natural {{water and a}} lake in a watershed containing bitumen-bearing sodic clays. In both experiments, yellow perch were captured in May from a nearby reservoir and released into the experimental ponds. Perch were recaptured in the experimental systems, the source lake, and two reference lakes in late September and lethally sampled to examine reproductive parameters. In the 1996 experiment, gonad size and steroid hormones were not affected in either pond environment. In the 2009 experiment, male perch in the water-capped tailings pond showed {{a significant reduction in}} the testicular development and reductions in circulating testosterone and 11 -ketotestosterone, while no reductions were seen in the second experimental pond. No changes were observed in ovarian size or circulating steroid levels in female perch. In the pond containing tailings, the release of water from underlying tailings caused approximately a twofold increase in salinity, alkalinity, and naphthenic acids, and a pH increase from 8. 4 to 9. 4 over the 13 -year period of the study. In the pond influenced by unextracted oil sands materials, total dissolved solids, major ions, and pH did not change substantially. However, naphthenic acids in this system dropped more than twofold post-watershed reclamation. Because the selective reproductive effect observed in male perch in the experimental end-pit lake were accompanied by increases in naphthenic acids, alkalinity, and pH, a specific cause cannot be determined. The present study adds to the evidence, suggesting the presence of <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substances</b> in oil sands...|$|R
40|$|The fluorescence-based multi-analyte chip {{platform}} {{for the analysis of}} estrogenic and anti-estrogenic substances is a new in vitro tool for the high throughput screening of environmental samples. In contrast to existing tools, the chip investigates the complex action of xenoestrogens in a human cell model by characterizing protein expression. It allows for the quantification of 10 proteins secreted by MCF- 7 cells, representing various biological and pathological endpoints of endocrine action and distinguishing between estrogen- and anti-estrogen-dependent secretion of proteins. Distinct protein secretion patterns of the cancer cell line after exposure to known estrogen receptor agonists ß-estradiol, bisphenol A, genistein, and nonylphenol as well as antagonists fulvestrant and tamoxifen demonstrate the potential of the chip. Stimulation of cells with Interleukin- 1 ß shifts concentrations of low abundant biomarkers towards the working range of the chip. In the non-stimulated cell culture, Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) show differences upon treatment with antagonists and agonists of the estrogen receptor. In stimulated MCF- 7 cells challenged with receptor agonists secretion of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (MCP- 1), Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), Rantes, and Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) significantly decreases. In parallel, the proliferating effect of <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substances</b> in MCF- 7 cells is assessed in a proliferation assay based on resazurin. Using ethanol as a solvent for test substances increases the background of proliferation and secretion experiments, while using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) does not show any adverse effects. The role of the selected biomarkers in different physiological processes such as cell development, reproduction, cancer, and metabolic syndrome makes the chip an excellent tool for either indicating endocrine-disrupting effects in food and environmental samples, or for screening the effect of xenoestrogens on a cellular and molecular level...|$|R
40|$|Lake Molnbyggen was {{previously}} found to harbour {{a large number}} of sexually immature female perch (Perca fluviatilis) suffering from endocrine disruption. In an attempt to pin-point the source of the <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>substance(s)</b> (EDSs), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from Vadbacken, a stream contaminated by leachate from a public refuse dump and which empties into Lake Molnbyggen, were investigated. In addition, female perch from Lakes Yxen and Kvarntjarn, located up-stream and down-stream of Lake Molnbyggen, were investigated. Only 16. 7 % of the adult female brook trout in Vadbacken were sexually mature, associated with decreased gonadosomatic index, lower brain aromatase activity, and lower circulating levels of testosterone and 17 beta-oestradiol, in comparison to female brook trout from the reference stream Bjorntjarnsbacken. Male brook trout showed decreased gonadosomatic index, in addition to bile duct hyperplasia in the liver, which was also found in female brook trout livers from Vadbacken. In Lake Molnbyggen, 57. 6 % of the female perch were found to be sexually immature with high frequencies of skin lesions, such as sores and fin erosion, significantly decreased gonadosomatic index, lower aromatase activity, and lower levels of testosterone and 17 beta-oestradiol. No signs of reproductive disorders or endocrine disruption were seen in female perch from Lakes Yxen and Kvarntjarn compared to female perch from the reference lake, Lake Djursjon. Since brook trout of both sexes from Vadbacken displayed the same kind of serious adverse impairment of gonad development and endocrine disruption as perch from Lake Molnbyggen, very strong evidence are provided that the refuse dump is the source for the responsible EDS(s), since both Vadbacken and Lake Molnbyggen are known to be contaminated by leachate from that dump. The low levels of PAHs and PCBs in the surface sediments of Lake Molnbyggen suggest that these pollutants are not the responsible EDS(s) ...|$|R

40|$|The European Commission has {{presented}} a draft on how <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> chemical <b>substances</b> (“endocrine disruptors”, ED) {{contained in the}} active ingredients of pesticides and biocides can be identified using harmonised scientific criteria. The definition of these criteria is a binding foundation for the regulation of ED in order to warrant {{a high level of}} consumers protection. The draft considers suggestions on hazard identification of ED which scientists developed in April in the course of an international conference organised by BfR and held in Berlin. According to these suggestions, a comprehensive scientific analysis with regard to the definition of the WHO must be carried out when identifying such substances, and the insights must be weighted based on their conclusiveness, (weight-of evidence approach). The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has recommended for many years that for ED the principle of “one substance – one assessment” must apply. The institute is of the opinion that the assessment criteria which the European Commission has recommended for pesticides and biocides should be applicable to all naturally occurring and synthetically produced substances that {{have a negative effect on}} the body’s hormone system. BfR recommends that harmonised technical guidelines are developed in order to enable transparent and safe identification of chemical substances. In order to ensure a high level of protection, a given ED should be identified on the basis of the weight-of evidence approach which, among other things, takes into account the quality, reliability, reproducibility and conclusiveness of the scientific evidence. BfR welcomes that, in addition to the mentioned criteria, the communication of the European Commission also lists a series of measures and their funding in order to support research and international cooperation, as well as the development of testing methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of various substances on all levels of organisms are under investigation. Among these <b>substances,</b> <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> compounds (EDCs) present a threat, although the environmental significance of these compounds remains largely unknown. To {{shed some light on}} this field, we assessed the effects of 17 β-oestradiol on the growth, reproduction and formation of free radicals in Eisenia fetida. Although the observed effects on growth and survival were relatively weak, a strong impact on reproduction was observed (50. 70 % inhibition in 100 μg/kg of E 2). We further demonstrated that the exposure of the earthworm Eisenia fetida to a contaminant of emerging concern, 17 β-oestradiol (E 2), significantly affected the molecules involved in antioxidant defence. Exposure to E 2 results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the stimulation of antioxidant systems (metallothionein and reduced oxidized glutathione ratio) but not phytochelatins at both the mRNA and translated protein levels. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) -imaging revealed the subcuticular bioaccumulation of oestradiol- 3, 4 -quinone, altering the levels of local antioxidants in a time-dependent manner.
