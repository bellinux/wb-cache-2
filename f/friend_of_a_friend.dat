They concoct a fake persona, a young woman named Keiko, to seduce the Japanese man who knows the watermark code. Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this.|$|E

2500|$|In Semantic Web applications, and in {{relatively}} popular applications of RDF like RSS and FOAF (<b>Friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friend),</b> resources {{tend to be}} represented by URIs that intentionally denote, {{and can be used}} to access, actual data on the World Wide Web.

For example, a URI that begins with [...] "http:" [...] and is used as the subject of an RDF statement does not necessarily have to represent a resource that is accessible via HTTP, nor does it need to represent a tangible, network-accessible resource — such a URI could represent absolutely anything. However, there is broad agreement that a bare URI (without a # symbol) which returns a 300-level coded response when used in an HTTP GET request should be treated as denoting the internet resource that it succeeds in accessing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} term {{by which}} these narratives were known, [...] "urban belief tales," [...] highlights {{what was then}} {{thought to be a}} key property: they were held, by their tellers, to be true accounts, and the device of the FOAF (acronym for <b>Friend</b> <b>Of</b> <b>A</b> <b>Friend</b> invented by English writer and folklorist Rodney Dale) was a spurious but significant effort at authentication. The coinage leads in turn to the terms [...] "FOAFlore" [...] and [...] "FOAFtale". While at least one classic legend, the [...] "Death Car", has been shown to have some basis in fact, folklorists as such are interested in debunking these narratives only to the degree that establishing non-factuality warrants the assumption that there must be some other reason why the tales are told and believed.

40|$|Several studies {{demonstrate}} {{effectiveness and}} benefits of using user's social network information to enrich user's profile. In this context, one of our contributions [1] proposes an algorithm enabling to compute user's interests using information from egocentric network extracted communities. Therefore, mining information from a small or a sparse network remains challenging because {{there is not enough}} information to enrich a relevant user's profile. So, one of the main lock is to cope with the lack of information that is considered as an important issue to extract a relevant community and could lead to misinterpretations in the user's profile modeling process. We aim to improve the performance of [1], regarding the lack of information problem, in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small and/or a sparse network. We propose to add more information (i. e. relations) into user's network before extracting the data and enriching his profile. To achieve this enrichment, we suggest using snowballsampling technique to identify and add user's distance- 2 neighbors (<b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend)</b> into the user's egocentric network. Our experimentation conducted in DBLP demonstrates the interest of node integration into small and sparse network.
