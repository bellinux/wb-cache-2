5|$|Maintenance of the Phantoms was {{undertaken}} by No.482 Squadron and No.3 Aircraft Depot, {{both of which}} were located at Amberley. In addition to routine servicing, these units modified the Phantoms' AN/APQ-120 radars during early 1971. In response to problems detected during maintenance, RAAF technical personnel checked all the aircraft for defects to their <b>emergency</b> <b>flap</b> system in September 1971 and used X-ray testing to detect any cracks in their stabilators during early 1972.|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{literature on the}} potential for a femoral blowout in case of fungating inguinal lymph nodes in a case of penile carcinoma. However, reported cases of actual femoral blowout are sparse in literature. We encountered one such case of femoral blowout because of fungating inguinal lymph nodes in a case of Ca. Penis. Emergency palliative resection of the fungating nodes, ligation of the femoral vein, and <b>emergency</b> <b>flap</b> cover {{in the form of a}} perforator-based anterolateral thigh flap was performed. We believe that patients with a potential of femoral blowout should undergo resection and suitable coverage to prevent fatal hemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|Although reimplantations {{are very}} well defined operations, the {{indications}} for <b>emergency</b> free <b>flaps</b> and the management of nerve injuries are much less so. Using several examples, the authors define {{the conditions in which}} a free flap is justified and the most useful procedures for nerve repair. An <b>emergency</b> free <b>flap</b> should constitute the best solution, with a reasonable chance of success, without compromising other possibilities of reconstruction in the event of failure. The authors present the three situations observed in the case of nerve lesions: clean nerve sections, nerve defects, cases with an unclear diagnosis and cases in which the conditions are unsuitable for immediate permanent repair...|$|R

Walter was the {{co-pilot}} for Bill Pegg during the Bristol Brabazon's maiden flight, and then flew it with himself in command, during in which the large aircraft suffered hydraulic failure, and suffered an <b>emergency</b> landing without <b>flaps.</b> The aircraft development programme was later scrapped in 1953.|$|R
40|$|Echocardiography {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the diagnosis and follow-up of aortic diseases. Evaluation of the aorta is a routine part of the standard echocardiographic examination. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) permits adequate assessment of several aortic segments, particularly the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) overcomes the limitations of TTE in thoracic aorta assessment. TTE and TOE should be used in a complementary manner. Echocardiography is useful for assessing aortic size, biophysical properties, and atherosclerotic involvement of the thoracic aorta. Although TOE is the technique of choice in the diagnosis of aortic dissection, TTE may be used as the initial modality in the <b>emergency</b> setting. Intimal <b>flap</b> in proximal ascending aorta, pericardial effusion/tamponade, and left ventricular function can be easily visualized by TTE. However, a negative TTE does not rule out aortic dissection and other imaging techniques must be considered. TOE should define entry tear location, mechanisms and severity of aortic regurgitation, and true lumen compression. In addition, echocardiography is essential in selecting and monitoring surgical and endovascular treatment and in detecting possible complications. Although other imaging techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance have a greater field of view and may yield complementary information, echocardiography is portable, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective in the diagnosis and follow-up of most aortic diseases...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Free vascularized tissue {{transfer}} to preserve upper extremity amputation level is an uncommon procedure. The authors investigate {{the role of}} free tissue transfer in preserving both morphology and function of the amputated upper extremity, {{with the goal of}} facilitating prosthetic rehabilitation. METHODS: Thirteen patients who underwent microsurgical free tissue {{transfer to}} preserve upper extremity amputation level were reviewed retrospectively. These cases were selected from four centers: Duke University Medical Center (Durham, N. C.) University Hospital of Modena (Modena, Italy), Careggi University Hospital (Florence, Italy), and the University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, Germany). Parameters that were evaluated included age, sex, cause of the defect, reconstructive procedure, structures to be salvaged, and functional outcome, among others. RESULTS: The cause of amputation was trauma in 92 percent of patients. Mean age was 32 years. In 31 percent of the cases, an <b>emergency</b> free fillet <b>flap</b> was used, and in the remaining 69 percent, a traditional free flap was performed. Structures/function to be preserved included pinch function to the hand, function of the elbow and shoulder joints, and skeletal length greater than 7 cm. Complications occurred in 38 percent of the cases, but the final goal of the procedure was achieved in all cases. A treatment algorithm for the management of the amputated upper extremity is presented. CONCLUSION: Use of free vascularized tissue transfer for preservation of upper extremity amputation level in well-selected cases facilitates prosthetic rehabilitation and improves residual limb functio...|$|R
