50|$|In cocurrent systems, the {{purge gas}} is 50 °F to 100 °F hotter than the soil <b>discharge</b> <b>{{temperature}}.</b> The {{result is that}} the purge gas exit temperature may range from 400 °F to 1,000 °F and cannot go directly to the baghouse. Purge gas first enters an afterburner to decontaminate the fine particles, then goes into a cooling unit prior to introduction into the baghouse. Because of the higher temperature and volume of the purge gas, the baghouse and all other downstream processing equipment must be larger than in a countercurrent system. Cocurrent systems do have several advantages over countercurrent systems: The afterburner is located upstream of the baghouse ensuring that fine particles are decontaminated; and because the heated purge gas is introduced at the same end of the drum as the feed soil, the soil is heated faster, resulting in a longer residence time. Higher temperatures and longer residence time mean that cocurrent systems can be used to treat soils contaminated with heavier petroleum products. Cocurrent systems are effective for light and heavy petroleum products including No. 6 fuel oil, crude oil, motor oil, and lubricating oil.|$|E
5000|$|Increasing {{pressure}} ratio, as Figure 1 above shows, {{increasing the}} pressure ratio increases {{the efficiency of}} the Brayton cycle. This is analogous to the increase of efficiency seen in the Otto cycle when the compression ratio is increased. However, practical limits occur when it comes to increasing the pressure ratio. First of all, increasing the pressure ratio increases the compressor <b>discharge</b> <b>temperature.</b> This can cause the temperature of the gasses leaving the combustor to exceed the metallurgical limits of the turbine. Also, the diameter of the compressor blades becomes progressively smaller in higher pressure stages of the compressor. Because the gap between the blades and the engine casing increases in size {{as a percentage of the}} compressor blade height as the blades get smaller in diameter, a greater percentage of the compressed air can leak back past the blades in higher pressure stages. This causes a drop in compressor efficiency, and is most likely to occur in smaller gas turbines (since blades are inherently smaller to begin with). Finally, as can be seen in Figure 1, the efficiency levels off as pressure ratio increases. Hence, little gain is expected by increasing the pressure ratio further if it is already at a high level.|$|E
40|$|Finite {{difference}} numerical modeling {{has been}} used to study buoyancy-driven heat and fluid transport in submarine volcanic environments and its consequences for the formation of volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposits in ancient and modern submarine seafloor environments. Two different geological settings were chosen to enable comparison of modeling results with field observations and determine the extent and significance of key modeling parameters (rock properties, fault structure, model geometry) on fluid migration, rock alteration and base metal accumulation under a variety of conditions. The first model combines field data with theoretical assumptions to examine heat and fluid flow in the Lau basin, a modern back -arc seafloor setting. An extensive sensitivity analysis of relevant rock and model parameters confirmed several key observations in the Lau basin, such as the location of major fluid discharge zones and measured <b>discharge</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Other results such as fluid velocities and heat flux are comparable with theoretical predictions and general seafloor measurements. New insights were obtained with regard to the controls on recharge-discharge patterns, deep-seated fluid migration and the life span of hydrothermal convection as well as the timing and minimum requirements for massive sulfide ore body formation on the seafloor. The second model researched the evolution of an ancient seafloor hydrothermal system in the Panorama district, Western Australia. The Archean Panorama district provides unprecedented access to a complete section of a hydrothermal system underlying massive sulfide deposits, which allowed {{for the first time the}} construction of a locally accurate model involving realistic stratigraphy, fault geometry and fault distribution. The unique preservation of the Panorama district enables a direct comparison of modeling results with field observations and helps to simulate the main features of the hydrothermal system, such as alteration zonation, <b>temperature</b> distribution and <b>discharge</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Results also allow the establishment of minimum fluid and rock property requirements for the formation of confirmed, and potential, ore bodies and assess the potential of the hydrothermal system to host significant (> 5 Mt) massive sulfide deposit. Results from both models suggest that the most important factors and processes controlling heat and fluid transport in submarine volcanic settings are fault and rock permeability, basement topography, and the nature of the heat source. <b>Discharge</b> <b>temperatures</b> are primarily controlled by rock permeability and range between 150 QC and about 400 QC. Discharge fluid velocities depend mostly on fault permeability variations and range between - 1 x 10 - 8 m/s and 4 x 10 - 6 m/s for individual fault structures, which equates to values of about 3 m/s for a typical chimney orifice. Both, predicted <b>discharge</b> <b>temperatures</b> and fluid <b>discharge</b> velocities, compare well with seafloor observations and theoretical calculations and do not require a thermal cracking front and associated permeability constraints. The control on recharge-discharge patterns depends on the nature of the heat source and model geometry, but is generally determined by fault spacing (Panorama model) and their placement relative to the heat source (Lau basin model), and not by the size of developing convection cells. Significant deep-seated fluid migration is predicted to occur at the sheeted dike - gabbro interface due to inferred permeability differences and basement topography. The life span of ancient and modern seafloor hydrothermal systems producing fluid <b>discharge</b> <b>temperatures</b> greater than 150 QC for individual faults is predicted to range between about 2, 000 years at high permeabilities and greater than 200, 000 years as permeabilities decrease. Heuristic mass calculations based on modeling results indicate that hydrothermal fluids with a 10 ppm base metal content and low deposition efficiency (10 percent) can form significant seafloor massive sulfide deposits(> 0. 5 Mt of 10...|$|R

The {{combined}} chemical composition, O and H isotopes, and {{the basic}} geologic setting of the geothermal system of the Gulf of Suez, Egypt have been investigated to evaluate {{the origin of the}} dissolved constituents and subsurface reservoir temperatures. Hydrochemical characterization of thermal waters discharged from springs and flowing artesian wells in the Gulf of Suez region show that there are two groups. One is Hammam Faroun thermal waters with salinity values exceeding 10, 000 mg/l, <b>discharge</b> <b>temperatures</b> reach to 70 ºC, and Na-Cl hydrochemical facies. The other group is thermal waters discharged at Hammam Mousa, Ain Sukhna, and shallow flowing artesian wells at Ayoun Mousa and Ras Sudr.

Different graphical presentations using major and minor ions indicated that little mixing with sea water is probably a source of dissolved constituents.
