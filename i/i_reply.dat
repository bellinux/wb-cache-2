2500|$|Following Hitler's {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia and Poland, Lindbergh decried suggestions that the United States should send aid to countries under threat, writing [...] "I {{do not believe}} that repealing the arms embargo would assist democracy in Europe" [...] and [...] "If we repeal the arms embargo with the idea of assisting one of the warring sides to overcome the other, then why mislead ourselves by talk of neutrality?" [...] He equated assistance with war profiteering: [...] "To those who argue that we could make a profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, <b>I</b> <b>reply</b> that we in America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war." ...|$|E
2500|$|While in Europe, the Lindberghs came to {{advocate}} isolationist views {{that led to}} their fall from grace {{in the eyes of}} many. In 1938, the U.S. Air Attaché in Berlin invited Charles to inspect the rising power of Nazi Germany's Air Force. Impressed by German technology and their apparent number of aircraft and influenced by the staggering number of deaths from World War I, Charles opposed U.S. entry into the impending European conflict. He suggested any military assistance to Britain might be done for improper financial reasons: [...] "To those who argue that we could make a profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, <b>I</b> <b>reply</b> that we in America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He is very good," [...] <b>I</b> <b>replied.</b> <b>I</b> {{could not}} {{resist the temptation to}} add, [...] "I had an idea Asquith rather suited your {{purposes}} just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Horace Moncrieff," [...] <b>I</b> <b>replied.</b> <b>I</b> {{was using}} at the period both my names indiscriminately, {{but for this}} {{occasion}} Horace Moncrieff I judged the more awe-inspiring.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] <b>I</b> <b>reply.</b> [...] "We are all by ourselves, you know. Nearly {{everyone}} in the village is at the theatre, I wish we had got a dog." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{hear you}} reproach, [...] "But delay was best, [...] For their end was a crime." [...] Oh, a crime will do [...] As well, <b>I</b> <b>reply,</b> to serve for a test, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{the third}} interrogatory <b>I</b> <b>reply,</b> that I am {{opposed to the}} {{admission}} of any more Slave States into the Union, that may be formed out of Texas or any other Territory.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>replied</b> that <b>I</b> {{should have}} known her, anywhere. Which was true enough.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>replied</b> {{that such}} was the {{conclusion}} to which observation had directed me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>replied</b> with {{considerable}} embarrassment that I liked them all,--as I certainly did.|$|R
6000|$|... "My sons? It may [...] Unman my heart, and {{the poor}} boys will weep; [...] And what can <b>I</b> <b>reply,</b> to comfort them, [...] Save with some hollow hopes, and ill-worn smiles?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When <b>I</b> <b>reply</b> {{in doing}} nothing, my dear Doctor,' said Walstein, 'you will {{think that you}} have {{discovered}} the cause of my disorder. But perhaps you will only mistake an effect for a cause.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Formerly," [...] I answered, [...] "because you did {{not love}} me; now, <b>I</b> <b>reply,</b> because you almost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me. You are killing me now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] he said, [...] "I {{see your}} drift exactly. You say {{what is the}} Ballplatz? <b>I</b> <b>reply</b> quite frankly that it is almost {{impossible}} to answer. Probably one could best define it as the driving power behind the Ausgleich." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>replied</b> that <b>I</b> could a little, though I {{had never}} done so in public.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>replied</b> that <b>I</b> did not know. My {{grandfather}} had never {{brought up the}} subject.|$|R
