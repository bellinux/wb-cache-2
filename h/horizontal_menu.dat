50|$|Championship Manager 3 {{features}} new {{user interface}} and menu system. It primarily used a vertical menu {{bar on the}} left-hand side of the screen, {{as well as the}} traditional <b>horizontal</b> <b>menu</b> bars across {{the top and bottom of}} the screen. As well as the new menu system, many more high-resolution background images were added - these were mostly relevant to whatever screen the player was viewing.|$|E
5000|$|It {{still has}} touch {{controls}} {{and a similar}} built-in sliding USB plug as the U3 but the plastic case design is quite different. Also, the OLED screen is no longer blue but displays 16-grey levels. The UI was also reworked compared to the U3: the vertical main menu changed to a <b>horizontal</b> <b>menu,</b> with some redesigned icons. And the [...] "Now playing" [...] screen now displays the album art if one {{is embedded in the}} tags. The U4 has three LEDs which can blink randomly or when pressing a button. It also has the standard DNSe 2.0 engine, including street mode, clarity, 3D and Bass effects as well as 10 EQ presets and a 7-band user EQ.|$|E
5000|$|... dmenu is a keyboard-driven menu utility {{developed}} {{as part of}} the dwm project. When invoked, usually by a user-configured key combination, dmenu displays a <b>horizontal</b> <b>menu</b> of its stdin stream at the top edge of the screen. This is usually used to pipe in a list of executable names from the user's $PATH, but dmenu can be used for any purpose where a menu is required. The user can start typing a program name, and dmenu will narrow the list to show only substring matches for what the user typed. The user can also use the arrow keys to navigate the menu. When a choice is made, dmenu sends the selected text to stdout, which is usually piped into a shell to launch the program. Command-line options can alter the font and colors of the menu, make the search case-insensitive, as well as switch the menu to a vertical orientation or place it {{at the bottom of the}} screen. By default, only X Font Server fonts are supported although a patch exists to enable TrueType fonts using Xft.|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} computerising {{histopathology}} records developed in-house using dBASE IV on IBM-compatible microcomputers {{in a local}} area network is described. The software package uses a <b>horizontal</b> main <b>menu</b> bar with associated pull-down submenus as interface between the machine and the user. It {{is very easy to}} use. The package provides options for selecting databases by years, enteringtediting records, browsing data, making multi-characteristics searches/retrievals, printing data, and maintaining databases that includes backing-up and repairing corrupted databases...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} computerising {{full blood picture}} {{reporting}} developed in-house using dBASE IV on IBM-compatible microcomputers in a local area network environment is described. The software package has a user-friendly interface which consists of a <b>horizontal</b> main <b>menu</b> bar with associated pull-down submenus. The package captures data directly from an automatic blood cell counter and provides options to modify or delete records, search for records, print interim, final or cumulative reports, record differential counts with an emulator, facilitate house-keeping activities which include backing-up databases and repairing corrupted indices. The implementation of this system has helped to improve the efficiency of reporting full blood picture in the haematology laboratory...|$|R

It was initially {{designed to make}} more efficient use of space given the limited screen size of netbooks, including, for example, a vertical application switcher called the launcher, and a space-saving <b>horizontal</b> multipurpose top <b>menu</b> bar.|$|R

40|$|The {{authors of}} this paper are {{conducting}} research into the usability of menu positioning on web pages. Other researchers have also done work in this area, but the results are not conclusive and therefore more work {{still needs to be}} done in this area. The design and results of an empirical experiment, investigating the usability of menu positioning on a supermarket web site, are presented in this paper. As a comparison, the authors tested a left vertical menu and a fisheye menu placed horizontally at the top of a page in a prototype supermarket web site against a real supermarket web site using a <b>horizontal</b> <b>menu</b> placed at the top of a page. Few significant results were observed, which gave rise to the conclusion that overall there were not many differences between the tested menu types.

40|$|Objective. Based on {{principles}} proposed by Rosenfeld and Morville (2006), {{the present study}} examined the PubMed database interface, since a well-structured information architecture contributes to good usability in any digital environment. Method. The research development occurred {{through the use of}} literature techniques and empirical study on the analysis of information architecture based on organization, navigation, recommended labeling and search for Rosenfeld and Morville (2006) for the sake of usability base PubMed. For better understanding and description of these principles, we used the technique of content analysis. Results. The results showed that the database interface meets the criteria established by the elements of Information Architecture, such as organization based on hypertext structure, <b>horizontal</b> <b>menu</b> and local content divided into categories, identifying active links, global navigation, breadcrumb, textual labeling and iconographic and highlight the search engine. Conclusions. This research showed that the PubMed database interface is well structured, friendly and objective, with numerous possibilities of search and information retrieval. However, {{there is a need to}} adopt accessibility standards on this website, so that it reaches more efficiently its purpose of facilitating access to information organized and stored in the PubMed database...|$|E
40|$|Graphical user {{interface}} guidelines {{have been developed}} predominantly in English-speaking countries, but aspects related to culture (e. g., local metaphors, symbols, color, and flow) are not universal and have received little or no attention. Even though the reading and writing flow of languages such as English, Japanese, and Chinese differ widely, most software interfaces do not take account of this. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of menu flow or menu orientation in both the Chinese and English languages for Chinese users. The experimental results indicate that for the Chinese population, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>menu</b> in either language {{is more effective than}} the vertical orientation. Thus item differentiation in menus is best performed when the natural flow of the user's native language is broken through a transformation process similar to a matrix transpose. Even though we did not investigate search strategies explicitly, we hypothesize that the primary reason for the difference lies in the scanning patterns adopted by the Chinese population in search tasks so that there is no mismatch in the reading metaphors. Applications of this research include the design of culturally and linguistically adapted human-computer interfaces for Chinese users...|$|E
