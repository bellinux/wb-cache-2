40|$|PUSSYCATS (Pedestrian Urban Safety System and Comfort at Traffic Signals) is a {{new system}} {{incorporating}} technical improvements better adapted to pedestrians needs and behaviour. A Kerb-side <b>detector</b> <b>mat</b> replaces the push buttons, with infrared sensors detecting the presence of pedestrians on the crossing. The pedestrian displays or the lightheads are moved to the near side of the crossing, thus facing the oncoming traffic. The study presented included interviews of pedestrians concerning comprehension, safety and convenience. Pedestrians were also observed in a before and after study. Their behaviour was related to traffic flows, presence of other pedestrians and impact of different phases...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the Dutch {{part of an}} {{international}} (French-British-Dutch) evaluation study of new pedestrian crossing facilities, summarized under the name 'PUSSYCATS' (See also IRRD 859331). 'PUSSYCATS' is a new system, characterized by technical improvements better adapted to the behaviour and needs of pedestrians, particularly those of vulnerable road users. The pedestrian display has been moved to the near side of the crossing (the Maastricht position), facing the oncoming traffic. A <b>mat</b> <b>detector</b> replaces the push button, with infrared sensors detecting the presence of pedestrians on the crossing. Observations were planned at two sites in Gouda and Heemstede, but problems arose during installation of the mats in Gouda, causing the cancellation of the survey there. The paper also describes the installation process and makes suggestions for improvements of infrared <b>detectors</b> and <b>mats.</b> More than 1, 000 pedestrians were observed. The effect {{of the presence of}} other people was also determined. Two hundred users of the crossing were asked to compare the old crossing with the new one, in terms of safety and convenience...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Wandering is aimless or {{repetitive}} locomotion {{that may}} expose persons with dementia to falls, injuries, elopement, and untimely death. Using data from focus groups, this study obtained {{opinions on the}} potential effectiveness of existing technologies for managing wandering in persons with dementia living in the community, and on the elements that such technologies should possess from the user’s perspective. Design 2 ̆ 6 Methods Cross-disciplinary, consensus-based analysis was applied to data from 6 focus groups consisting of 7 elderly nursing home residents, 7 caregivers of persons with dementia, 9 home healthcare staff, 7 long term care staff, 7 medical surgical staff caring for dementia patients, and 6 engineers working in rehabilitation settings. Each group received a briefing on available technology for wanderer monitoring systems and elopement management systems. Results Participants in all groups wanted flexible systems that would allow for a normal daily life, accommodate to changes over time, and be inexpensive. Inside the home, motion <b>detectors</b> and weight-sensitive <b>mats</b> by doors were preferred over camouflage and other visual deterrents; outside, Global Positioning System based elopement management was preferred. For both technologies, ranges and sensitivities must be programmable and changeable as environmental and human conditions warrant. Policy Implications 60...|$|R
40|$|Methyl halides are trace gases {{with both}} natural and {{anthropogenic}} origins. Once generated, these gases transport chlorine and bromine into the stratosphere, where they {{play an important role}} in ozone depleting catalytic cycles. The Florida Everglades is one location where methyl halide emissions have been proposed to be elevated due to high primary production and ionic halogens. This region also provides a unique study environment due to salt water intrusions, which occur during storm or low marsh water level-high tide events. The purpose of this research was twofold. First, quantification of methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl) and methyl bromide (CH 3 Br) production from periphyton mats on a temporal scale was needed. Secondly, to determine how varying concentrations of salinity affect CH 3 Cl and CH 3 Br production originating from calcareous periphyton mats within the Everglades. Periphyton was exposed to continuous 12 hour dark/light cycles in varying concentrations of salt water (0, 0. 1, 1, 5, and 10 parts per thousand). All water samples were analyzed to determine the production rate of CH 3 Cl and CH 3 Br in periphyton samples using a gas chromatograph coupled with an electron capture <b>detector</b> (GC-ECD). Periphyton <b>mats</b> were found to be a producer of CH 3 Cl in all freshwater (0 parts per thousand) trials and sampling times; however, results from CH 3 Br analysis found production rates that suggest consumption occurred in the majority of the 0 parts per thousand trials. Production rates for CH 3 Cl ranged from 0. 077 to 0. 109 g- 1 hr- 1 after 24 hours, 0. 027 to 0. 073 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 48 hours, and 0. 034 to 0. 047 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 72 hours. Production rates for the CH 3 Br freshwater experiments ranged from - 0. 00025 to 0. 00185 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 24 hours, - 0. 00022 to - 0. 00078 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 48 hours, and - 0. 00042 to - 0. 00061 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 72 hours. This research has also shown that increased salinity does have a significant positive effect on the production of CH 3 Cl and CH 3 Br from calcareous periphyton mats, which is important in areas that could be prone to salt water intrusions or rising sea levels due to global climate change...|$|R
