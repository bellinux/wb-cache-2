40|$|In the UK, at present, the {{majority}} of <b>aggregate</b> materials, <b>for</b> all construction applications, are obtained from primary resources such as crushed rock and sand and gravel. Material extraction results in many adverse environmental impacts and utilisation consumes a finite natural resource.

40|$|In {{concrete}} production, {{shape of}} aggregate reflects {{the quality of}} concrete produced. The well-shaped aggregates are said to produce high quality concrete by reducing water to cement ratio. On the contrary, poor-shaped aggregates often require higher water to cement ratio in concrete production. Conventionally, the quality of concrete is determined by calculating the ratio of well-shaped aggregate to poor-shaped aggregate contained in concrete. This procedure is slow, highly subjective and laborious, which is inefficient and expensive. In order to decrease the problems, this paper proposed an intelligent classification system <b>for</b> the <b>aggregates</b> <b>using</b> neural network.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringStacey KuleszaIn Kansas, {{mechanically}} stabilized earth (MSE) {{retaining walls}} are typically backfilled with coarse aggregate. Current backfill material testing procedures {{used by the}} Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) utilize on-site observations for construction quality assurance and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standard T 288 - 12 (“Standard Method of Test for Determining Minimum Laboratory Soil Resistivity”). AASHTO T 288 - 12 is designed to test a soil sample’s electrical resistivity (ER) that correlates to its corrosion potential. However, the test, based on material passing through a No. 10 sieve, is inappropriate <b>for</b> coarse <b>aggregate</b> typically <b>used</b> by KDOT as the aggregate will be retained on a No. 10 sieve and potentially leads to over-conservative designs. However, ER imaging provides a two-dimensional (2 D) profile of bulk ER of backfill material, thereby yielding more information regarding backfill uniformity compared to traditional sampling. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize bulk ER of in-place MSE wall backfill aggregate. In this study, MSE walls selected by KDOT were tested using ER imaging during construction to determine bulk ER of the backfill. Variations within backfill ER may be a result of varying aggregate material, inclusions of fines, thoroughness of compaction, and the presence of water. ER imaging was used on five walls: four MSE walls and one gravity retaining wall that contained no reinforcement. One MSE wall contained metal reinforcement, while the other four walls contained geosynthetic. The ER imaging field method produced a 2 D profile that depicted ER uniformity for bulk analysis. A post processing algorithm was generated to remove the subjective nature of the ER imaging results. The program determines the bulk ER based upon the ER imaging results. These results indicate that the laboratory analysis of AASHTO T 288 - 12 under-estimates the bulk ER of in-situ backfill material. Identification of a material’s bulk ER will help characterize the ER of aggregates in a complementary KDOT project. Results of this study will be used to recommend an in-situ test method <b>for</b> <b>aggregate</b> <b>used</b> by KDOT...|$|R
