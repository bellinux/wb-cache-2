The group of conformal diffeomorphisms of ^n is denoted by M (n). Let M_o (n) be its identity component which consists of all orientation-preserving elements <b>in</b> M (<b>n).</b> The conjugacy classification of isometries <b>in</b> M_o (<b>n)</b> depends on the conjugacy of T and T^- 1 <b>in</b> M_o (<b>n).</b> For an element T <b>in</b> M (<b>n),</b> T and T^- 1 are conjugate <b>in</b> M (<b>n),</b> {{but they may not}} be conjugate <b>in</b> M_o (<b>n).</b> <b>In</b> the literature, T is called real if T is conjugate <b>in</b> M_o (<b>n)</b> to T^- 1. In this paper we classify real elements <b>in</b> M_o (<b>n).</b> Let T be an element in M_o(n). Corresponding to T there is an associated element T_o in SO(n+ 1). If the complex conjugate eigenvalues of T_o are given by {e^iθ_j, e^-iθ_j}, 0 < θ_j ≤π, j= 1, [...] .,k, then {θ_ 1, [...] .,θ_k} are called the rotation angles of T. If the rotation angles of T are distinct from each-other, then T is called a regular element. After classifying the real elements <b>in</b> M_o (<b>n)</b> we have parametrized the conjugacy classes of regular elements <b>in</b> M_o (<b>n).</b> <b>In</b> the parametrization, when T is not conjugate to T^- 1, we have enlarged the group and have considered the conjugacy class of T <b>in</b> M (<b>n).</b> We prove that each such conjugacy class can be induced with a fibration structure.

5|$|In Nicotiana attenuata HypSys {{is known}} to not be {{involved}} in defence against insect herbivores. Silencing and over-expression of HypSys {{does not affect the}} feeding performance of larvae compared to normal plants. Berger silenced HypSys and found that it caused changes in flower morphology which reduced the efficiency of self-pollination. The flowers had pistils that protruded beyond their anthers, a similar phenotype to CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1-silenced plants which lack a jasmonate receptor. Measurement of jasmonate levels in the flowers revealed that they were lower than in normal plants. The authors suggested that HypSys peptides <b>in</b> <b>N.</b> attenuata have diversified from their function as defence related peptides to being involved in controlling flower morphology. The signalling processes remain similar however, being mediated through jasmonates.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah is a {{carnivorous}} plant of the pitfall trap variety. It {{is famous for}} occasionally trapping vertebrates, even small mammals. There exist at least two records of drowned rats found <b>in</b> <b>N.</b> rajah pitchers. The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by Spenser St. John, who accompanied Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu. In 1988, Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb confirmed the plausibility of this record when they managed to observe drowned rats in a large pitcher of N. rajah. In 2011, {{the discovery of a}} drowned mountain treeshrew (Tupaia montana) in a N.rajah pitcher was reported.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that transgene expression in plants can be affected by ploidy. Here we show that three different transgenes, a reporter transgene, an antisense transgene, and a hairpin RNA (hpRNA) transgene, are all expressed at a lower level <b>in</b> autotetraploid (4 <b>n)</b> than <b>in</b> diploid (2 <b>n)</b> Arabidopsis. RNA silencing of two endogenous genes was induced by the antisense and hpRNA transgenes and this silencing is significantly less effective <b>in</b> 4 <b>n</b> than <b>in</b> 2 <b>n</b> Arabidopsis; furthermore, the reduced silencing <b>in</b> 4 <b>n</b> Arabidopsis correlated with reduced accumulation of silencing-inducer RNAs. Methylation analysis both of independent 2 n and 4 n transgenic lines and of 2 n and 4 n progeny derived from the same 3 n transgenic parent, indicated that transgenes are more methylated <b>in</b> 4 <b>n</b> than 2 n Arabidopsis. These results suggest that transgenes are transcriptionally repressed <b>in</b> the 4 <b>n</b> background, resulting <b>in</b> expression levels lower than <b>in</b> the 2 <b>n</b> background. Transgenes designed to silence endogenous genes express lower concentrations of silencing-inducer RNAs <b>in</b> 4 <b>n</b> Arabidopsis plants, resulting in less effective silencing of target genes than <b>in</b> 2 <b>n</b> Arabidopsis plants...|$|R
5|$|Of these viruses {{the most}} serious and {{prevalent}} are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping <b>in</b> <b>N.</b> tazetta. Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.|$|E
5|$|Riya first {{appeared}} as a child artist in the film Vishkanya in 1991, where she {{played the role of}} the young Pooja Bedi. At the age of 19, she did National Film Awards winning director Bharathiraja's Tamil film, Taj Mahal (2000), which did not achieve commercial success. She was scheduled to make her Bollywood film debut in Love You Hamesha, opposite actor Akshaye Khanna; however, the film was stalled, and she finally made her debut <b>in</b> <b>N.</b> Chandra's Style in 2001. This low-budget sex comedy was the first commercial success in over a decade for the director. A launch pad for Riya, cast in the female lead along with fellow-newcomers, Sharman Joshi, Sahil Khan and Shilpi Mudgal, the film pioneered a trend of commercial success for small budget films in India. Riya and the second female lead of the film were replaced by aspirant actresses Sonali Joshi and Jaya Seal in Xcuse Me'.|$|E

The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced.

5|$|The {{leaves of}} N. rajah are very {{distinctive}} and reach a large size. They are leathery in texture with a wavy outer margin. The leaves are characteristically peltate, whereby the tendril joins the lamina on the underside, before the apex. This characteristic is more pronounced <b>in</b> <b>N.</b> rajah {{than in any}} other Nepenthes species, with the exception of N. clipeata. However, it is not unique to these two taxa, as mature plants of many Nepenthes species display slightly peltate leaves. The tendrils are inserted ≤5cm below the leaf apex and reach a length of approximately 50cm. Three to five longitudinal veins run along each side of the lamina and pennate (branching) veins run towards the margin. The lamina is oblong to lanceolate-shaped, ≤80cm long and ≤15cm wide.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones as tools. When a large egg, such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks up to it with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble by swinging the neck down over the egg. The operation is repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to jagged rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that it was first reported by Jane Goodall in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded <b>in</b> <b>N.</b> p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E
