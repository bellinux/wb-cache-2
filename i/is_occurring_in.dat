40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of Ex-press glaucoma filtration device implantation under scleral flap for traumatic glaucoma. METHODS: Totally 19 eyes of 19 patients with traumatic glaucoma were implanted with Ex-press glaucoma filtration device under the scleral flap from December 2012 to May 2013. The postoperative visual acuity, anterior chamber depth and hyphema,intraocular pressure(IOP), filtering bleb and other complications were observed and summarized. RESULTS: Ex-press glaucoma filtration device were implanted successfully in 19 patients. At 1 d postoperatively shallow anterior chamber <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> 2 eyes and hyphema <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> 3 eyes. At 3 mo postoperatively increased vision <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> 9 eyes(47 %),functional filtering bleb <b>was</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> 18 eyes(95 %),and IOP was 12. 1 ± 6. 1 mmHg.

25|$|The {{subscripts}} {{indicate a}} central word order difference across {{direct and indirect}} questions. Wh-fronting in main clauses typically results in V2 word order in English, meaning the finite verb appears in second position, as marked by the 2-subscript in the b-sentences. In indirect questions, however, V3 word order typically obtains, as marked by the 3-subscript in the c-sentences. Despite this systematic word order difference across direct and indirect questions, wh-fronting within the clause <b>is</b> <b>occurring</b> <b>in</b> both cases.

There are still some lake areas along with four major canals and wetlands, also under conservation status. The urbanization has led to serious traffic and transportation problems as well as the completion of Line 12 of the Mexico City Metro in 2012, which a terminal in the borough.|$|E
