5|$|The {{orbits of}} Solar System planets are nearly circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller orbital eccentricity. Although there are {{attempts}} to <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> partly with a {{bias in the}} radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.|$|E
5|$|A large tumulus of {{uncertain}} {{origin and}} purpose stands approximately {{in the middle}} of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city.

However, these remain unproven hypotheses.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor in}} Lisbon's failure was Lisbon itself. An impenetrable legal document, {{it could not}} be {{understood}} without close study, and even the Referendum Commission – the nonpartisan body set up to <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> – could not <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> all.|$|E

50|$|A bigger {{vulnerability}} for {{the view}} is that it lacks explanatory power. The worry is that projectivism does not <b>explain</b> meta-ethics, <b>it</b> <b>explains</b> <b>it</b> away. Projectivism may stand to meta-ethics as particularism stands to ethics.|$|R

25|$|Prior to Lloyd, {{several authors}} had {{reported}} this phenomenon and {{had attempted to}} <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> by positing that creatures caught by the tail repeatedly set off the trap as they thrash about {{in an attempt to}} escapeeven as their tails are actively digested by the plant.

25|$|Rav Nissim Gaon postulates in his Hakdamah Le'mafteach Hatalmud that {{information}} on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to <b>explain</b> <b>it.</b> A modern-day scholar Reuvein Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kochba revolt, its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{the sinking of the}} Clan Ranald is still undetermined.

Other theories include the water ballast tanks were not emptied or that the sea cock was opened throughout the journey. Some even suggested that most of the crew were drunk at that time.|$|E

25|$|Some {{doubt this}} biographical {{interpretation}} of Nemean 7 {{since it is}} largely based on marginal comments by scholiasts and Pindaric scholiasts are often unreliable. The fact that Pindar gave {{different versions of the}} myth may simply reflect the needs of different genres, and does not necessarily indicate a personal dilemma. Nemean 7 in fact is the most controversial and obscure of Pindar's victory odes, and scholars ancient and modern have been ingenious and imaginative in their attempts to <b>explain</b> <b>it,</b> so far with no agreed success.|$|E
25|$|Heisenberg set Peierls a {{research}} project on ferromagnetism. It was known that this {{was caused by the}} spin of the electrons in the metal aligning; but the reason for this was unknown. Heisenberg suspected that it was caused by a quantum mechanical effect, caused by the Pauli exclusion principle. Peierls was unable to develop the theory, but work on Hall effect was more productive. The anomalous Hall effect could not be explained with the classical theory of metals, and Heisenberg sensed an opportunity to demonstrate that quantum mechanics could <b>explain</b> <b>it.</b> Peierls was able to do so, resulting in his first published paper.|$|E
25|$|For the friar to be beatified, {{a miracle}} (normally, a healing) {{had to be}} {{approved}} following confirmation that science could not <b>explain</b> <b>it.</b> Numerous cases were investigated, including one validated by the Congregation on April 3, 1998 that was later debunked. The diocese deemed another case miraculous on January 18, 2015. This received Congregation validation on October 12, 2015; approval {{by a panel of}} medical experts on September 22, 2016; and approval by theological consulters on January 19, 2017. The Congregation approved of the miracle on May 2, 2017, and Pope Francis did so two days later, meaning that the late friar would be beatified. The beatification is scheduled for November 18, 2017, at Ford Field in Detroit.|$|E
