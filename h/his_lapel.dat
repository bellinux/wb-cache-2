He often wore a black {{carnation}} in <b>his</b> <b>lapel,</b> and was known to color his finger- and toenails. Crosby once hired four horse-drawn carriages and raced them through the Paris streets. He would frequently drop in at Drosso where he would smoke opium. He would stay {{away from home for}} days.|$|E

He pinned it on <b>his</b> <b>lapel,</b> his concert was a success and Mayol, who was superstitious, made the lily-of-the-valley his personal emblem. It was taken up by the rugby club in 1921.|$|E

25|$|The jackdaws {{return to}} their nest and attack the travelers, {{carrying}} off the Scarecrow's straw. Fortunately, the nest contains {{a large amount of}} paper money, with which the Scarecrow can be re-stuffed. Using Wishing Pills they discover in the container holding the Powder of Life, Tip and his friends escape and journey to the palace of Glinda the Good Witch in Oz's southern quadrant, the Quadling Country. They learn from Glinda that after the fall of Oz's mortal king Pastoria decades ago, a long lost princess named Ozma was hidden away in secrecy when the Wizard of Oz took the throne. She also informs them that Ozma is the rightful ruler of the Emerald City and all of Oz in general, not the Scarecrow (who did not really want the job anyway). Glinda therefore accompanies Tip, Jack, the Sawhorse, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Wogglebug, and the Gump back to the Emerald City to see Mombi. The crooked woman tries to deceive them by disguising a chambermaid named Jellia Jamb as herself (which fails), but manages to elude them as they search for her in the Emerald City. Just as their time runs out, the Tin Woodman plucks a rose to wear in <b>his</b> <b>lapel,</b> unaware that this is the transformed Mombi.|$|E

After the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) parts ways with Martha (Freema Agyeman), he tries taking off, only for the TARDIS to spin wildly and sound an alarm. Checking out the systems, the Doctor passes his fifth {{incarnation}} (Peter Davison) doing the same thing. The Tenth Doctor recognises his past self and is overjoyed to see him, gently poking fun at his particular eccentricities, such as the stick of celery on <b>his</b> <b>lapel</b> and the unneeded glasses he sometimes wears; he also explains that his presence has 'shorten out the time differential' between himself and his past incarnation, resulting in the latter gaining an uncharacteristic older physical appearance. [...] The Fifth Doctor is annoyed, believing his counterpart to be a fan who has broken into the TARDIS.|$|E
500|$|Thousands of fans braved cold {{temperatures}} on January 24 for {{a public}} visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in <b>his</b> <b>lapel</b> pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist. Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him [...] "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial [...] "was a better player than me {{because he was a}} better man than me".|$|E

5000|$|Behind the scenes, however, Rooney {{was like}} the [...] "hyperactive girl-crazy teenager" [...] he portrayed. Wallace Beery, his co-star in Stablemates, {{described}} him as a [...] "brat", but a [...] "fine actor". MGM head Louis B. Mayer {{found it necessary to}} manage Rooney's public image, explains historian Jane Ellen Wayne: Mayer naturally tried to keep all his child actors in line, like any father figure. After one such episode, Mickey Rooney replied, [...] "I won't do it. You're asking the impossible." [...] Mayer then grabbed young Rooney by <b>his</b> <b>lapels</b> and said, [...] "Listen to me!

500|$|Senator Tillman, a fiery speaker {{who wore}} a {{pitchfork}} on <b>his</b> <b>lapel,</b> began the debate. [...] His speech, set as the only one besides Bryan's in favor of silver, portrayed silver as a sectional issue pitting the poorer folk of the South and West against gold-supporting New York {{and the rest of}} the Northeast. [...] It was badly received even by silver delegates, who wished to think of silver as a patriotic, national issue. [...] Senator Jones felt compelled to spend five minutes (granted by the gold side), stating that the silver issue crossed sectional lines. [...] New York Senator Hill was next: the leading spokesman for gold, both gold and silver delegates quieted to hear him. [...] He was followed by Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William D. Russell. [...] Each made their cases for gold, and likely changed few votes. [...] Only Bryan was left to speak, and no one at the convention had yet effectively championed the silver cause. [...] The New York Times described the setting: ...|$|E
500|$|The Joker has no {{inherent}} superhuman abilities. He commits crimes with {{a variety}} of weaponized thematic props such as a deck of razor-tipped playing cards, rolling marbles, Jack-in-the-boxes with unpleasant surprises and exploding cigars capable of leveling a building. The flower in <b>his</b> <b>lapel</b> sprays acid, and his hand often holds a lethal joy buzzer conducting a million volts of electricity, although both items were introduced in 1952 as harmless joke items. However, his chemical genius provides his most-notable weapon: Joker venom, a liquid or gaseous toxin which sends its targets into fits of uncontrollable laughter; higher doses can lead to paralysis, coma or death, leaving its victim with a ghoulish, pained rictus grin. The Joker has used venom since his debut; only he knows the formula, and is shown to be gifted enough to manufacture the toxin from ordinary household chemicals. Another version of the venom (used in [...] "Joker's Last Laugh") makes its victims resemble the Joker, susceptible to his orders. The villain is immune to venom and most poisons; in Batman #663 (2007), Morrison writes that being [...] "an avid consumer of his own chemical experiments, the Joker's immunity to poison concoctions that might kill another man in an instant has been developed over years of dedicated abuse." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on <b>his</b> <b>lapel.</b> [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

In a perhaps apocryphal story, when a furious President Lyndon B. Johnson met with Pearson the next day, he grabbed the much smaller Canadian by <b>his</b> <b>lapels</b> and talked angrily with him for an hour. After this incident, the two men somehow found ways to resolve their differences over the war—in fact, they both had further contacts, including later twice meeting in Canada.|$|R

2500|$|The {{character}} of Walter Neff {{was not only}} a heel, he was a weak and malleable heel – many Hollywood actors including Alan Ladd, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March passed on it. Wilder even recalls [...] "scraping the bottom of the barrel" [...] and approaching George Raft. Raft was illiterate, so Wilder had to tell him the plot. About halfway through, Raft interrupted him with, [...] "Let's get to the lapel bit." [...] "What lapel bit?" [...] a bewildered Wilder replied. [...] "The lapel," [...] the actor said, annoyed by such stupidity. [...] "You know, when the guy flashes <b>his</b> <b>lapel,</b> you see his badge, you know he's a detective."
