5|$|The {{model of}} the drone was created by Dan Curry, from a L'eggs pantyhose {{container}} and a shampoo bottle. He hand animated the model instead of using motion control photography, using his years of Tai Chi training to keep the movements fluid. In order to blend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> he wore a pair of green tights whilst he was manually moving the model on screen.|$|E
5|$|At (1:18), the song's main melody is introduced, {{played by}} a guitar, the bass guitar and a glockenspiel, with a chord {{progression}} of E minor, C major seventh, G major, and D major. This is repeated until (3:28), when the guitars fade out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> and the drumbeat ends, leaving only the ride cymbal to keep the beat, and the main melody, which is repeated until it gradually fades out, leaving ambient guitar noise.|$|E
5|$|Each of the Crusaders {{features}} {{in a single}} major attack against Mew Berry or the other Mew Mews, before fading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> Towards {{the end of the}} series, Mew Berry breaks the brainwashing spell on the public. Tasuku and Duke admits that the methods the Crusaders used were wrong. They are last seen in the series standing together on the roof of a building, enjoying the warm feelings being spread by Mew Berry.|$|E

50|$|Hernandez {{gradually}} {{took advantage}} of serialization to broaden his narrative scope; the stories became longer and more ambitious, and Hernandez delved more deeply <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> of his characters, their community, and sociopolitical issues. His longest and most complex work Poison River appeared in 29-40. Love and Rockets X ran alongside Poison River and Jaime's eight-part Wig Wam Bam.|$|R
40|$|Bartók's {{well-known}} opera Duke Bluebeard's Castle has {{an internationally}} hardly known parallel in Willem Pijper's opera Halewijn. The Hungarian and the Dutch opera {{share the same}} motives; they make use of a historical, a literary and a musical heritage, both from eastern and western Europe, in different ways yet with remarkable similarities. This article is an investigation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> of <b>the</b> two operas and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> contexts in which their motives developed - and continue to develop...|$|R
5|$|The {{clothing}} worn by characters {{was brought}} up-to-date, while the old steam railways {{were replaced by}} electrified alternatives. Adverts for the genuine Johnnie Walker whisky were replaced by adverts for a fictional alternative, Loch Lomond whisky, while a Sussex County Council signpost was added to page 11. Various English towns and villages were renamed, with Puddlecombe becoming Littlegate, and Eastbury becoming Eastdown, while Scottish pub Ye Dolphin was renamed The Kiltoch Arms. The police were no longer depicted as carrying guns, as was accurate, while the journalists Christopher Willoughby-Drupe and Marco Rizotto, who had first appeared in The Castafiore Emerald (1963), were retroactively added <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> of one scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{designs in}} Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, {{which may be}} overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including {{a wide variety of}} tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13thcentury, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to create the illusion of flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
50|$|Martin was {{regarded}} as a quiet man who enjoyed relaxing on the beach near his home in Miami, where he liked slipping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> of photographs tourists would take of each other, so when their films were developed they would wonder who the strange man was. Fellow Mad contributor Sergio Aragonés had the same impish habit. Despite his preference for privacy, he delighted in having struggling cartoonists visit his home.|$|R
50|$|During Mads {{run as a}} comic book, Kurtzman {{wrote and}} laid out each story. He built up his layouts laboriously on {{multiple}} sheets of tracing paper before passing them on to be finished by the artists. Most EC artists contributed to Mad at some time, but none more frequently than Jack Davis, Wally Wood, and especially Will Elder. While followingKurtzman's layouts strictly, Elder greatly expanded the art, inserting countless visual gags <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{the first}} scene filmed was the final scene {{to appear in the}} film (shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in 2000), {{principal}} photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at Shepperton Studios and Elstree Studios in London from August 2004 to January 31, 2005. The initial filming took place on sound stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand (they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami). The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting {{at the same time that}} Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out {{a position where they}} can blend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which {{makes it difficult for}} the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.|$|E

50|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{has been}} altered {{to use a}} modified version of the Super Street Fighter II intro, in which logos of the past five games appear flashing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> screen. <b>The</b> <b>background</b> music played during the player select screen was also reverted to the theme used in Super Street Fighter II.|$|R
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
5|$|Stories in {{the series}} {{frequently}} emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and tragedies of the characters, and the main plot often recedes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> as the focus shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from love to rivalry. Other recurring situations that drive the plot include amnesia, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and self-sacrifice. Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game items that are frequently connected to the themes of the games' plots. Crystals often {{play a central role}} in the creation of the world, and a majority of the Final Fantasy games link crystals and orbs to the planet's life force. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The classical elements are also a recurring theme {{in the series}} related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the Gaia hypothesis, an apocalypse, and conflicts between advanced technology and nature.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>background).</b> Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E
