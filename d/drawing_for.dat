5|$|In 1995, Gretzky {{sold the}} card to Wal-Mart and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two {{companies}} {{intended to use}} the card as the grand prize in a promotional contest. The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize <b>drawing</b> <b>for</b> the card was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on. She consigned the card to Christie's, a New York-based auction house better known for selling famous artworks.|$|E

He was a freelancer throughout that time.|$|E
25|$|A {{high-level}} {{representation of}} an image necessarily contains elements in a different domain from pixels. These elements {{are referred to as}} primitives. In a schematic <b>drawing,</b> <b>for</b> instance, line segments and curves might be primitives. In a graphical user interface, windows and buttons might be the primitives. In 3D rendering, triangles and polygons in space might be primitives.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the Venetian {{agreed to}} pay a $1 million penalty to settle a 12-count Gaming Control Board complaint.

25|$|When <b>drawing</b> <b>for</b> UEFA European Championships Qualification {{a special}} measure {{is put in}} place where by Gibraltar and Spain cannot be drawn {{together}} because of the Disputed status of Gibraltar. The same system is in place for Azerbaijan and Armenia because of the poor {{relations between the two}} countries. The same measure was put in place for Russia and Georgia after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War but was however lifted for the Euro 2016 tournament when the two agreed to play each other again.|$|E
25|$|The art {{department}} generated all of {{the concepts}} and <b>drawing</b> <b>for</b> the prop department, the set decoration department, the construction department, the paint department and the model shop. They also collaborated with the visual effects department. Stargate SG-1 employed about 200 Canadian union workers, although that number could exceed 300 when new sets were built. Lead production designer Richard Hudolin joined the project in October 1996. Bridget McGuire, SG-1s art director since the pilot episode, took over as lead production designer in Season 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} and {{symmetric}} plane drawing of the Petersen graph, as a pentagram within a pentagon, has five crossings. However, {{this is not the}} best <b>drawing</b> <b>for</b> minimizing crossings; there exists another drawing (shown in the figure) with only two crossings. Thus, the Petersen graph has crossing number 2. Each edge in this drawing is crossed at most once, so the Petersen graph is 1-planar. On a torus the Petersen graph can be drawn without edge crossings; it therefore has orientable genus 1.|$|E

The painting measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil.|$|E
25|$|Green's Theorem, {{which gives}} the {{relationship}} between a line integral around a simple closed curve C and a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C, is applied in an instrument known as a planimeter, which is used to calculate the area of a flat surface on a <b>drawing.</b> <b>For</b> example, {{it can be used to}} calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property.|$|E
25|$|Second round {{qualifying}} {{was held}} on Saturday November 14. Under the rules at the time, drivers who did not qualify during the first round moved on to second round qualifying. Each driver could elect to stand on his time from the first round, or erase their time and make a new attempt. Rookie Jeff Gordon bettered his time from the day before, and became the fastest qualifier of the second round. That entered him into the wild card <b>drawing</b> <b>for</b> the 1993 Busch Clash.|$|E

There, she is presumed to have learned the technique of silverpoint <b>drawing,</b> <b>for</b> which she is best known. In 1920, Wood and a fellow art student, Myra Marglous, applied for passports and left for Paris to continue their study of art.|$|E

25|$|The {{magazine}} {{was a success}} and soon attracted the industry's leading contributors. Among the most important was Charles Dana Gibson. Three years after the {{magazine was}} founded, the Massachusetts native first sold Life a <b>drawing</b> <b>for</b> $4: a dog outside his kennel howling at the moon. Encouraged by a publisher who was also an artist, Gibson was joined in Life early days by such well-known illustrators as Palmer Cox (creator of the Brownie), A. B. Frost, Oliver Herford and E. W. Kemble. Life attracted an impressive literary roster too: John Kendrick Bangs, James Whitcomb Riley and Brander Matthews all wrote for the magazine around {{the start of the}} 20th century.|$|E
