Relevant phenomena most commonly include thermal stresses, physical ageing, frozen-in strains and molecular orientation. In this work, two different <b>high-impact</b> <b>polystyrenes,</b> processed by thermoforming, were considered: a “standard” one and a grade specifically resistant to Environmental Stress Cracking (ESC). The main effect induced by thermoforming was molecular orientation. The local degree of orientation was measured on a thermoformed product {{and its effect on}} the material ESC behavior in sunflower oil was studied. A Fracture Mechanics approach was applied to evaluate the fracture resistance of the two materials.

40|$|Major {{benefits}} of plastics recycling are reduced depletion of non-renewable resources and reduction of world-wide waste. Traditional thermo-mechanical recycling causes reduction of mechanical properties for most thermoplastics. Down-cycled materials may nevertheless be suited for certain useful applications. Developing such applications {{may be a}} step towards more effective future use of resources. Increased application of recycled thermoplastics is generally preferable over landfills, or waste lying around {{in some parts of}} the world. Different recycled <b>high-impact</b> <b>polystyrenes</b> (HIPS) from TVs were mechanically tested, as well as mixtures of them. Mixtures of a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and a polypropylene (PP) were tested as well, representing a large portion of mixed plastics waste. A contribution was made to a process improvement for creating products from street waste in Kenya. Mixing different recycled HIPS grades gave no significant changes in melt flow index and impact strength. One mixture showed a significant reduction in tensile strength.

50|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{to other}} classes of material. Naturally brittle materials, such as glass, are {{not difficult to}} toughen effectively. Most such techniques involve one of two mechanisms: to deflect or absorb {{the tip of a}} propagating crack, or to create carefully controlled residual stresses so that cracks from certain predictable sources will be forced closed. The first principle is used in laminated glass where two sheets of glass are separated by an interlayer of polyvinyl butyral, which as a viscoelastic polymer absorbs the growing crack. The second method is used in toughened glass and pre-stressed concrete. A demonstration of glass toughening is provided by Prince Rupert's Drop. Brittle polymers can be toughened by using metal particles to initiate crazes when a sample is stressed, a good example being <b>high-impact</b> <b>polystyrene</b> or HIPS. The least brittle structural ceramics are silicon carbide (mainly by virtue of its high strength) and transformation-toughened zirconia.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{oxidative}} degradation of pure polystyrene, polybutadiene and butadiene-modified polystyrene (normally called {{high impact polystyrene}} or HIPS) have been studied {{using a variety of}} physical and chemical techniques. The changes in dynamic-mechanical properties occurring during the ultra-violet light accelerated weathering of these polymers were followed by a visco-elastometric technique (Rheovibron) in the solid phase over a wide temperature range. Selective cross-linking of the polybutadiene in <b>high-impact</b> <b>polystyrene</b> caused the depression of the low temperature damping peak (tan d) with a corresponding sharp peak in tan d at ambient temperature accompanied by an integral rise in complex modulus. During the same period of photoxidation, the hydroperoxide concentration and gel content increased rapidly, reaching a maximum before decomposing photolytically with the destruction of unsaturation and with the formation of stable oxidation products. Infra-red spectroscopy showed the formation of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. a,ß-unsaturated carbonyl was also identified and was formed by decomposition of both allylic hydroperoxide and initial peroxidic gel by ß-scission of the graft between polybutadiene and polystyrene. With further photoxidation a more stable ether gel was formed involving the destruction of the conjugating double bond of a,ß-unsaturated carbonyl. Addition of saturated and unsaturated ketones which are potential sensitisers of photoxidation to <b>high-impact</b> <b>polystyrene</b> and polybutadiene failed to photo-initiate the oxygen absorption of the polymers. A prior thermal oxidative treatment on the other hand eliminated the auto- accelerating stage leading to linear kinetics as the concentration of thermally-produced hydroperoxide approached a maximum. Antioxidants which act by destroying hydroperoxide lengthened the induction period to rapid oxygen absorption, whilst a phenolic antioxidant behaved as a weak photo-activator initially and a retarder later. Prior photolysis of <b>high-impact</b> <b>polystyrene</b> photo-activated the unsaturated component and caused similar changes in dynamic-mechanical properties to those found during photoxidation although at a much lower rate.

40|$|<b>High-impact</b> <b>polystyrene</b> (HIPS) {{constitutes}} a mechanically attractive composite, {{consisting of a}} glassy matrix and a rubberlike particle phase (gel phase).

An approximate estimation of the gel-phase modulus was attempted by using known mechanical models. A comparison with experiments was also made. The modulus of the composite was found to be lower than the theoretical lower bound for particulate composites. This was attributed to a separate phase between gel particles and the matrix.

Due to legal requirements of the current restriction for the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, focus now is placed on phosphorus-based flame retardants instead of the brominated kind. Newly developed analytical methods for the first-mentioned substances also require RMs similar to industrial samples for validation and verification purposes. Hence, the prepared candidate RMs contained resorcinol-bis-(diphenyl phosphate), bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate), triphenyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphine oxide as phosphorus-based flame retardants.
