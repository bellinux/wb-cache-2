25|$|Benford's law was empirically tested {{against the}} numbers (up to the 10th digit) {{generated}} {{by a number of}} important distributions, including the uniform distribution, the exponential distribution, the half-normal distribution, the right-truncated normal, the normal distribution, the chi square distribution and the log normal distribution. In addition to these the ratio distribution of two uniform distributions, the ratio distribution of two exponential distributions, the ratio distribution of two half-normal distributions, the ratio distribution of two right-truncated normal distributions, the ratio distribution of two chi-square distributions (the <b>F</b> <b>distribution)</b> and the log normal distribution were tested.|$|E
25|$|The uniform {{distribution}} {{as might be}} expected does not obey Benford's law. In contrast, the ratio distribution of two {{uniform distribution}}s is well described by Benford's law. Benford's law also describes the exponential distribution and the ratio distribution of two exponential distributions well. Although the half-normal distribution does not obey Benford's law, the ratio distribution of two half-normal distributions does. Neither the right-truncated normal distribution nor the ratio distribution of two right-truncated normal distributions are well described by Benford's law. This is not surprising as this distribution is weighted towards larger numbers. Neither the normal distribution nor the ratio distribution of two normal distributions (the Cauchy distribution) obey Benford's law. The fit of chi square distribution depends on the degrees of freedom (df) with good agreement with df = 1 and decreasing agreement as the df increases. The <b>F</b> <b>distribution</b> is fitted well for low degrees of freedom. With increasing dfs the fit decreases but much more slowly than the chi square distribution. The fit of the log-normal distribution depends on the mean and the variance of the distribution. The variance has a much greater effect on the fit than does the mean. Larger values of both parameters result in better agreement with the law. The ratio of two log normal distributions is a log normal so this distribution was not examined.|$|E

Since the non-central F-distribution is stochastically larger than the (central) F-distribution, one rejects the null hypothesis if the F-statistic is larger than the critical F value. [...] The critical value corresponds to the cumulative distribution function of the <b>F</b> <b>distribution</b> with x equal to the desired confidence level, and degrees of freedom d1=(n'p) and d2=(N'n).

40|$|Some {{equivalence}} {{tests are}} based on two one-sided tests, where in many applications the test statistics are approximately normal. We define and find evidence for equivalence in Z-tests and then one- and two-sample binomial tests {{as well as for}} t-tests. Multivariate equivalence tests are typically based on statistics with non-central chi-squared or non-central <b>F</b> <b>distributions</b> in which the non-centrality parameter λ is a measure of heterogeneity of several groups. Classical tests of the null λ ≥ λ 0 versus the equivalence alternative λ < λ 0 are available, but simple formulae for power functions are not. In these tests, the equivalence limit λ 0 is typically chosen by context. We provide extensions of classical variance stabilizing transformations for the non-central chi-squared and <b>F</b> <b>distributions</b> that are easy to implement and which lead to indicators of evidence for equivalence. Approximate power functions are also obtained via simple expressions for the expected evidence in these equivalence tests...|$|R
