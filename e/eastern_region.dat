5|$|In May 1967, the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Region</b> {{declared}} independence {{as a state}} {{called the}} Republic of Biafra, {{under the leadership of}} Lt. Colonel Emeka Ojukwu. The Nigerian Civil War began as the official Nigerian government side (predominated by soldiers from the North and West) attacked Biafra (Southeastern) on 6 July 1967 at Garkem. The 30-month war, with a long siege of Biafra and its isolation from trade and supplies, ended in January 1970. Estimates of the number of dead in the former <b>Eastern</b> <b>Region</b> are between 1 and 3 million people, from warfare, disease, and starvation, during the 30-month civil war.|$|E
5|$|Later, the counter-coup of 1966, {{supported}} {{primarily by}} Northern military officers, facilitated {{the rise of}} Lt. Colonel Yakubu Gowon to head of state. Tension rose between North and South; Igbos in Northern cities suffered persecution and many fled to the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Region.</b>|$|E

5|$|The tallest {{building}} in Enugu's Central Business District (CBD) is the African Continental Bank (ACB) tower with six stories. The tower {{was built in}} the late 50s for the African Continental Bank Limited which was founded by Nnamdi Azikiwe who became the first president of Nigeria after the country's independence from the United Kingdom on October 1960. The opening of the building took place on 30 April 1959. Other tall buildings include the Hotel Presidential opened on August 1963. The seven story building contains 100 rooms and is located in the Independence Layout. Hotel Presidential cost $2.5 million to build and was commissioned by the government of what was then the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Region</b> to serve visiting businessmen, officials and tourists. In the middle of Enugu is the Michael Okpara Square, dedicated to the premier of the former <b>Eastern</b> <b>Region</b> Michael Okpara. Beside the square is located the Enugu State Government House, Enugu State House of Assembly and Enugu State Judiciary Complex.|$|E
5|$|Designed at British Railways' Derby Works, the {{new class}} was {{constructed}} at British Railways' Crewe Works between 1951 and 1954. The initial order was for 25 locomotives, but {{such was the}} demand for the Britannias on the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Region</b> that more were rushed through construction before the teething problems had been ironed out on the prototypes. In total, 55 {{members of the class}} were constructed over three batches at Crewe Works, where each was given improvements to improve reliability and efficiency, and to overcome flaws with the original design.|$|E
40|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>regions</b> of Russia have a {{substantial}} potential for expansion of steaming coal production. The majority of coal deposits in the <b>eastern</b> <b>regions</b> are located {{close enough to the}} objects of the Asian super ring. The large coal reserves make it possible to consider it as a reliable fuel source for power plants for a long-term horizon. The coal reserves suitable for using at power plants of the Asian super ring are estimated in the paper by subject of the federation of the <b>eastern</b> <b>regions</b> for operating and new coal producers. The coal deposits of the <b>eastern</b> <b>regions</b> that are promising for the construction of power plants of the Asian super ring are presented. The paper describes both the coal deposits of the <b>eastern</b> <b>regions</b> that are considered in the projects for power plant construction and included in the program documents and the coal deposits that are not included in the program documents. The coal reserves of these deposits and the possible volumes of its production are estimated. The key qualitative coal characteristics of the deposits: heating value, and ash, sulfur, moisture content are presented. The mining-geological and hydrological conditions for deposit development are briefly characterized. The coals of the <b>eastern</b> <b>regions</b> are showed to contain valuable accompanying elements. It is noted that the creation of industrial clusters {{on the basis of the}} coal deposits is the most effective from the standpoints of the economy and ecology. The favorable and restraining factors in development of the described coal deposits are estimated...|$|R

He then took the offensive to the heartland of Persia, and arrived at the walls of its capital Ctesiphon. The city withstood the short siege but Odaenathus reclaimed the entirety of Roman lands occupied by the Persians {{since the beginning of}} their invasions in 252. Odaenathus celebrated his victories and declared himself King of Kings, crowning his son Hairan I as co-king. By 263, Odaenathus was in effective control of the Levant, Mesopotamia and Anatolia's <b>eastern</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was {{promoted}} at the NBS and {{put in charge of}} the network's <b>eastern</b> <b>region</b> coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.|$|E
5|$|Several {{strands of}} the SAF in the <b>eastern</b> <b>region</b> of the San Francisco Bay Area are the Hayward–Rodgers Creek and Calaveras Faults. The Hayward Fault {{exhibits}} fault creep, {{but it also}} has potential for large earthquakes, like the 1868 Hayward earthquake that occurred on its southern segment. The northern Calaveras Fault meets the Hayward Fault near the Calaveras Reservoir and can also produce large earthquakes. Except for a ~M6.5 shock that occurred in 1911, the central and southern segments might only produce smaller events and fault creep.|$|E

5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the <b>eastern</b> <b>region.</b> Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E

5|$|The former <b>Eastern</b> <b>Region</b> {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined {{largely because the}} plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E
5|$|The {{heyday of}} the line was between 1923, when the GCR was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and 1948, when the LNER was nationalised to form the British Rail <b>Eastern</b> <b>Region.</b> As a result, many prestigious locomotives, such as Flying Scotsman, Sir Nigel Gresley, and Mallard which ran on the East Coast Main Line, were {{frequent}} visitors to the line. Special trains ran {{on the line to}} destinations such as Scotland. The station's busiest use came after the construction of Wembley Stadium in 1923, when it was used to contain large crowds wishing to see the FA Cup Final. Special services ran from Marylebone to the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotive}} {{classes were}} all pre-chosen by BR, but the various regions {{were free to}} choose, within certain parameters, which specific locomotives were to be represented.

To drive the engine throughout, the LMR chose driver Byford from Camden shed who was seen to be sufficiently experienced. City of Bradford was then tested on its home ground between London Euston and Carlisle, on the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Region</b> (ER) between London Kings Cross and Leeds, on the Western Region (WR) between London Paddington and Plymouth, then finally on the Southern Region (SR) between London Waterloo and Exeter.|$|E
