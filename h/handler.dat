In her pre-game run Ralphie ran perfectly, but slipped out of her harness at the very start of the halftime run, bumping, but not trampling, one <b>handler</b> and shedding all but one of her other handlers. Zeb Kopasz was the only <b>handler</b> to hold on to her. They were able to get her under control on the far 25-yard line and return her to her trailer.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the <b>handler.</b> Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.|$|E

For non-blocking <b>handlers,</b> an implementation model whereby all heap-using <b>handlers</b> are serviced by a single thread and all no-heap <b>handlers</b> are serviced by another server thread is proposed and schedulability analysis is derived. The model is shown to have bounded priority inversion. General multiple-server models are needed for nonblocking <b>handlers</b> but the support in the RTSJ is criticised as lacking in configurability. A solution is proposed which allow the number of servers to be specified, and the allocation of <b>handlers</b> to servers to be controlled...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} 10 years, the {{influence}} of the dog–owner relationship on dog behaviour has received growing attention, unlike the working dog <b>handler's</b> relationship. Using a questionnaire addressed to the 430 dog <b>handlers</b> of the Belgian army in 2001 (303 respondents), this study investigated the association between the time spent by <b>handlers</b> with their military dog (MD) and some behaviours of these dogs, reflecting welfare, obedience, and aggressiveness. Less than half of the <b>handlers</b> took their MD home and/or practised a sport with their MD. Most of the <b>handlers</b> practising sport with their MD also took their animal home. Statistically significant associations were detected. Obedience of MDs was clearly greater in MDs living at their <b>handler's</b> home and in MDs practising sport. On the contrary, we found no influence on obedience either for the first time <b>handlers</b> or for their length of service. <b>Handlers</b> taking their MD home and <b>handlers</b> practising sport with their MD declared fewer bites than the other <b>handlers</b> did. Bites concerned almost exclusively military staff. Only one family member was bitten by an MD and this MD had been left in a military kennel. Suspicion of previous rough handling was associated with fearful and aggressive behaviours. <b>Handlers</b> taking their MD home had dogs that were more sociable, this was not evidenced for MDs practising sport. Finally, being taken to a <b>handler's</b> home and practising sport were associated with a lower expression of behaviours indicative of impaired welfare. Discussion of our results in the field of dog-human relationship leads to conclude that the effects of housing at a <b>handler's</b> home and practising sport were strongly linked to the enhanced dog–handler relationship...|$|R

40|$|The Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) {{is silent}} on {{multiprocessor}} issues. It attempts not to preclude multiprocessor implementations but provides no direct support. Many {{areas of the}} RTSJ leave an implementation considerable freedom on how it provides the defined functionality. One such area is the asynchronous event handling (AEH) model. Events are fired and associated <b>handlers</b> are scheduled for execution in response; <b>handlers</b> have defined scheduling parameters and deadlines. The primary goal of the AEH model is to support a lightweight real-time concurrency model. Hence <b>handlers,</b> in general, do not have dedicated threads. Rather, the implementation is responsible for ensuring that all <b>handlers</b> meet their deadlines. Typically real-time threads are assigned to execute <b>handlers</b> by the implementation. This paper discusses the issues associated with implementing the AEH model on multiprocessor systems. The emphasis here is on achieving a lightweight model. A model is lightweight if {{it is able to}} meet the deadlines of all <b>handlers</b> with as few as possible real-time threads. In the RTSJ this is made more complicated because asynchronous event <b>handlers</b> are allowed to suspend themselves (for example, by waiting on a monitor condition). Such <b>handlers</b> are called blocking <b>handlers.</b> Most of an implementation’s freedom comes from being able to optimize the support for those <b>handlers</b> that do not block.

50|$|Art <b>handlers</b> and preparators {{are first}} and {{foremost}} responsible for ensuring the safety of artifacts and works of art. For works traveling out of a gallery or museum, art <b>handlers</b> must carefully pack objects in crates with appropriate materials {{to protect them from}} damage while in transit. Some objects may require custom boxes or custom crates that art <b>handlers</b> and preparators might construct on site. Similarly, when objects come into a gallery or museum, art <b>handlers</b> must carefully unpack the objects, paying close attention to how they were originally packed and arranged in their container. Art <b>handlers</b> and preparators also load and unload crates from trucks. When loading crates and packages inside an art transportation truck, art <b>handlers</b> and preparators must be sure to secure the crates and packages to the walls and floor of the truck storage area to prevent any type of movement during transit. Art <b>handlers</b> may also act as a courier, accompanying the object during its transport and being present during its unpacking at the destination. Sometimes art <b>handlers</b> and preparators are responsible for preparing packing and shipping paperwork.|$|R
50|$|A {{topic of}} {{controversy}} in the art handling field is the fair treatment of art <b>handlers.</b> Some art <b>handlers</b> wish to be represented by unions in order to negotiate terms and advocate for better wages and better working conditions.

40|$|International audienceImplicit {{invocation}} languages, like aspect-oriented languages, automate the Observer pattern, which decouples subjects (base code) from <b>handlers</b> (advice), {{and then}} compound {{them together in}} the final system. For such languages, event types have been proposed {{as a way of}} further decoupling subjects from <b>handlers.</b> In Ptolemy, subjects explicitly announce events at certain program points, and pass the announced piece of code to the <b>handlers</b> for its eventual execution. This implies a mutual dependency between subjects and <b>handlers</b> that should be considered in verification; i. e., verification of subject code should consider the <b>handlers</b> and vice versa. However, in Ptolemy the event type defines only one obligation that both the <b>handlers</b> and the announced piece of code must satisfy. This limits the flexibility and completeness of verification in Ptolemy. That is, some correct programs cannot be verified due to specification mismatches between the announced code and the handlers’ code. For example, when the announced code does not satisfy the specification of the entire event and <b>handlers</b> must make up the difference, or when the announced code has no effect, imposing a monotonic behavior on the <b>handlers.</b> In this paper we propose an extension to the specification features of Ptolemy that explicitly separates the specification of the <b>handlers</b> from the specification of the announced code.

40|$|Aspect-oriented {{languages}} are usually formulated {{as an extension}} to existing languages, without paying any {{special attention to the}} underlying exception handling mechanisms. Consequently, aspect exceptions and <b>handlers</b> are no different than base exceptions and <b>handlers.</b> Conflation between aspect and base exceptions and <b>handlers</b> may inadvertently trigger execution of unintended <b>handlers,</b> changing the expected program behavior: aspect exceptions are accidentally caught by base <b>handlers</b> or vice-versa. Programmers cannot state the desired interaction between aspect and base exceptions and <b>handlers.</b> Specific instances of this issue have been identified by others researchers. We distill the essence of the problem and designate it as the exception conflation problem. Consequently, we propose a semantics for an aspect-oriented language with execution levels and an exception handling mechanism that solves the exception conflation problem. By default, the language ensures there is no interaction between base and aspect exceptions and <b>handlers,</b> and provides level-shifting operators to flexibly specify interaction between them when required.
