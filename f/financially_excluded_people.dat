It seeks to promote social upliftment through participation and contribution. The broader goal of Samanvay is to promote financial literacy and to expand the coverage of financial services to all sections of the population. Samanvay 2010 served the purpose of creating awareness through discussions and presentations as well as creating familiarity with the financial system by assisting the <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>people</b> of nearby villages in opening bank accounts and availing of accident insurance.

40|$|The {{access to}} basic {{financial}} services for disadvantaged groups {{is regarded as}} a prerequisite for reducing poverty and catalyzing the engines of economic development. Hence, financial inclusion becomes very important. Though the govern-ment and RBI have taken several steps to improve the supply side of financial inclusion, these measures will not work without adequate demand for financial inclusion. The demand for financial inclusion means the need and use of the same from the people in terms of the need to open a savings account or the need to avail the credit facilities from the formal fi-nancial channel available. The only way {{to keep up with the}} economic growth is to ensure that the capital formation is always on track. This capital will be generated only when the savings of the large masses will be mobilized. Since Accessi-bility is the most influential factor of the demand for financial inclusion the RBI should take some measures that will make financial services more accessible to those who are <b>financially</b> <b>excluded.</b> The <b>people</b> should be made aware of the availa-ble facilities and its related advantages to make use of our financial system for their betterment and also for the nation’s betterment. This paper intends to explore into financial access which plays a pivotal role in understanding the progress of financial inclusion. The research highlights that there are various reasons for low level of access which needs to be taken care of to achieve better and faster growth with respect to financial inclusion.

40|$|Mobile money {{business}} is a new phenomenon, which has transformed {{the lives of the}} previously <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> poor <b>people</b> especially in developing nations. The industry is continuing to grow rapidly, with increased business success stories being recorded. The {{purpose of this study was}} to make an assessment of the factors influencing the growth in market share of mobile money in the Zimbabwean mobile phone providers. The motivation of this study is to give insights to current players and new players entering such an industry, so that they are able to be in a position to make informed strategic decisions. The study adopted a quantitative deductive research approach and survey design, in which the Harare CBD agents from the three mobile network providers constituted the population of the study. A combination of stratified and simple random sampling methods was used to select the agents. Stratified random sampling was selected to allow agents from all the operators to have the opportunity of being sampled. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS). The results revealed that all the factors influence the growth in market share of mobile money, among the factors analysed such as the strong financial resource, customer base, strong agent network, network coverage and pricing strategy, the factor with the greatest influence was the financial resource factor, and the least was network coverage. It is recommended that the Central bank, RBZ and POTRAZ should put a regulatory framework in place for the mobile payment system to curb against monopoly and anti-competitive agreements in this industry. The study also recommended that mobile operators who are in this industry or who may wish to venture into this industry be financially sound as the business needs a lot of investment in terms of customer acquisition, agent training and management, network coverage, without which there is no growth in market share in the mobile money business...|$|R
40|$|Microfinance (MF) {{has grown}} {{over the last}} two decades into an {{important}} sub-field of development studies. This special issue of Oxford Development Studies explores the contributions of MF, drawing particularly on research conducted in India. After a brief overview of the emergence of MF as a research field, this introduction develops three themes. First, we argue that MF interventions generally involve, and assume a process of transformation of, <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>people</b> and groups who are not fully dominated by the logic of market exchange but have histories, culture, social relationships and politics structured by other kinds of authority and dynamics. Second, we argue that understanding MF interventions at the local level requires the social and political analysis of global development architecture, while MF may also play a role in consolidating or cementing global political economy at its base. Third, we argue that MF interventions have provided fertile ground for research into the causes and consequences of poverty.

30|$|Exclusion {{from the}} {{mainstream}} financial world is a burden on the poor of many countries. The proliferation of new mobile and online financial services, such as e-banking, money transfers, and payment processing {{has the potential to}} provide access to basic financial products and services to <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>people.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of the growth of mobile phone and Internet use on financial inclusion in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries from 2004 to 2014. We applied principal component analysis to construct a financial inclusion index that served as a proxy variable for the accessibility of financial services in the SAARC countries. Using three different models-the fixed effect, random effect, and panel correction standard errors models-this study discovered a positive and significant relationship between the growth of financial inclusion and expansion of both mobile phone and Internet services. Moreover, an empirical study of the control variables showed that the levels of income and education were positively associated with financial inclusion, whereas the size of the rural population and unemployment were negatively related to financial inclusion. In addition, the empirical estimates posit a unidirectional causal flow from the growth of mobile and Internet services to expanded financial inclusion in the SAARC countries.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reviews the}} UK's {{progress}} towards financial inclusion, and develops an evidence-based vision for achieving financial inclusion over a ten-year timeframe. The Personal Finance Research Centre, in close collaboration with Friends Provident Foundation, conducted the research. Financial inclusion {{policy and practice}} {{has come a long}} way since Policy Action Team 14 's landmark report in 1999. Other countries, in Europe and elsewhere, continue to look to the UK as a leader in this field. We cannot afford to be complacent, however. Financial exclusion remains an issue in the UK for a sizeable minority of people, worst affecting those on low incomes who may also be vulnerable in other ways. Financial services are an essential part of everyday life. People who face difficulties accessing and using financial services experience real detriment - in terms of the monetary costs of financial exclusion, but also the social and psychological costs of feeling excluded from mainstream society. People need financial services that enable them to manage day-to-day financial transactions, such as receiving income, paying bills and buying goods. In addition there are a number of different needs that <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>people</b> may have to deal with periodically. The first of these is the need to meet one-off expenses that can be anticipated, such as family holidays and Christmas expenses. The second relates to less predictable expenses or events, such as burglary or white goods breaking down.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} needs society has in 2012 is addressing {{the plight of the}} 4 billion people, globally, who live {{at the bottom of the}} economic pyramid. Unless initiatives are undertaken to alleviate poverty and hardship in this portion of society, human potential will be wasted and the economic burden on the rest of society to support them will remain significant. In South Africa a significant portion of the population live at the bottom of the pyramid. One initiative to alleviate poverty and hardship is to enable bottom of the pyramid people who are excluded from formal financial services to access to them. By accessing formal financial services they would be able to safely save and borrow money. They would also be able to escape exploitative informal financial practices. Technology has the potential to expand access to financial services and reduce the cost of service provision. To date, however, it has not delivered on its promise of expanding financial inclusion at the bottom of the pyramid. Intermediaries, too, have been used to increase access to financial services but have also not successfully expanded financial inclusion at the bottom of the pyramid. Understanding which factors would allow these approaches to realize their potential has the ability to meaningfully contribute to addressing the plight of people at the bottom of the pyramid. This study brings together the potential of technology and the role of intermediaries to model expanding financial inclusion at the bottom of the pyramid in South Africa. The Technology Acceptance Model is used as a basis to propose an extended TAM model that explains adoption of technology enabled financial services through an intermediary at the bottom of the pyramid in South Africa. The proposed model is validated using structural equation modelling with data collected in a national survey in South Africa. The extended TAM model successfully explains more than 90 % of the behavioural intention of <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>people</b> at the bottom of the pyramid to adopt financial services through an intermediary. Using the findings, a strategic approach to expanding financial inclusion at the bottom of the pyramid is proposed. Thesis (PhD(Eng)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

40|$|The {{inclusive}} {{nature of}} the Grameen Bank (GB) model and its effectiveness in addressing issues of poverty and financial exclusion in developing countries are widely recognised. However, its efficacy as a strategy in advanced economies remains under-researched. More so, {{there appears to be}} no study undertaken exploring the possibility to establish a microfinance social business enterprise in the Australian socioeconomic context. The current circumstances of the Australian economy, and policies being pursued to manage it, have made this research all the more important. Australia is regarded as a wealthy country and has experienced about two decades of continuous economic prosperity, spurred by a mining boom (Das, 2013). However, not all Australians have benefited equally from the wealth that has been created. As a so-called welfare economy, Australia has institutionalised a comprehensive safety net programme (SNP) as the principal strategy for supporting the relatively low-income population. With an estimated 20 % people below the 60 % median poverty line (Dorsch et al., 2016 : 11), 17 % of adult population (Connolly, 2014 b: 5) <b>financially</b> <b>excluded,</b> and about one-third of the total labour force of the country on part-time and casual employment, the need for an alternative strategy to connect the unemployed and underemployed low-income working age Australians to the economic value chain is an imperative. Approximately, one-third of the Federal budget is committed for SNP. Notwithstanding, the gradual slowing down of the economy exacerbated by the fallout from the global financial crisis, the management of the Australian economy has come under increasing scrutiny. The global microfinance movement, inspired by the example of GB, motivated the Australian Government to establish a Community Development Finance Pilot in 2009, and a Social Enterprise Development and Investment Fund in 2010, to explore fair and affordable financial services for the <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> low-income individuals. A burgeoning of microfinance organisations: not for profit companies (i. e. benevolent or charity entities), unincorporated entities, and credit unions, supported by the Government and corporates, populate the microfinance sector. Despite reported positive social and economic impact, Australian microfinance organisations are found to be financially nonviable over the medium-to-long-term, providing mostly consumer loans as opposed to microenterprise loans for self-employment, and serving only a small number of <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> low-income <b>people.</b> The sector is essentially at the crossroads. Against this backdrop, this thesis investigates the replicability of microfinance social business model of GB in Australia. Adopting a qualitative paradigm with a constructivist epistemology, this research assumes the theoretical perspective of phenomenology which espouses that the construction of meaning and its effectiveness are the results of individual experiences of a phenomenon. In this instance, microfinance practices in different sociocultural settings are explained from everyday experiences of practitioners, clients and broader stakeholders who are directly and indirectly impacted by microfinance operations. This thesis involves three inter-related studies. Study 1 is an evaluation of the suitability of establishing a microfinance social business in Australia. The study is supported by a poverty and inequality mapping and a critical analysis of the existing microfinance market and its nature. Respectively, Studies 2 and 3 are exploratory and explanatory case studies of GB in Bangladesh, and its replication, Grameen America (GA) in the USA. The GA model investigated from the perspective of examining the process of adaptation of the GB paradigm in a developed economy with similar socioeconomic characteristics to that of Australia. Supported by multiple sources of extant literature, all the three studies used primary data obtained through semi-structured interviews of microfinance practitioners and stakeholders. Institutional theory and contingency theory of organisations provide the theoretical lenses through which complexities of society, institutions, and the underlying dynamics of the growth are viewed. These two theories helped to explain the adaptation process of GB replication across different social and economic contexts. Study 1 identified a potential market for microfinance social business in Australia. A number of institutional and legal barriers were identified, and an apparent institutional anathema to undertaking social-collateral microfinancing model was investigated and explained. The case studies of GB and GA illustrated socioeconomic and regulatory challenges in their respective countries, and demonstrated the process of adapting and responding to both institutional and noninstitutional factors. The cross-country findings of the three studies highlighted the contextual differences, adaptation strategies, and identified the key attributes necessary for the foundation of a potential microfinance social business model for Australia. This thesis has a number of implications for theory, policy, and practice in the implementation of inclusive and socially relevant microfinance social business enterprises in the Australian context. The research contributes to the theoretical understanding of microfinance as a social business from the perspectives of design and delivery system; GB model&rsquo;s conflict with the precepts condoning the solely profit-driven non-inclusive growth paradigm; distributive justice and equity in lending; and culminates in the development of a conceptual framework of a microfinance social business for consideration and application in different socioeconomic and regulatory environments...|$|R

30|$|The {{vulnerability}} of farmers in Sub Saharan Africa to {{the adverse effects}} of climate change has been recognized by several studies (IPCC 2007, 2012, Boko et al. 2007, World Bank 2008, 2012). The financial innovations aimed at increasing the access of farmers to financial services as an adaptive strategy have been identified by several studies (see Siegel and Alwang 2005, Schneider and Gugerty 2011, Sanfo and Gérard 2012, World Bank 2012). However, the empirical evidence examining whether the various financial services benefit mostly poor and <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> farmers remains scarce. The agriculture in West Africa is largely rain-fed, hence, vulnerable to flood and drought. With over 70 % of the West African population depending on agriculture, weather shocks severely affect rural livelihood (MeheRette 2009). Although climate risk management strategies are useful for minimizing risk and taming vulnerabilities (Vargas-Hill and Torrero 2009), financial markets (both insurance and credit markets) in West Africa are often underdeveloped, with over 80 % of the population being <b>financially</b> <b>excluded.</b> According to Adesina (2012), despite accounting for 44 % of the GDP, the agricultural sector only receives 2 % of the total loans by commercial banks in Nigeria. Unfortunately, the high demands for collateral by banks, lack of capacity to develop appropriate credit instruments for agriculture, high perceived risks of lending to this sector, and general aversion of banks toward agriculture have led to the under-capitalization of the agricultural sector.|$|R
40|$|Financial {{inclusion}} measures {{initiated in}} India to contain financial abandonment have hardly taken the demand side factors at grass roots level into consideration. The authorities of imple-mentation, including the Reserve Bank of India, {{operate under the}} presumption that the finan-cial inclusion initiatives have trickled down automatically to the lowest administrative unit at village level and have brought respite {{into the lives of}} the hitherto <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> sections. However, reality on the ground is entirely different and the situation remains unchanged. Since these measures have had hadly any impct on the <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> sections of society, the inci-dence of financial abandonment remains unchanged at the lowest administrative unit. Surpris-ingly, people at the grass root level are not familiar and have not even heard about the financial inclusion measures. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect the necessary change to occur in the ab-sence of any financial institution, like commercial bank or cooperative society at lowest adminis-tration unit level. Also, the conspicuous absence of rural credit cooperative societies and self-help group organizations has further worsened the situation in rural areas. This paper, besides identifying the failures of the financial inclusion measures {{from the perspective of the}} lowest ad-ministrative unit, attempts to bring the demand side factors to the forefront, including the busi-ness potential that exists for financial institutions, and effective administration of financial serv-ices by the formal financial system and other newly emerged institutions like self-help groups...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{correlation}} between financial exclusion and financial education and whether it can be better tackled through online education. The proposition is that financial exclusion is a complex and diverse phenomenon and that the link of low financial literacy levels in <b>people</b> who are <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> is an interesting explanation as to why exclusion occurs. This paper recognises that there are many reasons why <b>people</b> are <b>financially</b> <b>excluded</b> but this paper focuses on just one element of this, that being the lack of financial education. The paper goes further than recognising the link between financial education and financial exclusion and determines that in the modern technical world, online education, or virtual education could offer a solution to the educational gap that is often found by those in financial education. Therefore the paper is divided into three parts. The first is to explore what financial exclusion is. The second is to examine the empirical findings of research conducted by the researcher and then finally the paper explores financial education in a virtual medium. The paper does not proffer that virtual learning is a panacea for financial exclusion but merely offers a possible additional tool in tackling the phenomenon. This is especially important in times when the banking industry is under going major reform in the hope that financial education does not get forgotten amongst the policy reform objectives...|$|R
