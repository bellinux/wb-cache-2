5|$|In 1990, Nine Inch Nails {{began the}} Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series, {{in which they}} toured North America as an opening act for {{alternative}} rock artists such as Peter Murphy and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Reznor began smashing <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> while on stage; Rockbeat interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The AM-1Q was {{developed}} for electronic countermeasures (ECM) duties. The fuselage fuel tank was removed {{to make room for}} the ECM operator and <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> in a windowless compartment. The aircraft carried several radio and radar receivers, transmitters and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of chaff through a chute to block radar signals.|$|E

Olivia and Peter depart {{to try to find}} Hoffman, while Walter remains behind, examining Hoffman's equipment.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, the player character's {{parachute}} fails to open. Awakening hours later, the character finds almost all <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> inoperable. Reaching the pyramid on foot {{hours after the}} rest of the team entered the structure, the player must complete the team's mission before the god awakens in five days. In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of Spanish-speaking treasure hunters, and fallen members of a Nazi expedition from the 1930s who were looking for a secret weapon but never returned. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by an item attainable early in the game, the yellow crystal.|$|E

50|$|Samuelson {{went through}} several {{iterations}} of <b>equipment</b> in <b>his</b> quest to ski on water. <b>His</b> first <b>equipment</b> consisted of barrel staves for skis. He later tried snow skis, but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather. The ski rope {{was made from}} a long window sash cord. Samuelson never patented any of <b>his</b> ski <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 1985 Indianapolis 500, he {{was passed}} {{for the lead}} by Danny Sullivan in Turn One on lap 139. Immediately after {{completing}} the pass, Sullivan spun in front of Andretti. A caution for the spin, minimized the time Sullivan would lose to Andretti by pitting to replace 20 laps later Sullivan took the lead for good when he passed Andretti without incident. Andretti dominated the 1987 Indianapolis 500, leading 170 of the first 177 laps of the race. His lead was so large, that he was advised to slow his pace to preserve <b>his</b> <b>equipment.</b> In a cruel twist of fate, when Andretti started running slower, his reduced engine rpm's created a harmonic imbalance in his turbocharged Ilmor/Chevrolet V8 {{that led to a}} broken valve spring with 20 laps to go.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March, {{with the}} ship at 84°4′N, the pair finally began their polar march. This was their third attempt to leave the ship; on 26 February and again on the 28th, damage to sledges had forced them to return after {{travelling}} short distances. After these mishaps Nansen thoroughly overhauled <b>his</b> <b>equipment,</b> minimised the travelling stores, recalculated weights and reduced the convoy to three sledges, before giving the order to start again. A supporting party accompanied the pair and shared the first night's camp. The next day, Nansen and Johansen skied on alone.|$|E
5|$|Other attractions {{that closed}} {{at about the}} same time as the zoo {{included}} the boating on Firework Lake, and the miniature railway. In 1979 the amusement park was leased to the main concessionaire, Alf Wadbrooke, although by then it was only open at weekends during the summer season. The long-promised restoration of the Scenic Railway had not happened and the Water Chute had closed. In August 1980, Wadbrooke was given notice to close down the park by 26October 1980 and to have all <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> removed by February 1981.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} bassist for Anthem, which renamed to Anthym, {{was deemed}} unsatisfactory, so Slovak began teaching Flea to play bass. Following {{several months of}} commitment to the instrument, Flea developed proficiency and a strong musical chemistry with Slovak. When Strassman saw Flea playing Anthym songs on <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> he quit the band, with Flea quickly replacing him. Shortly afterwards Anthym entered a local Battle of the Bands contest and won second place. Anthym started to play at local nightclubs, {{despite the fact that}} the members were all underage. After graduating from high school, the band changed their name to What Is This?. Flea left Anthym around this time to accept an offer of playing bass in the prominent L.A. punk band Fear. What Is This? continued on and performed many shows along the California coast.|$|E
5|$|The two {{meet up with}} Sallah in Hatay, {{where they}} learn of Marcus's abduction. The Nazis are already moving toward the Grail's location, using the map possessed by Marcus. In {{exchange}} for a Rolls-Royce, the Sultan of Hatay has given the Nazis full access to <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> for the expedition, including a large tank. Indy, Henry, and Sallah find the Nazi expedition, which is ambushed by the Brotherhood. During the battle, Henry is captured by SS Colonel Ernst Vogel while attempting to rescue Marcus from the tank; Kazim and his comrades are killed. The younger Jones pursues the tank on horseback and, {{with the aid of}} Sallah, saves Henry and Marcus. He is then caught up in a fight with Vogel, and barely escapes before the tank goes over a cliff, crushing Vogel to death.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} running jokes {{throughout}} the series. Established in Goldfinger is Q's continuing disgust at how <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> is often lost, {{damaged or destroyed}} by Bond during missions. Another is how easily distracted Bond is in the lab ("Now pay attention") as Q rattles off details {{about the use of}} the equipment which Bond needs to commit to memory. Another part of the customary byplay between Q and Bond is Bond's amused reaction to the latest devices and the Quartermaster's indignant response ("I never joke about my work"). There are also sight gags showing prototype equipment. In the field, however, Bond always remembers the details and takes full advantage of the tools supplied.|$|E

50|$|In his seventy-second year he {{commenced}} {{to study}} Turkish, {{and started for}} the East on 15 June 1858. After some work in Constantinople, and while waiting for <b>his</b> <b>equipments</b> and tents to proceed to the interior of Asia Minor, Yeardley was smitten with paralysis at Isnik, and was compelled to return to England, where he died on 11 August 1858. He was buried at Stoke Newington on the 18th.|$|R
5|$|Walter sets up <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> on {{the frozen}} ice of Reiden Lake, near a cabin where Elizabeth and Peter are staying; Walter theorizes the frozen waters will buffer {{the effects of the}} crossing. Carla arrives with Nina, and both try {{to talk him out of}} it. When Walter realizes William is not with them, he takes this as an {{implicit}} sign of William's consent to his plan, and activates the portal. Nina attempts to tackle Walter as he steps through, but instead part of her arm disappears in the portal as it closes; Carla rushes her to the hospital.|$|E
5|$|While {{clearing}} <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> {{from the}} craft the drill operator triggers more poltergeist activity, {{and runs through}} the streets in a panic until he finds sanctuary in a church. Quatermass and Roney find him there, and he describes visions of the insect aliens killing each other. As Quatermass investigates {{the history of the}} area, he finds accounts dating back to medieval times about devils and ghosts, all centred on incidents where the ground was disturbed. He suspects a psychic projection of these beings has remained on the alien ship and is being seen by those who come into contact with it.|$|E
5|$|At the Penitentiary, Quinn {{releases}} Poison Ivy {{from her}} cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production {{facility in the}} Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that {{it can only be}} made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy <b>his</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
60|$|With these prepossessions in his favor, when we {{consider}} Washington's noble person and demeanor, his consummate horsemanship, the admirable horses he was accustomed to ride, and the aristocratical style of <b>his</b> <b>equipments,</b> we may imagine the effect produced by himself and his little cavalcade, as they clattered {{through the streets of}} Philadelphia, and New York, and Boston. It is needless to say, their sojourn in each city was a continual fête.|$|R

5000|$|Perry {{was known}} for his {{eccentric}} and superstitious behavior during production sessions. He would often [...] "bless" [...] <b>his</b> recording <b>equipment</b> with mystical invocations, blow ganja smoke onto his tapes while recording, bury unprotected tapes in the soil outside of his studio, and surround himself with burning candles and incense, whose wax and dust remnants were allowed to infest <b>his</b> electronic recording <b>equipment.</b> He would also spray tapes with a variety of fluids, including urine, blood and whisky, ostensibly to enhance their spiritual properties. Later commentators have drawn a direct relationship between the decay of Perry's facility and the unique sounds he was able to create from <b>his</b> studio <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
5|$|Brean Down is a {{promontory}} {{marking the}} eastern end of the bay. Made of carboniferous limestone, it is a continuation of the Mendip Hills, and two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. It is owned by the National Trust, and is rich in wildlife, history and archaeology, as well as being a Site of Special Scientific Interest in its own right. It is bounded by steep cliffs and, at its seaward point, Brean Down Fort built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War. There is evidence of an Iron Age hill fort, prehistoric barrows, field systems and a pagan shrine. The shrine dating from pre-Roman times was re-established as a Romano-Celtic style temple in the mid-4th century and probably succeeded by a small late-4th century Christian oratory. In 1897, following wireless transmissions from Lavernock Point in Wales to Flat Holm, Guglielmo Marconi moved <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> to Brean Down and set a new distance record for wireless transmission.|$|E
5|$|Since 1888, when Mahdist rebels {{forced the}} {{evacuation}} of then governor Emin Pasha, the Lado Enclave had been occupied by rebels {{under the leadership of}} Emir Arabi Dafalla. Rejaf was their strongest fortified position in the area, and it was there Arabi Dafalla stationed <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> and soldiers. The establishment of Mahdist Sudan had provided the context for European powers to commence the invasion and colonization of the Sudan, in which King Leopold desperately wanted to take part in order to expand his Congolese empire. However, a direct military campaign into the area was not an option; Leopold {{would not have been able}} to get permission from either the French or the British according to the rules laid out in the 1884 Berlin Conference, especially considering both nations were looking to annex the Sudan themselves. King Leopold II therefore decided to disguise his campaign into the Sudan as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim the Lado Enclave from the Mahdists, although he inended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past the boundaries of Belgian territory, first to Fashoda and then on to Khartoum. After receiving a new loan of 6.5 million francs from the Belgian government in 1895, Leopold ordered preparations to be made for the execution of his plan.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{takes place}} during the events of Human Revolution: after staging an {{explosion}} in the docks of Hengsha, Adam Jensen smuggles himself on board a ship bound for a secret research base inside a cryosleep pod. Adam is discovered and captured aboard the ship. Two Belltower commanders, Pieter Burke and Netanya Keitner, torture him for information on his identity. After the EMP chair holding him captive mysteriously deactivates, Adam is able to retrieve <b>his</b> <b>equipment</b> {{with the help of an}} unknown hacker who contacts him via radio. The ship docks at Rifleman Bank Station, a seaborne regional Belltower supply hub. After escaping into the station, Adam discovers that it was Keitner who set him free. Disillusioned with the unethical nature of local Belltower operations, she wants Adam to find concrete proof of illegal research that she can use to deliver to Interpol. She also instructs Adam to obtain weaponry from Garvin Quinn, resident technician and black market weapons trader.|$|E
