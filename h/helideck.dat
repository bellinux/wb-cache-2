40|$|The Institute of Flight Guidance of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Braunschweig is {{involved}} in the EU project OPTIMAL. One of the objectives was to demonstrate the rotorcraft system’s 4 D flight guidance capabilities. For these advanced interoperability flight trials the FHS (Flying Helicopter Simulator) – the highly modified Eurocopter EC 135 T 1 research helicopter from DLR - is equipped with an SBAS receiver and a special 4 D-capable experimental rotorcraft flight management system (FMS) using also a 4 D referenced flight guidance. SBAS offers a performance comparable to an ILS CAT I without requiring any specific installation on ground and consequently is well adapted to rotorcraft IFR operations at isolated helipads like for example hospitals or <b>helidecks.</b> In the framework of the flight trials the practical flyability of the helicopter-specific steep and curved time referenced IFR approach procedure should be confirmed. The approach procedures were initially developed for Bremen airport (EDDW). Vertical guidance allows a precise height control throughout the final descent and reduces the risk of collision with terrain at night or in bad weather conditions. Approaches with vertical guidance are known as being much safer than laterally guided NPAs referring to worldwide aircraft accident statistics. The paper will provide an analysis of the flight results which promise very good navigation accuracies regarding time-based 4 D-curved approaches. The Flight Technical Error (FTE) denotes the ability of the pilot to follow the displayed guidance indications. Furthermore, the paper illustrates the evaluation of SBAS positioning data, the HMI solution based on a head-down primary flight display (PFD) incorporating with a “tunnel-in-the-sky”-style visualization and the Advanced Flight Management System...|$|R

2500|$|The second {{gas line}} {{ruptured}} (the riser for the MCP-01 platform), ejecting millions of {{cubic feet of}} gas into the conflagration and increased its intensity. Huge flames shot over [...] in the air. The Tharos was driven off by the fearsome heat, which began to melt the surrounding machinery and steelwork. It was only after this explosion that the Claymore platform stopped pumping oil. [...] Personnel still left alive were either desperately sheltering in the scorched, smoke-filled accommodation block or leaping from the various deck levels, including the <b>helideck,</b> [...] into the North Sea. The explosion also killed two crewmen on a fast rescue boat launched from the standby vessel Sandhaven and the six Piper Alpha crewmen they had rescued from the water.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2015, Arctia Shipping {{announced}} that Otso has been chartered to an unnamed client to support seismic surveys in the Arctic {{for two years}} with an option of two additional years. The vessel will be upgraded for service in the northern latitudes by increasing her ice strengthening, now adequate for icebreaking in the Baltic Sea, to Polar Class 4 (PC-4) which is intended for vessels operating year-round in thick first-year ice which may include old ice inclusions. Furthermore, a [...] anti-rolling tank will be installed to improve her open water characteristics. Other additions include lifeboats to allow unrestricted worldwide service {{as well as a}} new <b>helideck.</b> The modifications, scheduled to be completed by July 2015, will be carried out by Rauma Marine Constructions. After the summer season in the Arctic, Otso will return to the Baltic Sea icebreaking duty by November as mandated by the icebreaking contract between Arctia Shipping and the Finnish Transport Agency.|$|E

50|$|Project 21900 icebreakers Moskva and Sankt-Peterburg are 114 m long {{overall and}} have a moulded breadth of 27.5 m. While Project 21900M icebreakers Vladivostok, Murmansk and Novorossiysk are {{slightly}} longer at 119.8 m, {{they have the same}} beam as well as the same design draught, 8.5 m, which corresponds to a displacement of about 10,000 tons.

5000|$|On December 28, 2016, a S-92 (registration G-WNSR, {{serial number}} 920250) {{operated}} by CHC Helicopter experienced [...] "unexpected control responses" [...] whilst in mid-air {{on a routine}} shuttle flight between two oil installations in the North Sea. The pilots conducted an emergency landing on the West Franklin platform. The helicopter {{is reported to have}} spun on the <b>helideck</b> during the landing, damaging the helicopter wheels and rotor blades. The <b>helideck</b> also sustained damage during the emergency landing. There were no reported injuries amongst the nine passengers and two crew during the incident. The aircraft was transported back to Aberdeen via ship, at which time the Air Accidents Investigation Branch began their investigation into the incident. Sikorsky issued a notice on January 9, 2017 grounding all S-92 aircraft until the tail rotors have been inspected. The inspection work takes approximately 11 man hours to complete. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch issued an update on January 11, 2017 which reported that the tail rotor pitch change shaft bearing had seized. The bearing showed signs of severe overheating and significant wear. The failure of the bearing allowed the tail rotor driveshaft to damage the tail rotor servo. The damage to the tail rotor servo is considered to be the cause of tail rotor control. The health and usage monitoring systems had discovered the flaw the day before flight, but the maintenance crew had not.|$|E
50|$|In May 1998, the Polar Duke was rebuilt by its Norwegian owner, Rieber Shipping, as a {{seismic survey}} vessel, {{extending}} the aft superstructure and converting the <b>helideck</b> {{to a regular}} deck. It was assigned to a Rieber subsidiary, Exploration Vessel Resources, which was spun off in 2005 and acquired later that year by CGG, which {{is now part of}} CGGVeritas. It was renamed CGG Duke in 2006, and Duke in 2008. The vessel was decommissioned by CGGV in 2009, was reflagged to the Bahamas, and is currently operated by Gardline CGGV, a joint venture between Gardline Geosurvey and CGGVeritas.|$|E
5000|$|A £3 million refit, {{carried out}} by Burgess Marine in Portsmouth, {{provided}} a new aft accommodation module and the [...] "Sky Lounge". The heavy military ramp was replaced with a new stern door and the <b>helideck</b> was removed. Following this, she arrived in Douglas on 11 May 2009. An open day took place {{at each of the}} Company's ports and at a renaming ceremony, she was renamed after Manannán mac Lir, the Celtic god of the Irish sea. Manannan made her maiden service voyage with the Steam Packet Company on Friday 22 May 2009 on the 07:30 sailing from Douglas to Liverpool.|$|E
