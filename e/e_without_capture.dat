40|$|The {{standard}} approach for geologic storage of CO 2 consists of injecting it as a supercritical CO 2 phase. This approach places stringent requirements on the caprock, which must display: (1) high entry pressure {{to prevent the}} buoyancy driven upwards escape of CO 2; (2) low permeability to minimize the upwards flux of brine displaced by the CO 2; and (3) high strength to ensure that pressure build up does not cause caprock failure. We propose an alternative approach for cases when the above requirements are not met. The approach consists of extracting brine from the storage formation and then re-injecting {{it so that it}} mixes with CO 2 at depth in the injection well. Mixing at depth reduces the pressure required for brine and CO 2 at the surface. This CO 2 -saturated brine will sink to the aquifer bottom because it is denser than resident brine, which eliminates the risk of buoyant escape of CO 2. The method is particularly favorable when the aquifer dips, because CO 2 -saturated brine will tend to flow downslope. We perform two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations to study how far upslope the extraction well needs to be located to ensure a very long operation without CO 2 ever breaking through. Several sets of simulations were carried out to evaluate the effect of slope, temperature, pressure and CO 2 concentration, which is significantly reduced if flue gas (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>without</b> <b>capture)</b> is mixed with the brine. We analyze energy requirements to find that the system requires high permeability to be viable, but its performance is improved by taking advantage of the thermal energy of the extracted brine. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
