Religion, they reflected, was all very well, but without mealies they could not live, and without <b>Kaffir</b> <b>corn</b> {{there would be no}} beer. Indeed, metaphorically, before long they passed from murmurs to shouting, and their shouts said this: Menzi must be invited to celebrate a rain-service in his own fashion {{for the benefit of the}} entire tribe.|$|E
60|$|This is {{the season}} of the sowing of crops, and upon the climatic {{conditions}} of the few following weeks depends the yield of the harvest. Should the spring be delayed even a week or two, a short crop would certainly result, but if its arrival is postponed for a month, it means something like a famine during the following winter. For although this people dwell on high lands they cultivate the same sorts of grain which are common in these latitudes, namely maize and sundry varieties of <b>Kaffir</b> <b>corn,</b> having no knowledge of wheat and the other hardy cereals. Therefore, it is all important to them that the corn should have a fair start, for if the autumn frosts catch it before it is fit to harvest the great proportion of the crop turns black and is rendered useless.|$|E
50|$|The county's {{economy has}} {{historically}} been based on agriculture, specifically wheat farming, poultry raising and cattle ranching. Major crops have included corn, wheat, <b>Kaffir</b> <b>corn,</b> broomcorn and alfalfa. The Hallren Poultry and Creamery founded in Fairview in 1936 was the county's largest employer by the late 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{has been}} the {{mainstay}} of the local economy since its founding. The main crops were cotton, corn, wheat, alfalfa, broom corn, and <b>kaffir</b> <b>corn.</b> Poultry and livestock production have also been important. By 1960, Caddo County ranked first in Oklahoma for producing of peanuts, hogs and poultry.|$|E
50|$|The county {{economy has}} {{depended}} on agriculture, which has benefitted {{from the fact}} that it lies above the Ogallala Aquifer. Principal crops have included <b>Kaffir</b> <b>corn,</b> broomcorn, wheat, cotton, corn, and alfalfa. Farms have been consolidating throughout the period since the Great Depression. In 1930, there were 2,353 farms, averaging 278.3 acres each. By 2000, there were 680 farms, averaging 1,015.54 acres each.|$|E
50|$|The county {{economy has}} {{centered}} on agriculture since it began to be settled. Principal crops have included corn, cotton, wheat, broomcorn, <b>Kaffir</b> <b>corn,</b> and oats. Truck farmers {{in the eastern part}} of the county grew tomatoes, watermelons, apples, blackberries, and other small fruits. Livestock (cattle, horses, mules, sheep and goats) raising had become important by the 1930s. These products were still economically important by the turn of the 21st Century.|$|E
50|$|Primary {{industries}} in Garfield County are agriculture and livestock. Historically, crops have included wheat, corn, oats, sorghum, <b>Kaffir</b> <b>corn,</b> and alfalfa. In addition, {{oil and gas}} and flour milling have proved fruitful for the county. The county seat of Enid, Oklahoma has the most grain storage capacity in the United States {{and one of the}} largest grain elevators in the world. Vance Air Force Base is also a major employer in the area of both soldiers and civilians.|$|E
50|$|The {{fourth day}} is the {{greatest}} day of the festival. It has the most revolting features of {{any part of the}} ceremonies. A huge heap of boiled cholam, <b>kaffir</b> <b>corn,</b> is poured out before the goddess and the sacrificed animal is brought. Several rituals are performed after this. When Poleramma's worship is over, a sheep is offered to Potu Razu, and some of the food is poured before him. Prayers are offered to him in order to guard the village and this brings the ceremonies to an end.|$|E

40|$|Citation: Felton, Ray Bonifield. New crops for Kansas. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1904. Introduction: Nature {{works in}} a misterious way her wonders to perform. Often some {{valuable}} tree or cereal will be found in one country or locality only, {{while it may be}} adapted to many parts of the globe because of some particular character. Sometimes certain plants do even better in a new country than in the old country, for instance, the American locust tree does better in Europe than here for there it escapes the borates which so hinders its best developement here. In the last half century the work of transplanting and testing the trees, cereals and grasses of one locality or country in other localities or countries has been carried on to a great extent. In many instances this work has been performed by single individuals. For instance, people coming to this country to settle, often bring with them their favorite apple, cherry or pear. But in the United States by far the greater amount of this work, has been carried on by the department of agriculture with the co-operation of the experiment stations of the different states. The worth of this work cannot well be overestimated. It has transformed the sun burned and dust swept plains of the central west, into comfortable homes surrounded by growing crops. It has brought Kansas the soy bean, <b>kaffir</b> <b>corn,</b> sorghum, wheat and alfalfa...|$|E
