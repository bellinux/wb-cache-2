60|$|The second {{benefit to}} be {{expected}} from giving to women the free use of their faculties, by leaving them the <b>free</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> their <b>employments,</b> and opening to them the same field of occupation and the same prizes and encouragements as to other human beings, would be that of doubling the mass of mental faculties available for the higher service of humanity. Where there is now one person qualified to benefit mankind and promote the general improvement, as a public teacher, or an administrator of some branch of public or social affairs, there would then be a chance of two. Mental superiority of any kind is at present everywhere so much below the demand; {{there is such a}} deficiency of persons competent to do excellently anything which it requires any considerable amount of ability to do; that the loss to the world, by refusing to make use of one-half of the whole quantity of talent it possesses, is extremely serious. It is true that this amount of mental power is not totally lost. Much of it is employed, and would in any case be employed, in domestic management, and in the few other occupations open to women; and from the remainder indirect benefit is in many individual cases obtained, through the personal influence of individual women over individual men. But these benefits are partial; their range is extremely circumscribed; and if they must be admitted, on the one hand, as a deduction from the amount of fresh social power that would be acquired by giving freedom to one-half of the whole sum of human intellect, there must be added, on the other, the benefit of the stimulus that would be given to the intellect of men by the competition; or (to use a more true expression) by the necessity that would be imposed on them of deserving precedency before they could expect to obtain it.|$|R

50|$|SV Wilhelmshaven filed {{a lawsuit}} against FIFA, the {{international}} governing body of football, regarding the signing in 2007 of free transfer Sergio Sagarzazu. Sagarzazu played 38 times for the club over a year and a half. However, Sagarzazu's former clubs River Plate and Atletico Excursionistas filed for compensation in the amount of 157,000 Euros, which is allowed under FIFA's regulations. Wilhelmshaven refused to pay, claiming that such fees violated German law. FIFA demanded that the German FA deduct six points from Wilhelmshaven in the 2011-12 season. Despite this deduction, Wilhelmshaven managed to avoid relegation from the Regionalliga Nord. FIFA imposed another six-point deduction in 2012-13 season for lack of payment, but again, Wilhelmshaven avoided relegation as two other teams went bankrupt. FIFA has demanded that the German FA relegate Wilhelmshaven for lack of payment following the 2013-14 season. Wilhelmshaven filed suit against FIFA in German court to overturn the relegation order, stating that a German Court decision (from 2004) that the payment of training compensation was a restraint of trade under European law of <b>free</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> meant {{that they did not have}} to pay such compensation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{possibility}} of a full diplomatic career only opened up to Corley Smith and to others with no private means after the Eden reforms of the 1940s. He was appointed as labour attaché in Brussels in 1945, and {{caught the attention of}} Ernest Bevin, foreign secretary in the post-war Labour government. Bevin, keen to encourage closer ties with European trade unions, saw Corley Smith as well suited to work in this new area. He was posted to UN headquarters in 1949 as counsellor at the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. As Britain's EcoSoc representative, Corley Smith was chosen to present the case against the Soviet forced labour camps, or gulags, the existence of which was only then beginning to be revealed to the world. It was a task that predictably earned him the anger and disapproval of the Eastern bloc delegations and their press. Much of his time in New York was taken up in drafting the UN Charter on Employment following the adoption of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Art.23), which stated inter alia: [...] "Everyone has the right to work, to <b>free</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> to just and favorable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment." [...] Member states were unable to agree on the wording or the substance of the draft charter, and it was not adopted by the UN. Corley Smith returned to Europe in 1952 and was awarded the CMG. He spent two years in Paris and five in Madrid before being appointed British ambassador to Haiti, which was ruled by François 'Papa Doc' Duvalier. With little he could do diplomatically in Haiti where, according to Graham Greene, [...] "it was impossible to deepen the night", Corley Smith was able to develop his hobby of bird-watching. Eventually, he was chosen as the spokesman for a number of foreign embassies to protest to Duvalier about the reign of terror and extortion by the Tonton Macoute, Duvalier's private mafia. The result was immediate denunciation as an [...] "impertinent British colonialist", and a demand for his recall. Corley Smith regarded being thrown out of Haiti as an honour, and certainly a better fate than was usually meted out to critics of Duvalier's regime. Years later, he said: [...] "I find it difficult to conceive of any solution to Haiti's problems. The country has been independent for two centuries now and it has never had a good leader." ...|$|E

40|$|Poverty {{alleviation}} {{and food}} security are two prominent {{features on the}} international agenda. The provision of sustainable employment {{is seen as a}} major factor in the attainment of those goals. 1 Access by the poor to food and work, combined with the construction of essential infrastructure and accumulation of assets, has long been seen both in economic theory and practice to be an effective approach to poverty alleviation and the attainment of food security. This model is appealingly simple. Getting adequate food dominates the lives of poor, food-insecure people. Promoting the productive use of the most abundant resource that poor people have—their labor—in order to increase their income and assets can lead to self-reliance and to equitable and sustainable social and economic development. Constructing and maintaining basic infrastructure is an essential requirement for an economy's growth. Labor-intensive works programs that provide food and employment for the poor are therefore the cement that holds the model together (Gaude and Watzlawick 1992). This chapter focuses on the use of food aid and the directions it might take both in development and in the provision of relief by contributing to poverty alleviation and food security. It concentrates on the direct uses of food aid in employment programs, while recognizing that there are other important benefits to be gained from this form of aid resource—particularly through the development of human resources—that have important indirect effects. The chapter begins with an analysis of current food aid uses and with the international policy context within which discussion and decisions are taking place. It notes the important global and regional '"Everyone has the right to work, to <b>free</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> to just and favorable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment [...] Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, includin...|$|E
