40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{occupational}} {{health and safety}} risks facing <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> employees (also known as temporary agency workers) in the Australian state of Victoria. Three questions are considered. First do <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> employees face greater risk of injury and disease than direct hire employees? Second, if so, which characteristics of <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> employment contribute to a higher rate of injury? Third, what characteristics of <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> employment reduce the likelihood of injured employees returning to work and being rehabilitated? The first question is answered by an aggregate analysis of data drawn from all workers' compensation claim files in Victoria between 1994 / 5 and 2000 / 1 contrasting the frequency of injury for both temporary agency employees and direct hire employees. Second a unique sub sample of individual investigated claim files was then examined to test employment factors that could account for the higher frequency of injury amongst agency workers. A third data source involved a survey and focus groups of temporary agency workers. This provided supplementary data on the work experiences of <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> employees. A number of conclusions are drawn. <b>Labour</b> <b>hire</b> employees {{are more likely to be}} injured at work than their direct hire counterparts. Factors explaining this include economic pressures, disorganisation at the host workplace, and regulatory failure for agency employees. Several of these factors are uniquely related to the triangular nature of <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> arrangements. Once injured at work, <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> employees are especially disadvantaged relative to direct hire employees through the reluctance of many <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> employers to offer further employment. This reduces the capacity of <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> workers to return to meaningful employment. Regulatory failure stemming from both employment and {{occupational health and safety}} legislation underpins the greater likelihood of agency workers being injured at work and then dispensed with by employers. Until the uniqueness of their triangular relationship with employers and hosts is recognised through appropriate regulatory intervention, their greater occupational health and safety risks will not be overcome...|$|R

5000|$|In Namibia {{the issue}} of <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> has become a heated debate between the government, unions and labour brokers companies.The ILO categorises two forms of sub{{contracting}}, namely job contracting (where a subcontractor supplies goods or services) and labour-only contracting (the sub-contractor supplies only labour). Most of Namibia’s <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> companies fall into the second category as they merely only supply labour to their clients. [...] The workers, known as contractors, field employees, temps, on-hired employees or even just employees, are employed by the <b>labour</b> <b>hire</b> organisation.

We investigated the diversity, constraints {{and opportunities to}} increase smallholder productivity and achieve food self-sufficiency in maize-based farming systems in two Posts in central Mozambique.

Farm type 1 cultivated relatively large areas, owned cattle and <b>hired</b> in <b>labour.</b> Farm type 2 cultivated moderate areas and both hired in and <b>hired</b> out <b>labour.</b> Farms of type 3 a and 3 b cultivated the smallest areas. Farm type 3 a shared labour while Farm type 3 b only <b>hired</b> out <b>labour.</b> For each farm type, we calculated land and labour productivities of maize, sunflower and sesame and assessed maize self-sufficiency. Access to labour during weeding was the main constraint. The <b>hiring</b> out of <b>labour</b> by small farms caused severe reductions in both land and labour productivity. Yield reductions on these farms were due to delayed weeding in own fields. In one Post, Farm type 3 b was not maize self-sufficient. Labour quality was probably impaired by excess alcohol consumption among the poorer farmers (both men and women). Our results showed that production can be increased based on current agricultural practices. Farmers did not cultivate all of their land, suggesting that lack of labour constrained intensification by smallholder farmers...|$|R
