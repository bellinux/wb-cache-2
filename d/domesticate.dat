5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to <b>domesticate</b> zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E

5|$|With some exceptions, {{most notably}} the unparalleled 22-year tenure of John Kourkouas, or in times of {{domestic}} instability, Domestics were changed on the average every three to four years. During the 10th century, the <b>Domesticate</b> of the Schools was dominated {{by members of the}} Phokas family, which produced six holders of the office. Their attempts to monopolize the office led a series of emperors, concerned over the power of the military aristocracy, to entrust the potentially over-powerful office to non-military court officials, including—especially {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, before the military aristocracy reasserted its authority—to eunuchs, even though this was in theory forbidden, with the alternate office of stratopedarches having been created for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to <b>domesticate</b> wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{typically}} harvested local small game, {{but sometimes}} organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their {{main sources of}} animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk. They began to <b>domesticate</b> turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop. Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.|$|E

5|$|The first humans of the Colorado River basin {{were likely}} Paleo-Indians of the Clovis and Folsom cultures, who first {{arrived on the}} Colorado Plateau about 12,000 years ago. Very little human {{activity}} occurred in the watershed until {{the rise of the}} Desert Archaic Culture, which from 8,000 to 2,000 years ago constituted most of the region's human population. These prehistoric inhabitants led a generally nomadic lifestyle, gathering plants and hunting small animals (though some of the earliest peoples hunted larger mammals that became extinct in North America {{after the end of the}} Pleistocene epoch). Another notable early group was the Fremont culture, whose peoples inhabited the Colorado Plateau from 2,000 to 700 years ago. The Fremont were likely the first peoples of the Colorado River basin to <b>domesticate</b> crops and construct masonry dwellings; they also left behind a large amount of rock art and petroglyphs, many of which have survived to the present day.|$|E

40|$|Faunal {{evidence}} from the Fayum Neolithic is often cited {{in the framework of}} early stock keeping in Egypt. However, the data suffer from a number of problems. In the present paper, large faunal datasets from new excavations at Kom K and Kom W (4850 – 4250 BC) are presented. They clearly show that, despite the presence of <b>domesticates,</b> fish predominate in the animal bone assemblages. In this sense, there is continuity with the earlier Holocene occupation from the Fayum, starting ca. 7350 BC. Domesticated plants and animals appear first from approximately 5400 BC. The earliest possible evidence for <b>domesticates</b> in Egypt are the very controversial domesticated cattle from the 9 th/ 8 th millennium BC in the Nabta Playa-Bir Kiseiba area. The earliest <b>domesticates</b> found elsewhere in Egypt date to the 6 th millennium BC. The numbers of bones are generally extremely low {{at this point in time}} and only caprines are present. From the 5 th millennium BC, the numbers of sites with <b>domesticates</b> dramatically increase, more species are also involved and they are usually represented by significant quantities of bones. The data from the Fayum reflect this two phase development, with very limited evidence for <b>domesticates</b> in the 6 th millennium BC and more abundant and clearer indications in the 5 th millennium BC. Any modelling of early food production in Egypt suffers from poor amounts of data, bias due to differential preservation and visibility of sites and archaeological remains, and a lack of direct dates for <b>domesticates.</b> In general, however, the evidence for early stock keeping and accompanying archaeological features shows large regional variation and seems to be mainly dependen...|$|R

25|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that Neolithic material culture was introduced to Europe via western Anatolia, and that similarities in cultures of North Africa and the Pontic steppes are due to diffusion out of Europe. All Neolithic sites in Europe contain ceramics, and contain the plants and animals domesticated in Southwest Asia: einkorn, emmer, barley, lentils, pigs, goats, sheep, and cattle. Genetic data suggest that no independent domestication of animals took place in Neolithic Europe, and that all domesticated animals were originally domesticated in Southwest Asia. The only <b>domesticate</b> not from Southwest Asia was broomcorn millet, domesticated in East Asia. The earliest evidence of cheese-making dates to 5500 BCE in Kujawy, Poland.|$|E

25|$|The Kintampo site is {{most often}} studied by archaeologists who are {{interested}} in seeing how people made the change between foraging and horticulture and agriculture as a way of producing food. Kintampo is seen as an example of neither foraging or farming, but somewhere in between. As practitioners of sedentism, derived from the word sedentary, the people of Kintampo spent more time in their villages and less time wandering around, hunting and gathering food. They took advantage of plants that were native to the area, and although technically they were not farming, they did influence the evolution of plants, effectively being some of the first to <b>domesticate</b> plants in Africa.|$|E

40|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} {{is an essential}} investigative technique, complementary to more traditional zooarchaeological approaches to elucidating animal keeping practices. Carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) stable isotope values of 132 <b>domesticates</b> (cattle, caprines and pigs) were evaluated to investigate one aspect of animal keeping, animal forage, at the Late Chalcolithic (mid-fourth millennium BC) site of Çamlıbel Tarlası, which is located in north-central Anatolia. The analyses indicated {{that all of the}} <b>domesticates</b> had diets based predominantly on C 3 plants. Pig and caprine δ 13 C and δ 15 N values were found to be statistically indistinguishable. However, cattle exhibited distinctive stable isotope values and, therefore, differences in diet from both pigs and caprines at Çamlıbel Tarlası. This difference may relate to the distinct patterns of foraging behaviour exhibited by the <b>domesticates.</b> Alternatively, this diversity may result from the use of different grazing areas or from the foddering practices of the Çamlıbel Tarlası inhabitants...|$|R
