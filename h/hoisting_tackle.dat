6000|$|There was the mainmast, fifteen {{inches in}} {{diameter}} at what was now the butt, still sixty-five feet in length, and weighing, I roughly calculated, at least three thousand pounds. And then came the foremast, larger in diameter, and weighing surely thirty-five hundred pounds. Where was I to begin? Maud stood silently by my side, while I evolved in my mind the contrivance known among sailors as “shears.” But, though known to sailors, I invented it there on Endeavour Island. By crossing and lashing the ends of two spars, and then elevating them {{in the air like}} an inverted “V,” I could get a point above the deck to which to make fast my <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> To this <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle</b> I could, if necessary, attach a second <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> And then there was the windlass! ...|$|E
60|$|The houses {{near the}} sea have not fared so well. They are {{built in the}} water on piles, and are all of them {{warehouses}} with projections in front, from which hang blocks and <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> These projections resemble heads; the piles look like legs; {{and it does not}} require a very strong effort of imagination to believe that the warehouses are great living creatures which have waded into the sea, and are looking earnestly down into the water to observe how the fish are getting on.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was {{constructing}} the shears. Lashing the two topmasts together, and making allowance for their unequal length, at the point of intersection I attached the double block of the main throat-halyards. This, with the single block and the throat-halyards themselves, gave me a <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> To prevent the butts of the masts from slipping on the deck, I nailed down thick cleats. Everything in readiness, I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and carried it directly to the windlass. I was growing to have faith in that windlass, for it gave me power beyond all expectation. As usual, Maud held the turn while I heaved. The shears rose in the air.|$|E
6000|$|The bo's'n--a broad, short, burly man, as a {{boatswain}} {{always is}} and always ought to be, with, of course, a terrific bass voice, a body outrageously long, and legs ridiculously short--replied, [...] "Ay, ay, sir," [...] and gave some directions to his mates, who {{stood by the}} <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackles.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} an {{hour the}} single and double blocks came {{together}} {{at the top of the}} shears. I could hoist no more. And yet the mast was not swung entirely inboard. The butt rested against the outside of the port rail, while the top of the mast overhung the water far beyond the starboard rail. My shears were too short. All my work had been for nothing. But I no longer despaired in the old way. I was acquiring more confidence in myself and more confidence in the possibilities of windlasses, shears, and <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackles.</b> There was a way in which it could be done, and it remained for me to find that way.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{suspended}} and eventually banned for life by then PBA Commissioner Jun Bernardino in 1995 for committing a flagrant foul after <b>hoisting</b> a dangerous <b>tackle</b> on then-Alaska rookie Jeffrey Cariaso in midair while Cariaso {{was going for}} an uncontested layup during their game against the Milkmen in the 1995 PBA All-Filipino Cup Finals. [...] The Games and Amusement Board also revoked his playing license. [...] He {{was never able to}} play in the PBA again.|$|R
60|$|But we did {{not have}} to wait long, and the problem solved itself. In the morning, after several trials, I found the point of balance in the {{foremast}} and attached my <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle</b> a few feet above it. Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down while I heaved. Had the windlass been in order {{it would not have been}} so difficult; as it was, I was compelled to apply all my weight and strength to every inch of the heaving. I had to rest frequently. In truth, my spells of resting were longer than those of working. Maud even contrived, at times when all my efforts could not budge the windlass, to hold the turn with one hand and with the other to throw the weight of her slim body to my assistance.|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{of three}} men loading a train car with logs using a <b>hoist</b> and cable <b>tackle,</b> {{in a forest}} at Santa Cruz, ca. 1900. One man stands atop the pile of logs on the car, the other two stand on logs {{awaiting}} loading on the ground beside the car. An ax is buried in a small pile of little logs in the foreground. Two large stumps are visible in the background near a steam powered winch at left. The forest is in the background...|$|R
5000|$|The Pyramid Play {{was first}} used unsuccessfully in a game on October 28, 1933, against Washington State College (now Washington State University) without much fanfare. [...] The play was used again on November 11, 1933, against the University of Oregon during the annual Civil War game at Multnomah Stadium, now Providence Park. The Beavers had a 6'5" [...] (1.97 m) center named Clyde Devine and two 6'2" [...] (1.88 m) tackles named Harry Fields and Ade Schwammel. The two <b>tackles</b> <b>hoisted</b> Devine upon their shoulders. [...] With the {{combination}} of their height and Devine's long arm span, they succeeded in blocking one of Oregon's two kicks. [...] The play is [...] "probably the most notorious on-field shenanigan" [...] {{in the history of}} the Civil War game.|$|R
60|$|In his {{own small}} room Martin lived, slept, studied, wrote, and kept house. Before the one window, looking {{out on the}} tiny front porch, was the kitchen table that served as desk, library, and type-writing stand. The bed, against the rear wall, {{occupied}} two-thirds of the total space of the room. The table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau, manufactured for profit and not for service, the thin veneer of which was shed day by day. This bureau stood in the corner, and in the opposite corner, on the table's other flank, was the kitchen--the oil-stove on a dry-goods box, inside of which were dishes and cooking utensils, a shelf on the wall for provisions, and {{a bucket of water}} on the floor. Martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink, there being no tap in his room. On days when there was much steam to his cooking, the harvest of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous. Over the bed, <b>hoisted</b> by a <b>tackle</b> to the ceiling, was his bicycle. At first he had tried to keep it in the basement; but the tribe of Silva, loosening the bearings and puncturing the tires, had driven him out. Next he attempted the tiny front porch, until a howling southeaster drenched the wheel a night-long. Then he had retreated with it to his room and slung it aloft.|$|R
60|$|One of the {{attending}} harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable {{hole in the}} lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging, slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two <b>tackles</b> <b>hoisting</b> and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.|$|R
