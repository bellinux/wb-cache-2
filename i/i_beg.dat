5|$|Bajo Pivljanin <b>i</b> <b>beg</b> Ljubović, ("Bajo Pivljanin and Bey Ljubović", {{best known}} poem about him, recounting his victory in duel with Ljubović bey in Nevesinje, and his killing of Mato Njegošević who betrayed him).|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>beg</b> {{to tender}} the {{following}} suggestion {{as a means}} of getting over the difficulty: that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home-and-away fixtures each season, the said fixtures to be arranged at a friendly conference {{about the same time as}} the International Conference.|$|E
5|$|The story I {{am going}} to tell is a horrible one: <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> that daughters and fathers should hold {{themselves}} aloof, while I sing, or if they find my songs enchanting, let them refuse to believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or else, if they believe that it did happen, they must believe also in the punishment that followed.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>begged</b> Stroeve {{to behave}} more wisely. His want of spirit was exasperating.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>begged</b> his pardon, and he {{recovered}} his good humor in a moment.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought you}} were never coming. <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> you to come at once.|$|R
5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> {{to apply for the}} same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe all}} {{the works of}} the bridge are completed, and that I believe it to be {{perfectly}} secure and safe. The Company have as yet only laid one line of rails over this structure, and <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> to recommend that permission be given to open that one line.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>beg</b> your graces, {{with the}} zeal of {{faithful}} Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, {{to read all}} my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now {{at the end of}} my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.|$|E
60|$|At this <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> and besought that {{we might}} lie down and sleep.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>begged</b> her to {{interpret}} my {{silence in the}} sense most agreeable to herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "He thought I was sick. He worked over me. He gave me medicine. And then he prayed. I saw him, in the dark, on his knees, {{praying for}} me. That seemed strange. Yet he was kind, so kind that <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> {{him to let}} me go. I was not a Mormon. I couldn't marry him. <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> him to let me go.|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>beg</b> {{to acquaint}} you, that the Danish three-masted {{schooner}} privateer Norsk Mod, of six guns, four swivels, 28 men, and of 100 tons burthen, commanded by Mathias Bergt, was captured {{at two o'clock}} this morning by the Pyramus. – This privateer had left Arundel only six hours, and sailed {{for the express purpose}} of annoying the very large convoy that sailed yesterday from Gottenburgh for England.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>beg</b> {{leave to}} appoint you their Foster Father intimating that my desire {{is that both}} my Said Sons shd. be active Characters in Life... The {{prevailing}} Notion now is to Continue the most abject State of Slavery in this Common-Wealth – On this Consideration only, I do not intend that these my two Sons shall return to this State till each of them arrive to the Age of 21 years.|$|E
25|$|O most Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, I adore You profoundly. I offer You the Most Precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, {{present in}} all the tabernacles of the world, in {{reparation}} for the outrages, sacrileges and indifferences by which He is offended. By the infinite merits of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> the conversion of sinners.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>begged</b> her to continue. She perplexed--I am {{not sure}} that she did not even alarm me.|$|R
60|$|Surprised at this speech, <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> {{him to tell}} me what I {{had said}} that was wrong.|$|R
60|$|Replying in the negative, <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> {{the doctor}} to tell me why he had put his question.|$|R
25|$|Sir Pelham Warner records 'according to Sir Edward, Harvey was 'showing {{off before}} the ladies on Ladies Day by endeavouring to bowl faster than ever. Poor Chandos Leigh {{had a bad}} time at long-stop and when he {{returned}} home after match, battered and bruised, his man said to him ' <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> your pardon, sir, but have you noticed your finger? Finger? Which finger? This one, sir, it's broken' Good heavens, man! Quick! Get me an arnica bath. And that was why in after-years Sir Edward often shook with half a hand'.|$|E
25|$|Sir, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> {{to acquaint}} you, that the Spanish {{schooner}} le Felix, a Letter of Marque, pierced for ten guns, but only six mounted, with a complement of forty-two men, commanded by Francisco Lopes, laden with coffee and bees wax, from the Havana to Vera Cruz, was this day captured by His Majesty's Ship under my Command, after a Chase of four hours. She sailed the preceding evening, and {{was permitted to}} do so from her very great superiority of sailing, and is the first Vessel that has quitted that anchorage since the Embargo was laid on.|$|E
25|$|I {{have written}} this letter {{to you on}} a happy day to me, {{which is also the}} last day of my life. For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> you {{to take care of the}} children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to me, and to philosophy.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>begged</b> Mr. Pumblechook to {{remember}} that nothing was to be ever said or hinted, on that point.|$|R
60|$|We {{were getting}} along famously, and <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> {{him to take}} some of Mrs Bowater's black currant jam.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>begged</b> {{that the}} doctor would not trouble himself to repeat more of what my women {{servants}} had said.|$|R
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E
60|$|Beginning {{to recover}} myself, <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> {{that he would}} make no more excuses. My {{interruption}} seemed to confuse him.|$|R
60|$|I {{thanked the}} fairy {{for all that}} she had done for me, but <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> her not to kill my brothers.|$|R
6000|$|... "He wouldn't come back, mother, if <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> {{him ever}} so [...] . . ." [...] said Elsa drearily; [...] "and besides--where should I find him?" ...|$|R
500|$|Be careful, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> you, {{never to}} assume the debts of others {{when you are a}} debtor yourself; do not dare give {{absolution}} without having received in your heart the One who takes away the sin of the world." [...] (Eth. 6) ...|$|E
500|$|During its {{marketing}} campaign, 12 Years a Slave received unpaid endorsements by celebrities such as Kanye West and Sean Combs. In a video posted by Revolt, Combs urged viewers to see 12 Years a Slave by stating: [...] "This movie is very painful but very honest, {{and is a}} part of the healing process. <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> all of you to take your kids, everybody to see it.... You have to see this so you can understand, so you can just start to understand." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 April 1770, Smart {{was arrested}} for debt. On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, the gentleman who {{originally}} introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the King's Bench Prison. Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the [...] "Rules" [...] (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: [...] "Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> you to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, {{in two or three}} days." [...] On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, Hymns, for the Amusement of Children.|$|E
60|$|But Miss Clarissa {{giving me}} a look (just like a sharp canary), as {{requesting}} that I would not interrupt the oracle, <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> pardon.|$|R
6000|$|... "She looked surprised, then rather proud, {{and shut}} the piano at once, though <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> her to go on. Isn't Jean a pretty name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{just come}} from his office, where <b>I</b> <b>begged</b> harder of him than <b>I</b> ever <b>begged</b> of man before to take what money I had and wait a year longer; but he wants my back pasture to piece on to his own, and says he will foreclose to-morrow," [...] replied the old man.|$|R
