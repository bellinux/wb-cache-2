5|$|Spanish conquistadors brought {{potatoes}} and tomatoes from the Americas to <b>Europe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern <b>Europe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, and tomatoes – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour {{as the source}} of tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across <b>Europe.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E

5|$|Brought by explorers, {{queen conch}} shells {{quickly became a}} popular asset in early modern <b>Europe.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 17th century they were widely used as {{decoration}} over fireplace mantels and English gardens, among other places. In contemporary times, queen conch shells are mainly utilized in handicraft. Shells are made into cameos, bracelets and lamps, and traditionally as doorstops or decorations by families of seafaring men. The shell continues to be popular as a decorative object, though its export is now regulated and restricted by the CITES agreement. In modern culture, queen conch shells are often represented in everyday objects such as coins and stamps.|$|E

Commercial secondary schools spread, and some Italian towns had more than one such enterprise. Universities also spread throughout <b>Europe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 14th and 15th centuries.

When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project.

However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E

The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including millstone grit, which is a major source of building material for the region's churches.

5|$|Historians have {{interpreted}} the widespread presence of castles across <b>Europe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11thand 12thcenturies {{as evidence that}} warfare was common, and usually between local lords. Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Before the 12thcentury, castles were as uncommon in Denmark {{as they had been}} in England before the Norman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences. The motte and bailey remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Ireland well into the 12thcentury. At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.|$|E
