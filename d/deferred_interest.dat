Disney invested US$750million into Euro Disney and granted a five-year suspension of royalty payments. In June that same year, Saudi Arabian Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud cut a deal whereby the Walt Disney Company bought 51% of a new US$1.1billion share is existing shareholders at below-market rates, with the Prince buying any that were not taken up by existing shareholders (up to a 24.5% holding).|$|E
60|$|More than once, in {{the brief}} days of my {{struggle}} for an education, I went to Johnny Heinhold to borrow money. When I entered the university, I borrowed forty dollars from him, without interest, without security, without buying a drink. And yet--and here is the point, the custom, and the code--in the days of my prosperity, after the lapse of years, I {{have gone out of}} my way by many a long block to spend across Johnny Heinhold's bar <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> on the various loans. Not that Johnny Heinhold asked me to do it, or expected me to do it. I did it, as I have said, in obedience to the code I had learned along with all the other things connected with John Barleycorn. In distress, when a man has no other place to turn, when he hasn't the slightest bit of security which a savage-hearted pawn-broker would consider, he can go to some saloon-keeper he knows. Gratitude is inherently human. When the man so helped has money again, depend upon it that a portion will be spent across the bar of the saloon-keeper who befriended him.|$|E

50|$|Private student loans, made to {{students}} or parents: Higher limits and no payments until after graduation, although interest starts to accrue immediately and the <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> {{is added to}} the principal, so there is interest on the (<b>deferred)</b> <b>interest</b> (which Is not the case with subsidized student loans). Interest rates are higher than those of federal loans, which are set by the United States Congress. Private loans are, or should be, a last resort, when federal and other loan programs are exhausted. Any college financial aid officer will recommend you borrow the maximum under federal programs before turning to private loans.|$|E
50|$|Negative {{amortization}} (also called <b>deferred</b> <b>interest)</b> occurs if {{the payments}} made do not cover the interest due. The remaining interest owed {{is added to}} the outstanding loan balance, making it larger than the original loan amount.|$|E
50|$|Shareholder loan is a debt-like form of {{financing}} provided by shareholders. Usually, {{it is the}} most junior debt in the company's debt portfolio, and since this loan belongs to shareholders it should be treated as equity. Maturity of shareholder loans is long with low or <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> payments. Sometimes, shareholder loan is confused with a loan from company extended to its shareholders.|$|E
25|$|From that time, through fresh {{sanguine}} {{predictions for}} {{improvements in the}} business climate and the Reading's overall performance, which allowed him to borrow more funds on a less grand scale {{and to get the}} McCalmonts to <b>defer</b> <b>interest</b> payments due; and maneuverings such as periodically paying workers in scrip—essentially promissory notes—instead of cash, Franklin Gowen continued to run the Reading. In early 1880, employees were paid in cash {{for the first time in}} sixteen months. Then, on Friday, May 22, 1880, two Coal & Iron Co. checks, intended to transfer cash to the railroad, bounced. Gowen offered railroad promissory notes to make the checks good, but the bank turned him down. McCalmont Brothers ignored Gowen's plea by cable for a fresh loan of a half million dollars. That same day the Reading announced suspension of payments on debt.|$|R
25|$|On 23 January 2004, Jágr was {{eventually}} {{traded to the}} New York Rangers in exchange for Anson Carter and an agreement that Washington would pay approximately $4 million per year of Jágr's salary.

5000|$|On 27 March 2012 {{the company}} {{struck a deal}} for $120m of interim {{financing}} to give it time to recapitalize the company. Lenders holding about 70 percent of its bank debt agreed to waive covenants on that debt, and <b>defer</b> <b>interest</b> payments until 29 June 2012. The following day Reuters reported rumours {{that the company was}} negotiating a prearranged bankruptcy [...] "within the next several weeks" [...] to include debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing of less than $500M. On 30 March, the company failed to pay interest on its secured credit facility, which Standard & Poors considered a [...] "selective default" [...] and on 2 April it failed to pay $28 million of interest on its unsecured and subordinated notes, which S&P rated as a full default. Hawker also reported that it had breached banking covenants and had failed to file its 10-K for 2011 on time because of problems with its internal financial reporting systems.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Deferred</b> <b>interest</b> {{mortgage}} - {{a mortgage}} {{that allows the}} borrower to make repayments that are lower than the amount of interest owed. The remainder {{is added to the}} principal, which is likely to increase to more than the original amount owed; the remaining interest payments will then be significantly higher. These mortgages were marketed during periods of high interest rates to young professionals whose salaries were expected to increase quickly.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the rift}} between Greenberg and Ryan were never {{publicly}} discussed by the Rangers, reports indicated two major events {{that might have}} directly led to the removal of Greenberg, Greenberg's involvement with additional attempts to sign Cliff Lee, and his involvement with potential Young trades after Young demanded a trade, most specifically that Greenberg demanded Young forfeit <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> due {{to him by the}} Rangers. The demand would have been a violation of the MLB CBA.|$|E
50|$|IBR plans {{generally}} cap loan payments at 10 {{percent of}} the student borrower's income. <b>Deferred</b> <b>interest</b> accrues, and the balance owed grows. However, after {{a certain number of}} years, the balance of the loan is forgiven. This period is 10 years if the student borrower works in the public sector (government or a nonprofit) and 25 years if the student works at a for-profit. Debt forgiveness is treated as taxable income, but can be excluded as taxable under certain circumstances, like bankruptcy and insolvency.|$|E
5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans. Borrowers were then allowed to <b>defer</b> paying <b>interest</b> on the loan {{until the end of}} the period, when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due. These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|R

50|$|On August 7, 2009, U.S. Century Bank {{announced}} it {{has participated in}} the United States Department of the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program by receiving $50.2 million of funds. U.S. Century Bank reported earnings of $1 {{million in the first}} quarter of 2010, but <b>deferred</b> the <b>interest</b> payment to the U.S. Government on its TARP loan. The rating agency Fitch downgraded the rating on the banks corporate debt to junk status.

50|$|In finance, {{negative}} amortization (also {{known as}} NegAm, <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> or graduated payment mortgage) occurs whenever the loan payment for any period {{is less than}} the interest charged over that period so that the outstanding balance of the loan increases. As an amortization method the shorted amount (difference between interest and repayment) is then added to the total amount owed to the lender. Such a practice would have to be agreed upon before shorting the payment so as to avoid default on payment. This method is generally used in an introductory period before loan payments exceed interest and the loan becomes self-amortizing. The term is most often used for mortgage loans; corporate loans with negative amortization are called PIK loans.|$|E
5000|$|According to some, the bailouts {{could be}} traced {{directly}} to Alan Greenspan's efforts to reflate {{the stock market}} and the economy after the tech stock bust, and specifically to a February 23, 2004 speech Mr. Greenspan made to the Mortgage Bankers Association where he suggested that {{the time had come to}} push average American borrowers into more exotic loans with variable rates, or <b>deferred</b> <b>interest.</b> This argument suggests that Mr. Greenspan sought to enlist banks to expand lending and debt to stimulate asset prices and that the Federal Reserve and US Treasury Department would back any losses that might result. As early as March 2007 some commentators predicted that a bailout of the banks would exceed $1 trillion, at a time when Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Henry Paulson all claimed that mortgage problems were [...] "contained" [...] to the subprime market and no bailout of the financial sector would be necessary.|$|E
50|$|Unsubsidized. Students who do {{not meet}} a {{financial}} needs test or who need to supplement their subsidized loans may receive unsubsidized Stafford loans. Borrowers may <b>defer</b> payment of <b>interest</b> during school, grace, and deferment periods, but {{they are responsible for}} all interest that accrues. Repayment begins six months after graduation or the student withdraws to a less than half time status.|$|R
50|$|In {{the decades}} before 1861, the Virginia Board of Public Works had {{invested}} in canals, roads, and railroads, by purchasing stock in and/or receiving mortgages on turnpike, toll bridge, canal and rail transportation companies. By 1861, those $34 million in investments with <b>deferred</b> 6% <b>interest</b> totaled about $46 million. During the American Civil War, {{most of the}} railroads had been used for military purposes by armies on both sides, and had become strategic targets. Railroad lines were ripped up, terminals burned, bridges blown up and rolling stock destroyed. Several northwestern counties also seceded from Virginia {{to remain in the}} Union as the State of West Virginia. Much of what little railroad and canal infrastructure remained was in West Virginia.|$|R
50|$|Asset {{management}} {{is another important}} feature of a financial software. It uses the updated status of the investment to provide the necessary tools in creating every possible outcome, such as future payments that are distressed, conversions for debt to equity and maturity of loans. It also provides an efficient tracking of payment dates and rates. Updated financial statements are readily available, which makes it very easy to determine credit standing {{and as a result}} make proper adjustments on the projections. Asset management can modify dates of payment, conversion of floating to fixed rates, <b>deferred</b> payments, <b>interest</b> rates, maturity extensions and change schedules for repayment. It also uses various assumptions to store and run multiple cases such as downside, base and upside.|$|R
5000|$|While {{historically}} super jumbo mortgages {{were primarily}} short term adjustable rate principal & interest mortgages, interest only options and payment cap or negative amortization loans (currently called [...] "Option ARM" [...] mortgages) {{were introduced to}} the category in the early 1980s to counteract typical 12% rates of the time. While 30-year fixed rate mortgages are available in the super jumbo category, they do not represent the majority of super jumbo mortgages. 3/1 ARM, 5/1 ARM, 7/1 ARM and 10/1 ARM Adjustable Rate Mortgages are more popular among super jumbo mortgage applicants than with the general public, but the greatest increase in originations as a category has been so called [...] "exotic" [...] Super Jumbo Mortgages. Offering interest only and negative amortization features, these loans allow borrowers to choose a lower payment option than a conventional principal & interest mortgage, often 10 to 20% lower in the case of interest only amortization and up to 50% lower or more in the case of <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> options.|$|E
50|$|In January 1994, Sanford Litvack, an {{attorney}} from New York City and former Assistant Attorney General during the Jimmy Carter presidency, {{was assigned to}} be Disneys lead negotiator regarding Euro Disneys future. On February 28, Litvack made an offer (without the consent of Eisner or Frank Wells) to split the debts between Euro Disney creditors and Disney. After the banks showed interest, Litvack informed Eisner and Wells. On March 14, {{the day before the}} annual shareholders meeting, the banks capitulated to Disneys demands. The creditor banks bought US$500 million worth of Euro Disney shares, forgave 18 months of interest and <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> payments for three years. The Walt Disney Company invested US$750 million into Euro Disney and granted a five-year suspension of royalty payments. In June that same year, Saudi Arabian Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud cut a deal whereby The Walt Disney Company bought 51% of a new US$1.1 billion share issue, the rest being offered to existing shareholders at below-market rates, with the Prince buying any that were not taken up by existing shareholders (up to a 24.5% holding).|$|E
40|$|Various {{health care}} {{providers}} offer patients medical credit cards that charge high rates of <b>deferred</b> <b>interest.</b> As the cost of medical care and patient responsibility for out-of-pocket costs continue to rise, patients have turned to medical credit cards for help footing the bill. Unfortunately, because they fail to pay off their balances {{before the end of}} the promotional period, many patients find themselves unexpectedly responsible for <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> charges at rates well above those associated with general-purpose credit cards. Medical credit cards fall outside the protection of many federal credit laws regulating consumer credit. This Note argues that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) should ban <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> medical credit cards through the exercise of its rulemaking power. Short of a total ban on <b>deferred</b> <b>interest</b> medical credit cards, the CFPB should use its rulemaking power to expand the reforms it recently levied on GE CareCredit to the entire medical credit card industry...|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{unconventional}} requirements of many super jumbo mortgage applicants, {{the popularity of}} unconventional mortgage programs amongst the wealthy is understandable. The popularity in particular of cash flow option ARM loans with super jumbo mortgage applicants is {{due in large part}} to the difference in perception of negative amortization in the context of their primary residence not being an asset but a liability. When home equity is substantial as required by the more stringent LTV requirements of super jumbo mortgage underwriting, negative amortization allows a borrower to extract more of the cash locked in the home's equity than would otherwise be possible, short of selling the property, due to the ability to <b>defer</b> <b>interest</b> above and beyond the Loan To Value stipulated on the note. In a conventional mortgage with principal and interest or interest only amortization, the borrower would be required to take out a second mortgage or line of credit to accomplish the same goal, but CLTV guidelines from most super jumbo lenders preclude the use of most of these products for this purpose. This is not to say that second mortgages and lines of credit are uncommon in super jumbo lending, in fact quite the opposite is true, but [...] "piggyback" [...] or [...] "80/20" [...] transactions which are common in conforming and jumbo loan financing are not as prevalent. Another popular application for the use of negative amortization loans by super jumbo mortgage borrowers is to shift as much of their taxable income to long term capital gains as possible by taking advantage of the lower monthly carrying costs and the ability to make lump sum payments at annual or semi-annual intervals. Super Jumbo Option ARM mortgages are also available in hybrid form, with fixed rate and fixed payment periods of 3, 5, 7 or 10 years, although they are relatively new on the super jumbo mortgage scene and not necessarily available to 8-figure loan amounts ($10 Million and up).|$|R

2500|$|Three {{investigations}} into the Fukushima disaster showed the man-made nature of the catastrophe and its roots in regulatory capture associated with a [...] "network of corruption, collusion, and nepotism."
