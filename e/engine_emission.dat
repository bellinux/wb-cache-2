40|$|Abstract：The diesel {{methanol}} combinational combustion (DMCC) engine with methanol fumigation {{has been}} shown considerable petroleum-saving potential and obvious fuel cost reduction. However, the DMCC <b>engine</b> <b>emissions</b> have been deteriorated severely.

As a result, the novel urea-SCR system with V 2 O 5 /TiO 2 catalyst and Ag-Al 2 O 3 catalyst coexisting maybe become the promising technical solution for DMCC <b>engine</b> <b>emissions</b> control...|$|R

2500|$|For the 1973 model year, the VAM Javelin {{received}} cosmetic changes. The car {{incorporated the}} new smaller rectangular grille design with integrated rectangular parking lights and mesh grille, open air vents under {{the front of}} the fenders for cooling the brakes, the [...] "TV screen" [...] tail light design with a larger central bulls eye emblem between them and new original seat patterns. Mechanically, the car was the same as in the year before with the only exception of a new engine head design with larger valves and independent rockers without flute-type shaft. Except for the lack of intake porting, these heads were same units used in the Go Pack engines. These were the most powerful VAM Javelins ever made in stock condition. Similarly to the Mexican originals, the second-generation Javelins were not available with cowl induction hoods as the AMC Javelins in any form. Sales of this year went down from the previous seasons and the beginning of <b>engine</b> <b>emission</b> certification scheduled by the Mexican government the following year would take toll on all high-compression gasoline engines produced in the country. This started to threaten not just the Javelin, but all performance cars produced in Mexico. All this plus the need to open a space to introduce the Gremlin line and the company's perception that new Matador coupe model could take the position as the image builder and enthusiast generator of the marque prompted VAM to discontinue the Javelin {{at the end of the}} 1973 model year production, one year before AMC's production of the Javelin ended in the U.S.|$|E

In recent years, worldwide biofuel production and use raised drastically. Some developed countries have put their target and mandate to use biofuel.

5000|$|For the {{emission}} standards to deliver real emission reductions {{it is crucial}} to use a test cycle that reflects real-world driving style. However the fixed speeds, gear shift points and accelerations of the NEDC offer possibilities for manufacturers to engage in what was called 'cycle beating' to optimise <b>engine</b> <b>emission</b> performance to the corresponding operating points of the test cycle, while emissions from typical driving conditions would be much higher than expected, undermining the standards and public health. In one particular instance, research from two German technology institutes found that for diesel cars no 'real' [...] reductions have been achieved after 13 years of stricter standards.|$|E
40|$|Aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>emissions</b> {{from civil}} {{aviation}} cause several adverse effects to the atmospheric environment. These emissions {{are among the}} known major contributors to changes in atmospheric chemistry and global climate change. One {{way in which the}} international community has responded to the problem has been the adoption of several international treaties, generally dealing with subjects such as protection of the ozone layer, long-range transboundary air pollution, and global climate change. The other way in which the problem has been dealt with is the adoption of an industry-specific international regulatory regime for controlling aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>emissions</b> from civil aviation. In this regard, the international community has, through the law making functions of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), adopted the mechanism of Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) to establish a regulatory framework aimed at reducing environmentally harmful <b>engine</b> <b>emissions.</b> These SARPs, though international in nature, are to be implemented at the national level by the member states of ICAO. This thesis provides a review of current understanding of the effects of aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>emissions</b> on the atmospheric environment and an analysis of the international responses to the problem. In particular, it focuses on the industry-specific regime adopted by ICAO and considers whether it is an effective tool for achieving a balance between the safe and orderly development of civil aviation and the human environment...|$|R

The 'K' prefix cars had a coupe-style swept roofline and shorter deck lid while wagons got a 'W' prefix. In the U.S., the 1968 510 two-door sedan saw a limited introduction during the summer season, resulting in it being the rarest U.S. 510-year/model. The two-door sedan body style became popular and was imported into the U.S. in large numbers for the next 5 model years.

5000|$|Porsche {{executives}} {{decided that}} after the 1969 model year, continuation of 912 production would not be viable, due to {{both internal and external}} factors. First, production facilities used for the 912 were reallocated to a new 914-6, a six-cylinder high performance version of the 914 Porsche-Volkswagen joint effort vehicle. Second, the 911 platform had returned to Porsche's traditional three performance-level ladder, including a most powerful 911S, a fuel-injected 911E, and a base model 911T, with pricing largely in line with market expectations. Third, more stringent United States <b>engine</b> <b>emission</b> control regulations also had a bearing on the decision; Ferry Porsche stated [...] "It would have taken some trouble to prepare the 912 for the new exhaust rules, and {{with the arrival of the}} 914 we would have had three different engines to keep current.

50|$|In 2001, five {{separate}} lawsuits {{were filed}} against the US EPA by the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) and several individual trucking industry entities (such as International Truck and Engine Corporation). Each of those lawsuits challenged thelegality and technological feasibility of certain <b>engine</b> <b>emission</b> control standards in EPAregulations now referred to as NTE requirements. In their challenge, EMA stated that to determine whether an engine meets a primary emission standard, engines are tested and assessed using a standardized 20-minute emissions laboratory test known as the Federal Test Procedure. The NTE, by contrast, has no specified test procedure and potentially could apply over an almost infinite number of test conditions. This, in the manufacturers’ view, made it virtually impossible to ensure total compliance with the NTE—since {{there is no real}} or practical way to test an engine under all conceivable conditions—and so made the NTE both unlawful (the CAA authorizes EPA to adopt engine standards AND accompanying test procedures) and technically infeasible.|$|E
