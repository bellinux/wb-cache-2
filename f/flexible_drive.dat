The cam that generated the firing impulses was moved from the engine to the gun itself; the trigger motor in effect now generated its own firing impulses.

25|$|A major {{advantage}} {{was that}} the adjustment (to set where on the propeller's disc each bullet was to impact) was now in the gun itself. This meant that each gun was adjusted separately, an important feature, since twin synchronized guns were not set to be fired in strict unison, but when they were pointing {{at the same point}} on the propeller disc. Each gun could be fired independently, since it had its own <b>flexible</b> <b>drive,</b> linked to the engine camshaft by a junction box, and having its own clutch. This provision of a quite separate set of components for each gun also meant that a failure in the gear for one gun did not impinge on the other.|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{suppression}} of a pneumatic <b>drive</b> <b>flexible</b> manipulator using adaptive phase adjusting controller Zhi-cheng Qiu and Zhi-li Zhao Generally, a low damping system {{has a small}} phase margin. One should {{deal with the problems}} of long time delay and unmodeled dynamics for active vibration control of a low damping system sometimes. For a pneumatic <b>drive</b> <b>flexible</b> manipulator system, time delay or phase lag and unmodeled nonlinear dynamics problems have raised the level of concern. It is vital but difficult to regulate the phase of vibration controller, to compensate for the time-varying phase lag or time delay due to the gas compression and parametric uncertainty of the pneumatic control system. The objective of this investigation is to formulate an active vibration control law with practical approach of phase adjusting for a pneumatic <b>drive</b> <b>flexible</b> manipulator system. A control strategy named adaptive phase adjusting control is designed and applied. The adaptive phase adjusting controller is implemented by using the phase angles as explicit parameters. These parameters are tuned online, depending on the corresponding control performance index. To evaluate the control performance of the designed adaptive phase adjusting technique, experiments are conducted on a pneumatic <b>drive</b> <b>flexible</b> manipulator experimental setup. The experimental results demonstrate the adaptive phase adjusting controller has the ability to optimize the phase angle accordingly. Vibration suppression is accomplished by using the designed adaptive phase adjusting controller, even with time delay and unmodeled dynamics in the system...|$|R

5000|$|Mandrels {{are also}} used in {{industrial}} composite fabrication such as in filament winding. During the manufacturing process, resin-impregnated filaments are wound around a mandrel to create a composite material structure or part. The structure is cured and the mandrel is removed. One problem {{with this type of}} process is that the mandrel can be very difficult to remove once the part has been cured. As a result, engineers have created a new type of mandrel that has the ability to change shape and be easily extracted. When heated above a certain temperature, the mandrel becomes elastic and can be manipulated into the desired shape and then cooled to become rigid again in the new shape. It can then be used in the filament winding process. Once the composite part is cured, the mandrel can be reheated until elastic and easily removed from the cured part. These types of mandrels can be used repeatedly. In the production of steel core used for <b>flexible</b> <b>drives,</b> the centre wire upon which the subsequent layers are wound is referred to as a Mandrel. This [...] "centre wire" [...] may itself be composed of either a single wire or layers, depending on the sizing of the finished product.|$|R
