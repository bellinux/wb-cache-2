Forty-five indicators influencing <b>building</b> <b>development</b> costs in New Zealand were explored by literature review and pilot interviews. These indicators were grouped into seven categories. The determination and ranking of the significant cost drivers were carried out through questionnaire survey distributed to key professionals working in New Zealand construction industry. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used in analysing the empirical data. Findings showed that the property market, construction industry characteristics, statutory and regulatory, and socio-economic factors were major drivers of the <b>building</b> <b>development</b> cost trends in New Zealand. It was recommended that the ever-increasing <b>building</b> <b>development</b> costs and housing unaffordability in New Zealand could be significantly mitigated by addressing the identified factors. fals...|$|R

40|$|Green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> is an {{emerging}} paradigm {{for the construction}} industry practice all around the world. The establishement of Green Building rating tool helps to assess the whole life cycle process in planning to operation in a building. The Malaysian construction industry recognizes buildings that have been assessed using established green building tool such Green Building Index, Green RE or My CREST. Eventhough these rating tools provide motivation factors in its criteria and sub-criteria to promote sustainability in Malaysia buildings, {{there is still a}} major doubt to developers in terms of risks that may hinder their investments in green buildings. This paper highlights the priority importance of economic motivation factors against risks in the green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> in Malaysia. The data presented in this paper have been mainly derived from responses received through questionnaires completed by building stakeholders involved in green <b>building</b> <b>developments.</b> In order to determine the priority importance of economic motivation factors and risks identified for green <b>building</b> <b>development,</b> the questionnaire outcomes have been thoroughly assessed using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. As a result, lack of government incentive and high capital cost, which classified under green building risks, are the two key factors with highest priority importance that influenced most of the decision making for green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> in Malaysia. The results show green buildings have proliferated as governmental support and incentives with more exampler of higher profit return of investment in enhancing developers preference for green <b>building</b> <b>development...</b>|$|R

40|$|The typical American {{approach}} to buying, or (for the fortunate ones) {{building a house}} is to choose from the existing market or available land. The purchase is made and one moves into the location and tries {{to fit into the}} existing community and environment. The majority of new communities are established by developers and engineers, usually only interested in making the most money, and how to move the vehicles around, respectively. Little consideration is given to the environment (through <b>haphazard</b> <b>building</b> and street orientation), the pedestrian (forced to use the automobile) or community (usually consisting of strip malls and segregated zoning). This is the unfortunate picture across America, except for pre-automotive traditional towns and a growing movement of intentional communities called Cohousing. Cohousing started in Denmark in the early 1970 ’s and has spread to northern Europe, Canada and the United States. It came about in response to housing options that no longer addressed people’s needs. Cohousing is a mix of traditional village concepts adapted to the contemporary lifestyle.

50|$|The community’s upswing and {{development}} into modernity are closely linked with mayor Herbert Brehm’s name. Important projects during his mayoralty were {{things such as}} opening up <b>building</b> <b>development</b> areas like Breite Wiese, dredging the Aschaff for flood control, and laying down requirements for further development at the YMOS metalworks which were then being operated in the community, employing {{more than a thousand}} workers. Further businesses such as the drinks industry and tourism managed to blossom. Substantial infrastructure projects in waterworks and sewage and transport links were undertaken and successfully completed. The sport centre and the gymnasium came into being and were put into a developmental context with the Ebets <b>building</b> <b>development</b> area. In the zoning plan that was put forth, Brehm introduced the ideas for the Ebets <b>building</b> <b>development</b> area and the Heerbach commercial area, thereby laying decisive guidelines down, until his very early death, for the village’s future development. Today, the community administration’s eyes have been cast upon renewing the village’s core. To this end, a consortium was formed. In 2006, the Ebets-Rodwiesen <b>building</b> <b>development</b> area had been fully opened up.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} {{sustainable}} building is increasing rapidly throughout the global construction marketplace. However, the real success of sustainable <b>building</b> <b>development</b> {{depends on the}} concerted effort of different stakeholders. Without knowing the drivers and barriers, {{it is difficult to}} introduce pragmatic policies and strategies to promote such <b>development.</b> While sustainable <b>building</b> <b>development</b> in China is still at an infancy stage, its experience should help other developing countries to develop a road map for developing sustainable buildings. In this paper, twelve semi-structured interviews with senior managers of listed real estate developers in China were conducted. The results indicated that government regulation, incentives and CEO's vision are the key drivers of sustainable <b>building</b> <b>development.</b> The most significant barriers identified by the interviewees are the additional costs due to sustainable initiatives, lack of customers demand and lack of mature green supply chain. To better understand the system structures causing these management problems, a causal loop diagram was developed to identify the relationships and the causal influences between the elements of the sustainable <b>building</b> <b>development</b> sector. Finally, a suite of effective sustainable strategies is proposed based on the findings...|$|R
40|$|The Vietnamese {{construction}} {{market has}} witnessed slow green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> to date. The motivations for enhancing green building practices {{that lead to}} increased green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> (IND 1 -IND 9) are generic and not yet verified in the Vietnamese context. Therefore, it is currently unknown how {{the extent to which}} these motivations apply to the Vietnamese construction industry. This study fills this gap by surveying the opinions of 166 construction professionals covering the education, public and industry sectors in Vietnam. The findings reveal that all IND 1 -IND 9 are very influential, with mean scores > 3. 77 out of a maximum possible 5. 00. Of these, monetary benefits are the most influential, followed by societal gratification and improved human well-being, while the least influential is government regulation. Furthermore, financial incentives and economic benefits are the most influential motivators of construction professionals in each of the education, public and industry sectors. It is concluded that motivation is very important for encouraging green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> among construction professionals in Vietnam and that the government needs to focus more on providing financial and/or economic incentives to as a means of increasing green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> in the country...|$|R
