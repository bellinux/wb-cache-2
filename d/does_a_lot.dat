500|$|Nash was {{slower and}} more portly {{than he was}} in the 1930s, short of match {{practice}} and forced to spend most Sundays in hospital having fluid drained from his injured knees swollen from the exertions of the day before, forcing South Melbourne coach Bull Adams to nurse Nash through the season. Additionally, in the Round 5 match against Footscray, he tore the webbing between his fingers which later became infected, causing him to miss the Round 6 match against North Melbourne and although Nash wore a special leather glove to protect his hand, the injury would trouble him {{for the rest of the}} season. Despite these setbacks, Nash could still be a match winner and many opposition players saw him as the key player for South Melbourne. Nash's best return for the year was seven goals against St Kilda in Round 12 and he twice kicked six goals in a match; against Geelong in Round 15 and Fitzroy in Round 18.

500|$|In {{the season}} ten premiere, the {{audience}} got its {{first glimpse of}} the traditional Superman costume, which was left for Clark by Martha in the season nine finale. Although the suit was briefly seen through a reflection in Clark's eyes in the season nine finale, the suit that appeared in the season ten premiere was a different design. The producers, working alongside Warner Bros. and DC Comics, procured the costume worn by Brandon Routh in Superman Returns, which the team chose over the Christopher Reeve suit of the 1980s. DC Comics offered the suit worn by Reeve, but Peterson explained that it [...] "... just didn't quite fit with our world." [...] According to producer Kelly Souders, [...] "Well, the process was really a group effort. We worked with DC, and we have Alicia Louis, who <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of stuff for us at the studio, and who was really instrumental. It took quite a bit to get that costume. There's a lot of sign-offs, it really was Warner Bros. and DC and us working to make it happen." [...] Peterson stated that the costume plays a more prominent role in the final season, with the last scene of Smallville ending with Clark wearing it. Before then, Clark began wearing a new costume in the season ten episode [...] "Shield". Here, Clark replaced the black trenchoat with a red leather jacket, and the [...] "S" [...] shield now embossed onto the chest of that jacket.|$|E

The A.V. Clubs Alex McCown-Levy called it [...] "a standard first episode back, in that it once again <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of table-setting, and not always in the most compelling manner".

2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E
2500|$|Roach {{made his}} Test debut on 9July 2009. He {{was part of}} an understrength team fielded by the West Indies against Bangladesh; in the 15-man squad, there were nine {{uncapped}} players and in the Test seven West Indies players made their debut. The side was captained by Floyd Reifer who had played the last of his four Tests ten years earlier. The first XI had made themselves unavailable due to a pay dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board. His first Test wicket was that of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Although Bangladesh won by 95runs, Roach helped put pressure on the Bangladesh batsmen through a combination of yorkers and swinging deliveries, although he bowled slightly wide to the left-handers. Reifer praised Roach's efforts, saying [...] "The first time I saw him as an under-19 bowler, I always {{thought he was going to}} play for West Indies. He <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> especially with the old ball, getting it to move in and out and he performed very well this morning, bowling decent lengths and lines". Although Bangladesh won the second Test to take the series 2–0, Roach again bowled with pace and aggression, unsettling the Bangladesh batsmen. Varying his length and exploiting the Bangladesh batsmen's weakness against short bowling– even hitting Raqibul Hasan on the elbow with one delivery– Roach proceeded to take career-best figures of 6/48 in the first innings. With 13wickets to his name, Roach finished as West Indies' leading wicket-taker from the series. Although Bangladesh won the three-match ODI series that followed 3–0, Roach was leading wicket-taker for the series, with 10wickets at an average of 16.20; in the first of the ODIs he took his maiden five-wicket haul in one day matches (5/44), beating his previous best figures of 2/29. In the second ODI, Roach was fined 10% of his match fee for bowling two beamers. The core of the same squad was retained for September's 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. Roach played in two of West Indies' three matches, as they exited the tournament in the first round, and took three wickets at 33.33.|$|E
