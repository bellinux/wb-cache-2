50|$|A 2011 {{study by}} the {{consulting}} firm Management Information Services, Inc. (MISI) estimated the total historical federal subsidies for various energy sources over the years 1950-2010. The study found that oil, natural gas, and coal received $369 billion, $121 billion, and $104 billion (2010 dollars), respectively, or 70% of total energy subsidies over that period. Oil, natural gas, and coal benefited most from percentage <b>depletion</b> <b>allowances</b> and other tax-based subsidies, but oil also benefited heavily from regulatory subsidies such as exemptions from price controls and higher-than-average rates of return allowed on oil pipelines. The MISI report found that non-hydro renewable energy (primarily wind and solar) benefited from $74 billion in federal subsidies, or 9% of the total, largely {{in the form of}} tax policy and direct federal expenditures on research and development (R&D).

40|$|At {{a time of}} deep {{national}} {{concern about}} both {{the adequacy of the}} U. S. energy supply and how much cleaner it can become, the question of how the U. S. tax code influences investment in energy generation is a crucial one. This report offers a comprehensive overview of the energy-related provisions of the U. S. tax code and their estimated impact on tax revenues. More important, this report indicates where the U. S. tax regime as a whole is likely to direct energy investment. The term for such an overall measure is the “effective ” tax rate—that is, the total effect of the tax code on investors trying to decide into which part of the energy industry to put an additional dollar. This paper builds on other work on effective tax rates by including in its analysis production and investment tax credits appearing in the code as well as <b>depletion</b> <b>allowances</b> reserved for the petroleum and gas sectors. It also considers energy-specific tax provisions that most previous analyses have not taken into account. By providing more detailed disaggregated estimates than its predecessors, it is able to permit clearer and broader comparisons of the tax code’s effects on investment in different fuels. The present analysis has determined that a major shift has occurred since the time, not so long ago, when the tax code encouraged domestic oil and coal investment above all other kinds. • The subsidy for fossil fuels has dropped from over 60 percent in 1997 to under 50 percent in 2007...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which the use of a fixed input in the extraction process for a nonrenewable resource affects a number of common results in depletion theory. A multi-deposit model is constructed where the extraction technology requires capital equipment that is deposit-specific and has no resale value once installed. It is shown that for each deposit there is an equilibrium capacity level, which is built up all at once or gradually, depending on the adjustment costs associated with installing the equipment and the heterogeneity of deposits. The aggregate extraction rate is constant over an initial period of time. The paper goes on to derive a number of results for this model. Firstly, different quality deposits are always exploited simultaneously, although better quality deposits are exhausted first. Secondly, higher discount rates entail quicker depletion only if the resource is sufficiently scarce relative to capital equipment. Thirdly, a programme that is optimal from a social viewpoint can in principle be reproduced without intervention in a perfectly competitive market. Fourthly, fiscal instruments generally discourage investment, and consequently overconserve the resource, unless tax writeoff provisions or <b>depletion</b> <b>allowances</b> are in force. Fiftly, exploitation under monopoly and symmetrically placed Cournot-Nash producers is generally more conservationist than the social optimum, but the distortion is negligible if the number of producers is sufficiently large. Finally, allowing for a variable input in the extraction process or a positive rate of depreciation for capital equipment is shown to quality the results by restoring the more common results that the aggregate extraction rate is always a strictly declining function of time...|$|R
50|$|As {{automobiles}} {{became more}} affordable, {{demand for oil}} quickly rose. Since {{the rise of the}} automobile industry, oil price, demand, and production have all increased. From 1900 to 1980, fuel was directly correlated with Gross National Product (GNP), oil shocks have often coincided with recessions, and the government has responded to oil shocks with a variety of methods. In the 1920s, oil prices were peaking and many commentators believed that oil supplies were running out. Congress was confronted by requests to augment supplies, so a generous <b>depletion</b> <b>allowance</b> was enacted for producers in 1926, which increased investment returns substantially. This change induced additional exploration activity, and subsequently the discovery of large new oil reservoirs.|$|E

40|$|The {{main concern}} {{of this study}} is to obtain an optimal time path of crude oil and natural gas {{production}} by controlling the pressure at the bottom of any producing well in Walton Canyon Reservoir. To achieve this goal, the following objectives were obtained: (a) an estimation of the reservoir properties at different levels of the reservoir pressure; (b) an estimation of an optimal time path of joint production using the estimated reservoir properties and the expected prices and costs in the absence and presence of severance, state, and federal income taxes, and depletion of allowances; and (c) an analysis of the changes in the rates of extraction, firms 2 ̆ 7 profits, revenues to local, state, and federal governments, and welfare losses as a result of changes in tax policies. To conduct this study, an optimization model is used to maximize the present value of net revenues of firms producing oil and gas in the reservoir, subject to the available stock of oil in the ground. Cost per unit of time is discussed at three stages of production (naturally flowing, pumping, and secondary recovery or pressure maintenance). Using the assumption that all producing wells in the reservoir are at the pumping stage of production, the conclusion is made that only the operating cost is related to the bottom well-hole flowing pressure. Since the goal is to control the rates of joint production by controlling the bottom well-hole flowing pressure, the operating cost of the whole reservoir is minimized through separable programming. The non-linear cost equation is solved for the values of the bottom well-hole flowing pressure under a competitive condition in the absence of externalities. In order to estimate the optimal rates of oil and gas production, the expected prices are computed using the actual domestic prices of oil, gas, and electricity. The optimal rates of oil and gas production are obtained through dynamic programming which is applied to the optimization model using a 15 percent discount rate. However, discount rates of 10 percent and 20 percent also are used to determine the influences on the optimal production plan, allowing the production period for twenty years. The empirical results indicate that the production of oil and gas from this reservoir will be profitable in the future, using a 15 percent discount rate, prior to imposition of any taxes. The whole recoverable stock of oil by pump will be extracted within three years beginning with a higher production rate in 1998 and ending with a lower production rate in the year 2000. A 10 percent discount rate influenced the net revenue of the whole reservoir but did not change the production plan. However, the optimization model and, in particular, the production plan are affected by the 20 percent discount rate. In other words, the joint production is profitable in the early years, using a 20 percent discount rate, beginning with a higher production rate in 1982 and ending with a lower production rate in 1985. The important conclusion is that imposing various taxes and <b>depletion</b> <b>allowances,</b> while using a 15 percent discount rate, did not change the optimal time path of production from that time path, which was obtained in the absence of taxation using the same discount rate. The presence of taxation, however, affected revenues and, thereby, resulted in welfare changes in the producing firms and local, state, and federal governments...|$|R
50|$|Regulation of the {{oil market}} {{has been a major}} player in oil history. Policies affect the market {{in a variety of ways}} such as; price, production, consumption, supply and demand. The Oil market has a history of booms and troughs, which caused {{producers}} to demand government intervention. Many times this government involvement only made the situation worse, and many of the regulations were quickly ruled illegal and removed. Before World War II, many of the problems within the oil market were related to changing prices. During the 1920s, oil prices were beginning to peak leading to fears of oil depletion. In response to these fears, during Coolidge's term, Congress enacted a <b>depletion</b> <b>allowance</b> to producers which led to a surge of investment in the oil business and the discovery of many new, large oil reservoirs. The next decade consisted of falling prices due to the new investment and overproduction. The declining prices led producers to demand some form of price support system. One example of how prices were propped up was a pro-rationing order made by the Texas Railroad Commission, which restricted oil production and increased price. This order was soon ruled illegal by federal district court in 1931. The 1930s was the beginning of large federal intervention in the oil industry and began with the creation of the National Industrial Recovery Act, in 1933. This act allowed for natural price competition, instead of agreements between the major producers. However, this act was ruled unconstitutional in 1934.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, {{researcher}} Barr McClellan {{published the}} book Blood, Money & Power. McClellan claims that Johnson, {{motivated by the}} fear of being dropped from the Kennedy ticket in 1964 and the need to cover up various scandals, masterminded Kennedy's assassination {{with the help of his}} friend, Austin attorney Edward A. Clark. The book suggests that a smudged partial fingerprint from the sniper's nest likely belonged to Johnson's associate Malcolm [...] "Mac" [...] Wallace, and that Mac Wallace was, therefore, on the sixth floor of the Depository at the time of the shooting. The book further claims that the killing of Kennedy was paid for by oil magnates, including Clint Murchison and H. L. Hunt. McClellan states that the assassination of Kennedy allowed the oil <b>depletion</b> <b>allowance</b> to be kept at 27.5 percent. It remained unchanged during the Johnson presidency. According to McClellan, this resulted in a saving of over $100 million to the American oil industry. McClellan's book subsequently became the subject of an episode of Nigel Turner's ongoing documentary television series, The Men Who Killed Kennedy. The episode, [...] "The Guilty Men", drew angry condemnation from the Johnson family, Johnson's former aides, and former Presidents Gerald Ford (who was a member of the Warren Commission [...] ) and Jimmy Carter following its airing on The History Channel.

The unique tax benefit they used was the percentage oil <b>depletion</b> <b>allowance,</b> part of the Revenue Act of 1926, which allowed an oil company to reduce its taxable income by 27 ½ percent. By the 1950 s, many Hollywood individuals and corporations extensively invested in the oil business which made the allowance an important component of their financial portfolios. Meanwhile, rich oilmen were also attracted to Hollywood to capitalize on a big hit, or use the losses on a money losing movie to offset their taxable profits from oil. Thus, in the mid-twentieth century, the American oil industry and Hollywood formed a close, mutually reinforcing relationship, and one that academic historians have largely overlooked. After the 1973 oil shock, the percentage <b>depletion</b> <b>allowance</b> came under threat as it was repealed for major integrated oil companies.
