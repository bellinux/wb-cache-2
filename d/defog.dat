Obscuresound.com wrote, [...] "The <b>Defog</b> {{should not have}} a difficult time finding new fans as they tackle new cities, coasts, and countries." [...] Pluginmusic.com wrote, [...] "It is that piano sound, along with the band dabbling in electronics, that makes The Defog’s “Ebb And Flow” a versatile and varied album." [...] The Daily Vault gave the album an A rating and wrote, [...] "The <b>Defog</b> is every bit as refreshing as a new act full of promise can be." ...|$|E
50|$|Superhydrophilic {{material}} has various advantages. For example, it can <b>defog</b> glass, {{and it can}} also enable oil spots to be swept away easily with water. Such materials are already commercialized as door mirrors for cars, coatings for buildings, self-cleaning glass, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Defog's</b> 2004 EP, Sounds {{from the}} Stars, {{was the subject}} of much media praise. Music Connection Magazine wrote, [...] "The catchy tunes, tight musicianship and {{spirited}} performances deserve a listen," [...] giving it the top rating for the issue. 2 Walls Webzine wrote that the band, [...] "...brews the indie-emo sensibility of Failure with synth hooks once perfected decades ago by The Cars." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{period is}} {{especially}} important the participation of prominent lawyers and public men, Máximo Pacheco Gómez and William Elton Alamos, who alternate in the Vice President of the Board, making a great contribution to the project, and academics, Joaquín Barceló and Manuel Krauskopf, who come to <b>defog</b> after ownership of the rectory.|$|E
50|$|A {{full-face}} mask {{consists of}} a transparent faceplate (lenses, or window) through which the diver can see, a connection to a source of breathing gas, a means of removing any water which may get inside, some facility for the diver to block the nose to equalise the ears, a means of sealing these components to the diver's face and preventing ingress of water and a means of securing the assembly to the diver's head. Additional components may include communications equipment, lights, alternative breathing gas connections, and a means to <b>defog</b> the interior surface of the faceplate.|$|E
50|$|The Apis-Bee {{differs from}} the early Apis by the {{incorporation}} of 133 improvements, including: retractable landing gear, steerable tailwheel, ballistic parachute, enlarged cockpit, new lighter Hirth F33BS engine that can be removed quickly and has faster engine extension and retraction, a redesigned propeller, lower vibration levels and better cooling, standard wing-mounted 20 L fuel tank replacing the former 8 L tank, new instrument panel, cockpit control ergonomics, the engine management system from the Taurus, re-balanced and lighter flight control feel, optional 5.00 x 5 main wheel, leather interior, solar panels to run the on-board electrical system, improved cockpit ventilation and canopy <b>defog</b> and a new firewall between the cockpit and the engine compartment.|$|E
50|$|Lightweight diving {{helmets and}} bandmasks usually use a demand {{controlled}} breathing gas supply {{as the standard}} mode, as it is more economical on gas consumption - the amount of gas supplied is the amount needed for the diver's respiratory requirements. However, {{there may be a}} freeflow valve to provide gas at a constant flow at a rate determined by the valve which is operated by the diver. One of the functions of freeflow supply is to <b>defog</b> the faceplate. Another is for breathing gas supply in case of demand valve malfunction, and a third is to assist with clearing water from a leaking helmet, or to prevent inflow through a leaking exhaust port or neck seal.The demand valve of a lightweight helmet can also freeflow for some of the same reasons as can happen with a scuba demand valve.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a novel efficient scheme, <b>DEFOG</b> (for "deciphering families of genes"), for determining sequences of numerous genes {{from a family}} of interest. The scheme provides a powerful means to obtain a gene family composition in species for which high-throughput genomic sequencing data are not available. <b>DEFOG</b> uses two key procedures. The first is a novel algorithm for designing highly degenerate primers based on a set of known genes from the family of interest. These primers are used in PCR reactions to amplify the members of the gene family. The second combines oligofingerprinting of the cloned PCR products with clustering of the clones based on their fingerprints. By selecting members from each cluster, a low-redundancy clone subset is chosen for sequencing. We applied the scheme to the human olfactory receptor (OR) genes. OR genes constitute the largest gene superfamily in the human genome, {{as well as in the}} genomes of other vertebrate species. <b>DEFOG</b> almost tripled the size of the initial repertoire of human ORs in a single experiment, and only 7 % of the PCR clones had to be sequenced. Extremely high degeneracies, reaching over a billion combinations of distinct PCR primer pairs, proved to be very effective and yielded only 0. 4 % nonspecific products...|$|E
40|$|As users analyze data, {{visualization}} {{is important}} for both generating insight during exploration and displaying information for presentation purposes. While visualization systems have been very successful at the latter, their full potential as an aid for data exploration {{has yet to be}} realized. Existing systems have often focused on techniques for displaying information, requiring data to conform to specific file formats or allowing very limited manipulation of the data. In addition, most systems that provide a stronger link between data and visualization sacrifice the freedom of arbitrary composition. In this paper, we present <b>DEFOG,</b> a system that aims to more tightly integrate data exploration and visualization. <b>DEFOG</b> was designed to manipulate objects and as such, it is able to handle a wide range of data types. In addition, it allows flexible data manipulation through both visual and programmatic operations, all integrated in the same environment. By allowing both objects and their relationships to be displayed and combined, <b>DEFOG</b> provides great freedom for visual composition. To that end, it combines information visualization with infrastructure to support a variety of data including in-memory objects and operations found in vector-based graphics editors like select, move, scale, group, and copy-and-paste. We show that this system provides a natural way to use and combine data visualization techniques to explore a variety of data types, and present case studies that demonstrate its use in analyzing collections of workflow specifications and biochemical pathways...|$|E
40|$|Based on dark channel priority, {{the paper}} proposes an {{improved}} defogging algorithm of single image which can <b>defog</b> the foggy images rapidly. The algorithm {{in the paper}} applies the method combining adaptive median filter and bilateral filter to figure out clear dark channel on the edge. And the algorithm {{is based on the}} physical model of foggy images to estimate transmission. Compared with the traditional algorithm, the estimated transmission is detailed and clear, and has no need to be optimized, which not only overcomes the disadvantages of traditional algorithm using plenty of time to optimize transmission, but also reduces the complexity of the algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the algorithm realizes rapid and high-quality defogging on single imag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a simple but}} {{effective}} image prior—dark channel prior to remove haze from a single input image. The dark channel prior {{is a kind of}} statistics of outdoor haze-free images. It is based on a key observation—most local patches in outdoor haze-free images contain some pixels whose intensity is very low in at least one color channel. Using this prior with the haze imaging model, we can directly estimate the thickness of the haze and recover a high-quality haze-free image. Results on a variety of hazy images demonstrate the power of the proposed prior. Moreover, a high-quality depth map can also be obtained as a byproduct of haze removal. Index Terms—Dehaze, <b>defog,</b> image restoration, depth estimation. Ç...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Freezing of gait (FOG) is {{a common}} {{complication}} in movement disorders, typically associated with the advanced stages of Parkinson’s disease. Auditory cues {{might be used to}} facilitate unfreezing of gait and prevent fall related injuries. We present a wearable, unobtrusive system for real-time gait monitoring, which consists of an inertial wearable sensor and wireless headset for the delivery of acoustic cues. The system recognizes FOG episodes with minimum latency and delivers acoustic cues to unfreeze the gait. We present design of a system for the detection and unfreezing of gait (<b>deFOG),</b> and preliminary results of the feasibility study. In a limited test run of 4 test cases the system was able to detect freezing of gait with average latency of 332 ms, and maximum latency of 580 ms.

40|$|Ah&met-The {{boundary}} element {{method is}} {{used to analyze the}} ACPD (alternating current potential drop) field perturbed by a semi-elliptical surface flaw in a metallic sheet. The depth of the penetration of the alternating current is assumed to be small as compared to the crack depth. This allows us to adopt the “unfolding ” technique developed by Dover et al. [ASTM STP 722, 401 - 427 (1981) ], which reduces the problem to a two-dimensional surface Laplacian field. This surface potential field is determined for different surface cracks with crack aspect ratios ranging from 0. 2 to 2. To facilitate the use of these results, an empirical formula is developed based on the numerical results. A simple inverse analysis methodology is also developed for <b>defog</b> the crack depth for ~-el~pti~l surface flaws of known surface length with measured potential drop readings. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new <b>defog</b> {{algorithm}} based on fog veil subtraction to remove fog {{from a single}} image. The proposed algorithm first estimates the illumination component of the image by applying smoothing to the degraded image, and then obtains the uniform distributed fog veil through a mean calculation of the illumination component. Next, we multiply the uniform veil by the original image to obtain a depth-like map and extract its intensity component to produce a fog veil whose distribution is according with real fog density of the scene. Once the fog veil is calculated, the reflectance map {{can be obtained by}} subtracting the veil from the degraded image. Finally, we apply an adaptive contrast stretching to the reflectance map to obtain an enhanced result. This algorithm can be easily extended to video domains and is verified by both real-scene photographs and videos...|$|E
