40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a batch delivery single-machine scheduling problem in which jobs have an assignable common due window. Each job will incur an early (tardy) penalty {{if it is}} early (tardy) {{with respect to the}} common due window under a given schedule. There is no capacity limit on each delivery batch, and the cost per batch delivery is fixed and independent of the number of jobs in the batch. The objective is to find the optimal size and location of the window, the optimal <b>dispatch</b> <b>date</b> for each job, as well as an optimal job sequence to minimize a cost function based on earliness, tardiness, holding time, window location, window size, and batch delivery. We show that the problem can be optimally solved in O(n 8) time by a dynamic programming algorithm under a reasonable assumption on the relationships among the cost parameters. A computational experiment is also conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. We also show that some special cases of the problem can be optimally solved by lower order algorithms. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|E

30|$|The {{study of}} {{economic}} <b>dispatch</b> <b>dates</b> {{back to the}} 1920 s. The spatial and temporal distribution variation of load demand is the prime cause of economic dispatch. The goal of dispatch is the advanced decision-making for base-point generations of units and configuration of spinning reserves based on load forecast. From classical economic dispatch centering on the concepts of incremental cost, incremental loss and hydro-coal conversion equivalent in the mid and late of 1950 s [1], to the optimal power flow considering network security in the 1960 s [2], thence to the theories of dispatch and control which emphasizing the coordination of dispatch and automatic generation control (AGC) in the 1980 s [3, 4], the study of economic dispatch has been relatively mature in theory and practice.|$|R
