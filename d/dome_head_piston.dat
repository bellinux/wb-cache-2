40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} analysis of 2 stroke engine scavenging in two cases. One with an existing condition (Flat <b>headed</b> <b>pistons)</b> and another with a new design (<b>Dome</b> <b>headed</b> <b>piston).</b> The numerical analysis is done with help of CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 14. 5. Here, the modeling of engine <b>piston</b> with flat <b>headed</b> type and with <b>dome</b> <b>headed</b> types was done in workbench. In ANSYS FLUENT after the geometrical design, for the dynamic motion meshing is used and set up species transport model also. At first the scavenging effect of flat <b>headed</b> <b>piston</b> is analyzed. Later the simulation of <b>piston</b> with <b>dome</b> <b>headed</b> type was also checked. Analyzing the variations from each and selected the best method for scavenging. Finally the scavenging efficiency is calculated for both type arrangements...|$|R
50|$|If a circlip (or any non {{preloaded}} system) is used, {{the force}} acting {{to separate the}} <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> and the Cylinder Shaft shoulder is the applied pressure multiplied by {{the area of the}} <b>Piston</b> <b>Head.</b> The <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> and Shaft shoulder will separate and the load is fully reacted by the <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> Retainer.|$|R

5000|$|Toyota {{never made}} a wide-valve angle [...] "7A-GE" [...] based on the 7A, but many enthusiasts have created one using a {{combination}} of 7A-FE parts (block and crank), 4A-GE parts (<b>head,</b> <b>pistons)</b> and custom connecting rods. The '7A-FE' has a smaller crank journal, and smaller wrist pins (press fit) so a few companies have made special rods to accommodate these builds. Likewise, an unofficial supercharged [...] "7A-GZE" [...] has also been built from 7A-FE parts (block, crank), 4A-GZE parts (<b>head,</b> <b>pistons)</b> and custom connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|If a {{preloaded}} {{system is}} used the force between the Cylinder Shaft and <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> is initially the <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> Retainer preload value. Once pressure is applied this force will reduce. The <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> and Cylinder Shaft shoulder {{will remain in}} contact unless the applied pressure multiplied by <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> area exceeds the preload.|$|R
30|$|As {{compared}} with HSD-fueled engine, lesser carbon deposits on the in-cylinder parts (such as cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>piston</b> crown, and fuel injector) were observed for the B 10 -fueled engine due to better combustion of biodiesel blend.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{force the}} <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> Retainer will {{see is the}} larger of the preload and the applied {{pressure}} multiplied by the full <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> area. It {{is interesting to note that}} the load on the <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> Retainer is greater than the external load, which is due to the reduced shaft size passing through the <b>Piston</b> <b>Head.</b> Increasing this portion of shaft reduces the load on the Retainer.|$|R

The engine transmits its power to the rear wheels via a 5-speed gearbox, an automatic transmission was also available. The suspension of the E28 has been modified with Bilstein gas dampers, as standard the B9 was delivered with 16-inch wheels (see picture).

40|$|A column {{longeron}} {{latch assembly}} provides the securing {{mechanism for the}} deployable, telescoping column of a hoop/column antenna. The column is an open lattice structure with three longerons disposed 120 deg apart as the principle load bearing member.

The longeron latch is a four bar linkage mechanism using the over-center principle for automatically locking the longeron sections into position during deployment.

40|$|In {{this present}} work a study about {{influence}} of the air swirl in the cylinder upon the performance and emission of a single cylinder diesel direct injection engine is presented. In order to achieve the different swirl intensities in the cylinder, three design parameters have been changed: the cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>piston</b> crown, and inlet duct. In this way, the piston crown is modified i. e. alteration of combustion chamber to enhance the turbulence in the cylinder. This intensification of the swirl is done by cutting grooves on the crown of the piston.
