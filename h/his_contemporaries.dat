5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> as a loner {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E

5|$|The 1840s were a {{turbulent}} decade in the Church of England. Following the earlier German Higher Critics, who {{argued for a}} historical approach to religious texts, David Strauss published Leben Jesu or The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined which argued that {{the events of the}} New Testament were not historical but rather mythical. In 1846 George Eliot published an English translation of Leben Jesu which became a source of religious doubts for Froude and many of <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> Critics have also identified Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus and Spinoza as sources of Sutherland's doubts, and those of many of <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with many of <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> Miller's {{sporting}} career was interrupted by World War II.

5|$|Booth's stage {{performances}} were often characterized by <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> as acrobatic and intensely physical, with him leaping upon {{the stage and}} gesturing with passion. He was an excellent swordsman, although a fellow actor once recalled that Booth occasionally cut himself with his own sword.|$|E
5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight, especially {{in his left}} eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> He {{appeared to have been}} near-sighted, yet he did not use eyeglasses. His eyesight became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite legible.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century William Shakespeare and <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> {{lived in}} London {{at a time}} of hostility to the {{development}} of the theatre. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605.|$|E

5|$|Laurence Olivier (1907–1989) was an English actor who, {{along with}} <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud, {{dominated}} the British {{stage of the}} mid-20th century.

5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Fitzgerald in 1978, Flanagan then {{attracted}} {{praise for}} the elegance of his playing, which was principally in trio settings when under his own leadership. In his 45-year recording career, he recorded more than three dozen albums under his own name and more than 200 as a sideman. By {{the time of his}} death, {{he was one of the}} most widely admired jazz pianists and had influenced both <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> and later generations of players.|$|E

5|$|An {{alcoholic}} and womanizer, Kunichika also portrayed women deemed beautiful (bijinga), contemporary social life, {{and a few}} landscapes and historical scenes.

5|$|Arundel was {{considered}} a great soldier by <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> He had been a successful commander in France, {{in a period of}} decline for the English, and his death was a great loss to his country.

5|$|Benjamin Hudson {{suggested}} {{that it was only}} the vigorous campaigning by Niall Glúndub in Ulster and Connacht from 913 to 915, along with Óengus's fortuitous death, that led to Niall being named Flann's heir.
