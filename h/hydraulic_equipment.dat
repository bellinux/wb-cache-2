5|$|On 24 May 2002, Queen ElizabethII {{opened the}} Falkirk Wheel {{as part of}} her Golden Jubilee celebrations. The opening was delayed a month due to {{flooding}} caused by vandals who forced open the wheel's gates. The damage, which cost £350,000 to repair, resulted in the dry well being flooded, damaging electrical and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{hydraulic}} power network {{is a system}} of interconnected pipes carrying pressurized liquid used to transmit mechanical power from a power source, like a pump, to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> like lifts or motors. The system is analogous to an electrical grid transmitting power from a generating station to end-users. Only a few {{hydraulic power}} transmission networks are still in use; modern <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> has a pump built into the machine. In the late 19th century, a hydraulic network might {{have been used in}} a factory, with a central steam engine or water turbine driving a pump and a system of high-pressure pipes transmitting power to various machines.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Entrapped trauma victims require extrication, which, on rare occasions, {{may involve}} {{amputation}} of a limb. Standard extrication techniques sometimes fail {{or may be}} impossible, leading {{to the death of}} the entrapped victim. We propose that the use of fire service <b>hydraulic</b> cutting <b>equipment</b> can be used effectively to urgently amputate a limb, where conventional techniques are unusable. Method: The study aims to determine: (i) the potential use of this equipment to achieve expeditious life-saving amputations and (ii) the effect the fire service <b>hydraulic</b> cutting <b>equipment</b> has on the bony and surrounding soft tissues. Initially a porcine limb was used followed by fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs. We recorded the time, number of cuts, proximal fracture propagation and quality of bone cut when performing amputations at five levels. Results: The experiment confirms that faster guillotine amputations in human cadaveric lower limb specimens can be achieved by using fire service <b>hydraulic</b> cutting <b>equipment.</b> Overall, the average time to complete an amputation in these ideal experimental circumstances at all five levels was quicker using the <b>hydraulic</b> cutting <b>equipment.</b> Either one or two cutting actions were required to achieve the amputation using fire service <b>hydraulic</b> cutting <b>equipment.</b> The degree and proximal extent of the comminution were greater using the fire service <b>hydraulic</b> cutting <b>equipment.</b> Conclusion: If circumstances and time constrains allow, a conventional amputation technique carried out by a trained medical practitioner would be preferable {{to the use of the}} fire service <b>hydraulic</b> cutting <b>equipment.</b> However, we feel that this technique could be used to perform emergent amputation under trained medical supervision, if it is felt that a standard amputation technique would take too long or the environment is too restrictive to perform a standard amputation safely. </p...|$|R
25|$|After new {{segments}} of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if {{the temperature of}} the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The stressing process involves either heating the rails, causing them to expand, or stretching the rails with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment.</b> They are then fastened (clipped) to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold weather the rails try to contract, but because they are firmly fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are a bit like a piece of stretched elastic firmly fastened down.|$|E
25|$|Authorities on {{each side}} work to keep out from the other that which is undesirable. For the United States, this mostly {{involves}} drugs and illegal immigrants. For Mexico, this mostly involves struggling against the importation of untaxed goods, especially automobiles. Smuggling people and drugs into the United States is big business in Mexico, but while it affects everyone living on the border, it is generally not seen, except for occasional newspaper headlines, occasional violent crime and religious articles geared {{to those in the}} trade. Illegal crossings taking place through tunnels, hidden cars and trucks or most commonly, simply passing through a gap in the fence, especially in the more remote areas. In 1990, a tunnel linking two warehouses in Agua Prieta and Douglas, AZ was discovered. It was sophisticated with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> and means to move large quantities of goods. At least three corridos have been written about this tunnel.|$|E
500|$|That same year, deHavilland {{made two}} more period films, {{beginning}} with The Great Garrick, a fictional romantic comedy about the 18th-century English actor's encounter with jealous {{players from the}} Comédie-Française who plot to embarrass {{him on his way}} to Paris. Wise to their prank, Garrick plays along with the ruse, determined to get the last laugh, even on a lovely young aristocrat, deHavilland's Germaine Dupont, whom he mistakenly believes {{to be one of the}} players. With her refined demeanor and diction, deHavilland delivers a performance that is [...] "lighthearted and thoroughly believable", according to Judith Kass. Variety praised the film, calling it [...] "a production of superlative workmanship". Despite the positive reviews, the film did not do as well at the box office. Her final film that year was Michael Curtiz's romantic drama Gold Is Where You Find It, a film about the late 19th-century conflict in the Sacramento Valley between gold miners and their <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> and farmers whose land is being flooded. DeHavilland played the daughter of a farmer, Serena Ferris, who falls in love with the mining engineer responsible for the flooding. The film was released in February 1938, and was her first appearance in three-strip Technicolor.|$|E

2500|$|Access to {{the control}} panel was poor, as it was partly {{obstructed}} by an emergency pump for the aircraft's <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment.</b> The fire extinguisher control panel included selector switches for the co-pilot to select which of the four engines to douse with CO2. Investigators found that aboard KG867 the selector switch for the port engines was in the [...] "off" [...] position and the selector for the starboard engines was switched to extinguish the inner starboard engine. This suggested that in the emergency, Warrant Officer Brož may have selected to extinguish the wrong engine by mistake.|$|E
2500|$|The {{complex is}} located inside Osówka Mountain (German: Säuferhöhen) [...] It is {{accessible}} by tunnel number1 (120m) with chambers for guardrooms and tunnel number2 (456m), bored 10m {{below the level}} of the main underground, with guardrooms close to completion. Behind them there is a connection of two levels created by the collapse of the ceiling. The structure is a grid of tunnels (1,750m, 6,700m2, 30,000m3) and underground halls, up to 8m in height. Only 6.9% is reinforced by concrete. There is a shaft leading to the surface with a diameter of 6m (48m). Tunnel number3 (107m) is not connected to the complex.

2500|$|The {{success of}} his {{hydraulic}} crane led Armstrong to consider setting up a business to manufacture cranes and other <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment.</b> He therefore resigned from his legal practice. Donkin, his legal colleague, supported him in his career move, providing financial backing for the new venture. In 1847 the firm of W. G. Armstrong & Company bought [...] of land alongside the river at Elswick, near Newcastle, and began to build a factory there. The new company received orders for hydraulic cranes from Edinburgh and Northern Railways and from Liverpool Docks, {{as well as for}} hydraulic machinery for dock gates in Grimsby. The company soon began to expand. In 1850 the company produced 45 cranes and two years later, 75. It averaged 100 cranes per year {{for the rest of the}} century. In 1850 over 300 men were employed at the works, but by 1863 this had risen to 3,800. The company soon branched out into bridge building, one of the first orders being for the Inverness Bridge, completed in 1855.|$|E
