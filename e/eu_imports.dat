As ASEAN transforms from a commodity-producing region to a supplier of manufactured goods, there has been a dramatic shift in ASEAN's exports to the EU from primary products to manufactures.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} twofold. First, against the background of an existing empirical literature on the duration of trade which has found that international trade is often of strikingly short duration, we aim to establish whether or not <b>EU</b> <b>imports</b> {{from the rest of the}} world also are short-lived. Second, since there is at this point no clear commonly accepted theoretical explanation for these short trade durations, we seek to provide a thorough empirical description and analysis of the phenomenon, with the intention of thereby facilitating theoretical developments on the subject. We employ a rich data set of detailed imports to the EU 15 countries from 140 exporters, covering the time period 1962 - 2006. Using these data, we begin by conducting a thorough descriptive analysis of the duration of <b>EU</b> <b>imports.</b> Thereafter, we perform a regression analysis using discrete-time duration models with proper controls for unobserved heterogeneity.
