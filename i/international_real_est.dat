40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the risk and}} return attributes of <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate equities over the 1980 - 1988 time period. The empirical results indicate that <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate equities offer higher returns as well as greater total and systematic risk than U. S. -based REITs. The results also indicate that <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate equities are weakly positively correlated with the return on REITs. <b>International</b> <b>real</b> estate equities achieve higher values for both the Treynor and Jensen measures than either the S&P 500 Index or the World Equities Index. <b>International</b> <b>real</b> estate equities also outperform domestic real estate companies on a risk-adjusted basis. However, <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate equities underperform the World Equities Index using the Sharpe Index which suggests that <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate equities carry significant unsystematic risk. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{benefits}} of diversification from <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate securities are generally well established. However, the drivers of <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate securities returns are insufficiently understood. We jointly examine the empirical implications of three major international asset pricing models {{that account for}} broad macroeconomic risk factors. In addition, we develop the hypothesis that an indicator of mispriced credit is significant in explaining the time series variation in <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate securities returns. We employ the returns generated by a large sample of firms from 20 countries over the period 1999 to 2011 to test our hypothesis. We find support for the predictions of the major international asset pricing models.

50|$|The term <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate {{describes}} {{a relatively new}} phenomenon, beginning in the 1980s and keeping pace with globalization. The term encompasses real property development, sales and leasing transactions across national borders. <b>International</b> <b>real</b> estate {{could be viewed as}} one of the most dynamic branches of real estate although it is, by definition, influenced by fluctuating market value in various sectors between countries, as can be evidenced by the 2008 global credit crisis.|$|R
40|$|Real estate {{investment}} {{is becoming increasingly}} international. Deregulation and integration of global capital markets, growth of emerging market economies, demographic trends in developed economies, and geopolitical and sociocultural changes the world over are presenting opportunities for <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate investors in a fascinating, complex and interconnected market place. Latin America {{seems to be one}} of the last frontiers still unexplored by <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate investors. Colombia in particular is making quiet and steady efforts to internationalize its economy and welcome Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Among the policy-makers' long-term goals, Colombia aspires to become one of the three most competitive countries in Latin America by the year 2032. <b>International</b> <b>real</b> estate investors need to adapt their tools and techniques to underwrite new and uncharted markets that present investment opportunities. This thesis proposes a comprehensive strategic framework for <b>international</b> <b>real</b> {{estate investment}}s, by adapting from selected business academic literature and real estate industry practice different decision-making approaches. The purpose of the thesis is twofold. First, by proposing a strategic framework, the work intends to contribute to the development of strategic decision-making literature in <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate investment. Second, by utilizing the strategic framework to study selected issues and variables that are deemed relevant or pertinent to the commercial real estate market in Bogota, it attempts to serve as a resource to <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate investors interested in the market. by José Camilo Otálora Castro.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{consider}} whether changes in economic fundamentals in the United States can impact on <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate markets. To this end a two-step approach is pursued. In the first step cointegration techniques are used to determine whether common trends exist in international property markets. Once common trends are identified amongst securitised property markets, a potential common driver is isolated by substituting US Gross Domestic Product for US property. The paper then uses a spectral response technique to examine the impulse response between shocks in the US economy and reactions in foreign real estate markets. The results support a linkage between the economic growth of an important {{member of the international}} economic community and <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate performance. <b>International</b> <b>Real</b> Estate Markets, Securitised Property, Cointegration, Spectral Analysis, Impulse Response...|$|R

This article tests for the presence of both price continuation and price reversals in <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate securities. The results reveal evidence of performance persistence in international markets over short and medium term horizons, however the evidence on price reversals is less compelling. The empirical analysis tests for mean reversion using Variance Ratio and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests. In neither case is there consistent evidence of mean reversion in <b>international</b> <b>real</b> estate securities. The portfolio switching tests do reveal some evidence of performance reversals. However, while under-performing markets do outperform over longer horizons, they do not do so at statistically significant levels. ...|$|R
