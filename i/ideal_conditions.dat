5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions),</b> in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its {{primary goal is}} to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E
5|$|The {{fresh water}} {{entering}} Florida Bay from the Everglades creates <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that foster animal {{life in the}} bay. Sea turtles and manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic plankton. Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, {{due to the lack}} of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch (Pleuroploca gigantea), left-handed whelk (Busycon contrarium), and the Florida crown conch (Melongena corona) as drinking vessels, picks, hammers, knives and awls.|$|E

Arranger Chris Elliott helped Hartnoll to move the album in this direction, taking music that Orbital would have produced electronically, and having it played by a union-full orchestra. People who are featured collaborating on The <b>Ideal</b> <b>Condition</b> were Robert Smith, Joseph Arthur, Lianne Hall, and Akayzia Parker.|$|R
5|$|Although most banded sugar ant colonies are monogynous (a nest that {{contains}} a single queen), some {{have been found to}} be polygynous, where a colony will have multiple queens; this is the fourth Camponotus species that is recognized as exhibiting polygyny. In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are monandrous, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their nuptial flight, although virgin queens and males (alates) were observed mating in South Australia in January. This hints that banded sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. <b>Ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> for nuptial flight is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), which is when the alates begin to swarm. A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven years or more. The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is known to adopt larvae and pupae from banded sugar ant colonies.|$|E
5|$|Crompton's damp climate {{provided}} the <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> for cotton spinning {{to be carried}} out without the cotton drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market. When suitable land in nearby Oldham (then the largest and most productive mill town in the world) had become scarce in the 1860s, there was a mill building boom in Shaw and Crompton, giving rise to the area as major mill town. The local townscape became dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills, and its former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a single town around these factories. Shaw and Crompton railway station and a goods yard was opened in 1863, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Royton had begun to encroach upon the township's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Oldham, Lees and Chadderton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.|$|E
5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E

5|$|Increased {{precipitation}} {{during the}} Tauca phase was probably {{triggered by the}} southern movement of the ITCZ and the strengthening of the South America monsoon, possibly caused by chilling in the northern hemisphere. Combined with a southern shift of high pressure zones, increased moisture during late glacial times would have flowed from the Amazon. This change, which occurred from 17,400–12,400 years or 18,000–11,000 BP, is recorded in Bolivian Chaco and Brazilian cave records. The Tauca phase may have been triggered by the southern shift of tropical atmospheric circulation. Although another theory posits that vegetation changes and lake development would have decreased the albedo of the Altiplano, resulting in warming and moisture advection of moisture towards the Altiplano, but such positive feedback mechanisms were considered questionable in a 1998 study. Persistent La Niña climatic conditions {{may have contributed to}} the lake's filling. Conversely, a global climatic warming and a northward shift of the monsoon occurred around 14,500 years ago. The <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> for the development of paleolakes in the Altiplano do not appear to exist during maximum glaciation or warm interglacial periods.|$|E
5|$|Royton's damp climate {{provided}} the <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> for cotton spinning {{to be carried}} out without the cotton drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market. By 1832, there were 12 steam powered mills in Royton, of which its former hamlets had begun to agglomerate as a town around the cotton factories, a number of small coalpits and new turnpike road from Oldham to Rochdale, which passed through the town centre. The Manchester, Oldham and Royton Railway and a goods yard was constructed in the 1860s, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged {{of the largest and most}} productive mill town in the world) had begun to encroach upon Royton's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district. The demand for cheap cotton goods from this area prompted the flotation of cotton spinning companies; the investment was followed by the construction of 22 new cotton mills in Royton. Together with Oldham, at its peak the area was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.|$|E
5|$|The {{floating}} {{stage on}} which Jarre and his musicians performed {{was built on}} top of four large barges.

One large mirror ball being transported to the event fell onto the roadside, causing a degree of confusion as some people mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less than <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions.</b> Inclement weather had threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock. Wind speeds were so high that television cameras were blown over. On the second evening the audience, which included Diana, Princess of Wales, was soaked by rain and wind.|$|E

5|$|The {{red maple}} can grow {{in a variety}} of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps. While many types of tree prefer a south or north facing aspect, the red maple {{does not appear to have}} a preference. Its <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> are in {{moderately}} well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern Michigan and New England, the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps. Additionally, Red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the region}} in and around Chadderton was {{dominated}} by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A fulling mill at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776. The damp climate below the South Pennines provided <b>ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> for textile production {{to be carried out}} without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton spinning in the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.|$|E
5|$|Virgin queens {{and males}} appear in colonies during January, before their nuptial flight. 20 females or fewer {{are found in}} a single colony, while males are much more common. The nuptial flight begins at {{different}} times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), {{but there is one}} case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July. <b>Ideal</b> <b>conditions</b> for nuptial flight are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30km/h (18mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F), and elevations of 91 metres (300ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although as many as four queens may leave the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and polyandrous, with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous. For example, nearly 80% of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly polyandrous. Nuptial flight takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a glandular secretion from the tergal gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and will drop to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. M. pulchra queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.|$|E
