40|$|Abstract. The process <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> is {{important}} in automotive performance, which impacts the safety of traffic. Several parameters <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> can be determined on stationary test stands, however, more accurate data {{that can be used}} in a more simple way in practise are gained by doing tests on the road. Based on EU legal documents on determining parameters <b>of</b> <b>braking,</b> a research methodology has been elaborated and approbated for determining parameters <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> for automobiles in road tests. To determine the parameters <b>of</b> <b>braking,</b> scientific radar Stalker ATS transferring data to a computer were used. Road tests were done for automobiles of various age groups and constructions, determining the period, distance, and deceleration rate <b>of</b> <b>braking.</b> According to the research data, the parameters <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> <b>of</b> the used automobiles comply with the standard for parameters <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> set by the EU. The effectiveness <b>of</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> does not mostly depend on the age of automobiles, but on the technical condition <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> system. Key words: distance <b>of</b> <b>braking,</b> deceleration <b>of</b> <b>braking,</b> period <b>of</b> <b>braking,</b> speed regime...|$|R
