Small grass fires around the building have also been reported. Restorations have been considered by the Goulburn City Council. The council is holding Ferrara accountable for allowing damage at the orphanage, while he <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> many development projects for the lot.

Liz, seeing Jenna miserable, visits Paul and tells her that Jenna misses him. Paul visits Jenna, though not to resume their relationship, instead to tell her that he <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a brilliant costume for the New Queer's Eve party in which guests dress up as a pop culture phenomenon from the previous year. Unbeknownst to Paul, Jenna also has the same costume idea as his and as a result the two get back together. At the party, Paul dresses like actress Natalie Portman's character in the 2010 movie Black Swan, and Jenna dresses up as former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Lynn Swann.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Tutankhamun's mummy, {{there has been a}} lot of speculation and theories on the exact cause of death, which until recent studies had been hard to prove with the evidence and data available. While it was a widely debated topic for many Egyptologists, it had also spread to the general public as popular culture <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> many conspiracy theories that played out in movies, TV shows, and fictional books. Author James Patterson has even recently written his own take in his book, The Murder of King Tut. There are many educated and respected Egyptologists as well as trained professionals in other fields who have devoted a lot of time researching Tutankhamun and who have varying beliefs to his cause of death. Some have stood by their theories even in light of new evidence. Some of the theories are better known and supported than others.|$|E
25|$|One {{case study}} with coral reef {{restoration}} {{was conducted on}} the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The University of Hawaii <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program to help relocate and restore coral reefs in Hawaii. A boat channel on the island of Oahu to the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology was overcrowded with coral reefs. Also, many areas of coral reef patches in the channel had been damaged from past dredging in the channel. Dredging covers the existing corals with sand, and their larvae cannot build and thrive on sand; they can only build on to existing reefs. Because of this, the University of Hawaii decided to relocate some of the coral reef to a different transplant site. They transplanted them {{with the help of the}} United States Army divers, to a relocation site relatively close to the channel. They observed very little, if any, damage occurred to any of the colonies while they were being transported, and no mortality of coral reefs has been observed on the new transplant site, but they will be continuing to monitor the new transplant site to see how potential environmental impacts (i.e. ocean acidification) will harm the overall reef mortality rate. While trying to attach the coral to the new transplant site, they found the coral placed on hard rock is growing considerably well, and coral was even growing on the wires that attached the transplant corals to the transplant site. This gives new hope to future research on coral reef transplant sites. As a result of this coral restoration project, no environmental effects were seen from the transplantation process, no recreational activities were decreased, and no scenic areas were affected by the project. This is a great example that coral transplantation and restoration can work and thrive under the right conditions, which means there may be hope for other damaged coral reefs.|$|E
500|$|Will Ferrell's {{character}} received {{criticism in}} the episode. White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting {{that she did not}} have a handle on the character and that he was too [...] "downright normal" [...] and [...] "practically boring". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do". He further noted that [...] "nobody <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a good reason for him being here other than that he's Will Ferrell." ...|$|E

Aditya Music marketed the film's soundtrack. Compared to other songs, Sastry took more time to complete the lyrics of the song [...] "Jaago". Siva explained the situation to Sastry during the film's shoot at Karaikudi and at Ramoji Film City, and Sastry took input from him. Prasad composed it in the indie rock genre. Haasan revealed that [...] "Charuseela" [...] was based on her character in the film and that the tune had been inspired by one of Michael Jackson compositions. Regarding that song, Prasad said, [...] "It's a peppy dance number that has Mahesh sporting an uber stylish look. Lyricist Ramajogayya Sastry <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a fusion of chaste Telugu words and English slang and I incorporated the Michael Jackson rhythm in the song".|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five and criticized various {{elements}} of the episode's direction. They wrote, [...] "Chris Carter the writer <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> something playful and light and charming. And Chris Carter the director has stamped all over it and made it so arch and obvious and dull that it kills it stone dead." [...] Shearman and Pearson praised the idea of [...] "a town which feels like an X-Files audience", but derided the episode's comic book setting and wrote that [...] "this play on post-modernism just doesn't make any sense [...] a comic has action, a way of jumping from frame to frame... this is languorous and self-indulgent." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote that the episode [...] "falls flatter than the chemical pancakes used to anesthetize the victims of this episode" [...] due to its [...] "collection of situations and observances that bear little relation to each other." [...] Vitaris also criticized the scene wherein various characters are compared to animals, and commented, [...] "the mean spiritedness of [...] is mind-boggling". Finally, she called the episode's conclusion a [...] "false ending".|$|E
500|$|However, Ryan Book of Music Times, {{was less}} {{critical}} with his review: [...] " [...] {{took a break}} from colorful music videos {{to make a statement}} of racial relations... the song uses a less clear sample than the other tracks, but interpolates his words into the electronic breakdown {{at the end of the}} song". Marc Robisch of Thought Catalog felt that [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] is [...] "one of the most interesting out of any on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.", further adding that the outro of the song resembles the work of M.I.A.. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was mixed with his review, stating that the song [...] "is a jarring buzz kill – and that's what's appealing about L.A.M.B., even if it such a shallow celebration of fleeting style and outdated bling-bling culture, it can grate". [...] A review from Traxionary described [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] as [...] "a plea for interracial love–or the tolerant embrace of it–the central contention that [...] "beauty" [...] can be [...] "black or white/yellow or green"". In an extremely positive review of the track, Mike Usinger writing for The Georgia Straight, claimed that [...] " [...] a surprisingly soulful duet with Andre 3000, Stefani <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the kind of solo album that gets singers thinking that maybe they don't need a backing band at all," [...] referencing Stefani's time spent with No Doubt.|$|E

500|$|As in {{previous}} seasons, filming {{of the third}} season of the series included {{a large amount of}} improvisation from the cast. For example, during one scene in [...] "The Fight" [...] in which almost the entire cast becomes intoxicated at the Snakehole Lounge bar, each actor spent about two days on their own filming their own individual scenes. Much of the filming was improvised, including shots used in a montage sequence that showed how drunk each character had become {{by the end of the}} night. Amy Poehler described the filming as [...] "the most fun I've ever had". Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally also improvised a great deal of their scenes during the filming of [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two". The third season continued to use several visual and camera techniques that had been introduced in past seasons. In the past, Poehler would improvise several different jokes during a take, and they would be intermingled into a montage of jump cuts featuring many of the jokes. That technique was used prominently in [...] "Indianapolis" [...] during a scene in which Leslie comforts Ann with stories about multiple times Leslie was dumped in the past. The same technique was used by Aziz Ansari in [...] "Soulmates", during a scene in which Tom describes many slang nicknames he has given to foods, and in [...] "The Fight", in which Tom describes many strange entrepreneurial idea he <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B+, calling it [...] "a damned odd episode {{to end a}} season on, if still an effective one". VanDerWerff felt that [...] "Paper Dove" [...] represented [...] "the deepest the show has pulled us into a killer’s subconscious", making it [...] "one of the most bone-chilling episodes Millennium <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> so far". VanDerWerff compared elements of the episode, most notably {{the relationship between the}} character of Henry Dion and his mother, to the works of filmmaker David Lynch, particularly his television series Twin Peaks. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that it [...] "caps off the series sensationally". Gibron also praised Starr's guest role, describing it as [...] "a stellar interpretation". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Paper Dove" [...] four stars out of five. Shearman felt that the series found a comfortable [...] "tonal nuance" [...] in the episode that worked for it, but felt {{that by the end of}} the first season none of the supporting cast had been developed well enough to play against Henriksen's Frank Black, noting [...] "there are half a dozen actors who could be termed regulars ... but without exception they remain functional ciphers".|$|E
500|$|Bedtime Stories {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , praised the album for being [...] "considerably more tame in tone and image than [...] ethereal sounding, sexually explicit" [...] content. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, claiming that it is a [...] "warm album" [...] and that it [...] "offers her most humane and open music". Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a positive review as well, giving it a B+ grade, and writing that [...] "the new tracks work less as individual songs than as a sustained mood" [...] and that Madonna [...] "still has something to reveal". Barbara O'Dair of Rolling Stone also gave the album a three-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that [...] "Madonna <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> awfully compelling sounds". Billboard, while giving the album a positive review, commented that it [...] "sticks to a pop recipe that yields hits galore, with little excess baggage". In 2015, Billboard ranked it as Madonna's sixth best album; [...] "while not as hardcore as 1992's Erotica, Bedtime captured Madonna in transition, swiveling away from explicit sexuality and relying on R and balladry before she dove headfirst into dance music four years later. Songs like 'Human Nature', 'Secret' and 'I'd Rather Be Your Lover' proved more compelling than most of the New Jack music being released in the mid-90s, and 'Take a Bow' added a classic slow jam to Madge's canon". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Bedtime Stories a positive review and {{four out of five}} stars, writing that it is [...] "a fluffy-pillowed concept album that unfolds like a musical fairy tale".|$|E

He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E

[...] Andrew C. Bradick of Prefix Magazine gave the album a favorable review and called it [...] "Wilco's first step toward aging well, but it transcends transition and is an album that sounds right in its place and time." [...] Alan Shulman of No Ripcord gave it a score of eight stars out of ten and said, [...] "Wilco <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> 50% of a classic album and 50% of a merely decent one. Buy it for the moments you simply won’t hear anywhere else." [...] Will Hermes of Spin gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it [...] "A near-perfect album by a band that seems, finally, to have found their identity." [...] Alternative Press gave it four stars out of five and said, [...] "It's apparent it takes deft skill to sound this simple." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes also gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "While the elders will rejoice [...] this sober, satisfied, and craftily subdued effort, the younglings of the bunch, with their abbreviated attention spans, iPod shuffles, and demand for instant gratification, will declare the album a boring and lethargic affair." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine likewise gave it four stars out of five and said that [...] "Though it may not fit comfortably alongside any other albums in Wilco's catalogue, Sky Blue Sky is further confirmation that, even at their most retro, they're among contemporary pop music's most vital acts." [...] Likewise, Graeme Thomson of The Observer gave it four stars and said, [...] "The closer {{you listen to the}} jazzy guitars, Beatles touches and easy, shuffling rhythms ... the more it transpires that Tweedy is simply allowing the songs sufficient room to speak up for themselves." ...|$|E
