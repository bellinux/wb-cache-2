5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 {{includes}} a multiplayer option which allows two players to cooperatively {{play the game}} by taking turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi (a palette swap of Mario). Through this mode, players can access several mini-games, including a remake of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, in which one player {{has the opportunity to}} steal the cards of another but may lose their turn <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> the mini-game.|$|E
5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature {{the concept of}} permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E
5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth, giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. Keep the money and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E

25|$|Number Four is {{the primary}} defence player. They can move {{anywhere}} on the field, but they usually try to prevent scoring. The emphasis on defence by the Number Four allows the Number Three to attempt more offensive plays, since {{they know that they}} will be covered <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> the ball.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study of}} one {{skeleton}} of the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus concluded that this dinosaur grew even faster, reaching its full size {{at the age}} of about 15; the main evidence was the number and spacing of growth rings in its bones. The authors found this consistent with a life-cycle theory that prey species should grow faster than their predators <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> a lot of juveniles to predators and the local environment provides enough resources for rapid growth.|$|E
25|$|The player {{operates}} a rapid-fire main cannon, {{which can be}} upgraded by collecting power-ups found in blue boxes that periodically descend {{from the top of}} the screen. As the main cannon's power level is upgraded, the number of bullets fired from the ship as well as their speed increases. In addition, the player {{operates a}} specialty weapon that is separate from the main cannon. There are eight different specialty weapons, each represented by differently-numbered power-ups. The player can change the type of specialty weapon equipped by collecting a differently-numbered power-up or can upgrade their current specialty weapon by collecting a numbered power-up that matches their current weapon. These weapons range from directional bullets to shields to indestructible projectiles. Players lose all accumulated power-ups <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> a life.|$|E

25|$|Hafey {{strongly}} {{believed in}} leaving players in their designated position, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were <b>losing</b> to their opponent, which attracted criticism {{when the team}} lost. By contrast, virtually all players are rotated in modern play as the coach seeks match-ups favourable to the team.|$|R
500|$|Water {{makes up}} between 62-68% of a horse's body weight and is {{essential}} for life. [...] Horses can only live a few days without water, becoming dangerously dehydrated <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> 8-10% of their natural body water. Therefore, it is critically important for horses {{to have access to}} a fresh, clean, and adequate supply of water.|$|E
500|$|Wanting {{to prove}} himself, Mike enters the university's [...] "Scare Games", {{and makes a}} wager with Hardscrabble to {{reinstate}} him and his team to the scare program if they win, but Mike must leave the university <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose.</b> He joins a group of misfits named Oozma Kappa, the weakest fraternity on campus, but they are denied entry to the Games for being one team member short. Sulley subsequently joins them, seeing the competition as his ticket back into the scare program. Oozma Kappa finish last in the first challenge, but are saved from elimination after another team is disqualified for cheating. Oozma Kappa improve gradually due to Mike's training, intricate knowledge of scaring, and they advance through each following challenge, finishing just behind competition favorites, Roar Omega Roar. In the final round, they defeat Roar Omega Roar with a decisive final scare by Mike in the simulation bedroom. However, Mike soon discovers that he only won because Sulley changed the machine's difficulty to the easiest setting.|$|E
500|$|A {{longtime}} {{advocate of}} health care reform, Neal {{was involved in the}} major health care reform efforts of 1993–94 and 2009–10. In working on the unsuccessful Clinton health care plan of 1993 he balanced his desire for health care reform with the interests of the major health insurance and medical companies in his district, achieving a compromise allowing insurance companies to charge small businesses higher premiums. He was later involved writing the House's 2009 health care reform bill, the Affordable Health Care for America Act. As chairman of the Select Revenue Measures subcommittee, he had a hand in developing the bill's financing plan. He explained that his priorities were to address [...] "pre-existing conditions, capping out-of-pocket expenses and making sure people don't lose their health care <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> their job". Despite his support for the act, he spoke about his preference for a [...] "piecemeal" [...] approach to health care reform, saying it would allow for a more reasonable debate.|$|E
50|$|Players {{can place}} money in banks for safe keeping. This is useful <b>if</b> <b>they</b> ever <b>lose</b> a battle at sea, {{as they can}} start over with their savings. However, your savings are reduced by the {{interest}} rate over time, as you are paying for security.|$|R

50|$|Way of the Samurai 3 {{focuses on}} sword combat. There are over 100 {{weapons in the}} game, {{including}} swords, spears, and even some joke weapons like sticks, green onion, tuna, brooms, and hoes. Players can now kneel down and beg for mercy <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are <b>losing</b> the fight. NPCs can also do this.|$|R
500|$|The player {{starts with}} a single LocoRoco. When this LocoRoco eats a berry, it grows by one, up to a maximum size of twenty. The single large LocoRoco may be split into {{individual}} beings by pressing [...] or through specific points on the level, while individual LocoRoco can merge back into a single being by holding down [...] Manipulation of the LocoRoco in this manner {{may be necessary to}} guide them to the finish; while the single large LocoRoco is easier to control, small passages can only be navigated by individual LocoRoco. The player can lose LocoRoco if they are touched by harmful objects or they run into the Moja, and the game will be over <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> all their LocoRoco. With the exception of making them jump, the player does not otherwise directly control the LocoRoco, but instead controls the planet itself, tilting the planet using the L and R buttons. [...] This causes the LocoRoco to roll in the direction of tilt, as well as causing certain mechanical objects such as platforms to also tilt. [...] The player can also cause the LocoRoco to jump by holding and releasing both buttons; this not only allows the LocoRoco a way to cross gaps, but to burst through walls as well as harm the Moja without taking damage. As the player collects more LocoRoco in a level, the music gains more voices, each LocoRoco singing a part in the overall song.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the first season of Luke Cage, The Atlantics David Sims wrote on the pacing issue of Marvel's Netflix series, a common {{complaint}} to that point, stating, [...] "After two seasons of Daredevil, one of Jessica Jones, and now one of Luke Cage, the Netflix model feels fundamentally flawed, encouraging the kind of molasses-slow plotting comic books are designed to eschew. The problem isn’t that these shows are bad, necessarily... But they all take far too long to get going, by which point many viewers will have already tuned out." [...] He felt one of the problems was the fact that Netflix does not rely on viewers tuning into a particular series as broadcast series do each week, but rather subscribers who, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> interest, [...] "can take as long as they want to catch up... as long as they keep paying their subscription fee every month." [...] The Netflix series are also afforded the opportunity to explore elements in more detail, with Sims noting [...] "A lot of this detail [...] good, {{but it could have been}} considerably compressed—none of the Marvel Netflix series, so far, would have lost much by being squeezed into 10 episodes, or even 8. If Netflix shaved the 60-minute running time down quite a bit, it would likely inspire more economical—and better—storytelling from its shows." [...] Sims concluded by saying, [...] "What’s most frustrating of all is that Netflix isn’t getting rid of this approach anytime soon. Daredevil season three, Jessica Jones season two, Iron Fist, and The Punisher are all on their way, and each will follow the same 13-episode structure... The only respite may come in the form of The Defenders, a planned crossover series... over the course of just eight episodes. Who knows? The show might even surprise viewers and explain its villain’s motivations within the first hour. Until then, fans will be stuck needlessly giving over entire days to these series, while others are deterred from watching at all." [...] In her review for the first season of Iron Fist, Allison Keene of Collider.com spoke more on the pacing of Marvel's Netflix series, stating, [...] "By focusing so intently on making these series... much more grounded in a gritty real world than what we typically expect from a superhero show (like DC's candy-colored [...] on The CW), the problem is that they miss out on the key element: this [...] be fantastical entertainment." [...] With The Defenders, Jeff Jansen of Entertainment Weekly felt many improvements were made to the general complaints the previous seasons received. He said, [...] "The Defenders is far from perfect. But it’s an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations that I hope Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist. If Danny Rand must persist, add him to the other shows and let the stronger players carry him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each team nominates three batsmen and one bowler {{to play a}} one-over {{per side}} [...] "mini-match". The team which bats second in the match bats first in the Super Over.

As {{they lack the}} [...] "shell" [...] of Average People, the Dead Inside {{are aware of the}} supernatural; however, they lack the spiritual resources to make frequent use of supernatural powers. Instead, most Dead Inside seek to regain their old souls, or build new ones. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> are successful in this endeavour and they manage to 'ensoul', they will become Sensitives. <b>If,</b> however, <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> their last shards of a soul, they will become Qlippoth.|$|R

50|$|Ponzi schemes {{sometimes}} commence {{operations as}} legitimate investment vehicles, such as hedge funds. Hedge funds can easily degenerate into a Ponzi-type scheme <b>if</b> <b>they</b> unexpectedly <b>lose</b> money {{or fail to}} legitimately earn the returns expected. If the promoters fabricate false returns or produce fraudulent audit reports instead of admitting their failure to meet expectations, the operation is a Ponzi scheme.|$|R
2500|$|Swarm is an action-platform game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} up to 50 characters known as swarmites who operate as a collective to achieve their goals.

2500|$|The nine {{participants}} of the Dcom experiment are kidnapped by a masked individual known as Zero, who makes them play a coin toss; if they win, they are set free with {{no memory of}} what happened, and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> they awake in a facility separated into three wards, with one team in each. After losing, {{they are forced to}} play the [...] "Decision Game", and submit a vote for one of the teams; the one with the most votes gets executed.

2500|$|Another long-standing {{tradition}} at Georgia Tech, {{which began}} in 1915, requires freshmen to wear a RAT cap, which stands for [...] "Recruit at Tech", around campus, and most notably to football games. [...] The caps are decorated with the football team's scores, the freshman's name, hometown, major, and expected graduation date, and [...] "To HELL With Georgia" [...] emblazoned {{on the back of}} the cap. [...] Tradition states that freshmen are required to wear the RAT cap at least until the Georgia-Georgia Tech game, where they can take it off after the game for a Georgia Tech win, or keep it on the remainder of the freshman year <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose.</b> [...] Anti-hazing laws have loosened the strictness and overall participation by most freshmen at Georgia Tech, except in the volunteer marching band.|$|E
5000|$|Lutherans {{follow a}} similar {{theology}} of godparents as Roman Catholics.

2500|$|The {{documentary}} followed five Filipino transsexuals, each {{in different}} stage of gender transition and {{often referred to}} by their feminine names, who have emigrated to Israel to work as health care providers for elderly Orthodox Jewish men. Religious rules forbid the Orthodox men from being touched by women, so their carers must be male. [...] On their nights off, the transsexuals perform in Tel Aviv nightclubs as a drag group called [...] "Paper Dolls". [...] They are among 300,000 foreign immigrants who came to Israel {{in the wake of}} the Second Intifada to fill lowly jobs that had been handled by Palestinians. Their status is precarious because they cannot file for citizenship and their visas are revoked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>lose</b> their jobs.

40|$|Abstract: Labour {{poaching}} is {{a potential}} problem in work-linked training systems. Once trained, young people can be poached by rival firms, which threatened the training firm’s investment. A distinction is made between two types of workforce poaching. It is shown that it may be rational for some firms to train young people, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> then <b>lose</b> part of their workforce. However, this situation is not socially optimal: it does not exclude underinvestment or skilled labour shortages. This may justify government intervention. However, the introduction of subsidies can have perverse effects...|$|R
