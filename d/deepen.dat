40|$|We have {{previously}} visualized three Ca 2 + transients, generated by release from intracellular stores, which {{are associated with}} cytokinesis during the early cell division cycles of zebrafish embryos: the furrow positioning, propagation and <b>deepening</b> transients. Here we demonstrate the requirement of the latter for furrow <b>deepening,</b> and identify the Ca 2 + release channels responsible for generating the <b>deepening</b> transient. The introduction of the Ca 2 + buffer 5, 5 '-dibromo-BAPTA, at an appropriate time to challenge only the <b>deepening</b> transient, resulted in the dissipation of this transient and an inhibition of furrow <b>deepening.</b> Introduction of antagonists of the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptor (heparin and 2 -aminoethoxydiphenylborate; 2 -APB) at the appropriate time, blocked the furrow <b>deepening</b> transient and resulted in an inhibition of furrow <b>deepening.</b> In contrast, antagonists of the ryanodine receptor and the NAADP-sensitive channel {{had no effect on}} either the furrow <b>deepening</b> transient or on furrow <b>deepening.</b> In addition, microinjection of IP 3 led to the release of calcium from IP 3 -sensitive stores, whereas the introduction of caffeine or cADPR failed to induce any increase in intracellular Ca 2 +. Our new data thus support the idea that Ca 2 + released via IP 3 receptors is essential for generating the furrow <b>deepening</b> transient and demonstrate a requirement for a localized cytosolic Ca 2 + rise for the furrow <b>deepening</b> process. We also present data to show that the endoplasmic reticulum and IP 3 receptors are localized {{on either side of the}} cleavage furrow, thus providing the intracellular Ca 2 + store and release mechanism for generating the <b>deepening</b> transient...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the impact of interest-rate reforms on {{financial}} <b>deepening</b> in Botswana, one of Africa's economic development success stories. We employ three proxies of financial <b>deepening</b> against deposit rate, a proxy for interest-rate reforms. The financial <b>deepening</b> in this study is defined as the increase in the relative size and role of the financial system in an economy. The empirical results of our study show that the impact of interest-rate reforms on financial <b>deepening</b> is sensitive to the variable used as a proxy for financial <b>deepening.</b> When the ratio of bank deposits to GDP (BD/GDP) is used as a proxy for financial <b>deepening,</b> the interest-rate reforms impact positively on the level of financial <b>deepening.</b> However, when the monetization variable (M 2 /GDP) and the ratio of the private sector credit to GDP (DCP/GDP) are used, the coefficient of the deposit rate in the financial <b>deepening</b> model turns out to be statistically insignificant. Overall, our results show that the positive impact of interest-rate reforms on financial <b>deepening</b> in Botswana is minimal. This outcome, though contrary to our expectations, is not surprising given the high level of population dependency in Botswana. Our results show that there is a strong negative relationship between the dependency ratio and financial <b>deepening</b> in Botswana.
