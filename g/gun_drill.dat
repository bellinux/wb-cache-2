25|$|Unlike most of Britain's defence forces, 3 AA Division was {{frequently}} in action during the so-called Phoney War that lasted from September 1939 to May 1940. The first action occurred unexpectedly on 16 October 1939, when nine enemy aircraft suddenly {{appeared out of}} cloud and dived on warships off Rosyth Dockyard, close to the Forth Bridge. No warning had been given, but the crews of 71 HAA Rgt were undergoing <b>gun</b> <b>drill</b> and the gun positions hastily loaded for a 'crash' action under individual gun control, normal prediction being impossible against diving and turning targets. A total of 104 rounds were fired and one aircraft had its tail shot off (fighters accounted for another two). HMS Southampton was damaged. These {{are thought to have}} been the first British guns to open fire against the enemy during the war.|$|E
2500|$|The diameter-to-length {{ratio of}} the drill bit is usually between 1:1 and 1:10.

50|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> {{can be done}} {{on several}} kinds of machine tools. On lathes, it is {{generally}} practical with hole depths of less than 50 diameters. There are also purpose-built <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> machines, where longer aspect ratios can be drilled.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> was {{originally}} developed to <b>drill</b> out <b>gun</b> barrels {{and is used}} commonly for drilling smaller diameter deep holes. The depth-to-diameter ratio can be even greater than 300:1. The key feature of <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> is that the bits are self-centering; this is what allows for such deep accurate holes. The bits use a rotary motion similar to a twist drill; however, the bits are designed with bearing pads that slide along {{the surface of the}} hole keeping the drill bit on center. <b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> is usually done at high speeds and low feed rates.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> is {{possible}} over {{a range of}} depths and diameters. For diameters between 1-3 mm, <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> can be performed successfully with special equipment. It is a common process between 3-50mm in diameter. It is also possible for the 50-75 mm range, however less efficient than BTA deep hole drilling.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>drills</b> [...] are {{straight}} fluted drills which allow cutting fluid (either compressed air or a suitable liquid) to be injected through the drill's hollow {{body to the}} cutting face. They are used for deep drilling—a depth-to-diameter ratio of 300:1 or more is possible. Gun barrels are the obvious example; hence the name. Other uses include moldmaking, diemaking, and the manufacture of combustion engine parts such as crankcase, cylinder head, and woodwind musical instruments, such as uilleann pipes, as <b>gun</b> <b>drills</b> can drill long straight holes in metal, wood, and some plastics. The coolant provides lubrication and cooling to the cutting edges and removes the swarf or chips from the hole. Modern <b>gun</b> <b>drills</b> use carbide tips to prolong life and reduce total cost when compared with metal tips. Speed of drilling depends on the material being drilled, rotational speed, and the drill diameter; a high speed drill can cut a hole in P20 steel at 30 inches per minute.|$|R

50|$|Installing linear {{position}} sensors into {{hydraulic cylinders}} {{has been a}} sore subject for cylinder manufacturers for a long time. Extensive fabrication headaches, including <b>gun</b> <b>drilling,</b> the need to stock all different sensor lengths, and handling issues have contributed to industry frustration. CPI has been developing {{a new generation of}} sensors which eliminates the need for <b>gun</b> <b>drilling.</b> CPI SL Series Sensors install into standard hydraulic cylinders with minimal modifications and are suitable for field retrofit where rod-type sensors have failed. The cable connector installs into the piston or rod via a 7/16”-20 threaded connector, and the sensor is coupled to the cylinder via a hydraulic hose through a #8 SAE port.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} few years, process {{monitoring}} of drilling processes using force and vibration signals has successfully been established. However, only few investigations were performed in the monitoring of chip breakage and chip transportation, while in <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> these properties are more relevant to ensure process robustness and performance than force and vibration. This paper presents a new monitoring approach of chip frequency and transportation for <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> processes using infrared light reflection next to the <b>drilling</b> bush. <b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> is a high performance cutting process used for small diameter and large aspect ratio drilling operations {{in the field of}} automotive, aeronautic, power generation and medical devices. The usage of new harder materials for future products increases the challenge of proper chip transportation and raises the need of chip monitoring being able to operate with economically acceptable parameters. The approach of optical chip detection highlights the opportunity of detecting chips smaller than 1 mm and velocities in axial direction of more than 16 m/s clearly and suggests new characteristic values to be used for process validation. For implementing the measurement principle a new sensor is designed. In addition, the opportunities of future data analysis and detection of characteristic values are explained...|$|R
50|$|Irish {{language}} {{is the primary}} language when a body of soldiers is on the square, but in cases where live ammunition is used or where <b>gun</b> <b>drill</b> for live ammunition practice or deployment is being carried out, English commands are used {{to ensure that the}} order is fully understood. Examples of this substitution would be mounting the guard or artillery <b>gun</b> <b>drill.</b> Because foot and arm drill commands are passed down by word of mouth through training, the Irish commands have become distorted from their original pronunciations. In the same way that has occurred in the British Army (the subject of many parodies with screaming Sergeant Majors), words of command lose their defined pronunciation; examples being Aire (Arra) which often becomes Ahha and Cle (Kley) which is sometimes distorted to Hey or Huy.|$|E

5000|$|With a {{standard}} twist drill, {{it is difficult}} to drill a straight and accurately sized hole of a depth more than about 5 times the diameter. This is a problem in many manufacturing processes, especially the firearms industry: the barrel of a gun must be very straight and accurately sized. Gun barrels are far longer than their inside diameter; as an example, the [...]223 inch (5.56 mm) caliber barrel of the M16 rifle is 20 inches (508 mm) long, nearly 90 times the diameter of the bore.
