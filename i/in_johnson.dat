5|$|The WSGA, led by Frank Wolcott (WSGA Member {{and large}} North Platte rancher), hired gunmen with the {{intention}} of eliminating alleged rustlers <b>in</b> <b>Johnson</b> County and breaking up the NWFSGA. By that time, prominent names in Wyoming started taking sides. Acting Governor Amos W. Barber supported the cattlemen, who blamed the small ranchers and homesteaders for the criminal activity in the state, while former cowboy and sheriff of Buffalo (the county seat of Johnson County), Red Angus, supported the homesteaders, who believed that the cattle barons were stealing their land.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Powell v. Alabama in 1932, the United States Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to {{defendants}} in capital trials, that is trials where capital punishment was a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own counsel. <b>In</b> <b>Johnson</b> v. Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded this principle to cover all federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to State courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, the court has affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation {{after they have been}} arrested (Miranda v. Arizona), and for line-ups (United States v. Wade).|$|E
5|$|Tensions <b>in</b> <b>Johnson</b> County {{remained}} high. On May 10, a Marshal named George Wellman, who {{had been}} appointed deputy U.S. Marshal by Marshall Rankin, was ambushed and killed by locals {{en route to the}} small community of Buffalo. The incident received national attention, with Wellman being the only Marshal to die in the war. His death was grieved by a large crowd, and his funeral service took place in St. Lukes Church, Buffalo. The 6th Cavalry who was sent to relieve the county of its violence, was said to be influenced by intense local political and social pressure, and they were unable to keep the peace. In one incident, a group of men set fire to the Post exchange and planted a homemade bomb in the cavalry's barracks. Noted officer Charles B. Gatewood was seriously injured by the bomb blast in the barracks; shattering his left arm and disabling him from serving in the Cavalry anymore.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson County War, {{also known}} as the War on Powder River and the Wyoming Range War, was a range {{conflict}} that took place <b>in</b> <b>Johnson</b> County, Wyoming between 1889 and 1893. The conflicts began when cattle companies started ruthlessly persecuting alleged rustlers in the area, many of whom were innocent settlers that competed with them for land, livestock and water rights. As tensions swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, violence finally culminated in Powder River Country, when the ranchers hired armed gunmen to invade the county and wipe out the smaller settlements and alleged rustlers. The gunmen's initial incursion in the territory aroused the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling stand-off. The siege ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted in the following months.|$|E

5|$|The Marshall Court (18011835) had {{repeatedly}} {{taken up the}} issue of aboriginal title in the United States. However, with the exception of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), which was dismissed for lack of original jurisdiction, all the disputes had been between non-Indianstypically between those who derived their title from the government and those who derived their title from private purchases from Indians. The uniform rule of these cases, enunciated most clearly <b>in</b> <b>Johnson</b> v. M'Intosh (1823), was that non-Indians could not acquire valid land title from such private purchases. However, the purchase at issue in Fellows, the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838), had been ratified by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} Vice President had been vacant sixteen times {{due to the}} death or {{resignation}} of the Vice President or his succession to the presidency.

At that time, the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 provided that the President pro tempore of the Senate would succeed Johnson if he was removed from office. Had the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson resulted <b>in</b> <b>Johnson</b> being removed from office, Senator Benjamin Wade, then the President pro tempore of the Senate, would have become acting president pending a special presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish <b>in</b> <b>Johnson</b> Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016.

The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E
