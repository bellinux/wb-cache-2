500|$|Koubek {{defended his}} work from criticisms {{that it was}} boxlike, sterile, repetitive, and dull. [...] "Good {{architecture}} ... has to fit {{the fabric of the}} city and be functional inside and make economic sense. The most wonderful building in the world <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> built if it will not make money." [...] Others defended his work as well. Oliver T. Carr, chairman of the giant real estate developer CarrAmerica, said, [...] "He was good. He was different from so many architects of that time. His buildings had clean architectural lines, and yet they were functional and practical and offered good work space. For that period of time, he was a perfect fit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{the founder}} of Pandora stated that the company {{may be on the}} verge of collapse. Royalty fees account for a {{majority}} portion of Pandora's revenues. If an agreement between Pandora and SoundExchange had not been reached, it could have meant the end of Pandora. [...] "We're losing money as it is," [...] said Tim Westergren.

2500|$|The studio {{brought in}} screenwriter W. D. Richter, a veteran script doctor (and {{director}} of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai) to extensively rewrite the script, {{as he felt}} that the Wild West and fantasy elements didnâ€™t work together. The screenwriter modernized everything. Almost everything in the original script was discarded except for Lo Pan's story. Richter realized that [...] "what it needed wasn't a rewrite but a complete overhaul. It was a dreadful screenplay. This happens often when scripts are bought and there's no intention that the original writers will stay on". Richter used Rosemary's Baby as his template, presenting [...] "the foreground story in a familiar context [...] rather than San Francisco at the turn-of-the-century, which distances the audience immediately [...] and just have one simple remove, the world underground, you have a much better chance of making direct contact with the audience". He wrote his own draft in 10 weeks. Goldman contacted Richter and suggested that he should not work on the project. Richter told him, [...] "I'm sorry the studio doesn't want to go forward with you guys, but my turning it down <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you the job. They'll just hire someone else".|$|E
2500|$|In the Brooklyn office, Giles and O'Keefe tell a loan {{counselor}} {{they want}} to buy a house, and that an abusive pimp is [...] "aggressively" [...] pursuing Giles. She [...] "wanted to leave because it is scary being subjected to a huge man who has control over your life." [...] The ACORN counselor advises her [...] "you get a tin if [...] is going to come beat you... you get a tin and bury it down in there and you put the money right in and you put grass over it and you don't tell a single soul." [...] When discussing getting a house and Giles' earnings, O'Keefe says that Giles is very honest and an ACORN counselor replies, [...] "honest <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you the house that is why you probably been denied cause you probably going in saying." [...] Another stated to Giles, [...] "you can't say what you do for a living." [...] For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a [...] "freelancer". The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.|$|E

5000|$|Again {{something}} {{written before}} Tommy {{had actually been}} formed as a total idea, and that particular song wasn't about Tommy's devotees at all.

6000|$|Why {{should she}} give her {{allegiance}} to this world, {{and let it}} so dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled life was turned into nothing? She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a prisoner in the dry, tyrannical man-world.

[...] "One ought always to overpay them," [...] March sighed, [...] "and I will do it from this time forth; we shall not be much the poorer for it. That heyduk <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off {{with less than a}} mark when we come out." [...] As an earnest of his good faith he gave the old man who showed them to their box a tip that made him bow double, and he bought every conceivable libretto and play-bill offered him at prices fixed by his remorse.|$|E

50|$|Cobb {{realizes he}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his woman and breaks down. Tommy realizes {{that there is}} a solution, namely that a pair of lonely women (ostensibly prostitutes) would {{certainly}} welcome Cobb's presence. Cobb proceeds to their house, and although it is across the border in Texas, where he is a wanted outlaw, the women roughly throw him off his horse and gleefully drag him across.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to this analysis Irfan Husain writing in Dawn agreed with her assessment and called for more drone attacks. He wrote 'We need {{to wake up to}} the reality that the enemy has grown very strong in the years we temporized and tried to do deals with them. Clearly, we need allies in this fight. Howling at the moon <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> us the cooperation we so desperately need. A solid case can be made for more drone attacks, not less.|$|E

50|$|As {{the trial}} opens, Fleming makes a casual remark to Arthur {{about wanting to}} rape the victim again, which pushes an already disgusted Arthur to a {{breaking}} point. In his opening statement, Arthur begins by mocking Bowers' case while speculating on the ultimate objective of the American legal system. He appears {{to be making a}} strong case to exonerate Fleming but unexpectedly bursts out and says that the prosecution <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Fleming, because he is going to get him and declares that his client is guilty.|$|E

5000|$|We had the Cold War. The Falklands. The Nuclear State. The {{prospect}} of a miners' strike. Greenham Common. It was Thatcher's Britain. At the BBC, there was no political dimension in their popular drama whatsoever. And I was really depressed about it, as indeed were other writers that I knew. And so, I said to my closest colleagues: 'The only thing one can do is actually write stuff that one knows <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> made, but at least we'll {{get it out of}} our system.' And that's how I started to write Edge Of Darkness. I didn't really think that it stood much of a chance of being produced.|$|E

5000|$|V. N. Khare, {{a former}} Chief Justice of India, implicitly criticised the trial judge, {{saying that it}} should have been an [...] "open and shut" [...] case and that [...] Sometimes when the police, the {{prosecution}} and the lawyers all have connections with the criminals, the judge should be slightly proactive. He should try to get to the truth, and not depend totally on the evidence provided in court. In a case like this, he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> proper evidence. Mostly the judiciary is depended on the evidence provided by the investigative agencies, but now when the situation is so bad, the judges have to wake up, be proactive and find the truth.|$|E
