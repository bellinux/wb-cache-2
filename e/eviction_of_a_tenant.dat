50|$|The {{women of}} Quinn Square were <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> mostly working class {{women living in}} Quinn Square, Bethnal Green, London who, in August 1938, {{organised}} a rent strike {{in reaction to the}} attempted <b>eviction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female <b>tenant</b> with “the landlord alleging that she owed arrears”. After an investigation it became clear that not only was she being overcharged, but that this overcharging was the case for 70 of the 90 controlled rents.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a rent control regime where rent increases on, and <b>eviction</b> <b>of,</b> <b>a</b> sitting <b>tenant</b> are not allowed. However when an apartment becomes vacant the landlord {{is free to}} negotiate a new rent. Under such a regime, if inflation exists, landlords prefer to rent to short-staying tenants. Since departure-date-contingent contracts are forbidden and a landlord cannot tell whether <b>a</b> <b>tenant</b> is <b>a</b> short-stayer, an adverse selection problem arises. In this case, the equilibrium is Pareto inefficient. We show that when tenant types are determined endogenously, multiple equilibria can arise where one equilibrium is Pareto dominated by the other equilibrium. The abolition of the rent control regime, can not only shift the equilibrium out of this inferior outcome, but also result in <b>an</b> across-the-board lowering <b>of</b> rents. ...|$|R
40|$|Djankov et al. (2003 a) propose {{and measure}} for 109 {{countries}} in the year 2000 <b>an</b> index <b>of</b> formalism of legal procedure for two simple disputes: <b>eviction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-paying <b>tenant</b> and collection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bounced check. For <b>a</b> sub-sample <b>of</b> 40 countries, we compute this index every year starting in 1950, which allows us to study the evolution of legal rules. We find that between 1950 and 2000, the formalism of legal procedure did not converge, and possibly diverged, between common law and French civil law countries. At least in this specific area of law, the results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that national legal systems are converging, and {{support the view that}} legal origins exert long lasting influence on legal rules. ...|$|R
50|$|In the Canada, {{residential}} homeowner-tenant disputes {{are primarily}} governed by provincial law (not federal law) regarding property and contracts. Provincial law sets {{the requirements for}} <b>eviction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tenant.</b> Generally, there are {{a limited number of}} reasons for which a landlord can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or rent regulation, and related eviction. There is also an implied warranty of habitability, whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.|$|E
50|$|In January 2001, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals {{declared}} {{the law to}} be unconstitutional {{in cases where the}} criminal wrongdoing in question was actually committed not by the tenant but by a person not legally residing in the unit, such as the tenant's grown child or guest. Rucker v. Davis concerned a 63-year-old grandmother, Pearlie Rucker, who was evicted because a member of her family had incurred a drug conviction. The court held that the federal statute that allowed the Oakland Housing Authority to evict Rucker should not be interpreted to allow the <b>eviction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tenant</b> merely because of the wrongdoing of another.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{residential}} homeowner-tenant disputes {{are primarily}} governed {{by state law}} (not federal law) regarding property and contracts. State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for <b>eviction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tenant.</b> Generally, there are {{a limited number of}} reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though {{at the end of the}} lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or rent regulation, and related eviction. There is also an implied warranty of habitability, whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.|$|E
5|$|Henry Fownes Luttrell, {{who married}} Margaret, Alexander's daughter, {{and took the}} Luttrell name, moved to Dunster in 1747.

Henry Luttrell raised the ground height of the Lower Ward between 1764 and 1765 to extend the New Way all {{around to the front}} of his mansion, adding additional ornamental towers onto the inside of the Great Gatehouse in the process.

In 1764, the Lower Ward of the Castle was reduced to one level, while several adjoining walls were removed and the road passing through the gateway was covered over.

40|$|We {{consider}} a rent control regime where rent increases on, and <b>eviction</b> <b>of,</b> <b>a</b> sitting <b>tenant</b> are not allowed. However when an apartment becomes vacant the landlord {{is free to}} negotiate a new rent. We argue that this stylized system is a good (though polar) approximation for many rent control regimes existent today in several U. S. cities and the world over. Under such a regime, if inflation exists, landlords prefer to rent to short-staying tenants. Tenants are of different types, where type refers {{to the amount of}} time they stay in an apartment, and landlords are unable to determine types before they rent to tenants. Since departure date contingent contracts are forbidden, an adverse selection problem arises. In this case, short-stayers are harmed by rent control while long-stayers benefit and landlord’s profits remain the same, and, in addition, the equilibrium is Pareto inefficient. We show that when tenant types are determined endogenously, then in the presence of rent control there may be multiple equilibria where one equilibrium is Pareto dominated by another equilibrium. The abolition of the rent control regime, can not only shift the equilibrium out of this inferior outcome, but can also result in <b>an</b> across-the-board lowering <b>of</b> rents...|$|R
40|$|Both the {{standard}} historical narrative and recent empirical research show that national legal systems vary systematically {{according to the}} legal traditions or origins that countries belong to. In particular, both substantive and procedural legal rules and regulations of civil (or Roman) law countries differ systematically from those of common (or English) law countries (Konrad Zweigert and Hein Kotz 1998; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer 2008). The observed variation raises <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> questions. Are these observed differences in laws and regulations merely <b>a</b> figment <b>of</b> recent data, or have they been present historically as well? Are legal rules coming from different legal traditions converging? Answers to these questions {{are central to the}} interpretation of legal origins, since some degree of permanence of their influence is central to the accounts of why they matter today. In addition, we wish to know which factors—economic, political, or even internal to the legal system itself—determine the nature and the pace of legal change. In this paper, we examine the design of the legal process for civil litigation in 40 countries between 1950 and 2000. We focus on civil procedure, defined as the “body of law concerned with methods, procedures and practices used in civil liti-gation ” (Henry Campbell Black 1991). We follow Simeon Djankov et al. (2003), who analyzed procedural rules governing the adjudication of simple legal disputes (the <b>eviction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonpaying <b>tenant</b> and the collection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bounced check) for 109 countries in 2000.
