500|$|... "Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song. King said [...] "that's fine" [...] when speaking of the situation, noting [...] "there are songs that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> that I always shoot down". [...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody always wants to hear" [...] performed live. He confessed; [...] "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I always say, 'Let's put the heavy ending {{at the end of}} [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] and just do the last half.' But I could never make that fly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cole {{responded that}} while he {{personally}} despised [...] "everything Ahmadinejad stands for, {{not to mention the}} odious Khomeini", he nonetheless objected to the New York Times translation. Cole wrote that it inaccurately suggested Ahmadinejad was advocating an invasion of Israel ("that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Hitler to Israel's Poland"). He added that a better translation of the phrase would be [...] "the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time," [...] a metaphysical if not poetic reference rather than a militaristic one. He also stated that Hitchens was incompetent to assess a Persian-to-English translation, and accused him of unethically accessing private Cole e-mails from an on-line discussion group.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Sulaiman Al Fahim was swiftly {{relieved}} {{of his role}} as publicity figure after the takeover, one such example of his conduct being his discussion of a £134 million bid for Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo: [...] "Ronaldo has said <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for the biggest club in the world, so we will see in January [...] if he is serious." [...] Despite making a series of other comments, this naïve statement was believed to have particularly irked Sheikh Mansour, who quickly appointed his trusted business friend Khaldoon Al Mubarak as chairman designate during the due diligence period, with Al Fahim {{relieved of}} his publicity duty.|$|E
2500|$|After Lindros criticized Worley in March 2000 {{for failing}} to {{diagnose}} a concussion (his second of the season), Clarke stripped Lindros {{of the role of}} team captain. A few weeks after suffering a third concussion during practice, Lindros returned to the Flyers lineup for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals and sustained his fourth concussion of the season (his sixth in 27 months) during Game 7. Afterwards, Clarke said he did not dislike Eric, but he had a problem with his parents, saying, [...] "If he's going to come back, he can't have his dad calling us and telling us who to trade for and who <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with Eric and who can't play with Eric." [...] Lindros never played for the Flyers again, as he rejected the Flyers qualifying offer in the off-season and sat out the 2000–01 season. Lindros pushed for a trade to Toronto but that move fell apart at last minute when Clarke and Leafs manager Pat Quinn could not agree on terms. [...] Clarke finally traded Lindros to the New York Rangers in August 2001. Following the trade, Clarke said, [...] "I don't give a crap whether he ever plays again or if I ever see him again. All he ever did was cause aggravation to our team." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the season's {{end and the}} Rocket's {{elimination}} {{from the}} playoffs, Pippen expressed {{that he wanted to}} be traded. Charles Barkley appeared on Up Close and openly criticized Pippen by saying: [...] "For him to want to leave after one year, it disappointed me greatly. The Rockets went out of their way to get Scottie and the fans have treated him well, so I was just disappointed in him." [...] Pippen commented on the situation in an interview by saying: [...] "I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint. He can never expect an apology from me, if anything, he owes me an apology for coming to play with his fat butt." [...] He stated that the main reasons for his departure were Barkley's selfishness and his lack of desire to win. He also expressed the wish to play for his former coach Phil Jackson, who was now coaching the Los Angeles Lakers. Scottie said one of the reasons <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for Jackson is because he longs to return to the system in which they won six NBA titles together in Chicago. Pippen was traded by the Houston Rockets to the Portland Trail Blazers on October 2, 1999 in exchange for Stacey Augmon, Kelvin Cato, Ed Gray, Carlos Rogers, Brian Shaw and Walt Williams.|$|E

He fancies that he is a little in love with me, and he is dazzled, of course, by the idea of Jeanne's fortune. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the host to us. Let him.

6000|$|Out of the cages, jays make {{charming and}} {{beautiful}} pets, and {{some who have}} kept them have assured me {{that they are not}} mischievous birds. The late Mark Melford one time when I visited him, had two jays, handsome birds, in bright, glossy plumage, always free to roam where they liked, indoors or out. We were sitting talking in his garden when one of the jays came flying to us and perched on a wooden ledge a few feet from and above our heads, and after sitting quietly for a little while he suddenly made a dash at my head, just brushing it with his wings, then returned to his perch. At intervals of a few moments he repeated this action, and when I remarked that he probably resented the presence of a stranger, Melford exclaimed, [...] "Oh, no, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with you--that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You were right,' {{answered}} Ralph.

Plainly, friend Arthur Gride, if you want any help from me in this business (which of course you do, or you would not be here), speak out, and to the purpose. And, above all, don't talk to me of its turning to my advantage, for I know it must turn to yours also, and to a good round tune too, or you would have no finger in such a pie as this.' ...|$|E
