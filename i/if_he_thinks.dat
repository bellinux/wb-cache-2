25|$|In 2012, Albert Chan and Wong Yuk-man of People Power {{submitted}} {{a total of}} 1306 amendments to the Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill, by which the government attempted to forbid lawmakers from participating in by-elections after their resignation. The bill {{was a response to}} the so-called 'Five Constituencies Referendum, in which 5 lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp resigned and then joined the by-election, claiming that it would affirm the public's support to push forward the electoral reform. The pro-democracy camp strongly opposed the bill, saying it was seen a deprivation of the citizens' political rights. As a result of the filibuster, the LegCo carried on multiple overnight debates on the amendments. In the morning of 17 May 2012, the President of the LegCo (Jasper Tsang) terminated the debate, citing Article 92 of the Rules of Procedure of LegCo: In any matter not provided for in these Rules of Procedure, the practice and procedure to be followed in the Council shall be such as may be decided by the President who may, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> fit, be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures. In the end, all motions to amend the bill were defeated and the Bill was passed.|$|E
500|$|Finally, {{symmetrical}} positions may {{be difficult}} for the white player for psychological reasons. Watson writes that anyone who tries the Exchange French, [...] "even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> he is playing for a win, assume a psychological burden. White has already ceded the advantage of the first move, and knows it, whereas Black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative." [...] Two famous examples of White losses in the Exchange French are M. Gurevich–Short and Tatai–Korchnoi. In M. Gurevich–Short, a game between two of the world's leading players, White needed only a draw to qualify for the Candidates Matches, while Black needed to win. Gurevich played passively and was outplayed by Short, who achieved the necessary win, qualified for the Candidates, and ultimately went on to challenge Kasparov for the World Championship. In Tatai–Korchnoi, the Italian IM fell victim to Korchnoi's whirlwind mating attack, losing in just 14 moves.|$|E

In the penultimate County Championship match of the season Kerrigan took career-best innings figures of 9/51 to take Lancashire to a 222-run win over Hampshire. The final wicket of the match was claimed with just four minutes of play left and was greeted with a mini pitch invasion as the victory kept Lancashire in contention for the title. Kerrigan recorded the best bowling figures for Lancashire since Roy Tattersall's 9/40 in 1953. In September, in the last match of the season Lancashire won the County Championship {{for the first time}} since they shared the title in 1950. Kerrigan contributed 24 wickets from the four Championship matches he played that season, placing him sixth on Lanashire's list of leading wicket-takers for the competition.|$|E
2500|$|The two met in {{the semifinals}} of the 1998 US Open, where Sampras was slowed in the third set by a leg injury {{and called for a}} trainer, and Rafter broke Sampras twice in the {{deciding}} fifth set. [...] Sampras's loss denied him the chance to match two records—Jimmy Connors' mark of five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles. Sampras cited a leg injury as the reason Rafter won, an attitude that upset the Australian: [...] "He really does say some funny things at the wrong time", said Rafter, [...] "We are out there busting our guts and he doesn't show a lot of respect {{at the end of the}} day. He tries to play down the reason why he lost, giving no respect to the other player, and that is what really upsets me about him and the reason I try to piss him off as much as I can." [...] Following Rafter's successful defense of his 1997 U.S. Open title by defeating Mark Philippoussis in the 1998 final, when asked about Sampras' earlier comments about having to win another Grand Slam in order to be considered great, Rafter replied: [...] "Maybe you can ask him that question, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that now. For me, I won another Slam, and it hasn't sunk in yet. It's very, very exciting for me, especially to repeat it". For his part, Sampras said about Rafter, [...] "When I see him holding the US Open trophy, it pisses me off." [...] Rafter responded by calling Sampras a “cry baby” and saying that it would be better for tennis if someone besides the American were No. 1.|$|E
2500|$|Body {{contact between}} runner and fielder is {{frequent}} in baseball, particularly at home plate. This is driven {{to a large}} extent by the manner in which a runner is put out. In both sports, rules prohibit interfering with runners. However, in baseball, the runner himself (or the base he is advancing to, if forced) must be tagged by a fielder holding the ball, to be put out. The catcher awaiting a throw will often stand between the plate and the runner. Once he catches it, the runner might try to go around the catcher, or he might simply bowl the catcher over, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> he can dislodge the ball by such contact; and if the catcher does not have the ball, the runner may still bowl the catcher over, which is considered fair because by rule a fielder without a ball cannot impede a runner. By contrast, in cricket, the stumps are the target for [...] "tagging" [...] rather than the runner. No contact with the runners is either necessary or allowed. Contact between opposing sides is rare, and is usually not deliberate. Violent contact between players was once even greater in baseball, as before the Knickerbocker Rules it was permitted in some versions of the game to literally [...] "throw out" [...] a runner by hitting him (or [...] "soaking" [...] him) with a thrown ball (in lieu of hitting a base or stake that would equate to cricket's wickets). This rule still exists in some versions of the baseball variant called kickball, which is played with a soccer ball and thus is much less injurious. Except when played batting in a hands-down position, kickball also calls for literal [...] "bowling" [...] of the ball, underhand, as with the old rules of both cricket and baseball. [...] "All 'round hands down" [...] kickball leagues exist, but in most of these, the ball is pitched with the face or shoulders.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, Nottingham Trent University criminologist Mike Sutton {{published}} in a non-peer-reviewed proceedings, a research paper that he presented to a British Society of Criminology conference proposing that both Darwin and Wallace had [...] "more likely than not committed the world's greatest science fraud by apparently plagiarising the entire theory of natural selection from a book written by Patrick Matthew and then claiming to have no prior knowledge of it." [...] On 28 May 2014 The Daily Telegraph science correspondent reported Sutton's views, and also the opinion of Darwin biographer James Moore {{that this was a}} non-issue (below). Sutton published a 2014 e-book Nullius in Verba: Darwin's Greatest Secret reiterating his argument, and alleging that [...] "the orthodox Darwinist account" [...] is wrong as [...] "Darwin/Wallace corresponded with, were editorially assisted by, admitted to being influenced by and met with other naturalists who - it is newly discovered - had read and cited Matthew's book long before 1858". [...] Sutton included as one of these naturalists the publisher Robert Chambers, and said it was significant that the book by Matthew had been cited in the weekly magazine Chambers's Edinburgh Journal on 24 March 1832, then in 1844 Chambers had published anonymously the best selling Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation which, according to Sutton, had influenced Darwin and Wallace. In 2015, Sutton further repeated his assertion of [...] "knowledge contamination" [...] in the Polish journal, Filozoficzne Aspekty Genezy (F.A.G.) (Philosophical Aspects of Genesis), which Sutton asserts is peer-reviewed, and about which, one of the journal's editors responded, [...] "As to Sutton, he cannot justifiably claim much credibility for his ideas just because these are {{published in}} such a journal like ours, i.e. one adopting Feyerabendian pluralism. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> otherwise, it is only his problem. Any reasonable person should know better." [...] In addition to his papers and e-book, Sutton disseminates his claims against Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace via several blog sites and twitter accounts, and public lectures: to the Ethical Society, at the Conway Hall, on 27 July 2014; to the Teeside Skeptics in the Pub, at O'Connells Pub in Middlehaven, a ward of Middlesbrough, on 2 October 2014; and to the Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group, at the James Hutton Institute, at Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen, on 17 March 2016. During this visit to Scotland, Sutton also presented his claims to The Junior Carsonians, [...] "the junior division of The Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group who represent the 6 Carse Primary Schools, some 1000 pupils, who work collectively on various climate change, heritage and sustainability project", who, [...] "got to hear about Dr Sutton’s work and the evidence he has uncovered about Patrick Matthew and Charles Darwin".|$|E
