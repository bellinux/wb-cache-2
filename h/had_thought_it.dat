Entering 2011, he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> to be {{his final}} season as an active competitor, and his main goal for the year was to wear the yellow jersey at some time during the Tour. His pursuit of yellow was {{strengthened}} {{by the addition of}} Kreuziger to the squad, riding solely in support of the veteran Kazakh. Paris–Nice stage winner Di Gregorio and Tiralongo were also named to the squad.|$|E
25|$|DeWyze, who had {{released}} {{two independent}} albums before winning the ninth season of American Idol, made his major-label debut with Live It Up in 2010. Released under RCA Records, {{it went on}} to become the worst-selling and lowest-charting debut album by a winner of the series. DeWyze has since expressed dissatisfaction with the album and said that winning American Idol did not turn out to be everything that he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was {{appointed}} to lead a Commonwealth expeditionary force of two infantry divisions and an armoured brigade to help Greece resist Italy and the subsequent German invasion in April 1941. Although the Allied forces were hopelessly inadequate Churchill's War Cabinet <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> important to provide support for the only country outside the Commonwealth which was resisting the Axis advance. Wilson completed the evacuation of British troops from Greece on 29 April 1941. He {{was appointed}} a GBE on 4 March 1941 and promoted to full general on 31 May 1941.|$|E

25|$|Cleese {{was born}} in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, {{the only child of}} Reginald Francis Cleese (1893–1972), an {{insurance}} salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn (née Cross; 1899–2000). His family's surname was originally Cheese, but his father <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the Army during the First World War. As a child, Cleese supported Bristol City FC and Somerset County Cricket Club. Cleese was educated at St Peter's Preparatory School, where he received a prize for English and did well at cricket and boxing. When he was 13, he was awarded an exhibition at Clifton College, an English public school in Bristol. He was already more than 6feet (1.83m) tall by then.|$|E
25|$|During the week-long clashes that {{occurred}} {{at the beginning of}} May 2008 in Beirut and other regions of the country, the army was unable to prevent rival Lebanese groups from fighting each other. This was because the army, along with the government, <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would have been better if rival groups would eventually end the violence and sort out the dispute between them, alone, other than involving the national army which may have led to great divisions between the soldiers, just like in the civil war. It would have also caused an out cry to the soldiers that could have died, leading to even greater divisions and blame to the political forces. However, whenever ceasefire was brought into action in a specific area or district in Beirut or else where in the country, the LAF would straight away enforce peace. On May 13, the national army had announced that if the clashes would not end as soon as possible, it would have to intervene and use force if necessary to stop them.|$|E
25|$|Fogg <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was one day {{more than}} it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact. During his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. At the time, {{the concept of a}} de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware {{that it would be a}} day less than it used to be once he reached this line. Thus, the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line. But a de facto date line did exist since the UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times, and he should have noticed when he arrived to the US that the local date was not the same as in his diary (his servant Jean Passepartout kept his clock in London time, despite the tips of his surroundings).|$|E

25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the final}} , Fogg <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was one day later than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact: during his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. In fact, {{at the time and}} until 1884, the concept of a de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware of the change in date once he reached this line. Thus, the day he added to his clock throughout his journey would be removed upon crossing this imaginary line. However, in the real world, Fogg's mistake would not have occurred because a de facto date line did exist. The UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times. He would have noticed, when he arrived in San Francisco, that the local date was actually one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. As a consequence he could not fail to notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the China steamer in New York were actually one day earlier than his personal travel diary.|$|E

500|$|Chasing Vermeer is Blue Balliett's first {{published}} book. Its original purpose {{was a book}} to read to her class for fun. She realized that a mystery about [...] "real" [...] art issues had not been written since E.L. Konigsburg's From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and desired to write what she wished to read. Chasing Vermeer took about five years to complete, as Balliett was also a teacher and parent. She compared writing the book to weaving, as she first wrote mainly about art, but then incorporated the pentominoes and classroom scenes, creating many different levels to read on. She admits that it ended up more complex than she <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be.|$|E
500|$|On {{her wedding}} day to Riley, Mercedes {{was the one who}} exposes the affair. Metcalfe said this was because when Mercedes looked into Riley's eyes she [...] "couldn't help it" [...] because of her love for him, and because Jacqui's {{entrance}} [...] "just tipped her over the edge". Metcalfe {{went on to say that}} she did not think Mercedes [...] "thought about it" [...] when revealing the affair, but if she <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> through she would not have revealed the secret. Metcalfe postulated that there would be [...] "huge repercussions" [...] from the events, explaining that her following storylines [...] "all stem from the wedding". Metcalfe added that she did not [...] "fancy" [...] the chances of a reunion for Mercedes and Riley although the actress would have liked one. Metcalfe commented that she [...] "loved" [...] the storyline and with working with Norbury.|$|E
500|$|On November 9 the {{expedition}} {{finally reached the}} Saint Lawrence at Pointe-Levi, {{across the river from}} Quebec. [...] Arnold had about 600of his original 1,100men, and the journey {{had turned out to be}} 350miles (560km), not the180 that Arnold and Washington <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be. [...] From John Halstead, a New Jersey-born businessman who operated a mill near Pointe-Levi, Arnold learned of the arrest of his courier and the interception of some of his letters. [...] Halstead's mill became the organizing point for the crossing of the Saint Lawrence. [...] Some of Arnold's men purchased canoes from the habitants and the local Saint Francis Indians, and then transported them from the Chaudière to the mill site. [...] The forces crossed the Saint Lawrence on the night of November 13–14 after three days of bad weather, likely crossing the mile-wide river between the positions of HMS Hunter and HMS Lizard, two Royal Navy ships that were guarding the river against such a crossing.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} the newsletters, {{particularly}} in the period between 1988 and 1994 when Paul {{was no longer in}} Congress, contained material that later proved controversial. Topics included conspiracy theories, anti-government militia movements, and race wars. During Paul's 1996 congressional election campaign, and his 2008 and 2012 presidential primary campaigns, critics charged that some of the passages reflected racist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic bigotry. In a 1996 interview, Paul did not deny writing the newsletters and defended some of their contents, but specified that he opposes racism. In March 2001, Paul said he did not write the commentaries, but stopped short of denying authorship in 1996 because his campaign advisers <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be too confusing and that he had to live with the material published under his name. In 2011, Paul's spokesperson Jesse Benton said Paul had [...] "taken moral responsibility because they appeared under his name and slipped through under his watch." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{situation}} was problematic for Sweden, since it once again faced both Denmark and Russia as potential enemies requiring the Swedes to split their forces.

Most of the Swedish plans assumed that warfare would be impossible during winter, disregarding the lessons from recent wars. In addition, several new good roads had been built into Finland greatly reducing the earlier dependency on naval support for any large operation in Finland.|$|E
