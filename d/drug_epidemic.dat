[...] Sessions wrote in the letter that [...] "I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict {{the discretion of the}} Department to fund particular prosecutions, particularly {{in the midst of an}} historic <b>drug</b> <b>epidemic</b> and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime." [...] John Hudak of the Brookings Institution criticized the letter, stating that it was a [...] "scare tactic" [...] that [...] "should make everyone openly question whether candidate Trump's rhetoric and the White House's words on his support for medical marijuana was actually a lie to the American public on an issue that garners broad, bipartisan support." ...|$|E

40|$|A five-state {{compartment}} {{model of}} trends in {{illicit drug use}} in Australia is parameterized using data from multiple sources. The model reproduces historical prevalence and supports what-if analyses {{under the assumption that}} past trajectories of drug escalation and desistance persist. For fixed initiation, the system has a unique stable equilibrium. The chief qualitative finding is that even though some users escalate rapidly, regular injection drug use still adjusts to changes in incidence with considerable inertia and delay. This has important policy implications, e. g., concerning the timing of reductions in drug-related social cost generated by interventions that reduce the social cost per injection user versus those that cut drug initiation.

40|$|In the mid- 19 th century, most American addicts were genteel women {{hooked on}} opiates through medical treatment. Within a few decades, {{a new group}} of addicts emerged [...] {{pleasure}} users who patronized opium dens. As local laws closed dens, the pleasure users [...] most often poor young men in northern cities [...] began experimenting with cocaine and heroin, causing an alarmed government to launch an escalating campaign to root out the new deviant subculture. Various treatment efforts were instituted, from short-lived clinics to federal narcotics farms. This <b>drug</b> use <b>epidemic</b> peaked in the 1920 s and was essentially quelled by World War II.

On {{the basis of a}} 2 -groups model in which the population in split into a user and a non-user group the advantage of a continuous age distribution is shown by considering more details and by yielding new results. Neglecting death rates reduces the model to a single state (1 -group) descriptive model which can still simulate some of the complex behavior of <b>drug</b> <b>epidemics</b> such as repeated cycles. Furthermore, prevention programs - especially school-based programs - can eb targeted to certain age classes. So in order to discover how best to allocate resources to prevention programs over different age classes we formulate and solve optimal control models...|$|R

40|$|Drug use and {{problems}} change dramatically {{over time in}} ways that are often described as reflecting an “epidemic cycle”. We use simulation of a model of <b>drug</b> <b>epidemics</b> to investigate how the relative effectiveness of different types of prevention varies over the course of such an epidemic. Specifically we use the so-called LHY model (see Behrens et al., 2000 b) which includes both “contagious” spread of initiation (a positive feedback) and memory of past use (a negative feedback), which dampens initiation and, hence, future use. The analysis confirms the common sense intuition that prevention is more highly leveraged early in an epidemic, although the extent to which this is true in this model is striking, particularly for campaigns designed to leverage awareness of the drug’s dangers. The findings also suggest that the design of “secondary” prevention programs should change over the course of an epidemic...|$|R
