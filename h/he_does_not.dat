5000|$|Eichelbaum {{interpreted}} his {{terms of}} reference such that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> interview anyone who had been directly involved with the case. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak {{with any of the}} children. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak with the children's parents, some of whom regularly visited the Civic Crèche [...] <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak with the children's evidential interviewers. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak with any of the crèche workers. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak with Ellis's mother. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak with Peter Ellis. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak with the oldest complainant, one of seven children upon whose evidence Ellis was convicted.

The only people with whom Eichelbaum discussed the matter of the selection of the experts were Justice Ministry officials and Thomas Lyon, a USA law professor. In 1999 Lyon criticised the direction and relevance of research undertaken by experts nominated by Ellis's counsel. Lyon's critique was cited approvingly in the Crown's submission to the ministerial inquiry.|$|R
