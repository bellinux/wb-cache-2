To examine the effects of species, wood flour derived from four species, ponderosa pine, loblolly pine, maple, and oak, was used as a filler for polypropylene at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 % by weight wood flour. With increasing wood flour content, flexural and tensile modulus, density, <b>heat</b> <b>deflection</b> temperature, and notched impact energy increased, while flexural and tensile strength, tensile elongation, mold shrinkage, melt flow index, and unnotched impact energy decreased.

40|$|At {{the present}} stage of {{aviation}} and missile equipment development {{there is increasing}} necessity for considering fast-acting, high-speed processes of impact interaction of structure elements with external loads, represented as both power factors (longitudinal force or bending moment) and uniformly spread aerodynamic pressure. The article analyses the dy- namic behavior of the nonuniformly-heated thin conical rotational shell, modelling the aircraft heat shield, under pressure wave loading in a gaseous environment. Stress-strain shell behavior caused by preliminary uneven heating is determined by solving thermo elastic equilibrium equations. The temperature field can be specified as any functional dependence in both circumferential and longitudinal coordinates of a thin-walled axisymmetric shell. The solution of the dynamic problem is obtained by the integration of shell and attached mass motion nonlinear equations under predetermined initial displace- ments, zero initial rates, and boundary conditions appropriate for heat shield fixation. The work presents simultaneous equations solution {{in the form of}} time dependent behavior from the beginning of front external pressure impact for dis- placements and stresses in thin-walled structures. The dependent behavior for various shell designs is presented taking into account the changes of shell thickness and attached mass. It is shown that the initial conditions of non-uniform shell <b>heating</b> cause leading-edge <b>deflection</b> comparable in size to the magnitude of the displacements from its free oscillations.

40|$|A zero {{pressure}} gradient boundary layer over a flat plate {{is subjected to}} step changes in thermal condition at the wall, causing the formation of internal, heated layers. The resulting temperature fluctuations and their corresponding density variations are associated with turbulent coherent structures. Aero-optical distortion occurs when light passes through the boundary layer, encountering the changing index of refraction resulting from the density variations. Instantaneous measurements of streamwise velocity, temperature and the optical deflection angle experienced by a laser traversing the boundary layer are made using hot and cold wires and a Malley probe, respectively. Correlations of the deflection angle with the temperature and velocity records suggest that the dominant contribution to the deflection angle comes from thermally-tagged structures in the outer boundary layer with a convective velocity of approximately 0. 8 U∞. An examination of instantaneous temperature and velocity and their temporal gradients conditionally averaged around significant optical deflections shows behavior consistent {{with the passage of}} a <b>heated</b> vortex. Strong <b>deflections</b> are associated with strong negative temperature gradients, and strong positive velocity gradients where the sign of the streamwise velocity fluctuation changes. The power density spectrum of the optical deflections reveals associated structure size to be on the order of the boundary layer thickness. A comparison to the temperature and velocity spectra suggests that the responsible structures are smaller vortices in the outer boundary layer as opposed to larger scale motions. Notable differences between the power density spectra of the optical deflections and the temperature remain unresolved due to the low frequency response of the cold wire...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} Finite Element Model for the Polyimide V-groove actuator (fabricated by T. Ebefors, Sweden). Extensive FEM simulations for this MEMS actuator were performed using ANSYS 5. 6. An optimization module was used to improve the performance of the existing design. A substantial improvement in the performance was observed for the proposed design. In short, this research established a methodology that can be extended for modeling and simulation of other MEMS devices. A computer simulated FEM model for <b>heat</b> and <b>deflection</b> analysis was validated for two configurations of the Polyimide V-groove Actuator (i. e. a Serpentine Heater Configuration and a Polysilicon Heater Configuration). Some differences between the simulated and experimental results (reported by T. Ebefors) were noted in the low frequency domain. The role of various parameters including thermal conductivity and wall temperature has been investigated to eliminate these discrepancies. To improve the performance of the actuator, different design geometries were proposed and each design was simulated for various frequencies. Significant performance improvement was observed for the case of 2 ̆ 2 uniform diaphragm thickness at the V-groove bottom 2 ̆ 2. The optimization module of ANSYS was used for optimizing the thickness of the silicon diaphragm (referred to as 2 ̆ 2 single variable optimal design 2 ̆ 2). Steady state analysis showed that there is an improvement in the deflection and the force developed for the single variable optimal design over T. Ebefors 2 ̆ 7 design. Transient analysis showed improvement in the cooling characteristics of the single variable optimal design over T. Ebefors 2 ̆ 7 design. In the second optimization exercise (referred to as 2 ̆ 2 overall optimization 2 ̆ 2), all the dimensions of the V-grooves were used as design variables. A three times increase in the deflection was observed in the overall optimal design as compared to the single variable optimal design. Also, there is a three times reduction in the maximum force developed by the overall optimal design. Transient analysis revealed that the overall optimal design has better cooling characteristics compared to the single variable optimal design. Hence, for an application where the applied force is not a critical factor, the 2 ̆ 2 overall optimal design 2 ̆ 2 would be suitable, e. g. if a lightweight mirror is mounted {{on the end of the}} actuator, the mirror can be moved through a larger distance.

The eddies' surface signatures are investigated using 19 years of satellite derived sea level anomaly (SLA) data. Two automated detection methods are applied, the geometrical method based on closed streamlines around eddy cores, and the Okubo–Weiß method based on the relation between vorticity and strain. Both methods give similar results. Mean eddy surface signatures of SLA, sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) are obtained from composites of all snapshots around identified eddy cores. Anticyclones/cyclones are associated with elevation/depression of SLA and enhanced/reduced SST and SSS patterns. However, about 20 % of all detected anticyclones show reduced SST and reduced SSS instead. These kind of eddies are classified as anticyclonic mode-water eddies (ACMEs). About 146 ± 4 eddies per year are identified (52 % cyclones, 39 % anticylones, 9 % ACMEs) with rather similar mean radii of about 56 ± 12 km. Based on concurrent in-situ temperature and salinity profile data (from Argo float, shipboard and mooring data) inside of the three eddy types, their distinct differences in vertical structure is determined. Most eddies are generated preferentially in boreal summer and along the West African coast at three distinct coastal headland region and carry South Atlantic Central Water that originates from the northward transport within the Mauretania coastal current system.

40|$|Drops and {{filaments}} {{are prominent}} in inkjet printing, surface and bulk property measurement, atomization, genomic analysis and drug discovery. Accurate prediction of their dynamics {{is the major}} objective of this thesis. Predicting the formation of drops from a capillary {{and analysis of the}} effects of surfactants and heat on the deformation and/or breakup of liquid filaments are central goals of this thesis. These situations are studied by one of two approaches: one-dimensional (1 -d) analysis based on the slender-jet approximation which, when appropriate to use, results in two to three orders of magnitude reduction in computational time and exact two-dimensional (2 -d) analysis using Galerkin/finite element method. Algorithms are developed for analyzing (i) the formation of hundreds of consecutive drops from capillaries, (ii) the effects of surfactants on the nonlinear deformation and/or breakup of stretching and oscillating liquid bridges and (iii) the deflection of planar jets emerging out of 2 -d channels when asymmetric heating or wetting is imposed at the slot exit. Key {{to the success of the}} 2 -d algorithms is the generation of meshes that can follow the deformation of the free surface(s). For this purpose, algebraic and elliptic mesh generation techniques are employed. In drop formation from a capillary at constant flow rate, the 1 -d algorithm developed in this thesis is demonstrated to be within 1 – 2 % of established rigorous 2 -d algorithms at low flow rates. However, the 1 -d predictions can err by 10 – 15 % at high flow rates and be in total disagreement with the 2 -d predictions in analyses of (i) drop formation when the flow rate is oscillatory or (ii) contraction of free liquid filaments, which are models of satellites. Analyses of surfactant-laden bridges reveal that convection-diffusion of an insoluble surfactant along an interface can result in complex interplay with the bulk flow and significantly alter the breakup of stretching liquid bridges and the frequency response of oscillating liquid bridges. Studies on the effects of differential wetting and <b>heating</b> on the <b>deflection</b> of planar jets yield windows of operation in the space of governing parameters that are favorable to significant deflection. Channel geometry is shown to contribute nontrivially to the angular momentum of the jet.

40|$|It {{is crucial}} for a {{building}} to maintain structural stability when subjected to multiple and sequential extreme loads. Safety and economic considerations dictate that structures are built to resist extreme events, such as a earthquakes, impacts, blasts or fires, without collapse and to provide adequate time for evacuation of the occupants. However, during such events, some structural damage may be permissible. Design codes do {{not account for the}} scenario where two extreme events occur consecutively on a structure nor do they address the situation of the structure having some initial damage prior to being subjected to a fire load. This work begins by detailing the major inconsistancies between designing reinforced concrete structures for extreme mechanical loads and designing for fire. The material behaviour and traits of the constitutive parts (i. e. the concrete and the steel), including post yielding behaviour, thermal relationships and their interaction with each other are all explored in detail. Comprehensive experimental and numerical investigations are undertaken to determine whether, and to what extent, phenomena such as tensile cracking and loss of the concrete cover affect the local and global fire resistance of a member or structure. The thermal propagation through tensile cracks in reinforced concrete beams is examined experimentally. A comparison is made between the rate of thermal propagation through beams that are undamaged and beams that have significant tensile cracking. The results show that, although small differences occur, there is no significant change in the rate of thermal propagation through the specimens. Consequently, it is concluded that the effects of tensile cracking on the thermal propagation through concrete can be ignored in structural analyses. Significantly this means that analyses of heated concrete structures which are cracked can be carried out with heat-transfer and mechanical analyses being conducted sequentially, as is currently normal and fully-coupled thermo-mechanical analyses are not required. The loss of concrete cover and the impact on the thermal performance is examined numerically. A comparison is made of the thermal propagation, beam deflections and column rotations between structures that are undamaged and structures that have partial cover loss in a variety of locations and magnitudes. Results show that any loss of cover can lead to unsymmetrical <b>heating,</b> causing larger <b>deflections</b> in both vertical and horizontal directions, which can result in a more critical scenario. It is concluded that the effect of cover loss on the thermal performance of the structure is extremely significant. A new approach to numerically simulating the loss of cover by mechanical means from a member is developed. This new approach provides the user with an extremely flexible yet robust method for simulating this loss of cover. The application of this method is then carried out to show its effectiveness. A large experimental study carried out at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee and separately numerically modelled at the University of Edinburgh. Unfortunately, due to unforseen circumstances, the experimental data available is limited at this time and as a result the validation of the numerical simulation is limited. Through these investigations it is clear {{that it is necessary to}} develop a method in enhance the stability and integrity of the concrete when subjected to the scenario of a fire following another mechanically extreme event. Therefore, finally a method is proposed and experimentally investigated into the use of fibres to increase the post crushing cohesiveness of the concrete when subjected to thermal loads. Results show that the fibrous members display an increased thermal resistance by retaining their concrete cover through an enhanced post crushing cohesion. From this investigation, it is concluded that the use of fibrous concrete is extremely beneficial for the application of enhancing the performance under extreme sequential mechanical and thermal loading.
