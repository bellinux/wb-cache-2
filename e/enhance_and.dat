5|$|Ben Nevis's {{popularity}} and high-profile {{have led to}} concerns in recent decades over the impact of humans on the fragile mountain environment. These concerns contributed {{to the creation of}} The , a five-year programme which aims to protect, <b>enhance</b> <b>and</b> future-proof Ben Nevis by delivering nineteen ambitious environmental projects between 2014 and 2019. The Nevis Landscape Partnership is supported by five partner organisations (John Muir Trust, Forestry Commission Scotland, The Highland Council, Scottish Natural Heritage & The Nevis Partnership) and has been made possible by Heritage Lottery Funding.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have also}} found {{significant}} levels of toxins in fish and the waters they inhabit within the basin. Accumulation of toxins in fish threatens the survival of fish species, and human consumption of these fish can lead to health problems. Water quality {{is also an important}} factor in the survival of other wildlife and plants that grow in the Columbia River drainage basin. The states, Indian tribes, and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water, land, and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to <b>enhance</b> <b>and</b> accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts. A number of cleanup efforts are currently underway, including Superfund projects at Portland Harbor, Hanford, and Lake Roosevelt.|$|E

25|$|Also {{important}} to {{indoor air quality}} is the control of moisture accumulation (dampness) leading to mold growth {{and the presence of}} bacteria and viruses as well as dust mites and other organisms and microbiological concerns. Water intrusion through a building's envelope or water condensing on cold surfaces on the building's interior can <b>enhance</b> <b>and</b> sustain microbial growth. A well-insulated and tightly sealed envelope will reduce moisture problems but adequate ventilation is also necessary to eliminate moisture from sources indoors including human metabolic processes, cooking, bathing, cleaning, and other activities.|$|E

25|$|Although the resource-based view of {{the firm}} recognizes the {{important}} role of knowledge in firms that achieve a competitive advantage, proponents of the knowledge-based view argue that the resource-based perspective does not go far enough. Specifically, the RBV treats knowledge as a generic resource, rather than having special characteristics. It therefore does not distinguish between different types of knowledge-based capabilities. Information technologies can {{play an important role in}} the knowledge-based {{view of the}} firm in that information systems can be used to synthesize, <b>enhance,</b> <b>and</b> expedite large-scale intra- and inter-firm knowledge management (Alavi and Leidner 2001).|$|E

In 2006, Flickr was the second most extended site on userscripts.org. Organizr and most of Flickr's other text-editing and tagging interfaces use Ajax, with which most modern browsers are compliant. Images can be posted to the user's photostream via email attachments, which enables direct uploads from many cameraphones and applications.

Anna Hyonjoo Lint, Ph.D., the center's Vice Chairwoman, explained that “The purpose of the Center is to empower, <b>enhance,</b> <b>and</b> enable the next generation of America’s counterintelligence and national security workforce through scholarship initiatives.” The mentoring program also serves to dispel myths about careers in intelligence and security, since the nature of intelligence work is secretive and known to the public primarily through movies and television.|$|E

The prestigious science journal Nature rates the Calgary Zoo {{as one of the top}} five zoos in the world for conservation research, alongside New York, San Diego, Frankfurt, and London. In June 2012, the head of the Calgary Zoo's Centre for Conservation Research, Dr. Axel Moehrenschlager, was awarded the Canadian Wildlife Federation’s Roland Michener Conservation Award which recognizes individuals who have shown a commitment to “promote, <b>enhance,</b> <b>and</b> further the conservation of Canada’s natural resources”. Dr. Moehrenschlager is chair of the Reintroduction Specialist Group within the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the world’s largest conservation network. He is the first North American to hold this position.|$|E
25|$|Through {{environmental}} enrichment, {{researchers were}} able to <b>enhance</b> <b>and</b> partially repair memory deficits in mice between ages of 2 to 7 months with characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Mice in enriched environments performed significantly better on object recognition tests and the Morris Water Maze than they had {{when they were in}} standard environments. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment enhances visual and learning memory for those with Alzheimer's. Furthermore, it has been found that mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that were exposed to enriched environment before amyloid onset (at 3 months of age) and then returned to their home cage for over 7 months, showed preserved spatial memory and reduced amyloid deposition at 13 months old, when they are supposed to show dramatic memory deficits and amyloid plaque load. These findings reveal the preventive, and long-lasting effects of early life stimulating experience on Alzheimer-like pathology in mice and likely reflect the capacity of enriched environment to efficiently stimulate the cognitive reserve.|$|E
