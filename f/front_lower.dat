5|$|The impala has {{a special}} dental {{arrangement}} on the <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> jaw similar to the toothcomb seen in strepsirrhine primates, which is used during allogrooming to comb the fur {{on the head and}} the neck and remove ectoparasites.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriform origins {{are unclear}} and debated. American {{paleontologist}} Philip Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved {{from one of}} several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> teeth of adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not strongly supported {{due to a lack}} of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E

5|$|Kentrosaurus {{was a small}} stegosaur. It had {{the typical}} dinosaurian body bauplan, characterised by a small head, a long neck, short forelimbs and long hindlimbs, and a long, {{horizontal}} and muscular tail. Typical stegosaurid traits included the elongation and flatness of the head, the powerful build of the forelimbs, erect and pillar-like hindlimbs {{and an array of}} plates and spikes running along both sides of the top mid-line of the animal. Only a single complete tooth was known when Hennig published his monography in 1925. Later, a part of a dentary, the tooth-bearing bone of the <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> jaw, was found, which bears a just emerging tooth, and some tooth fragments were recovered from matrix sticking to other bones. The deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of Stegosaurus, albeit much smaller. Similarly, the tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth, small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the <b>front,</b> <b>lower</b> part of the mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching {{in areas that are}} inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20Â° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

25|$|The PWS-6 was a {{two-seater}} biplane of {{a wooden}} construction. A fuselage, oval in cross-section, was covered with canvas skin on a wooden frame, except the engine part, which was covered with aluminium sheets. The wings were two-spar, two-section, rectangular with rounded tips, covered with canvas and plywood (in <b>front).</b> <b>Lower</b> and upper wings halves had the same dimensions, therefore the upper wing had smaller span, lacking a central section. The upper wing was staggered forward, and connected with a lower wing by N-shaped struts and a slanted transverse strut, without wires. The empennage was of wooden construction, canvas covered.|$|E
25|$|The describers {{established}} six distinguishing traits. At {{their very}} midline, the praemaxillae {{meet in a}} small sharp point, set within a larger notch in the snout tip as a whole. The <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> side edge of the praemaxilla protrudes to below. At least seventeen cervical vertebrae are present. The neural spines of the middle cervical vertebrae have a notch at their lower front edge with immediately above it a process directed to the front. The vertebrae of the middle neck, rear neck and front back possess neural spines that have a transversely expanded upper end. On the neck two rows of triangular bony plates are present that have a lightly convex outer side and a notch at the upper front edge creating a hook.|$|E
500|$|Stegoceras had {{teeth that}} were heterodont (differentiated) and thecodont (placed in sockets). It had {{marginal}} rows of relatively small teeth, and the rows did not form a straight cutting edge. The teeth were set obliquely {{along the length}} of the jaws, and overlapped each other slightly from front to back. On each side, the most complete specimen (UALVP 2) had three teeth in the premaxilla, sixteen in the maxilla (both part of the upper jaw), and seventeen in the dentary of the lower jaw. The teeth in the premaxilla were separated from those behind in the maxilla by a short diastema (space), and the two rows in the premaxilla were separated by a toothless gap at the front. The teeth in the front part of the upper jaw (premaxilla) and <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> jaw were similar, these had taller, more pointed and recurved crowns, and a [...] "heel" [...] at the back. The front teeth in the lower jaw were larger than those of the upper jaw. The front edges of the crowns bore eight denticles (serrations), and the back edge bore nine to eleven. The teeth in the back of the upper (maxilla) and lower jaw were triangular in side view and compressed in front view. They had long roots that were oval in section, and the crowns had a marked cingulum at their bases. The denticles here were compressed and directed towards the top of the crowns. Both the outer and inner side of the tooth crowns bore enamel, and both sides were divided vertically by a ridge. Each edge had about seven or eight denticles, with the front edge usually having the most.|$|E

2500|$|The large General Motors C-body {{was used}} to create the 1964 Electra 225, Buick's richest {{full-size}} car. Vertical, narrow taillamps {{were found in the}} nearly straight-cut rear fender ends, and the so-called [...] "Deuce-and-a Quarter" [...] came with fender skirts. Four traditional VentiPorts were found on the front fenders, with heavy die-cast grille accenting the frontal aspect. Wide <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> body moldings were used along with a bright deck cove insert. Electra 225 lettering was found on the rear fenders and specific full wheelcovers were featured. Vinyl and brocade cloth interior trims were found in closed models, while leather upholstery was offered for seats in the convertible. Among the Electra's exclusive standard equipment were power steering; power brakes; two-speed electric wipers with windshield washer; foam padded seats; electric clock; license frame; trunk light; two-way power seat and power windows for the convertible; safety buzzer; and additional courtesy lights. The 2-speed Dynaflow automatic was replaced by the 3-speed TH-400 as standard equipment.|$|E
2500|$|A new sports-oriented model, the AMX, was {{introduced}} to appeal to young, performance-oriented car buyers.

Standard was an upgraded black or tan interior with a floor console, [...] "rally" [...] instrumentation with tachometer, and [...] "soft-feel" [...] sports steering wheel. The special [...] "Hornet AMX" [...] was only available in four exterior colors that included matching painted bumpers with a wraparound rubber guard strip, body side rubber guard strip and contrasting AMX model identification bodyside decals ahead of the rear wheels. The exterior included a front spoiler integrated into the <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> fender extensions, rear lower fender flares, sport-styled road wheels, brushed aluminum [...] "Targa top" [...] band over the B-pillars and roof, black left and right outside mirrors, and louvers for the rear hatch window. Options included bright aluminum road wheels and large Hornet-graphic decals on the hood and on the decklid. This model marked the return of a famous name that evoked AMC's original AMX two-seat sports car.|$|E

2500|$|The {{accompanying}} plot shows {{these two}} solutions as surfaces {{in a space}} with horizontal axes of (sample excess kurtosis) and (sample squared skewness) and the shape parameters as the vertical axis. The surfaces are constrained by the condition that the sample excess kurtosis must be bounded by the sample squared skewness as stipulated in the above equation. [...] The two surfaces meet at the right edge defined by zero skewness. Along this right edge, both parameters are equal and the distribution is symmetric U-shaped for Î± = Î² < 1, uniform for Î± = Î² = 1, upside-down-U-shaped for 1 < Î± = Î² < 2 and bell-shaped for Î± = Î² > 2. [...] The surfaces also meet at the <b>front</b> (<b>lower)</b> edge defined by [...] "the impossible boundary" [...] line (excess kurtosis + 2 - skewness2 = 0). Along this <b>front</b> (<b>lower)</b> boundary both shape parameters approach zero, and the probability density is concentrated more at one end than the other end (with practically nothing in between), with probabilities [...] at the left end x = 0 and [...] at the right end x = 1. [...] The two surfaces become further apart towards the rear edge. [...] At this rear edge the surface parameters are quite different from each other. [...] As remarked, for example, by Bowman and Shenton, sampling {{in the neighborhood of}} the line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0) (the just-J-shaped portion of the rear edge where blue meets beige), [...] "is dangerously near to chaos", because at that line the denominator of the expression above for the estimate Î½ = Î± + Î² becomes zero and hence Î½ approaches infinity as that line is approached. [...] Bowman and Shenton [...] write that [...] "the higher moment parameters (kurtosis and skewness) are extremely fragile (near that line). However the mean and standard deviation are fairly reliable." [...] Therefore, the problem is for the case of four parameter estimation for very skewed distributions such that the excess kurtosis approaches (3/2) times the square of the skewness. [...] This boundary line is produced by extremely skewed distributions with very large values of one of the parameters and very small values of the other parameter. [...] See section titled [...] "Kurtosis bounded by the square of the skewness" [...] for a numerical example and further comments about this rear edge boundary line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0). [...] As remarked by Karl Pearson himself [...] this issue may not be of much practical importance as this trouble arises only for very skewed J-shaped (or mirror-image J-shaped) distributions with very different values of shape parameters that are unlikely to occur much in practice). [...] The usual skewed skewed-bell-shape distributions that occur in practice do not have this parameter estimation problem.|$|E
2500|$|The 2005 {{model year}} {{continued}} with standard hood scoops, split rear exhaust with a revised rear fascia, and {{late in the}} year, optional 18inch (45.7cm) wheels. The major change for 2005 was {{the replacement of the}} LS1 engine with the LS2 engine. This [...] engine increased power and torque in the GTO to [...] with [...] torque. Other changes included larger front rotors and caliper hardware from the Corvette, and the drivetrain was strengthened {{with the addition of a}} driveshaft with larger [...] "giubos" [...] and a larger differential flange, as well as revised half-shafts. Dashboard gauge graphics were revised. The optional dealer-installed Sport Appearance Package became available and differed visually by having a different lower rear fascia, aftermarket mufflers with quad chrome exhaust tips, revised spoiler and <b>front</b> <b>lower</b> fascia extension, recessed grilles, and revised rocker panels. This package was available from GM as an accessory in red, silver, black, or primer for other color cars. Production was 11,069 due in part to a shortened model year. Barbados Blue and Cosmos Purple were dropped this year, but Cyclone Grey and Midnight Blue Metallic were added. Customers also had the option to order their GTO without hood scoops (RPO code BZJ), though only 24 were produced this way. [...] With this improved powerplant, GM claimed the car capable of 0 to [...] in 4.7seconds and a 13.0second quarter mile at [...] (automatic transmission). Car and Driver magazine tested the car at 0â60mph in 4.8 seconds and the Â¼ mile in 13.3seconds at [...] for the quarter mile with its BFGoodrich g-Force T/A KDWS, 245/45ZR-17 95W M+S front and rear tires but manual transmission. The 0â100 and 0â130 times were 11.7 and 19.6 respectively.|$|E
