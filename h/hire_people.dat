Ron believes the park system should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, as exemplified by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers. He advocates for program cuts wherever possible, and purposely tries to <b>hire</b> <b>people</b> who are bad at their jobs so they will slow down the government.

25|$|Ahead of the 1983 season, Eggen {{chose to}} {{prioritize}} his teaching job, and Tommy Cavanagh {{was hired as}} manager. In Norwegian, the terms coach and manager are used interchangeably. Cavanagh had been coach for Manchester United, where he had {{done an excellent job}} at exactly that, but lacked abilities in team selection, tactics and inspiration. He used players in the wrong position, and instructed the ball to be kicked over the midfield, making it impossible to use the playmaker. He believed in breaking down the players and then building them up, and was unarguably good at the former. By the summer, his style was costing the club players: Eggen transferred to Orkanger in the Fourth Division, while Husby transferred to Brøndby in Denmark. Cavanagh was fired in August, at which time the club was second-last in the league, and Eggen took over as manager {{for the rest of the}} season. The team finished on a seventh place. President Erling Meirik withdrew as a consequence of the hiring, stating that in the future, the club should <b>hire</b> <b>people</b> based on more than their reputation and that they should seek judicial assistance with the contract.|$|E

DMRC was given full powers to <b>hire</b> <b>people,</b> decide on tenders and control funds. The DMRC then consulted the Hong Kong MTRC on rapid transit operation and construction techniques. As a result, construction proceeded smoothly, except for one major disagreement in 2000, where the Ministry of Railways forced the system to use broad gauge despite the DMRC's preference for standard gauge.|$|E
500|$|The 1872 Yellowstone Act {{prohibited}} {{fish and}} game, including buffalo, from [...] "wanton destruction" [...] {{within the confines}} of the park. However, Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching; as a result, Secretary Delano could not <b>hire</b> <b>people</b> to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment. By the 1880s buffalo herds dwindled to only a few hundred, a majority found mostly in Yellowstone National Park. As the Indian wars ended, Congress appropriated money and enforcement legislation in 1894, signed into law by President Grover Cleveland, that protected and preserved buffalo and other wildlife in Yellowstone. Grant also signed legislation that protected northern fur seals on Alaska's Pribilof Islands. This was the first law in U.S. history that specifically protected wildlife on federally owned land.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{idea for}} the DVD came to percussionist Shawn Crahan, {{three weeks before the}} band entered The Mansion in 2003, where they would work on their third studio album [...] Crahan {{received}} help from the band's record label Roadrunner, who supplied them with tapes, camera cleaning equipment and funds to <b>hire</b> <b>people</b> to operate the cameras when Crahan himself couldn't. Recording began when Slipknot entered The Mansion and continued until they had finished touring in 2005, reportedly covering 28 months of the bands time together. Crahan's intentions were to capture as many different Slipknot situations as he could, so when the opportunity to produce a DVD came, he would {{be in a position to}} begin work immediately. During the period in which the footage was being shot, Crahan began making little tests of the footage and revealed them to his fellow band mates, judging their reactions to help him establish areas of interest from them. The whole recording process produced over 300 60-minute tapes of footage.|$|E
500|$|Management {{of horses}} {{running on the}} range was {{initially}} left to Mustangers and local ranchers, but in 1934, the Taylor Grazing Act (TGA) established the United States Grazing Service (Grazing Service) to manage livestock grazing on public lands. [...] The TGA authorized the Grazing Service to grant ranchers individual grazing allotments and set fees for grazing. [...] The fee to graze a horse was twice that for a cow, and as a result, ranchers allowed unbranded horses to run loose rather than pay for them. [...] At the time the Taylor Grazing Act was passed, {{it was estimated that}} 50,000-150,000 horses roamed wild on public land subject to the Act. [...] The Grazing Service, along with the Forest Service, was committed to removing the free-roaming horses, which were viewed as mavericks, from the lands they administered. [...] In 1939, the Grazing Service began to directly <b>hire</b> <b>people</b> to remove horses from public land. The United States Forest Service periodically gave ranchers notice to round up their strays and thereafter shot any remaining horses.|$|E
500|$|On July 25, Chairman Lhota {{announced}} a two-phase, $9 billion New York City Subway Action Plan {{to stabilize the}} subway system and to prevent the continuing decline of the system. It expanded on the six-point plan elaborated on in May. The $836 million first phase, to be effective immediately, focused on [...] "stabilization." [...] It consisted of five categories. The first, Signal and Track Maintenance, included creating new crews to repair infrastructure more efficiently, adding continuously welded rail to more tracks, repairing 1,300 broken signals, cleaning 40,000 storm grates, and hiring 2,700 workers to repair broken signals and tracks more quickly. The second, Car Reliability, would put emphasis on maintaining car doors in a more timely fashion, add cars to trains on the C route, remove seats from 42nd Street Shuttle and L train cars to increase capacity, and put emergency car-repair teams at select locations, among other things. The third, System Safety and Cleanliness, would {{increase the number of}} key stations with emergency medical technicians, maintain elevators and escalators efficiently, clean stations and repair components more frequently, add public service announcements warning against littering, and collaborate with the NYPD to enforce the law within the subway. The fourth, Customer Communication, entailed launching a dedicated MTA app; creating better announcements during service disruptions; and completing the installation of systemwide countdown clocks; while the fifth category, Critical Management Group, would consolidate operations and <b>hire</b> <b>people</b> to resolve incidents quickly. The $8 billion second phase would implement the winning proposals from the Genius Transit Challenge and fix more widespread problems.|$|E

So much the better; because, as usually results from the division of labour, these people, having little or nothing to do save to take care of us, do so far better than we could; and so prevent a vast amount of violence and wrong, and therefore of misery, especially to the weak; for which last reason we will acquiesce in the existence of policemen and lawyers, as we do in the results of arbitration, as the lesser of two evils. The odds in war are in favour of the bigger bully, in arbitration in favour of the bigger rogue; and it is a question whether the lion or the fox be the safer guardian of human interests.
