2500|$|Nancy A. Denton and Douglass S. Massey {{devised a}} {{segregation}} index {{to measure the}} degree of segregation of African-Americans and whites according to income levels. [...] Their objective was {{to show that the}} discrimination of African Americans when it comes to housing was not related to income level, which many thought to be true. [...] Many have argued that continuing segregation is due to African Americans generally making less money, which means they cannot afford to live in the same neighborhoods as affluent whites. [...] But as the segregation index by Denton and Massey showed, blacks still remained highly segregated from whites no matter what the income level was. For example, in 1980, black families earning $25,000 a year or less had an <b>index</b> <b>level</b> of 86 while those earning $50,000 or more had an <b>index</b> <b>level</b> of 83. This trend was common throughout most major metropolitan areas, especially prevalent in the northern cities. The goal of this index was to show that upward economic mobility did not affect the level of segregation in America’s cities. [...] It should be noted that Denton and Massey also surveyed Hispanics and Asians, and found on average the indices to be 64 which meant the poorest Hispanics and Asians were still less segregated than the most affluent blacks. Leslie Carr notes that in 1990, 74 percent of whites live in suburbs, while most African Americans and Hispanics live in urban areas, and that African Americans were a majority population in 14 cities (with populations over 100,000). [...] The {{purpose of this study was}} to show that housing practices are indeed racially and not economically discriminatory.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the experiments conducted at the University of Bari for the Ad Hoc Robust-WSD track of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2008. The evaluation was performed using SENSE (SEmantic N-levels Search Engine), a semantic search engine that tries to overcome the limitations of the ranked keyword approach by introducing semantic levels, which integrate (and not simply replace) the lexical level represented by keywords. We show how SENSE is able to manage documents indexed at two separate levels, keyword and word meaning, in an attempt of improving the retrieval performance. Two types of experiments have been performed by exploiting both only one <b>indexing</b> <b>level</b> and all <b>indexing</b> <b>levels</b> at the same time. The experiments performed combining keywords and word meanings, extracted from the WordNet lexical database, show the promise of the idea and point out the value of our institution. In particular the results confirm our hypothesis: The combination of two <b>indexing</b> <b>levels</b> outperforms a single level. Indeed, an improvement of 35 % in precision has been obtained by adopting the N-levels model with respect to the results obtained by exploiting the <b>indexing</b> <b>level</b> based only on keywords...|$|R

5000|$|Movements {{of price}} indexes from one month to another usually should be {{expressed}} as percent changes, {{rather than as}} changes in index points, because the latter {{are affected by the}} level of the index in relation to its base period, while the former are not. Each index measures price changes from a reference period defined to equal 100.0. Currently, some PPIs have an index base set at 1982 = 100, while the remainder have an index base that corresponds with the month prior to the month that the index was introduced. BLS measures price change in relation to that figure. An <b>index</b> <b>level</b> of 110, for example, means there has been a 10-percent increase in prices since the base period; similarly, an <b>index</b> <b>level</b> of 90 indicates a 10-percent decrease in prices.|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, novel AKI biomarkers {{have not}} demonstrated consistent predictive performance {{outside of the}} neonatal cardiac surgery (CPB) population. After assessment for optimal sensitivity and specificity (Youden's J statistic), the renal angina <b>index</b> <b>level</b> derived as positive for renal angina fulfillment is {{greater than or equal}} to 8. A positive biomarker result in the population with an RAI > or = 8 significantly increases the predictive discrimination for subsequent severe AKI. Judicious AKI biomarker assessment will increase their predictive performance and clinical effectiveness. AKI biomarkers need to demonstrate the appropriate balance of diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness in order to gain widespread acceptance leading to implementation at the bedside. Indiscriminate biomarker measurement in every patient, regardless of size, age, and co-morbidities, for a given injury or syndrome will render any test virtually useless. Renal angina index assessment is early (day of admission), easy to practice (calculating RAI and measuring biomarkers is relatively simple compared to calculation of severity of illness scores), useful (high negative predictive value), and could potentially change initial resuscitation targets (fluid goals), use of medications (nephrotoxins), and timing of adjunctive therapies (renal replacement therapy).|$|E
