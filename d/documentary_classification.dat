40|$|The {{works that}} used graphs to {{represent}} documents {{has referred to}} the richness of these expressive tools. However, the exploited graph theory could be of great interest concerning the evaluation of similarity between these documents, both in <b>documentary</b> <b>classification</b> and the information retrieval. In structural classification of the documents, object of this work, the similarity measure is a crucial step. In many applications, this step results in a subgraph isomorphism problem. This problem is known in graph theory by a combinatorial explosion. To get around this problem, we propose to consider a graph {{as a set of}} paths that compose it. The matching, paths allows reducing the combinatorial cost. We propose a structural measure based on the sub-graph isomorphism and we discuss the quality of our classifier, especially the separation of classes. We’d like to show that our measure is structural, not a “surface measure ” and evaluate our approach on a corpus of multimedia documents extracted, randomly, from the INEX 2007 corpus...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{teaching}} of the educational discipline “The evolution of scientific classification” is a formation of system of theoretical, empirical and methodological knowledge about different types, processes, operations of scientific classification of information resources, acquisition of practical skills and attainments of scientific classification of information resources; to prepare specialists who perfectly know different types of scientific classification of information resources. In accordance {{with the requirements of}} the educational and professional program all students should: know: essentiality, meaning and types of scientific classification of information resources; development of theory and history of scientific classification of information resources; general and special methods of scientific classification of information resources. have got the following skills: to implement independently processes of scientific classification of information resources; to use for scientific classification of information resources the normatively regulating base of international, intergovernmental and national standards of Ukraine, linguistic manuals, <b>documentary</b> <b>classification</b> systems etc.; to analyze the modern state and prospects of existing newest technologies of scientific classification of information resources. ...|$|E
40|$|Networked orientated {{standards}} for vocabulary publishing and exchange and proposals for terminological services and terminology registries will improve sharing {{and use of}} all knowledge organization systems in the networked information environment. This means that <b>documentary</b> <b>classifications</b> may also become more applicable for use outside their original domain of application. The paper summarises some characteristics common to <b>documentary</b> <b>classifications</b> and explains some terminological, functional and implementation aspects. The original purpose behind each classification scheme determines the functions that the vocabulary is designed to facilitate. These functions influence the structure, semantics and syntax, scheme coverage and format in which classification data are published and made available. The author suggests that attention should {{be paid to the}} differences between <b>documentary</b> <b>classifications</b> as these may determine their suitability for a certain purpose and may impose different requirements with respect to their use online. As we speak, many classifications are being created for knowledge organization and it may be important to promote expertise from the bibliographic domain with respect to building and using classification systems. ...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the suggestion of}} a Music Microthesaurus, MiMu, with terms based in articles found in the Teclado & Áudio magazine and in references from the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, aiming the specialization of music-related subject representations, therefore seeking better indexing and retrieval of desired information. It also features a literature review concerning aspects of music-related documentation, emphasizing the librarian’s role in that process and issues related to the retrieval of information taking into account the various supports of music documents. The review includes a referential approach to the main themes of documentary languages, analyzing natural and controlled languages, schemes of <b>documentary</b> <b>classifications,</b> exemplifying of some that are used in music, and concept theory and terminology. It presents definitions and functions of thesauruses, given the origins of terms and their applications, exemplifying the collection of terms, the categorization and the process of relationships, as well as the thesaurus’ presentation and considerations about the applicability of specific software. In the methodology, the main orientations, steps and examples adopted in the making and structuring of the MiMu, as well as a research done as a pre-test, consisting of the creation of an article index by librarians, using samples of the Teclado & Áudio magazine and the final report from the thesaurus as an assistance to the task. It presents appendixes containing a report concerning the collection of terms, forms, a table and a frame comprising a research overview and the MiMu’s report in alphabetic order. Its considerations include drawbacks to this work’s planning, such as the absence of the indexing subject in the literature review and the need for deep researches in music-related Library Science works. MiMu is considered an important contribution to the subject in focus, though it needs to be reviewed by a diversified group of researchers, by projects of divulgation and expansion, so that it potentially becomes a specialized music thesaurus, as a whole...|$|R
40|$|In {{the program}} the {{recommendations}} are given {{on the study}} of the discipline “Analytical and synthetic processing of documents” and essential topics for study. The plans of seminar and practical lessons, assignments for independent work of students, topics for writing of term papers, essays, assignments for module control and questions for the final control, and also a list of recommended books and electronic resources for help of course study are given. Analytical and synthetic processing of documents (ASPD) is a normative discipline of professional and practical training that full-time students as well as students of distant learning study at the following training direction such as 6. 020102 book science, library science and bibliography. The value of the course is determined by place and role of macro and microanalitycal information folding in the information-analytical activity of libraries and information organs, in book publishing and book distribution, archival activity, providing users with various information services. The subject of the study course is a making up of bibliographic record of a document and is aimed to create a system of secondary documents and documentary information searching systems. In accordance with the requirements of the educational and professional program all students should: know: the theoretical bases of analytical and synthetic processing of documents, essentiality, meaning and types in particular; history of its development, theoretic and practical bases of making up of documentary bibliographic description; general and special methods of making up of bibliographic description; theory and history of documents’ annotation; the main regulations of the general annotation technique; <b>documentary</b> <b>classification</b> systems and classifications of sciences, the main stages of their development; peculiarities of the universal classification systems such as LBC and UDC; general and special methods of systematization of documents; theory and history of documentary subjects; general and special methods of documentary subjects; theory and history of documents’ summarization; basic regulations of general summarization methodology; have got the following skills: to examine and reduce the contents’ information and formal characteristics of documents independently, to create their bibliographic records, to form searching images of documents; for forming a bibliographic record to use the normatively regulating base of international, intergovernmental and national standards of Ukraine, linguistic manuals, <b>documentary</b> <b>classification</b> systems etc.; to systematize documents with application of LBC and UDC tables; to determine the subject headings as informatively searching language of subject indexing; to compile or make different types of annotations; to analyze the unity and difference between annotation and abstract; to form various types of abstracts; to analyze the modern state and prospects of existing newest technologies of documentary scientific processing. ...|$|E
