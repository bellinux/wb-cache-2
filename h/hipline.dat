MethodsSeventy-two patients with adult abdominal obesity with spleen deficiency and exuberant dampness were randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group with 36 patients in each group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with acupuncture at hour-prescriptive points from 9 to 11 AM {{every day on the}} principle of taking points along channels in time. Patients in the control group were treated with acupuncture at any time beyond 9 to 11 AM. Patients in both groups were treated for three courses of treatment. ResultsThe total effective rate was 87. 5 % in the treatment group and 78. 8 % in the control group. The total curative effect in the treatment group was significantly better than that in the control group in reducing body weight, body mass index, waistline, obesity level, and clinical symptoms (P< 0. 05). After treatment, t-test was used on two independent samples to analyze the ratio of waistline to <b>hipline</b> and <b>hipline.</b> A value of 0. 01 <P< 0. 05 expressed a weaker outcome and similar curative effect between the two groups in reducing ratio of waistline to <b>hipline</b> and <b>hipline</b> of patients. This value indicates that the treatment group has no obvious superiority to that of the control group for curative effect. ConclusionBecause it was superior in reducing waistline and body weight of female adult patients suffering from abdominal obesity with spleen deficiency and exuberant dampness, acupuncture at hour-prescriptive points, a method of midnight-noon ebb-flow, is an effective method to treat obesity...|$|E

Regressions between body measurements, amount of ease (on the bustline, waistline, <b>hipline)</b> and scale factors were used to determine connection between features of the garments forms and eases. In the cases, when we have no concrete value of amount of ease on the bustline, waistline and <b>hipline,</b> we proposed to calculate the scale factors by use values of eases, which were obtained with described formulas and measured projection parameters. And {{it would be possible to}} recreate and study any form of garment even if we have only its geometrical symbol. Several simple algorithms of calculating the scale factors in different processes of design and study virtual garments form were the basis for the computer program “Scale factor”. Algorithms could be called from the main window by clicking on the appropriate button. There are two parts on the main window: “Shape scale”, which must be used in 3 D design process of creation the virtual garment form, and “Pattern scale”, which must be used in 2 D design process to construct the bodice blocks.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 40) A {{study was}} undertaken {{to determine whether}} knit garments require less ease than woven garments and if the ease varies inversely with the stretchability of the fabric. Students in beginning clothing construction classes donated specimens of their fabric for testing of elongation. When the garments were fitted and finished, the students and their garments were measured to determine the percentage of ease which had been incorporated. The data were ranked in order of stretchability and the mean stretch and mean ease for each of six bodylines was calculated. Means for the entire population and for several groupings of stretchability {{as well as for}} the type of knit were determined. Significant negative correlations between stretch and ease were found for the bustline, waistline, high <b>hipline,</b> and widest part of the hip when the population included all specimens. One specimen was of an extremely stretchable character and produced a high degree of negative ease. When this specimen was deleted, the correlations previously disclosed were no longer significant. The study indicated that the amount of ease needed in knit garments is less than in woven garments for the upper back. Bustline ease needs to be less in most knit garments than in woven ones. The amount of ease needed through the widest part of the hip is approximately the same for both knit and woven garments. Comparison of ease in the waistline, high <b>hipline,</b> and upper arm were inconclusive...|$|E

40|$|The current world-wide {{epidemic}} of obesity has stimulated {{interest in developing}} simple screening methods to identify individuals with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2) or metabolic syndrome (MS). Prior work utilizing body composition obtained by sophisticated technology {{has shown that the}} ratio of abdominal fat to total fat is a good predictor for DM 2 or MS. The goals of this study were to determine how well simple anthropometric variables predict the fat mass distribution as determined by dual energy x-ray absorptometry (DXA), and whether these are useful to screen for DM 2 or MS within a population. To accomplish this, the body composition of 341 females spanning a wide range of body mass indices and with a 23 % prevalence of DM 2 and MS was determined using DXA. Stepwise linear regression models incorporating age, weight, height, waistline, and <b>hipline</b> predicted DXA body composition (i. e., fat mass, trunk fat, fat free mass, and total mass) with good accuracy. Using body composition as independent variables, nominal logistic regression was then performed to estimate the probability of DM 2. The results show good discrimination with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) having an area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 78. The anthropometrically-derived body composition equations derived from the full DXA study group were then applied to a group of 1153 female patients selected from a general endocrinology practice.

The patients in the observation group were given clozapine, while the patients in the control group were given risperidone. The serum TBA, T-Bil, D-Bil, I-Bil, glucose and lipid metabolism before and after treatment in the two groups were compared. Results: The comparison of TBA before and after treatment between the two groups was not statistically significant (P> 0. 05). T-Bil, D-Bil, and I-Bil after treatment were significantly reduced when compared with before treatment (P 0. 05). BMI, waistline, <b>hipline,</b> and waisthip ratio after treatment in the two groups were significantly elevated when compared with before treatment (P 0. 05). FBS, TC, TG, and LDL-C levels 12 months after treatment were significantly elevated when compared with before treatment (P< 0. 05), but HDL-C was significantly reduced when compared with before treatment (P< 0. 05).

Glucose intolerance (insulin resistance) is the main feature of type  2 diabetes. Obesity leads to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, etc. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the biochemical parameters and measures of obesity in {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM). Methods: A total of 2, 273 males and 6, 547 females previously healthy volunteers (aged 41 – 95  years old) were recruited by open invitation. The basic information, including age, sex, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waistline, <b>hipline,</b> menstrual cycle, and medical history, was collected by questionnaire survey and physical examination. Serum lipid profile, liver transaminase, blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, and hemoglobin A 1 c were obtained after 12  hours of fasting. Results: According to our results, diabetic patients presented serum lipid abnormality. Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels (≥ 1. 7  mmol/L) were noted in 19. 69 % of males and 20. 40 % of females, and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (≤ 1. 15  mmol/L) were noted in 21. 96 % of males and 15. 74 % of females. The combination of elevated TG and reduced HDL-C was the most prevalent of the combined lipid abnormalities. In contrast, no differences were observed in the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol. Moreover, there were statistically significant differences in the levels of BMI and waistline between T 2 DM and non-T 2 DM participants. After adjustment for BMI, logistic regression analysis revealed that the subjects with BMI ≤ 20  kg/m 2 and > 30  kg/m 2 had a significantly elevated hazard ratio of T 2 DM compared with participants having a BMI range of 20 – 30  kg/m 2 in both males and females. However, there was a significant difference between T 2 DM patients and non-T 2 DM patients in waistline (χ 2 = 8. 57, P< 0. 001) than in BMI parameter (χ 2 = 6. 29, P< 0. 001).
