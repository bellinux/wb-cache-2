5|$|Coming off {{his fourth}} championship, the 34-year-old Niedermayer {{contemplated}} retirement. Remaining undecided on his future as the 2007–08 season began, he <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> {{to the team}} and was suspended by the Ducks as a formality. Pronger replaced him as captain, and Niedermayer remained undecided until early December when he finally chose to return. He appeared in only 48 games that season, scoring 25 points, but played in his fourth All-Star Game.|$|E

He <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> for filming on Marie Galante in June 1934, and was found in his hotel room, virtually unconscious after a two-week binge. Tracy {{was removed from the}} Fox payroll while he recovered in a hospital, and then sued for $125,000 for delaying the production. He completed only two more pictures with the studio.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, as Scott's ships neared Cape Hunter at the {{northwest}} end of Guadalcanal, three of Scott's cruisers launched floatplanes. One crashed on takeoff, {{but the other}} two patrolled over Savo Island, Guadalcanal, and Ironbottom Sound. As the floatplanes were launched, Jojima's force was just passing around the mountainous northwestern shoulder of Guadalcanal, and neither force sighted each other. At 22:20, Jojima radioed Gotō {{and told him that}} no U.S. ships were in the vicinity. Although Jojima's force later heard Scott's floatplanes overhead while unloading along the north shore of Guadalcanal, they <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> this to Gotō.|$|E

Whereas extinction and neglect are common following stroke, the related phenomenon of anti-extinction is rare [...] there are four cases of anti-extinction in the literature, and all four cases demonstrated anti-extinction in the visual modality. Patients with anti-extinction do report a contralesional stimulus {{when it is}} presented {{at the same time as}} an ipsilesional stimulus; but, like patients with neglect, they <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> a contralesional stimulus when there is no competing ipsilesional stimulus.

5|$|Debs {{attended}} public school, {{dropping out}} of high school at age 14. He took a job with the Vandalia Railroad cleaning grease from the trucks of freight engines for fifty cents a day. He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive fireman <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> for work, Debs was pressed into service as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than a dollar a night for the next three and half years.|$|E

He scored on his debut with the equalizing goal against Liverpool with a penalty kick in a 1–1 draw on 28 January. He scored for Wigan in a 4–1 defeat against Arsenal and {{he finished the}} loan spell with 12 appearances and 2 goals. Following Middlesbrough's relegation to the Championship, he <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> to pre-season training, and he was eventually fined by the club after not turning up after a fortnight. He returned to training a day after this.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, Boston Police Department {{officers}} went {{on strike}} at 5:45p.m. Of the force's 1,544 officers and men, 1,117 (72%) <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> for work. Coolidge assigned 100 members of the state's Metropolitan Park Police Department to replace the striking officers, but 58 of them refused to participate and were suspended from their jobs. Despite assurances from Commissioner Curtis to Mayor Peters and Governor Coolidge, Boston had little police protection for the night of September 9. Volunteer replacements were still being organized and due to report the next morning. Many of those who provided scab labor were students at Harvard University.|$|E

50|$|Many jurisdictions {{have enacted}} {{regulations}} {{relating to the}} disposal of human bodies. Although it may be entirely legal to bury a deceased family member, the law may restrict the locations in which this activity is allowed, in some cases expressly limiting burials to property controlled by specific, licensed institutions. Furthermore, in many places, failure to properly dispose of a body is a crime.

5|$|In {{its early}} stages, the {{depression}} moved west-northwestward between {{the islands of}} St. Vincent and St. Lucia {{under the influence of}} a strong ridge to its north. Compared to its appearance 24hours before forming, the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection, although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, which <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> a closed circulation despite the depression's well-organized appearance on satellite imagery. At 21:00UTC on October5, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74mph (119km/h), corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60mph (95km/h). Based on these data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Iris, situated about 155mi (250km) south of the southern coast of Puerto Rico. In post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that Iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese force {{made contact}} with the outer {{positions}} of Maroubra Force, focusing upon the observation posts that had been laid down {{either side of the}} Eora Creek gorge. Along the Isurava ridgeline, these attacks were held off by the 39th. However, around Missima along the alternate route, which had been held by the 53rd, the Australian position was destroyed and the village taken, opening the route to the Australian rear. In response, the 53rd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Ward, dispatched a company from Alola forward to Abuari, to shore up the position there. Potts also requested reinforcements {{in the form of the}} 2/27th Infantry Battalion, which was being held in reserve around Port Moresby. The request was denied, though, due to concerns about the position around Milne Bay. Although some measure of defence was mounted by the 53rd, which dispatched another company after the first <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> in, the situation grew worse for the Australians. Conflicting information was sent back from the 53rd's forward positions, confusing Potts' headquarters and rendering co-ordinated action impossible. To make matters worse for them, the Japanese ambushed and killed several of the 53rd's senior officers, including Ward. As the 53rd's position disintegrated the Japanese also faltered, failing to exploit the opportunity to roll up the Australian position all the way to Alola. Horie's 2/144th was stalled into inaction by fatigue, and hesitation, caused by the defence previously mounted by the 53rd. The Japanese battalion commander was convinced that the route was more heavily defended than it actually was. While the Japanese failed to exploit the situation, the 2/16th was tasked with restoring the position around Abuari, reinforcing the 53rd as the Japanese began threatening the Eora Creek crossing.|$|E

50|$|Extinction is a {{phenomenon}} observable during double simultaneous stimulation of both left and right visual fields. Patients with extinction will <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> perceive the stimulus in the contralesional visual field when presented {{in conjunction with a}} stimulus in the ipsilesional field. However, when presented on its own, patients can correctly perceive the contralesional stimulus. Thus, patients with neglect <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> stimuli present in the aberrant field, whereas patients with extinction <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> stimuli in the aberrant field only when double simultaneous presentations occur in both hemifields. Analogous to neglect, extinction affects the contralesional visuospatial field in majority of patients with unilateral damage. Anatomical correlates of visuospatial neglect and extinction do not overlap absolutely, with extinction proposed to be associated with subcortical lesions.|$|R

For example, several texts entered into evidence during the trial implied that Steubenville head coach Reno Saccoccia was trying to cover for the players, which led to nationwide outrage after he received a new contract as the district's administrative services director. In response, shortly after the sentences were handed down Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced he would empanel a special grand jury to determine whether other crimes were committed—specifically, whether coaches and other school officials <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> the rape even though Ohio law makes them mandated reporters.|$|E
