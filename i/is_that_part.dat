Part {{of the difficulty}} in estimating the city's population <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated {{to be close to}} one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E
5|$|This {{conflict}} has led historians {{to take a}} number of positions on political arrangements in the province. Some have argued that Josephus' greater knowledge of Jewish affairs justifies favouring his account. M. Aberbach believes {{that there was a}} division of power, but that Tacitus reversed the governors' areas of authority and that Cumanus actually governed the south and Felix the north; this fits better with Josephus, who describes Cumanus as active in Jerusalem and nearby. Another suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the province was transferred to Felix after disturbances under Cumanus' rule.|$|E
5|$|Since the Reformation, {{the nave}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the {{building}} which is usually open to and most used by the congregation and general public. There is also, usually in the nave, a raised pulpit from which the dean or other clergy can expound the scriptures. In the late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for an hourly prayer to be said, {{for the benefit of}} visitors, and this is often presented from the nave pulpit. In a large cathedral, particularly in those where the building is divided by a screen as at Canterbury, an altar may be set at the eastern end of the nave so that services might be held there for large congregations. At each place where services are held there is a lectern on which rests a Bible.|$|E

5|$|The thorax is {{segmented}} {{into the}} two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> {{from which all}} three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax. When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.|$|E

25|$|The frons <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of {{the head}} capsule that lies ventrad or anteriad of the vertex. The frons varies in size {{relative}} to the insect, and in many species the definition of its borders is arbitrary, even in some insect taxa that have well-defined head capsules. In most species, though, the frons is bordered at its anterior by the frontoclypeal or epistomal sulcus above the clypeus. Laterally it {{is limited by the}} fronto-genal sulcus, if present, and the boundary with the vertex, by the ecdysial cleavage line, if it is visible. If there is a median ocellus, it generally is on the frons, though in some insects such as many Hymenoptera, all three ocelli appear on the vertex. A more formal definition is that it is the sclerite from which the pharyngeal dilator muscles arise, but in many contexts that too, is not helpful. In the anatomy of some taxa, such as many Cicadomorpha, the front {{of the head}} is fairly clearly distinguished and tends to be broad and sub-vertical; that median area commonly is taken to be the frons.|$|E

500|$|Instead {{of using}} {{multitrack}} recording (which was quickly gaining popularity), the Allman Brothers Band opted to cut most of Idlewild South live, {{with all of}} the musicians performing together. On rare occasions, they would go back to overdub sections that weren't up to standard. [...] "The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the thing of the Allman Brothers is the spontaneity — the elasticity. The parts and tempos vary in a way that only they are sensitive to", said Dowd. Duane often left a song alone for more work and testing out on the road. [...] "They would record maybe five songs. Then they might say, 'I don't think that song was good enough,' or, 'I don't think that song was ready to record,", remembered Dowd. Joel Dorn, predominantly a jazz producer for Atlantic, stepped in to produce one song on the album, [...] "Please Call Home", which was recorded at Regency Sound Studios on July 14, 1970.

Uplifted portions of the forearc, composed of Eocene igneous basement surmounted by reef terraces of Eocene and younger age, produce the island chain from Guam north to Ferdinand de Medinilla in the Marianas.

2500|$|The {{mouldboard}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the plough which {{receives the}} furrow slice from the share.

The intensity of this action depends on the type of the moldboard. [...] To suit different soil conditions and crop requirements, mouldboards have been designed in different shapes, each producing its own furrow profile and surface finish, but they still basically conform to the original plough body classification. Traditionally, the various types of plough body have been classified as general purpose, digger, and semi-digger, as described below.|$|E

2500|$|The {{photographs}} and portraits {{in the world}} of wizards are not stationary like in the Muggle world. They move around within the frame and from one portrait to another, and are also able to talk if they are developed in a certain potion. A portrait of the Fat Lady is used in Hogwarts to cover the door to the Gryffindor common room and opens only when she is given the password. Also, there are various paintings of old Headmasters and Headmistresses of Hogwarts in Dumbledore's office, and he is shown to be in discussion with them from time to time. He also uses the portrait of Phineas Nigellus, Sirius Black's great grandfather, to communicate with Sirius and to keep a watch at the Order's Headquarters through another portrait of Phineas in the house. The headmaster portraits are special, not simply {{due to the fact that}} they appear in them because of their death.

2500|$|Most of the {{ceremony}} {{takes place in a}} circular pattern with everyone seated cross-legged on the floor, or on the ground if it takes place outside in an open ceremonial area (malae).

The middle posts/termed matua Tala are reserved for the leading chiefs and the side posts on the front section termed Pou o le pepe are occupied by the orators chiefs. The posts {{at the back of the}} house talatua indicate the positions maintained by the 'ava makers and assistants.

2500|$|Many slums [...] grow {{because of}} growing {{informal}} economy which creates demand for workers. Informal economy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> {{of an economy}} that is neither registered as a business nor licensed, one that does not pay taxes and is not monitored by local or state or federal government. Informal economy grows faster than formal economy when government laws and regulations are opaque and excessive, government bureaucracy is corrupt and abusive of entrepreneurs, labor laws are inflexible, or when law enforcement is poor. Urban informal sector is between 20 and 60% of most developing economies' GDP; in Kenya, 78 per cent of non-agricultural employment is in the informal sector making up 42 per cent of GDP. In many cities the informal sector accounts for as much as 60 per cent of employment of the urban population. For example, in Benin, slum dwellers comprise 75 per cent of informal sector workers, while in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad and Ethiopia, they make up 90 per cent of the informal labour force. Slums thus create an informal alternate economic ecosystem, that demands low paid flexible workers, something impoverished residents of slums deliver. In other words, countries where starting, registering and running a formal business is difficult, tend to encourage informal businesses and slums. Without a sustainable formal economy that raise incomes and create opportunities, squalid slums are likely to continue.|$|E
