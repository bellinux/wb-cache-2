40|$|CONTEXTO: A presença de aneurisma da aorta {{abdominal}} (AAA) é rara em pacientes jovens. OBJETIVO: Avaliar os resultados da cirurgia <b>do</b> <b>AAA</b> em pacientes com idade BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) {{are rare}} in young patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes after AAA repair in patients aged < 50 years. METHODS: Between June 1979 and January 2008, 946 patients underwent elective repair for an infrarenal AAA {{performed by the}} first author. Of these, 13 patients (1. 4 %) were < 50 years old at surgery. Demographic characteristics and surgical data were analyzed, as well as early and late outcomes after surgical intervention. RESULTS: Mean age was 46 ± 3. 4 years (ranging from 43 to 50 years). Most patients were men (76. 9 %), hypertensive (76. 9 %) and smokers (61. 5 %). Perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were low (15. 4 % and 0 %, respectively); one patient had respiratory infection and another patient had unstable angina. Median follow-up was 85. 5 months, and two patients died due to ischemic cardiopathy and cerebrovascular accident during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: AAA repair in young patients is a safe procedure, with good long-term results. In our study, there were no perioperative deaths, and a good long-term survival was observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the wear of four different ceramics and human enamel. The ceramics used were lithium disilicate glass (e. max Press), leucite-reinforced glass (GN-Ceram), yttria-stabilized zirconia (Aadva Zr), and feldspathic porcelain (Porcelain AAA). Hemispherical styli were fabricated with these ceramics and with tooth enamel. Flattened enamel was used for antagonistic specimens. After 100, 000 wear cycles of a two-body wear test, the height and volume losses of the styli and enamel antagonists were determined. The mean and standard deviation for eight specimens were calculated and statistically analyzed using a non-parametric (Steel-Dwass) test (α = 0. 05). GN-Ceram exhibited greater stylus height and volume losses than <b>did</b> Porcelain <b>AAA.</b> E. max Press, Porcelain AAA, and enamel styli showed no significant differences, and Aadva Zr exhibited the smallest stylus height and volume losses. The wear of the enamel antagonist was not significantly different among GN-Ceram, e. max Press, Porcelain AAA, and enamel styli. Aadva Zr resulted in significantly lower wear values of the enamel antagonist than <b>did</b> GN-Ceram, Porcelain <b>AAA,</b> and enamel styli. In conclusion, leucite-reinforced glass, lithium disilicate glass, and feldspathic porcelain showed wear values closer to those for human enamel than did yttria-stabilized zirconia. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 878 号 学位授与年月日:平成 28 年 8 月 3 日Author: Jun Nakashima, Yohsuke Taira, Takashi SawaseCitation: European Journal of Oral Sciences, 124 (3), pp. 295 - 300; 201...|$|R

40|$|Rupture of {{abdominal}} {{aortic aneurysm}} (AAA) remains {{a major cause}} of death in the elderly. Its prediction is a serious challenge for public health. Despite its regular use to identify patients requiring surgical treatment, the diameter of AAA is not a sufficiently precise and reliable parameter for discriminating aneurysms at high risk of rupture. A better targeting of high risk patients needs understanding in deep the processes and mechanisms directing wall rupture. Inflammation is a significant element in the progression ofAAA and can be visualized using medical imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) using a glucose derivative (FDG) as radiotracer. Studies conducted in our department have established a relationship between PET positivity and the presence of symptoms such as accelerated growth of the aneurysm or pain, signs generally considered as predictive of rupture. Moreover, activation of leukocytes coupled to cellular and molecular alterations of the aneurysmal wall in the sites of FDG uptake may lead to its instability and incompetence to resist blood pressure and rupture.

40|$|OBJETIVO: A inflamação aterosclerótica, com possível papel de agentes infecciosos, pode contribuir na patogênese dos aneurismas da aorta {{abdominal}} (AAA). O achado de Chamydia pneumoniae (CP) nessas lesões, em estudos prévios, sem quantificação, variou de 0 - 100 %. O objetivo é quantificar a presença de CP e de Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) nos AAA. MÉTODO: A espessura, o número de células positivas para CP detectadas por imunoperoxidase e a porcentagem de área ocupada por MP detectada por hibridização "in situ", nas três camadas da aorta, foram medidos com sistema de análise de imagens, em 10 aortas abdominais aneurismáticas. Usouse três grupos-controle: 1) amostras das mesmas aortas, fora do aneurisma, exceto se a dilatação tomasse toda a porção sub-renal da artéria (n= 7); 2) aortas com aterosclerose grave, mas sem aneurismas (n= 10); 3) aortas sem aterosclerose ou com grau leve da doença (n= 10). Todos os espécimes foram obtidos em necropsias. Usou-se o teste de Wald para comparar os grupos; fixou-se o nível de significância em 5 %. RESULTADOS: A íntima era mais fina e a média mais espessa nos casos normais que nos outros grupos (p 0, 05). Também se detectou MP em todos os grupos. Este agente predominou no grupo de pacientes com aterosclerose, mas sem aneurisma na íntima e na adventícia; entretanto, as diferenças entre os grupos não foram significativas (p> 0, 05).

Finding of Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) in these lesions in previous, non-quantifying studies ranged from 0 - 100 %. The objective is to quantify the presence of CP and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) in AAA. METHODS: Thickness, number of cells positive for CP by immunohistochemistry and percent area occupied by MP, detected by "in situ" hybridization in the three layers of the aorta, were measured in the three aortic layers using an image-analysis system in 10 necropsy abdominal aneurysmatic aortas. Three groups of controls were used: 1) samples of the same aortas, outside the aneurysms, except if the dilatation took the whole sub-renal portion of the artery (n= 7); 2) aortas with severe atherosclerosis but without aneurysms (n= 10); 3) aortas with no or mild atherosclerosis (n= 10).
