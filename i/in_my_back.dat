[...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you should do the Latin music, this Spanish music...

500|$|When [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] {{was being}} showed to {{different}} [...] "music industry decision-makers", {{one of those}} individuals tried to give the song to a [...] "blue-eyed blonde" [...] artist instead of Mars, due to his race.

Mars concluded, [...] "Even with that song <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> pocket to seal the deal, things like {{that are coming out}} of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room." [...] According to American record producer Jim Jonsin, Atlantic Records' chairman, Craig Kallman, wanted him to work on the track for Lupe Fiasco. However, Jonsin pressured Kallman to give the song to B.o.B. Lupe stated that Kallman told him his lyrics and performance on the record were [...] "wack". Lupe claimed that this repeated denigration from the label drove him to a breaking point, and to feel [...] "suicidal". Afterwards, his verses were removed and new ones were written by Mars and B.o.B. An unmixed version of the song with Fiasco's verses and Mars' vocals leaked later in the same year.|$|E

The recently introduced Class 40 diesels had an absolute maximum drawbar horsepower of 1,450 and this could be exceeded by a Pacific steam locomotive if worked hard. On one of O. S. Nock's first Deltic runs (the down Heart of Midlothian loaded to 13 coaches, 530 tons gross) he states [...] "once {{the tail of the}} train was over the 60 mph restriction the throttle was opened to the full, and the surge forward could be felt in the cab. Never previously had I felt a positive thrust <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> when in the second man's seat!" [...] Nock went on to estimate that at 80mph the locomotive was producing about 2,750 drawbar horsepower.|$|E

By then, the Lower East Side was, in my mind and in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world." [...] "I certainly didn’t think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the Bhagavad-gita and the Upanishads. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> pocket, waiting to meet a friend.

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{chiropractic}} began in 1895 when Daniel David Palmer of Iowa performed the first chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard. While Lillard was working without his shirt on in Palmers office, Lillard {{bent over to}} empty the trash can. Palmer noticed that Lillard had a vertebra out of position. He asked Lillard what happened, and Lillard replied, [...] "I moved the wrong way, and I heard a 'pop' <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> and that's when I lost my hearing." [...] Palmer, who was also involved in many other natural healing philosophies, had Lillard lie {{face down on the}} floor and proceeded with the adjustment. The next day, Lillard told Palmer, [...] "I can hear that rackets on the streets." [...] This experience led Palmer to open a school of chiropractic two years later. Rev. Samel Weed coined the word [...] "chiropractic" [...] from Greek roots. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in vitalism, naturalism, magnetism, spiritualism and other constructs that are not amenable to the scientific method, although Palmer tried to merge science and metaphysics. In 1896, Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic echoed Andrew Still's principles of osteopathy established a decade earlier. Both described the body as a [...] "machine" [...] whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction/subluxation to improve health. Palmer distinguished his work by noting that he was the first to use short-lever HVLA manipulative techniques using the spinous process and transverse processes as mechanical levers. He described the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by the nervous system.|$|E
