5|$|Because of {{its design}} focus on player choice, Deus Ex has been {{compared}} with System Shock, a game that inspired its design. Together, these factors give the game a great degree of replayability, as the player will have vastly different experiences, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> methods he or she uses to accomplish objectives.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of worm <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> direction they turn when encountering a new type of intersection. The different varieties of worm can be classified systematically by assigning every direction a number and listing the choice made every time a new type of intersection is encountered.|$|E
5|$|By the Visean (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} {{tetrapods}} had radiated into {{at least three}} or four main branches. Recognizable basal-group tetrapods {{are representative of the}} temnospondyls (e.g. Eryops) lepospondyls (e.g. Diplocaulus), anthracosaurs, which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota, and possibly the baphetids, which are thought to be related to temnospondyls and whose status as a main branch is yet unresolved. <b>Depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are most probably derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1943, Lockwood had {{received}} enough reports from submarine officers to convince him the Mark 6 was significantly flawed. On 24 June 1943, he formally ordered all submarines operating out of Pearl Harbor to deactivate the magnetic influence feature. However, Christie was still committed to the exploder, and ordered Fremantle boats to continue using the influence feature. Submarines operating between the two commands were required to either enable or disable it, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> command area they were in. This difference of opinion strained {{relations between the two}} admirals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> {{bones are}} present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy.

5|$|The Kaivalya Upanishad manuscripts vary, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> Veda it is {{attached}} to. The one attached to Krishna Yajurveda has 26 verses, while the edition {{attached to the}} Atharvaveda has 24 verses with an epilogue. Both convey the same message, but the former is structured as a single chapter, and the latter into two chapters (19 verses in first, 5 verses in second). The text is structured as verses, set to a poetic Vedic meter (exactly same number of syllables per verse of the song).|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology {{grew in the}} late twentieth century, as did its clinical application. In 1980, Yuet Wai Kan et al. suggested a prenatal genetic test for Thalassemia that did not rely upon DNA sequencingthen in its infancybut on restriction enzymes that cut DNA where they recognised specific short sequences, creating different lengths of DNA strand <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> allele (genetic variation) the fetus possessed. In the 1980s, the phrase was used in the names of companies such as Molecular Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethseda Research Laboraties Molecular Diagnostics.|$|E
5|$|The party then {{undertakes}} {{a number}} of quests, which vary <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> faction the PC sides with. As the quests are completed, more is revealed about the cursed mask {{and how to get}} rid of it. The party eventually learns that the Night Masks are led by vampires, and additional clues lead them to the vampires' catacombs. After defeating the vampire Latasha, the PC travels through a portal to reach the chamber of the Night Masks' leader, Orbakh. Orbakh gives the PC the choice to either become a vampire or keep the cursed mask.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of Trigonognathus within the Etmopteridae is uncertain. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic data generally support the subdivision of the Etmopteridae into two clades, one consisting of Etmopterus and Miroscyllium {{and the other}} consisting of Centroscyllium and Aculeola. Phylogenetic analyses have variously placed Trigonognathus as closer to one clade or the other or as basal to both, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> morphological characters, nuclear DNA markers, and/or mitochondrial DNA markers were used.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} applications of matrices, both {{in mathematics and}} other sciences. Some of them merely {{take advantage of the}} compact representation of a set of numbers in a matrix. For example, in game theory and economics, the payoff matrix encodes the payoff for two players, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> out of a given (finite) set of alternatives the players choose. Text mining and automated thesaurus compilation makes use of document-term matrices such as tf-idf to track frequencies of certain words in several documents.|$|E
5|$|Unlike C++, C# {{does not}} support {{multiple}} inheritance, although a class can implement any number of interfaces. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows implementing each method <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> interface that method is being called through, or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and have that be the one invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.|$|E

5|$|When {{an enzyme}} has {{multiple}} substrates, inhibitors can show {{different types of}} inhibition <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> substrate is considered. This results from the active site containing two different binding sites within the active site, one for each substrate. For example, an inhibitor might compete with substrate A for the first binding site, but be a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to substrate B in the second binding site.|$|E
5|$|ZnO highly n-type doped with Al, Ga, or In is {{transparent}} and conductive (transparency ~90%, lowest resistivity ~10−4 Ω·cm). ZnO:Al coatings {{are used for}} energy-saving or heat-protecting windows. The coating lets the visible part of the spectrum in but either reflects the infrared (IR) radiation {{back into the room}} (energy saving) or does not let the IR radiation into the room (heat protection), <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> side of the window has the coating.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em ups often {{allow the}} player {{to choose between}} a {{selection}} of protagonists—each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and set of moves. Attacks can include rapid combinations of basic attacks (combos) as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Characters often have their own special attacks, which leads to different strategies <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> character the player selects. The control system is usually simple to learn, comprising as little as two buttons. These buttons can be combined to pull off combos, as well as jumping and grappling attacks. Since the release of Double Dragon, many beat 'em ups have allowed two players {{to play the game}} cooperatively—a central aspect to the appeal of these games. Beat 'em ups are more likely to feature cooperative play than other game genres.|$|E

5|$|Every so often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E

After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt around 331 BC, the capital became the city named for him, Alexandria, on the Mediterranean coast. This situation remained stable for nearly a thousand years. After the army of the Arabian Caliph Umar captured the region in the 7th century, shortly after the death of Muhammad, he wanted to establish a new capital. When Alexandria fell in September 641, Amr ibn al-As, the commander of the conquering army, founded a new capital on the eastern bank of the river.|$|E
