Madonna came to the recording studio one Thursday, and Leonard <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> cassette of a recording of the chorus, which he had just finished working on. Madonna went to the backroom and completed the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of it.

In view of what happened to von Richthofen, and John McCudden, he promised that [...] "I won't bustle, or do anything foolish like my brother".

2500|$|After graduation, Buchanan {{became a}} {{principal}} {{at a public}} high school, in the Houghton school in Detroit. In 1870, she moved to Chicago {{to pursue a career}} in journalism. Her reception by the Chicago editors was anything but favorable. Her youth and sex, they told her frankly, were against her. It was some time, therefore, before she received a position on any of the Chicago dailies. During the time when she was without regular work, she wrote continuously, sending her stories to the various papers. Her manuscripts, as a rule, were accepted but the acceptances brought her no staff position. The editors refused consistently to take a woman on their papers. The first story which she had accepted was an account of the reception at Sacred Heart Convent, where she boarded during her first years in Chicago. She took the story to the offices of the Chicago Times and laid it on the desk of the managing editor. He picked it up, glanced at it and gave Sullivan US$5. A few days later, as she was walking down Madison Avenue, some one tapped her on the shoulder. It was the editor of the Times. “I am sorry, Miss Buchanan, that I did not read your article before I paid you. It was extremely well written and worth more than five dollars.” At that, he <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> $10 bill.
