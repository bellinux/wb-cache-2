2500|$|Summing {{up while}} {{alluding}} to the politically motivated attacks that prevented Hunt's fuller acceptance as a major literary figure in his time, Hazlitt draws a comparison with certain gentleman-poets of an earlier age, integrating this with what he has noted of Hunt's personal vanity: [...] "We have said that Lord Byron is a sublime coxcomb: why should we not say that Mr. Hunt is a delightful one? ... He is the only poet or literary man we ever knew who puts us in mind of Sir John Suckling or Killigrew or Carew; or who united rare intellectual acquirements with outward grace and natural gentility. ... A wit and a poet, Mr. Hunt is also distinguished by fineness of tact and sterling sense: he has only been a visionary in humanity, the fool of virtue." [...] And here Hazlitt brings in {{the main reason for}} the hostile politically oriented attacks on him in Tory periodicals, his notorious criticism of the Prince Regent in his own periodical: [...] "What then is the <b>draw-back</b> to so many shining qualities, that has made them useless, or even hurtful to their owner? His crime is, to have been Editor of the Examiner ten years ago ...".|$|E

Bating her lame foot and her {{leanness}} (this last a horrid <b>draw-back</b> to a woman, in my opinion), the girl had some pleasing qualities in the eye of a man. A dark, keen, clever face, and a nice clear voice, and a beautiful brown head of hair counted among her merits. A crutch appeared in the list of her misfortunes. And a temper reckoned high in the sum total of her defects.|$|E

40|$|A pseudoword is a {{composite}} comprised {{of two or more}} words chosen at random; the individual occurrences of the original words within a text are replaced by their conflation. Pseudowords are a useful mechanism for evaluating the im-pact of word sense ambiguity in many NLP applications. However, the standard method for constructing pseudowords has some <b>draw-backs.</b> Because the constituent words are cho-sen at random, the word contexts that surround pseudowords do not necessarily reflect the con-texts that real ambiguous words occur in. This in turn leads to an optimistic upper bound on algorithm performance. To address these <b>draw-backs,</b> we propose the use of lexical categories to create more realistic pseudowords, and eval-uate the results of different variations of this idea against the standard approach. ...|$|R

Don't be slovenly-minded, Betteredge! One {{thing at a}} time. You have heard about the Colonel's Will; now you must hear what {{happened}} after the Colonel's death. It was formally necessary to have the Diamond valued, before the Will could be proved. All the jewellers consulted, at once confirmed the Colonel's assertion that he possessed {{one of the largest}} diamonds in the world. The question of accurately valuing it presented some serious difficulties. Its size made it a phenomenon in the diamond market; its colour placed it in a category by itself; and, to add to these elements of uncertainty, there was a defect, {{in the shape of a}} flaw, in the very heart of the stone. Even with this last serious <b>draw-back,</b> however, the lowest of the various estimates given was twenty thousand pounds. Conceive my father's astonishment! He had been within a hair's-breadth of refusing to act as executor, and of allowing this magnificent jewel to be lost to the family. The interest he took in the matter now, induced him to open the sealed instructions which had been deposited with the Diamond. Mr. Bruff showed this document to me, with the other papers; and it suggests (to my mind) a clue to the nature of the conspiracy which threatened the Colonel's life." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} clinical translation of gene therapy is that viral vector-mediated {{manipulation of the}} genetic make-up of neurons is irreversible. An alternative approach is to use tools for on-demand suppression of neuronal and circuit excitability. The first such approach was to use optogenetics. Several laboratories {{have shown that the}} inhibitory light-sensitive protein Halorhodopsin can suppress seizure-like discharges in vitro as well as epileptic activity in vivo. A <b>draw-back</b> of optogenetics is that light needs to be delivered to the area of the brain expressing the opsin. This can be achieved with laser-coupled fiber-optics or light-emitting diodes, but these are invasive.|$|E
50|$|The {{money order}} system was {{established}} by a private firm in Great Britain in 1792, and was expensive and not very successful. In approximately 1836, it was sold to another private firm which lowered the fees, which therefore significantly increased the popularity and usage of the system. The Post Office noted the success and profitability, and it took over the system in 1838. Fees were further reduced and usage increased further, making the money order system reasonably profitable. The only <b>draw-back</b> was the need to send an advance to the paying Post Office before payment could be tendered to {{the recipient of the}} order. This drawback was likely the primary incentive for establishment of the Postal Order System on 1 January 1881.|$|E

50|$|The M3 was the solution. The {{design was}} unusual because the main weapon — a larger caliber, low-velocity 75 mm gun — {{was in an}} offset sponson mounted in the hull with limited traverse. The sponson mount was {{necessary}} because, at the time, American tank plants were incapable of casting a turret {{big enough to hold}} the 75mm main gun. A small turret with a lighter, high-velocity 37 mm gun sat on top of the tall hull. A small cupola on top of the turret held a machine gun. The use of two main guns was seen on the French Char B1 and the Mark I version of the British Churchill tank. In each case, two weapons were mounted to give the tanks adequate capability in firing both anti-personnel high explosive ammunition and armor-piercing ammunition for anti-tank combat. The M3 differed slightly from this pattern having a main gun that could fire an armor-piercing projectile at a velocity high enough for efficiently piercing armor, as well as deliver a high-explosive shell that was large enough to be effective. Using a hull mounted gun, the M3 design could be produced faster than a tank featuring a turreted gun. It was understood that the M3 design was flawed, but Britain urgently needed tanks. A <b>draw-back</b> of the sponson mount was that the M3 could not take a hull-down position and use its 75 mm gun at the same time.The M3 was tall and roomy: the power transmission ran through the crew compartment under the turret cage to the gearbox driving the front sprockets. Steering was by differential braking, with a turning circle of 37 ft. The vertical volute-sprung suspension (VVSS) units possessed a return roller mounted directly atop the main housing of each of the six suspension units (three per side), designed as self-contained and readily replaced modular units bolted to the hull sides. The turret was power-traversed by an electro-hydraulic system {{in the form of an}} electric motor providing the pressure for the hydraulic motor. This fully rotated the turret in 15 seconds. Control was from a spade grip on the gun. The same motor provided pressure for the gun stabilizing system.|$|E
