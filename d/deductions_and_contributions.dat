Here, he treated, among other things, Riemann surfaces, non-Euclidean geometry, differential geometry, interpolation and approximation, and probability theory. He found the latter the most interesting, {{because as a}} relatively recent one, {{the relationship between the}} <b>deduction</b> <b>and</b> the empirical <b>contribution</b> was more clear. In 1919, he published Calcolo della probabilità e applicazioni, an early textbook on the subject. He also wrote a book on calculus, Le origini del calcolo infinitesimale nell'era moderna.|$|R

In addition, the running costs appear on their pay slip as deductions, with costs paid by the employer shown as [...] "pre-tax" [...] <b>deductions</b> <b>and</b> employee <b>contributions</b> as [...] "post-tax" [...] deductions. It therefore appears to {{the employee}} that they are directly paying all the running costs {{of the motor vehicle}} (albeit in some strange tax beneficial way), even though strictly the employer is paying for all or part of those costs. In addition, the leased vehicle is effectively their personal vehicle, chosen by them, available for their exclusive use, and they have first option to purchase it {{at the end of the}} lease.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Nature {{of science}} (NOS) has clearly won {{a place in}} science {{teaching}} given its increasing inclusion in standards documents, but the exact NOS elements {{that should be the}} focus of instruction have not yet been well determined. This study reviewed eight nature of science books designed for the general reader with the rationale that much might be learned about the most appropriate NOS content by examining works written for non-scientists by experts in the history and philosophy of science. A qualitative analysis of each text resulted in a set of twenty-three unique NOS content domain topics each found in at least one book in the set of those reviewed. Each book was reviewed again with respect to this master list of topics and compared against a rubric of 0 - 3 (no to high) to gauge the degree of inclusion of each topic. This information permitted the ranking of books and of topics related to the level of inclusion of each NOS content element. The topics most frequently included definitions of science, characteristics and goals of science, general discussions of the history of science, the roles of induction <b>and</b> <b>deduction,</b> the <b>contributions</b> of Kuhn <b>and</b> Popper, the roles of induction <b>and</b> <b>deduction,</b> <b>and</b> the interplay of science and society. The lowest ranked topics focused on the role of models in science, definitions of pseudoscience, NOS in specific science disciplines, the distinction between science and technology and the role of creativity in science. Assuming that the books reviewed contain all of the most useful suggestions for what members of the general publi...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} {{integrating}} <b>deduction</b> <b>and</b> search {{with the aid of}} machine learning techniques to yield practically efficient decision procedures for quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs). We show that effective on-line policies can be learned from the observed performances of <b>deduction</b> <b>and</b> search on representative sets of formulas. Such policies can be leveraged to switch between <b>deduction</b> <b>and</b> search during the solving process. We provide empirical evidence that learned policies perform better than either <b>deduction</b> <b>and</b> search, even when the latter are combined using hand-made policies based on previous works. The fact that even with a proof-of-concept implementation, our approach is competitive with sophisticated state-of-the-art QBF solvers shows the potential of machine learning techniques in the integration of different reasoning methods...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{programs}} are formal texts that are composed by programmers and executed by machines. Formal methods {{are used to}} predict the execution-time behavior of a program text through formal, symbolic calculation. Automation {{in the form of}} computer programs can be used to execute formal calculations so that they are reproducible <b>and</b> checkable. <b>Deduction</b> <b>and</b> exploration are two basic frameworks for the formal calculation of program properties. Both <b>deduction</b> <b>and</b> exploration have their limitations. We argue that these limitations can be overcome through a methodology for automated veri cation that uses property-preserving abstractions {{to bridge the gap between}} <b>deduction</b> <b>and</b> exporation.

40|$|There are two {{principal}} rationales for the charitable deduction. Depending upon choice of rationale, some tax reform changes are suggested {{and others are}} not. A base measurement rationale suggests eliminating the deduction for unrealized appreciation, keeping the benefit as a <b>deduction</b> <b>and</b> not a credit, not adopting caps or a nonitemizer <b>deduction,</b> <b>and</b> protecting the tax base by narrowing the class of organizations eligible to receive deductible contributions. A subsidy rationale, depending upon which strand is emphasized, might favor a more equitable tax benefit {{in the form of}} a credit or through caps or a nonitemizer <b>deduction,</b> <b>and</b> could lead to preferring some organizations over others. Both rationales are consistent with placing a floor under the <b>deduction,</b> <b>and</b> narrowing its scope. Present law presents a confusing mix of policies and priorities.
