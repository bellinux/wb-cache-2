Ponting recovered to lead the team in the Fourth Test, Australia's only loss.|$|E
5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought up for a vote. The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term.

5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, chances are that the number of alleles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|By definition, modern {{democratic}} constitutional monarchies are parliamentary, {{as there}} is no elected head of state who could assume non-ceremonial competences; of the twenty one republican member states of the European Union, only one is a presidential republic (Cyprus) and five are semi-presidential republics (France, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Romania). These six (semi-)presidential republics elect their president by direct popular vote. Among the fourteen parliamentary republics, half do the same (namely Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia and Slovenia), whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> seven (Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia and Malta), the president is elected by parliament or other special representative body such as the German Bundesversammlung.|$|E

5|$|Croatia can be {{subdivided}} {{between a}} number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently {{one of the richest}} in Europe in terms of biodiversity.

One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.|$|E

He was less effective <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> games, ending the series with 21 wickets {{at an average of}} 21.47, and scored 37 runs at an average of 7.40. He was not selected in the next Test matches played by England, against Australia in 1886, and missed the next English tour of Australia, in the winter of 1886–87, again organised by Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite.|$|E

Only the length of decision rules is extended when the current decision rules can’t classify all <b>the</b> samples <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decision table. At the same time, three methods are proposed to reduce the computational complexity: 1) defines the concept of bound coefficient, 2) only classify the samples with the same decision values at a time thus averting the time-consuming classification of the equivalence classes with different decision values, 3) defines <b>the</b> <b>Remain</b> set and only classify <b>the</b> samples <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Remain</b> set, so <b>the</b> computational complexity will decrease proportional with the reduction of <b>the</b> samples <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Remain</b> set.

For Arsenal, Kolo Touré partnered Sol Campbell in central defence as Martin Keown was absent. Mikaël Silvestre gave Manchester United {{the lead in the}} 15th minute from a corner, but Thierry Henry equalised for Arsenal five minutes later from a free-kick. In the second half, substitute Francis Jeffers was sent off for kicking out at Phil Neville. Neither team was able to score <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> time, so the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Howard saved the decisive spot-kick taken by Robert Pirès.|$|E
