25|$|In 1885, he was {{deported}} to Siberia, serving a three-year term. Briefly kept in Tyumen prison awaiting transport further east, {{he was sent}} to Kurgan in the custody of two gendarmes (October). He was joined there by Maria, who gave birth to their son Roman in 1886. Moving to Turinsk, the Steres joined a group of revolutionaries in internal exile; Constantin Stere agreed to print copies of a Narodnik magazine, using a <b>hectograph,</b> and was exposed during a raid by authorities. He was swiftly taken to Tobolsk, then shipped down the Irtysh to the place where it met the Ob; he traveled to the village of Sharkala (the northernmost part of Siberia he ever reached) in a Khanty canoe, and was then settled in Beryozovsky District, only to be arrested again and sent back to Tobolsk in the autumn of 1888.|$|E

50|$|Mimeographs, {{along with}} spirit duplicators and <b>hectographs,</b> were a common {{technology}} in printing small quantities, as in office work, classroom materials, and church bulletins.

In the late 1960s, mimeographs, spirit duplicators, and <b>hectographs</b> began to be gradually displaced by photocopying.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{science fiction}} fanzine, The Comet, was {{published}} in 1930. Fanzine printing methods have changed over the decades, from the <b>hectograph,</b> the mimeograph, and the ditto machine, to modern photocopying. Distribution volumes rarely justify the cost of commercial printing. Modern fanzines are printed on computer printers or at local copy shops, or they may only be sent as email. The best known fanzine (or [...] "'zine") today is Ansible, edited by David Langford, winner of numerous Hugo awards. Other fanzines to win awards in recent years include File 770, Mimosa, and Plokta. Artists working for fanzines have risen to prominence in the field, including Brad W. Foster, Teddy Harvia, and Joe Mayhew; the Hugos include a category for Best Fan Artists. The earliest organized fandom online was the [...] community, originally a mailing list in the late 1970s with a text archive file that was updated regularly. In the 1980s, Usenet groups greatly expanded the circle of fans online. In the 1990s, {{the development of the}} World-Wide Web exploded the community of online fandom by orders of magnitude, with thousands and then literally millions of web sites devoted to science fiction and related genres for all media. Most such sites are small, , and/or very narrowly focused, though sites like SF Site and SFcrowsnest offer a broad range of references and reviews about science fiction.|$|E

50|$|It is {{also used}} to create unique acrylic paint prints. The {{gelatine}} <b>hectograph</b> has been commercialized by Joan Bess and Lou Ann Gleason.

50|$|The special aniline dyes {{for making}} the master image {{came in the form}} of ink or in pens, pencils, carbon paper and even {{typewriter}} ribbon. <b>Hectograph</b> pencils and pens are sometimes still available. Various other inks have been found usable to varying degrees in the process; master sheets for spirit duplicators have also been pressed into service. Unlike a spirit duplicator master, a <b>hectograph</b> master is not a mirror image. Thus, when using a spirit duplicator master with a <b>hectograph,</b> one writes on the back of the purple sheet, using it like carbon paper to produce an image on the white sheet, rather than writing on the front of the white sheet to produce a mirror image on its back.|$|E

Other titles experimented with materials such as wallpaper, printing methods including carbon copying and <b>hectographs,</b> and binding methods including the random sequencing of pages, ensuring no two books {{would have the same}} contextual meaning.|$|R

That summer, upon his return to the family home at Bolkhov, Preobrazhensky closely reviewed this and other illegal material and determined to himself become actively involved in the revolutionary movement seeking the overthrow of the Tsarist regime in Russia.|$|R

Apart from paintings, Nolde's work includes many prints, often in color, and watercolor paintings of varied subjects (landscapes, religious images, flowers, stormy seas and scenes from Berlin nightlife). A famous series of paintings covers the German New Guinea Expedition, visiting the South Seas, Moscow, Siberia, Korea, Japan, and China.

On 15 April 1915, Germans captured Šiauliai and the gymnasium dispersed. Janonis evacuated to Vilnius and then Voronezh where a special Lithuanian gymnasium was opened by Martynas Yčas. There he was roommate with Butkų Juzė. Janonis {{was elected to}} the three-member presidium of aušrininkai organization and to editors of its <b>hectographed</b> newspaper Sūkurys (Whirlpool). However, the organization did not support revolutionary socialism and Janonis left in protest. In early 1916, he departed to Petrograd.|$|R
25|$|Initially {{raised by}} his {{maternal}} grandmother, Rosetti was then sent to various schools, and in 1890 was studying at Andrei Șaguna High School in Brașov, then under Austro-Hungarian rule. It was here that he met poet Ștefan Octavian Iosif, together with whom he put out the <b>hectographed</b> magazine Păcăleandru. Stubborn and rebelling against the prison-like conditions in boarding schools, he was then placed under private tutors, but did not manage to complete his studies. Reputedly, it was during these years that he first met Caragiale, who (despite being formally uneducated) worked as a teacher of Romanian history {{at one of the}} schools attended by young Rosetti. Rosetti was saluted by Caragiale as Romania's second-greatest writer, after Caragiale himself. Later, he found out that this was a prank: Caragiale would pay that same compliment to other writers in his circle.|$|R

5000|$|Lovecraft was {{frequently}} ill as a child, and he barely attended school {{until he was}} eight years old because of his sickly condition, and was withdrawn after a year. He read voraciously during this period and became especially enamored of chemistry and astronomy. He produced several <b>hectographed</b> publications with a limited circulation, beginning in 1899 with The Scientific Gazette. Four years later, he returned to public school at Hope High School. Beginning in his early life, Lovecraft is believed to have suffered from sleep paralysis, a form of parasomnia; he believed himself to be assaulted at night by horrific [...] "night gaunts". Much of his later work is thought to have been directly inspired by these terrors. (Indeed, [...] "Night Gaunts" [...] became the subject of a poem of the same name, in which they were personified as devil-like creatures without faces.) ...|$|R
50|$|Shortly thereafter, Houteff had an informal, {{unofficial}} {{meeting with}} some {{local and regional}} administrators to share his views. Initially, the leaders dismissed his views as “fanciful” and did not take him seriously. Approximately one year later, he prepared a 172-page manuscript entitled “The Shepherd’s Rod, Volume One.” In this book, Houteff listed twelve specific areas that he felt the church needed to address under the heading “Partial List of Abominations". According to Houteff, the book’s chief purpose was “a call for reformation.” It also included information attempting to define {{the identity of the}} 144,000 of the book of Revelation, as well as his disputed interpretations of Isaiah 54-66. Thirty-three <b>hectographed</b> copies were distributed to leading officials at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Session in June 1930. According to Houteff, each recipient promised to investigate the book thoroughly and respond to him either in person or by letter. Houteff also desired an official hearing. In the subsequent six years only two recipients responded. It is unclear as to whether there were additional responses prior to Houteff's death in 1955. The official church explanation was that the recipients were preoccupied with the tasks of the Session and did not have sufficient time to review the manuscript.|$|R
