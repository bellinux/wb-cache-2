5|$|Astatine <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> {{radioactive}} element; all its isotopes have short half-lives of 8.1 {{hours or}} less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, bismuth, polonium or radon. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 {{elements in the}} periodic table, only francium is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17.

5|$|Meitnerium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Mt and atomic number 109. It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> radioactive synthetic element (an element {{not found in}} nature that can be created in a laboratory). The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 7.6seconds, although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may have a longer half-life of 67seconds. The GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, first created this element in 1982. It is named for Lise Meitner.|$|E

5|$|Methoxyflurane <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> potent {{and highly}} lipid-soluble {{anesthetic}} agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does}} not predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E

5|$|Silver <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> soft, ductile and {{malleable}} transition metal, {{though it}} is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver.|$|E
5|$|Superior {{mesenteric}} artery syndrome (SMA) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> rare life-threatening {{condition that}} {{can either be}} congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and maywhen congenitalresult from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.|$|E
5|$|The genus Amphidromus {{is unusual}} in that it {{includes}} species that have dextral shell-coiling and species that have sinistral shell-coiling. In addition, some species within this genus are particularly notable because their populations simultaneously include individuals with left-handed and right-handed shell-coiling. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> rare phenomenon, and very interesting to biologists. Studies focused on the soft anatomy of Amphidromus are scattered and fragmentary. Information on the internal anatomy is known only from a few species, and no larger, comparative morphological study has ever been carried out.|$|E

5|$|The {{incomplete}} combustion {{of fossil}} fuels (such as diesel) and wood releases black carbon into the air. Though black carbon, most of which is soot, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> small component of air pollution at land surface levels, the phenomenon has a significant heating effect on the atmosphere at altitudes above two kilometers (6,562ft). Also, it dims {{the surface of the}} ocean by absorbing solar radiation.|$|E
5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> potent anesthetic agent. It {{is a powerful}} analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so. Einsteinium was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E
