40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the factors influencing <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> performance and accounting for expert <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> performance should benefit medical practice. Therefore, the aim here is to highlight key issues with using deliberate practice to improve <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> performance, especially given the success of deliberate practice for developing individual expert performance in medicine and other domains. Highlighting these issues will inform the development of training for <b>medical</b> <b>teams.</b> The authors first describe team coordination and its critical role in <b>medical</b> <b>teams.</b> Presented next are the cognitive mechanisms that allow expert performers to accurately interpret the current situation via the creation of an accurate mental “model” of the current situation, known as a situation model. Following this, the authors propose that effective team performance depends at least in part on team members having similar models of the situation, known as a shared situation model. The authors then propose guiding principles for implementing team deliberate practice in medicine and describe how team deliberate practice can be used in an attempt to reduce barriers inherent in <b>medical</b> <b>teams</b> to the development of shared situation models. The paper concludes with considerations of limitations, and future research directions, concerning the implementation of team deliberate practice within medicine...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Disasters {{cause an}} acute {{deterioration}} in {{all stages of}} life. An area affected by the disaster in which the normal activities of life are disrupted {{is described as a}} “Field” in disaster terminology. Although {{it is not easy to}} define the borders of this zone, the area where there is normally functioning society is accepted as the boundary. Disaster management is the responsibility of the local government. However, in many large disaster responses many non-governmental and international organizations play a role. A Disaster <b>Medical</b> <b>Team</b> is a trained, mobile, self-contained, self-sufficient, multidisciplinary <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> that can act in the acute phase of a sudden-onset disaster (48 to 72 hours after its occurrence) to provide medical treatment in the affected area. The <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> can include physicians, nurses, paramedics and EMTS, technicians, personnel to manage logistics, security and others. Various models of Disaster <b>Medical</b> <b>Teams</b> can be observed around the world. There is paucity of evidence based literature regarding DMTs. There is a need for epidemiological studies with rigorous designs and sampling. In this section of the special edition of the journal, field organizations in health management during disasters will be summarized, with emphasis on preparedness and response phases, and disaster <b>medical</b> <b>teams</b> will be discussed.
