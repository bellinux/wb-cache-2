5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the {{need to understand the}} divine in order to embrace it.|$|E

30|$|This {{study also}} {{compared}} the emission of phosphorus during degradation at a significance level of 0.05. Formulas  11 and 10 averaged 7.97 and 7.06  mg-P/kg, respectively, and <b>were</b> not statistically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> {{each other but}} <b>were</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the other formulas.

5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> lung cancer).|$|E
5|$|Attack by the ant Crematogaster laeviuscula <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> {{attacks by}} birds. Rather than {{knocking}} down the nest, the ants swarm {{all over the}} nest and remove the brood from it. The ants destroy the entire brood but {{they are unable to}} kill the adults.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata again while Thomaskantor in Leipzig, notably {{at his first}} Easter there on 9 April 1724. He also performed it the following year on 1 April 1725, in his second cycle of Leipzig cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. It followed in the cycle some forty newly composed cantatas. This early work fits the cycle {{in the sense that}} it is based on a chorale, but its style <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the others.|$|E

5|$|Chambyal (people of Chamba) {{enjoy the}} {{traditional}} folk music of their area. This consists of folk songs, dances and folklores {{and these are}} accompanied by various musical instruments.

Folk songs of Gaddis can be categorized as marriage songs, festivity songs, love songs.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{published}} his music in France, England and the German states {{due to the}} copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of ‘first editions’. Each edition <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E

30|$|This study {{compared}} the emission of nitrogen at different ratios; for the formula, a significance level of 0.05 {{was chosen to}} indicate differences. Formulas  4, 11 and 12 averaged 0.340, 0.485 and 0.350 % nitrogen, respectively, and <b>were</b> not <b>different</b> <b>from</b> each other but <b>were</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the other formulas. The nitrogen content of formula  11 <b>was</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the other formulas. The average percent nitrogen is shown in Table  3.|$|R
5|$|In 1998, a fragmentary fossil {{of another}} species of this {{same group of}} oryzomyines was found in eastern Argentina. It was {{initially}} identified as a possible second species of Noronhomys {{on the basis of}} the presence of a crest on the upper first molar, the mesoloph, but the specimen <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Noronhomys vespuccii in other respects, and in 2008 it was described as a new genus and species, Carletonomys cailoi, related to Noronhomys and associated genera.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's cuisine {{reflects}} the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. Many cultures {{from within the}} country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, {{largely due to the}} country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the original dishes.|$|E

Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations; this behavior <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of other programming languages. Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), octal, hexadecimal, and binary notations.|$|E

5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is known}} from three certain species, P. walkeri, P. tubicen, and P. cyrtocristatus. All {{of them can}} be {{distinguished}} from each other, and have many differences. The first named species, therefore the type, is P. walkeri. One certain specimen, from the Dinosaur Park Formation is referred to it, but many more are almost certainly referable. Like stated above, it <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the other two species, with it having a simpler internal structure than P. tubicen, a straighter crest and different internal structuring than P. cyrtocristatus.|$|E
5|$|Peers help expose {{children}} to multi-party conversations. This allows {{children to}} hear {{a greater variety of}} speech, and to observe different conversational roles. Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners, which pressures the children to communicate more effectively. Speaking to peers <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> speaking to adults, but children may still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{astronomy}} uses radiation {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter. Radio astronomy <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> most {{other forms of}} observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} two main {{characters}} was planned {{since the beginning}} of the game's development.
