40|$|Using isophotal radius {{correlations}} for {{a sample of}} 2 MASS <b>ellipticals,</b> we have constructed a series of template surface brightness profiles to describe the profile shapes of <b>ellipticals</b> {{as a function of}} luminosity. The templates are a smooth function of luminosity, yet are not adequately matched to any fitting function supporting the view that <b>ellipticals</b> are weakly non-homologous with respect to structure. Through comparison to the templates, it is discovered that <b>ellipticals</b> are divided into two families; those well matched to the templates and a second class of <b>ellipticals</b> with distinctly shallower profile slopes. We refer to these second type of <b>ellipticals</b> as D class, an old morphological designation acknowledging diffuse appearance on photographic material. D <b>ellipticals</b> cover the same range of luminosity, size and kinematics as normal <b>ellipticals,</b> but maintain a signature of recent equal mass dry mergers.

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{implement}} an observational test of the theoretical notion that dissipation in major mergers of gas-rich galaxies produces the fundamental plane (FP) and related correlations obeyed by <b>ellipticals.</b> Observations {{have shown that the}} “tilt ” of the FP involves more than a simple non-homology or stellar population effect: lower-mass <b>ellipticals</b> have a higher ratio of stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. Theoretical models have attempted to explain this via dissipation: if <b>ellipticals</b> are formed in major mergers of disks, then mergers between disks having a larger gas content (typically observed to be lower-mass disks) will yield remnants with a larger mass fraction formed in a central, compact starburst, giving a smaller stellar Re and lower Mtot/M ∗ within that Re. Such starbursts leave a characteristic imprint in the surface brightness profiles of <b>ellipticals,</b> {{in the form of a}} central excess above the outer profile established by the dissipationless, violent relaxation of disk stars. In previous work, we implemented a purely empirical method to use such features in the observed profiles of <b>ellipticals</b> to robustly estimate the amount of dissipation involved in the original spheroid-forming merger. Applying this to a large sample of <b>ellipticals</b> with detailed kinematic and photometric observations, we demonstrate that the location of <b>ellipticals</b> on the FP and its tilt are in fact driven by dissipation.

Calibrated with Galactic globular cluster data and spectrophotometric population models, the colors indicated that dwarf <b>ellipticals</b> have a mean [Fe/H] of - 1. 00 +/- 0. 28 ranging from - 1. 6 to - 0. 4. The {{mean age of}} dwarf <b>ellipticals,</b> also determined photometrically, is estimated at 10 +/- 1 Gyrs compared to 13 Gyrs for bright Fornax <b>ellipticals.</b> Comparison of our metallicity color and Mg_ 2 indices demonstrates that the [Mg/Fe] ratio is lower in dwarf <b>ellipticals</b> than their more massive cousins, {{which is consistent with}} a longer duration of initial star formation to explain their younger ages. There is a increase in dwarf metallicity with distance from the Fornax cluster center where core galaxies are, on average, 0. 5 dex more metal-poor than halo dwarfs. In addition, we find the halo dwarfs are younger in mean age compared to core dwarfs. One possible explanation is that the intracluster medium ram pressure strips the gas from dwarf <b>ellipticals</b> halting star formation (old age) and stopping enrichment (low metallicity) as they enter the core.

40|$|We develop {{observational}} {{tests of}} the idea that dissipation in gas-rich mergers produces the fundamental plane (FP) and related correlations obeyed by <b>ellipticals.</b> The FP 'tilt' implies lower-mass <b>ellipticals</b> have a higher ratio of stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. Models argue that mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield larger mass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar R_e and higher M_stellar/M_tot within that R_e. Such starbursts leave a characteristic imprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outer profile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. In previous work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observed profiles of <b>ellipticals</b> and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in the original spheroid-forming merger(s). Applying this to a large sample of observed <b>ellipticals,</b> we test whether or not their location on the FP and its tilt are driven by dissipation. At fixed mass, <b>ellipticals</b> formed in more dissipational events are smaller and have higher M_stellar/M_tot. At fixed degree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the FP. We show that the dynamical mass estimator R_e*sigma^ 2 /G is a good estimator of the true mass: the observed FP tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. Removing the effects of dissipation, observed <b>ellipticals</b> obey the same FP correlations as disks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical <b>ellipticals.</b> Dissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the FP tilt.

40|$|We {{present a}} two-pronged {{approach}} {{to the formation of}} early-type galaxies, using a sample of 18 galaxies at 0. 5 < ∼ z < ∼ 1 from the HST/ACS Ultra Deep Field and GRAPES surveys: 1) We combine slitless low resolution spectroscopy from the GRAPES dataset with simple models of galaxy formation to explore their star formation histories. 2) We also perform an analysis of their surface brightness distribution with the unprecedented details provided by the ACS superb angular resolution and photometric depth. Our spectroscopic analysis reveals that their stellar populations are rather homogeneous in age and metallicity and formed at redshifts zF ∼ 2 − 5. Evolving them passively, they become practically indistinguishable from <b>ellipticals</b> at z = 0. Also, their isophotal shapes appear very similar to those observed for nearby <b>ellipticals,</b> in that the percentages of disky and boxy galaxies at z ∼ 1 are close to the values measured at z = 0. Moreover, we find that the isophotal structure of z ∼ 1 early-type galaxies obeys the correlations already observed among nearby <b>ellipticals,</b> i. e. disky <b>ellipticals</b> have generally higher characteristic ellipticities, and boxy <b>ellipticals</b> have larger half-light radii and are brighter in the rest-frame B band.

40|$|We {{study the}} number and {{interaction}} rates of supermassive black holes in galactic bulges as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation in which the spheroidal components of galaxies are formed by mergers. In bright <b>ellipticals,</b> the number of events that can eject a central supermassive binary black hole is large. Central binaries must therefore merge {{in less than a}} Hubble time - otherwise there will be too much scatter in the M - relation and too many off-centre galactic nuclei. We propose that binary black holes are able to merge during the major gas accretion events that trigger QSO activity in galaxies. If this is the case, less than 10 per cent of faint <b>ellipticals</b> and 40 per cent of bright <b>ellipticals</b> are predicted to harbour binary black holes with near equal masses at their centres. This binary may be ejected away from the centre of the galaxy or even into intergalactic space in up to 20 per cent of the most luminous <b>ellipticals.</b> The number of low-mass black holes that can interact with the central object is predicted to be a strong function of galaxy luminosity. In most faint <b>ellipticals,</b> no black holes fall into the centre of the galaxy after the last major gas accretion event, but in the most luminous <b>ellipticals,</b> an average of 10 low-mass black holes interact with the central supermassive object after this time.

Minus spheroidals, <b>ellipticals</b> come in two varieties: giant, non-rotating, boxy galaxies with cuspy cores and smaller, rotating, disky galaxies that lack cores. We find a new feature of this "E-E dichotomy": Coreless <b>ellipticals</b> have extra light at the center with respect to an inward extrapolation of the outer Sersic profile. We suggest that extra light is made in starbursts that swamp core scouring in wet mergers. In general, only giant, core <b>ellipticals</b> contain X-ray gas halos. We suggest that they formed in mergers that were kept dry by X-ray gas heated by active galactic nuclei.
