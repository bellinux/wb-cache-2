One example is the agreement between Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors that started in 1971, where Chrysler imported Mitsubishi-manufactured vehicles into the United States to fill a void in their compact lineup with vehicles such as the Dodge Colt.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to analyse the {{response}} to the introduction of sanctions limitations with regard to the Russian economy. As the subject of the study were selected import mechanisms, structure and approaches to the implementation of which turned out to be significantly different in relation to the sectors of the Russian economy. Introduction US, EU and its allies of sanctions limitations with regard to the Russian economy was, in fact, tantamount to the top of these national policies aimed at the economic strangulation of Russia. It should be noted that most of these restrictions have been introduced, bypassing most of the activities of international organisations, and contrary to all norms of international law. The methodology of the study was to justify the illegality of the introduction of sanctions restrictions, assessing their impact on the development of the Russian economy on the basis of statistics of a number of specialized publications, organizations, ministries and departments, as well as the development of measures and mechanisms for their implementation, aimed at protecting the Russian economy from the negative effects sector and financial sanctions restrictions. The effectiveness of mechanisms for import substitution in practice has shown that the reorientation of domestic production in the replacement of imported components and equipment can be carried out in a fairly short period of time, and its results can significantly reduce the technological dependence of the majority of sectors of the Russian economy from the procurement of imported parts and equipment. So, in a number of key sectors of the Russian economy managed with the help of state support to pass quickly enough from the purchase of imported parts and equipment for the production of their domestic counterparts, technological characteristics and quality indicators are not inferior to foreign models. The leading role in achieving these results was the timely development and implementation of the <b>import</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the framework of sectoral strategies and development programs...|$|E
25|$|Commercial bonsai growers may {{use any of}} {{the other}} means of obtaining starter bonsai material, from seed {{propagation}} to collecting expeditions, but they generally sell mature specimens that display bonsai aesthetic qualities already. The grower trains the source specimens {{to a greater or lesser}} extent before sale, and the trees may be ready for display as soon as they are bought. Those who purchase commercially grown bonsai face some challenges, however, particularly of buying from another country. If the purchaser's local climate does not closely match the climate in which the bonsai was created, the plant will have difficulties surviving and thriving. As well, importing living plant material from a foreign source is often closely controlled by import regulations and may require a license or other special <b>import</b> <b>arrangement</b> on the buyer's part.

40|$|According to this USDA report, in 2002 / 03 EU sugar {{production}} rose 15 % to 18. 66 million tonnes. Indications {{are that}} the area under sugar has been reduced by 6. 5 % {{in response to a}} cut in sugar quotas in 2002 / 2003 and higher carry-over of stocks. Production in 2003 / 04 is projected to be 17. 4 million tonnes (raw sugar equivalent) under normal growing conditions. In October 2002 in response to WTO limits on EU sugar export subsidies and weak prices during most of 2002 the European Commission reduced sugar quotas by 7 % for the 2002 / 03 season. This cut of roughly 900, 000 tonnes came well after the 2002 / 03 crop had been sown, and so had no impact on overall production, but rather increased the level of 'C' sugar production. With this largely carried over to the following year, reduced planting for 2003 / 04 resulted. In 2001 / 02 EU imports of sugar increased to 2. 087 million tonnes raw sugar equivalent, with Serbia and Montenegro entering as the fifth largest source of imports. The opening up of the EU market to duty-free access from the western Balkans accounts for the increase in imports as the high-priced EU market sucks in imports. This however is mainly in the form of refined sugar. In outlining the EU's <b>import</b> <b>arrangements</b> the USDA analysis quotes an ISO (International Sugar Organisation) study which, under conservative assumptions, projects imports of 1 million tons of raw sugar equivalent by 2009 from least developed countries, with this rising to 2. 9 million tonnes if expensive infrastructure investments occurred in these countries. The analysis reviews the basis for the extension of the EU sugar regime to new member states and the likely implications of such a move, most notably an expected increase in the EU's structural surplus of sugar. It notes that enlargement is increasing the pressure for an early reform of the sugar regime, since it will be much harder to reach a consensus on reform amongst 25 governments than amongst 15. However it is noted that budget limits will seriously constrain the reform options open to the EU, given {{the extent to which the}} current costs of the sugar regime are borne by EU consumers. Comment: EU 'C' sugar exports (sugar exported without a direct export subsidy) in 2002 / 03 at 3. 256 million tonnes once again exceeded EU sugar exports receiving a direct export subsidy which were 2. 348 million tonnes. In terms of imports from least developed countries it is not clear to what extent ISO projections take into account likely scenarios for reform of the EU sugar regime, for as the report notes least developed countries 'are not the lowest cost producers on the world market' and they may therefore 'find it difficult to compete if EU prices are lowered as a result of sugar reform'. According to this USDA report, in 2002 / 03 EU sugar production rose 15 % to [...] ...|$|E

The template employs quantifiable measures of attributes-trade orientation, financial integration, economic diversification, macroeconomic stabilization, credibility, and "fear-offloating" type effects-that have been identified in the literature as key potential determinants of regime choice. To illustrate, the template is applied to Kazakhstan and Pakistan. The results indicate a fairly strong case against a pegged regime in Pakistan. The implications for Kazakhstan are mixed, although changes in that economy in recent years strengthen the case against a peg.

40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{characteristic}} space model of monopolistic competition with two interdependent markets, this paper analyses {{the effects of}} the bilateral adoption of antidumping measures on the degree of product differentiation, as well as the relationships with the type of product arrangement and the implications for welfare. Under an arrangement where each domestic firm competes directly with two <b>imported</b> products (interleaved <b>arrangement),</b> the model reproduces some of the results that already exist in the literature, where these have been obtained in an oligopolistic context. Through the characterisation of the symmetric zero profit equilibrium, it is shown that under such an arrangement the degree of product variety is higher when governments do not impose bilateral restrictions on prices. By contrast, under an arrangement where each half of the market is made-up of products of the same nationality (split arrangement), the reciprocal imposition of antidumping legislation has no effect on either the degree of product variety or on social welfare. ...|$|R

Although gravity models have been extensively used to measure bilateral trade among countries, they have—to the best of our knowledge—never been used to measure intra-Arab trade. Our results suggest that intra-Arab trade and Arab trade with the rest of the world are lower than what would be predicted by the gravity equation, suggesting considerable scope for regional—as well as multilateral—integration.

THE DEBATE OVER THE CAUSES OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT The economies of western Europe remain afflicted by high and intractable rates of unemployment, with the European Union unemployment rate standing at 8. 3 % as of September 2000, while the unemployment rate in the eleven country euro zone area was 9. 0 %. In stark contrast, the U. S. unemployment rate touched a thirty year low of 3. 9 % in September 2000. This divergence in performance has opened a great debate. One side claims that Europe's unemployment {{is the result of}} rigid sclerotic labor markets that have rendered it incapable of adjusting to technological advance and change in the international economy. Unemployment benefits are too generous and their duration too long, unions are too strong, and employee protections are such that firms are discouraged from hiring workers. This contrasts with the U. S. economy which is marked by flexible dynamic labor markets that have adjusted to these developments and used them to create new jobs. The other side claims that Europe's unemployment problem is significantly attributable to bad macroeconomic policy (Baker and Schmitt 1998; Palley 1998, 1999; Solow 1994), which has resulted from mistaken adherence to the theory of the natural rate of unemployment. This has prompted policy makers to adopt austere macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing inflation, regardless of the unemployment cost or the underlying cause of inflation. Currency market concerns have also played an adverse role. In the 1980 s and 1990 s the persistent threat of currency speculation induced European governments to raise rates so as to defend their currencies and guard against <b>imported</b> inflation. Subsequently, <b>arrangements</b> leading up to the introduction of the Euro aggravated the problem as countries were forced to satisfy strict fiscal convergence criteria that called for policies of austerit...|$|R

As {{a member of}} the CEMAC, Congo''s tariff scheme at least formally is guided by CEMAC''s 1994 trade regime agreement. This paper shows CEMAC''s customs code is restrictive relative to that of comparable regional integration groups. The paper also discusses a number of quantitative and qualitative barriers to trade applied by Congo that render its current regime complex, nontransparent, and relatively unpredictable, compromising efforts to develop the non-oil sector and the country''s export base. Moreover, Congo''s high tariffs and other taxes have not led to higher fiscal revenues, as the number of exemptions granted in recent years has surged and customs administration remains weak.

40|$|Over {{the past}} seven years, the U. S. {{government}} {{has been involved in}} trade negotiations that have led to one bilateral and two multilateral agreements whose provisions have substantive implications for U. S. agricultural trade. The first of these sets of trade negotiations led to the bilateral Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). The second resulted in the current multilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which was implemented on January 1, 1995. The third set of negotiations, initiated under the Bush Administration, led to the multilateral North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was approved by Congress in November 1993 and implemented on January 1, 1994. The three agreements signed by the U. S. since the late 1980 's have been substantively different from most previous agreements because each explicitly addressed trade in agricultural commodities. The result has been that, {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, CFTA, NAFTA, and GATT have altered or will alter the structure and behavior of world and domestic markets for agricultural commodities. These commodities include wheat and barley, sugar, and cattle and beef products; such changes are of importance to many Montana producers. The purpose of this report is to provide a detailed description of the agricultural provisions of NAFTA and the recent GATT agreement for wheat, barley, sugar, and cattle and boxed beef, and to discuss possible implications for producers of these commodities. The report does not investigate the consequences of the CFTA. The report begins by describing the general nature of these types of agreements. Brief histories and descriptions of the provisions of NAFTA and GATT are presented as well as overviews of the general agricultural provisions of the two agreements. The final section contains more detailed discussions of the provisions and implications of the agreements that directly relate to wheat, barley, sugar, and livestock products. The author concludes that for U. S. wheat producers, the consequences of both NAFTA and GATT appear to be favorable. Due to NAFTA, Mexican imports of U. S. wheat are likely to rise moderately. How NAFTA will impact U. S. and Canadian competition for the Mexican wheat market is unclear. The implications of GATT for wheat are also modest but generally favorable. Some countries will reduce tariff rates for wheat over the implementation period and improve import access to domestic markets. These adjustments are likely to encourage slight increases in world demand for wheat exports that will provide modest benefits for U. S. wheat producers. Historically, Mexico has levied high tariffs and implemented quantity restrictions via <b>import</b> licensing <b>arrangements</b> for barley <b>imports</b> from Canada and the U. S. Under NAFTA, Mexico allocated an initial quota of 120, 000 metric tons per year to U. S. barley producers. This duty-free quota will be increased to about 195, 000 metric tons in 2004. Tariffs on over-quota imports will also be removed by 2004. U. S. and Canadian barley producers are likely to benefit from increased Mexican import demand. The implications of GATT for barley are modest but generally favorable. As with wheat, some countries will reduce tariff rates for barley over the implementation period and/or improve import access to domestic markets. These adjustments are also likely to encourage slight increases in world demand for barley exports, thereby benefitting U. S. barley producers. With respect to cattle and beef, under the NAFTA agreement, the U. S. and Mexico have simply exempted each other from their respective import quotas. Prior to NAFTA, Mexico did not impose tariffs on live cattle or beef imports but did levy a small tariff on imports of edible offal. This tariff will be phased out by 2003. The U. S. also abolished modest tariffs on imports of Mexican fresh, chilled, and frozen beef, and imported feed and feeder cattle. Under the GATT agreement, several major beef-producing countries made commitments to reduce trade restrictions and internal supports. The U. S. has agreed to increase access at a low rate of duty and to reduce tariffs on over-quota imports by 15 percent by the year 2000. Some beef-importing countries such as Japan and South Korea have agreed to reduce tariffs and subsidies for domestic producers. The Trade Research Center is sponsoring research to analyze the impact of changes on U. S. beef prices due to GATT and NAFTA. Upcoming publications will discuss that issue. Under NAFTA, trade in sugar and sugar-containing products is subject to extensive provisions. Gradually, over the transition period 1994 - 2009, Mexico's access to the U. S. market will be expanded to a quota of 250, 000 metric tons, if Mexico becomes a net surplus producer. These trade policy adjustments are likely to have minimal effects on the U. S. sugar industry over the first six years of the fifteen-year transition period, but their long-run effects are likely to be much more substantial. The GATT agreement contained only small changes for U. S. sugar policy and is not expected to have much impact on the U. S. sugar market. This special report contains a detailed description of the agricultural provisions of GATT and NAFTA that are of particular interest to producers in the Northern Plains and Rockies. The Center is sponsoring research projects to analyze the economic impacts of these trade agreements on the economy of the region.

40|$|This study {{examines}} external and domestic influences on Latin America’s economic performance {{over the past}} decade and a half. It notes that over the past few years, macroeconomic policies have strengthened and structural reforms have been implemented. Together with a favorable external environment, these policies have contributed to Latin America’s relatively sharp economic recovery from its last recession. The study discusses the priorities for the region’s reform agenda that could help to ensure that this growing prosperity becomes entrenched. It also makes observations on the future roles of the major policymakers involved [...] the governments in the region; the international financial institutions, and especially the IMF; and industrial country governments.
