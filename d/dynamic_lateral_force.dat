40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of new materials and advanced engineering technology, slender footbridges are increasingly becoming popular to satisfy the modern transportation needs and the aesthetical requirements of society. These structures however are always "lively" with low stiffness, low mass, low damping and low natural frequencies. As a consequence, they are prone to vibration induced by human activities and can suffer severe vibration serviceability problems, particularly in the lateral direction. This phenomenon has been evidenced by the excessive lateral vibration of many footbridges worldwide such as the Millennium Bridge in London and the T-Bridge in Japan. Unfortunately, present bridge design codes worldwide do not provide sufficient guidelines and information to address such vibrations problems and to ensure safety and serviceability {{due to the lack of}} knowledge on the dynamic performance of such slender vibration sensitive bridge structures. A conceptual study has been carried out to comprehensively investigate the dynamic characteristics of slender suspension footbridges under human-induced dynamic loads and a footbridge model in full size with pre-tensioned reverse profiled cables in the vertical and horizontal planes has been proposed for this purpose. A similar physical suspension bridge model was designed and constructed in the laboratory, and experimental testings have been carried out to calibrate the computer simulations. The synchronous excitation induced by walking has been modelled as crowd walking dynamic loads which consist of dynamic vertical force, <b>dynamic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> and static vertical force. The dynamic behaviour under synchronous excitation is simulated by resonant vibration at the pacing rate which coincides with a natural frequency of the footbridge structure. Two structural analysis software packages, Microstran and SAP 2000 have been employed in the extensive numerical analysis. Research results show that the structural stiffness and vibration properties of suspension footbridges with pre-tensioned reverse profiled cables can be adjusted by choosing different structural parameters such as cable sag, cable section and pretensions in the reverse profiled cables. Slender suspension footbridges always have four main kinds of vibration modes: lateral, torsional, vertical and longitudinal modes. The lateral and torsional modes are often combined together and become two kinds of coupled modes: coupled lateral-torsional modes and coupled torsionallateral modes. Such kind of slender footbridges also have different dynamic performance in the lateral and vertical directions, and damping has only a small effect on the lateral vibration but significant effect on the vertical one. The fundamental coupled lateral-torsional mode and vertical mode are easily excited when crowd walking dynamic loads are distributed on full bridge deck. When the crowd walking dynamic loads are distributed eccentrically on half width of the deck, the fundamental coupled torsional-lateral mode can be excited and large lateral deflection can be induced. Higher order vertical modes and coupled lateral-torsional modes can also be excited by groups of walking pedestrians under certain conditions. It is found that the coupling coefficient introduced in this thesis to describe the coupling of a coupled mode, is an important factor which has significant effect on the lateral dynamic performance of slender suspension footbridges. The coupling coefficient, however, is influenced by many structural parameters such as cable configuration, cable section, cable sag, bridge span and pre-tensions, etc. In general, a large dynamic amplification factor is expected when the fundamental mode of a footbridge structure is the coupled lateral-torsional mode with a small coupling coefficient. The research findings of this thesis are useful in understanding the complex dynamic behaviour of slender and vibration sensitive suspension footbridges under humaninduced dynamic loads. They are also helpful in developing design guidance and techniques to improve the dynamic performance of such slender vibration sensitive footbridges and similar structures and hence to ensure their safety and serviceability...|$|E

The recent {{earthquakes}} {{have dramatically}} demonstrated that research in earthquake engineering must {{be directed to}} the assessment and strengthening of existing constructions lacking of appropriate seismic resisting characteristics. The very recent 'European earthquakes' (e. g. Italy- 1997, Turkey - August 1999, Greece - September 1999) confirm and highlight that also Europe may suffer from {{the vulnerability of the}} existing building stock. Data on the real characteristics of buildings that have been subjected to earthquakes are in general difficult to obtain. Hence, the experimental pseudo-dynamic test results on the fullscale RC frame generated an immense amount of records, that were used to corroborate the numerical models. Therefore, the calibrated analytical models can be extensively used in reproducing the real behaviour of existing RC buildings. The experimental tests on full-scale structure models assisted the calibration of  numerical models and sustain in the assessment of proportioning and detailing rules for the different structural sub-assemblages. This complementary numerical and experimental approach emphasise the important role of the research for the mitigation of the seismic risk. In this study, 4 -storey reinforced concrete frame structure is modelled with considering the nonlinear behaviour which is done pseudo-dynamic test. This full-scale RC frame representative of the building's design and construction practice until the late 1970 's in most of south European countries, and currently needing seismic retrofit, were constructed and tested pseudo-dynamically, at the ELSA laboratory (European Laboratory for Structural Assessment). The test frame had been designed without specifically considering seismic action (non-seismic resistant constructions).   This experimental study aimed at assessing the original capacity of existing structures, with and without infill masonry, and to compare performances of different retrofitting solutions. The tests have shown that the vulnerability of existing reinforced concrete frames designed without specific seismic resisting characteristics, which {{are an important part of}} the existing buildings in Europe, constitute a source of high risk for human life. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that advanced retrofitting methods, solutions and techniques substantially reduce that risk to levels currently considered in modern design. The experimental tests on full-scale structure models assisted the calibration of those numerical models and sustain in the assessment of proportioning and detailing rules for the different structural sub-assemblages. This complementary numerical approach emphasise the important role of the research for the mitigation of the seismic risk. The main objective of the theoretical, experimental and analytical work subject of this thesis is to achieve a numerical methodology, which is experimentally calibrated and able to reproduce rigorously the structural behaviour of existing reinforced concrete frame buildings. The evaluation of the available refined models in analysing the seismic performance of existing buildings, proposing improvements to reach a reliable numerical methodology to predict their seismic response. Initial calculations were performed based on the available refined models commonly used to model the new structures. Due to the unsatisfactory results, parametric analyses were performed, and confirmed with the experimental full-scale test results to identify the discrepancies. The detailed parametric analyses reveal inadequacies of the current models when applied to the existing structures. This effort led to fine-tuning of the model parameters' (as plastic hinge length, effective stiffness, concrete mechanical properties, viscous damping etc.), as well as to the inclusion of the inadequate longitudinal and transversal reinforcement detailing in beams, columns and joints, widespread use of smooth reinforcing steel, lack of concrete confinement, and, inadequate lap-splice length, transverse reinforcement in columns limited to perimeter hoops with 90 o hooks, which are insufficient. Various analysis methods, either linear elastic or non-linear, static or dynamic, are available for the performance analysis of existing reinforced concrete buildings. Elastic analysis methods include code static lateral force procedures, code <b>dynamic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> procedures and elastic procedures using demand capacity ratios. At the present time, linear elastic analysis remains the instrument of the design profession, for the calculation of forces and stresses, as well as for the proportioning of structural members.   Nevertheless, linear elastic analysis inability to reflect the real behaviour of structures under abnormal or ultimate loading conditions has been pointed out. This follows because almost all structures behave in some non-linear manner prior to reaching their limit of resistance. A more realistic evaluation of the strength of structures against the failure conditions, or the factor of safety, can only be achieved by analyses that take into account various non-linear effects. The non-linear time history analysis method, with recorded or simulated ground motion records, provides the most accurate means for predicting seismic demands. This inelastic dynamic method is widely used to model specimens tested in laboratory and real structures with a reduced number of elements. Despite its advantages, it must be admitted that non-linear time history analysis can frequently become overly complex and impractical for general use as a first assessment. An alternative is to use simplified nonlinear static analysis methods.   The improved models were found capable to analyse existing reinforced concrete structures, reproducing accurately their non-linear response. This numerical models are calibrated against experimental PsD test results on RC full-scale structures. The tests on full-scale models of existing structures constitute an exceptional opportunity for improvement of knowledge on behaviour and capacity of RC structures designed and constructed in Europe until the late 1970 's. The numerical analyses performed in this thesis are based in a non-linear plastic hinge model, and take into account the material non-linearity according to the specific materials properties. The influence of physical phenomena and model parameters in the structural response was thoroughly understood due to the integrated numerical and experimental research approach. In the numerical study, it was proposed a simplified model to account for the slippage of the reinforcement in existing RC structures.

As a result, the structure becomes more vulnerable to <b>dynamic</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>forces,</b> especially, those due to hydrodynamic effects. In addition, for estimation of seismic response, a fixed base assumption for stiff structures such as an aqueduct, may often lead to an inappropriate design if the soil underneath is not so stiff.

This is because the nonlinear SSI can take into account the energy dissipation behavior and nonlinear variation of stiffness along the soil-foundation interface.|$|R
40|$|A cable {{supported}} footbridge {{model with}} pre-tensioned cables in {{vertical and horizontal}} planes is proposed to investigate the vibration characteristics of shallow suspension footbridges under walking dynamic loads in this conceptual study. In this bridge model, the tension force in the supporting cables can be adjusted by introducing pre-tensions to the reverse profiled cables, and therefore the natural frequencies can be altered and cover the frequency range of dynamic force induced by pedestrians. In the numerical analysis, SAP 2000 is adopted to study the vibration properties and dynamic response under walking loads. The dynamic behaviour of the bridge under structure synchronous excitation is stimulated by resonant vibration. The crowd walking loads are modelled as uniform loads acting on the whole bridge deck and they consist of three parts: vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>force,</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>force</b> and vertical static force.

40|$|The {{stability}} of wagons {{is an important}} issue in railway industry especially in heavy haul networks. The stability largely depends on a number of factors such as loading conditions and wind conditions aerodynamic forces caused by crosswind, centrifugal force, and dynamic forces due to track parameters and characteristics. The different methodologies for study of wagon dynamics under different wind conditions and load factors as well as their implementation,are part of rolling stock standards. However these methodologies do not completely cover all issues for this field of research. This study presents new results for overturning due to cross winds and takes into account important factors such as real lateral track defects and estimated <b>lateral</b> coupler <b>forces</b> obtained from longitudinal train dynamics simulation for worst case scenarios. For this study, a combination of two simulation packages, CRE-LTS and Gensys multibody software, has been used. The analysis method is to complete a longitudinal train simulation with lateral defects and different wind loading parameters to obtain <b>lateral</b> coupler <b>force</b> data required for further vehicle <b>dynamic</b> analysis. The <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> are applied to a full multibody model to study the resulting wheel unloading and lateral to vertical wheel force ratio in order to determine compliance withthese parameters based on the existing standards. Therefore, in this paper, dynamic wagon behaviours are studied with the combined effectsof wind, <b>lateral</b> coupler <b>forces,</b> curving and <b>lateral</b> defectson a multibody vehicle model using computer simulation. The assessment methods are based on the estimation of the vehicle wheel unloading. The dynamic behaviour study combining these four factors will create opportunity in the new area of research...|$|R

The control law is designed using the differential flatness property of nonlinear longitudinal and lateral vehicle model. An algebraic estimation approach is employed to estimate simultaneously the vehicle <b>dynamic</b> parameters (like <b>lateral</b> <b>forces</b> and roll angle) and unknown inputs (like road bank angle and corrective yaw moment). The control and estimation approaches use also the algebraic estimators to perform the filtering and the numerical derivatives of noisy measurements. To perform some coupled vehicle tasks like an automatic line keeping of straight or curved lines, a line change maneuver, obstacle avoidance, a combined control of longitudinal and lateral vehicle motions is required. Note that this controller is designed via steering angle and traction/braking torque of vehicle. Furthermore, some other parameters like road bank angle has an important influence on vehicle lateral dynamics behavior and control vehicle systems. For this, the algebraic based unknown input estimator is considered here to estimate road bank angle and consider a more realistic trajectories.

40|$|The {{current study}} builds on a {{previous}} {{study conducted by the}} authors that investigated the seismic provisions of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) 2005 and 2010, pertaining to the loading and analysis of irregular L-shaped buildings. The study uses low-rise and high-rise L-shaped buildings as case studies. Three-dimensional finite element models of the two irregular L-shaped buildings were developed and discussed in the previous study. The lateral resisting system of the low-rise buildings consists of concrete shear walls, while the high-rise building consists of a combination of concrete shear walls and concrete rigid frames. Low and high-rise concrete buildings are modelled with the assumption of fully rigid floor diaphragms for computational efficiency. In the current the study, the effect of using rigid and semi-rigid diaphragms to simulate structural floors on the structure response to lateral loads is investigated. Significant change in the <b>dynamic</b> response and <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> distribution along both buildings’ height due to the use of semi-rigid diaphragms is noticed. In addition, a negligible contribution due to the effective inertia, due to cracking of concrete shear walls on the overall dynamic response of both buildings is observed.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} study was undertaken to comprehensively investigate the dynamic characteristics of slender suspension footbridges with shallow cable profiles under human-induced dynamic loads. This paper concerns their vibration under eccentrically distributed walking dynamic loads. A suspension footbridge model with reverse profiled cables in {{vertical and horizontal}} planes is proposed for this study, and three types of bridge models are considered in the numerical analysis to {{study the effects of}} cable configuration and reverse profiled cables. It is found that these slender footbridge structures exhibit coupled vibration modes such as coupled lateral-torsional or coupled torsional-lateral modes in addition to vertical ones. Research results show that large amplitude lateral vibration is mainly caused by the resonant vibration in coupled modes. When the first coupled lateral-torsional mode is excited, the large amplitude lateral vibration is induced by the <b>lateral</b> <b>dynamic</b> force; while when the first coupled torsional-lateral mode is excited, the excessive lateral vibration is mainly caused by the vertical dynamic force and enhanced by the <b>lateral</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>force.</b> It is also found that when vertical vibration mode is excited, the dynamic effect of eccentric dynamic vertical force has only slight effect on lateral vibration.

The efficacy of the assessed magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler may be adapted to the various clinical needs by adjusting the <b>lateral</b> <b>force,</b> tip angulation, and power setting. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Highly {{oriented}} pyrolytic graphite and boronated pyrolytic graphite were imaged in air by simultaneous {{normal and}} <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> microscopy. A number of effects occurred when scanning over steps, including {{an increase in}} attractive forces from surface contamination which could be detrimental to the imaging of soft or weakly bonded samples. Contamination may also give rise to regions of high <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> which {{do not seem to}} be associated with any topographic features. Finally, in atomic resolution images of graphite, atomic corrugation was clearer in the lateral cantilever deflection images than in the simultaneous topography and normal cantilever deflection images, demonstrating the high sensitivity of <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> detection to topographic features...|$|R

50|$|As the {{axial load}} on a {{perfectly}} straight slender column with elastic material properties is increased in magnitude, this ideal column passes through three states: stable equilibrium, neutral equilibrium, and instability. The straight column under load is in stable equilibrium if a <b>lateral</b> <b>force,</b> applied {{between the two}} ends of the column, produces a small lateral deflection which disappears and the column returns to its straight form when the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is removed. If the column load is gradually increased, a condition is reached in which the straight form of equilibrium becomes so-called neutral equilibrium, and a small <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> will produce a deflection that does not disappear and the column remains in this slightly bent form when the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is removed. The load at which neutral equilibrium of a column is reached is called the critical or buckling load. The state of instability is reached when a slight increase of the column load causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Japan {{where large}} {{earthquakes}} frequently occur, {{it is important}} to increase the resistibility of railway structures to earthquakes. The authors performed a shaking table test using a full-scale model to evaluate the <b>lateral</b> resistance <b>force</b> of the ballasted track during earthquakes. In this study, the shaking table test was attempted under test conditions under which the sleeper is given the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> to induce track buckling. Two kinds of cross sections of ballasted track for the full-scale model were applied: a straight track and a curved track to evaluate the influence of the difference of the cross section of ballasted track on the <b>lateral</b> resistance <b>force.</b> The results of the shaking table test clarified that the <b>lateral</b> resistance <b>force</b> of the ballasted track decreased during shaking, and the lateral sleeper displacement increased significantly by <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> smaller than the <b>lateral</b> resistance <b>force</b> of the ballasted track after shaking. In addition, it is considered that the influence of the cross section of ballasted track on the <b>lateral</b> ballast resistance <b>force</b> during shaking and after shaking is small...|$|R
40|$|During curve {{driving a}} <b>lateral</b> <b>force,</b> coupled to the off-center yaw rotation, is {{acting on the}} driver. In simulation, however, the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is often not {{generated}} using off-centric rotation, thereby uncoupling translational and rotational motion cues. This may cause misalignment of the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> w. r. t. the motion direction along the curve. In the present study we investigated how sensitive humans are to such misalignment. We performed a psychophysical study where participants were repeatedly moved along circular trajectories. The participants’ physical orientation {{with respect to the}} motion path was systematically varied, and the participants’ task was to indicate whether they felt facing to the inside or the outside of the curve, in a two-alternative forced choice. The experiment was performed in darkness and with a congruent visual motion stimulus. Heading JND, i. e. the smallest detectable difference in yaw orientation w. r. t. the direction of motion, was measured. The results show a considerably lower sensitivity to the misalignment of the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> than what is commonly found for heading sensitivity along straight paths, with better performance when congruent visual information was presented. This indicates that for simulated curve driving some misalignment of the <b>lateral</b> <b>force</b> is acceptable, without affecting perceptual realism...|$|R
