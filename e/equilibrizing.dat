40|$|For {{heavy haul}} trains, it is {{difficult}} to get global information due to the limited range of communication. This paper proposed a novel distributed optimal control based on game strategy, in which the global optimization is achieved by <b>equilibrizing</b> subsystemsâ€™ performance just utilizing local information. To online solve the game control, an efficient multivariable extremum seeking algorithm was adapted to approximate the partial differential equation deduced by optimal condition. The convergence of the proposed approximate algorithm is proved by constructing a fictitious Lie bracket system using Lyapunov function. Finally, the proposed distributed optimal control is valuated rigorously by case study according to the configuration of Daqin railway in China...|$|E
40|$|Microscopic {{calculations}} of intermediate energy heavy ion collision are performed employing the Boltzmann Uehling Uhlenbeck (BUU) formalism. We see that at beam energies around the Fermi energy {{the system does}} not <b>equilibrize</b> although the spectra show an exponential form. Preequilibrium particles are preferably emitted to the opposite site of the impact parameter {{as suggested by the}} Fermi jet model. We discuss furthermore the linear momentum transfer, the nuclear mean free path and the formation of a third cluster at midrapidity which reflects nicely the importance of both - two body collisions and mean field - at these beam energies...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermodynamical properties of nuclear matter in heavy ion collisions, {{in particular with}} respect to questions of thermodynamical instability, phase transitions and fragmentation. For this we analyze results of relativistic transport calculations of Au+Au collisons at intermediate energies, separately for spectator and participant matter. On one hand, we determine local thermodynamical variables from {{the analysis of the}} local momentum distribution; on the other, we analyze fragment energy spectra in a blast model scenario. We find that the spectator represents an instable, <b>equilibrized</b> fragmenting source, while in the participant no such common source can be identified. Our results compare well with experimental determinations of temperatures and flow velocities.

40|$|The sol-gel {{technique}} {{is a unique}} method for tailoring ceramic powders if the different reaction parameters can be controlled {{with respect to the}} powder properties. Reaction control can be achieved by control of hydrolysis and condensation, solvent, temperature, catalyst, additives and complex formers. Especially the use of complex formers have proved to be a successful mean with respect to the control of the gel structure, the generation of monosized particles and even the control of particle size and distribution. Another mean for controlling rates is the homogeneous generation of water for condensation within a reacting system by a chemical reaction; e. g. by ester formation. Thus, differences in reaction rates in multicomponent systems can be <b>equilibrized.</b> New synthesis routes, the characterization and the sintering behavior of Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2, mullite, cordierite, and BaTiO 3 powders are described, especially with respect to the influencing chemical parameters, and the results are discu ssed. With Al 2 O 3, complex formers lead to super amorphous powders which do not undergo crystallization. No boehmite or bayerite phases have been observed. In the case of mullite or cordierite acetyl acetonate or acetic acid ester complexed alumina leads to a better crystallization behavior of the powders. The results show, that proper use of chemistry allows a wide variation of powder properties. (ISC...|$|R
40|$|The migratory {{phenomenon}} {{is a process}} unchaining unprecedented forces {{in the formation of}} the Mexican urban structure. To master these forces and convert them into a tool that will properly shape the nation, it is necessary to assess a directing concept. This thesis is a search for a feasible concept. Migration is in depth a blind search for urban conditions. Today, these conditions must be proliferated to an enlarging number of settlements. The quality of the city must be given to the town. The search is conducted through three processes: I. A time-past -Tributary process or analytical approach II. A time-less Directing process or theoretical approach III. A time-future Formative process or design approach. The forces at work are the time present; the relationship between the past with the future. As a response from these processes, a basic proposition is made: The gradual change toward an urban condition can be achieved by function- ally linking series of existing towns. This linkage pattern is here referred to as SIorganic solidarity". In this concept of organic solidarity, each town requires the other in order to perform its major function's. The resultant urban unit is as the concept of a molecule in physics: the smallest structural unit made of several different parts necessary to each other to remain balanced and at the same time coexisting as an integral part of a major whole; this whole is <b>equilibrized</b> by the balance of every one of its molecules. The existence of this urban uriit is transitory. The concept is a process of urban formation, not a form. The purpose of the demonstration design is to represent the concept in an urban form as a synthesis of proposals and ideas. The resultant image is only one interpretation. There can be others...|$|R
