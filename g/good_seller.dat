40|$|We {{consider}} a market where privately informed sellers resort to certification to overcome adverse selection. There is {{uncertainty about the}} certifier's ability to generate accurate information. The profit of a monopolistic certifier is an inverted U-shaped function of his reputation for accuracy: being perceived as more precise allows to attract more <b>good</b> <b>sellers</b> but a high expected precision also deters bad sellers. Since the certifier tries to reach a balanced reputation to attract both types, reputation has a disciplining effect when the certifier is perceived as insufficiently accurate, but gives incentives to decrease precision when he is perceived as “too" accurate. The impact of competition depends on whether sellers “multihome" or “singlehome". Under singlehoming, certifiers compete to attract <b>good</b> <b>sellers,</b> which makes higher reputation more valuable. Multihoming makes higher reputations less desirable because the competitor exerts a negative externality by providing extra information. Therefore, singlehoming attenuates bad reputation effects, while multihoming exacerbates inefficiencies. ...|$|R

40|$|Positive {{externalities}} {{characterize the}} consumption of a majority class of information goods and services such as software, e-mail, and online content and services including virtual communities. We show that network externality is critical for the market segmentation and product line decisions of an information <b>goods</b> <b>seller.</b> With externality, a monopoly of multiple existing products offers exactly two distinct qualities. When development costs are taken into account, the low quality is developed only if the gain in revenue due to an enlarged network exceeds the extra development costs. In particular, if developed, the low quality should be offered for free under very general conditions. Network externality itself thus can explain the market provision of free information <b>goods</b> by proprietary <b>sellers</b> from a product line design perspective...|$|R
40|$|Our work {{investigates the}} effects of {{knowledge}} sharing among buyer agents in an electronic market, where the shared knowledge is the reputation of seller agents. Each buyer agent independently models a seller after having purchased <b>goods</b> from the <b>seller</b> and, upon request, shares this knowledge with friends. We investigated if having {{a larger number of}} friends enables buyers to find good quality low priced sellers in the market more rapidly and also if there is a point of diminishing returns, beyond which increasing the number of friends will not have any positive effects. Our results show that, by sharing information with friends, the buyers are able to identify <b>good</b> <b>sellers</b> earlier. However the marginal gain of having more friends decreases as the number of friends increases. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{solve for}} the optimal {{mechanism}} for selling two goods when the buyer’s demand characteristics are unobservable. In {{the case of}} substitutable <b>goods,</b> the <b>seller</b> has an incentive to offer lotteries over goods in order to charge the buyers with large differences in the valuations a higher price for obtaining their desired good with certainty. However, the seller also has a countervailing incentive to make the allocation of the goods among the participating buyers more efficient {{in order to increase}} the overall demand. In the case when the buyer can consume both <b>goods,</b> the <b>seller</b> has an incentive to underprovide one of the goods in order to charge the buyers with large valuations a higher price for the bundle of both goods. As in the case of substitutable <b>goods,</b> the <b>seller</b> also has a countervailing incentive to lower the price of the bundle in order to increase the overall demand. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{markets for}} {{credence}} <b>goods</b> <b>sellers</b> are better informed than their customers {{about the quality}} that yields the highest surplus from trade. This paper studies second-degree price-discrimination in such markets. It shows that discrimination regards the amount of advice offered to customers and that it leads to a different distortion depending on {{the main source of}} heterogeneity among consumers. If the heterogeneity is mainly in the expected cost of efficient service, the distortion involves overprovision of quality. By contrast, if consumers differ mainly in the surplus generated whenever the consumer’s needs are met, the inefficiency involves underprovision of quality...|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{publishers}} {{are not likely}} to be interested in the Principia due, at least, to the counter copyright on it-for, if they had a <b>good</b> <b>seller,</b> then other publishers could print it out from under them. Consequently publication and distribution will have to occur spontaneously, thru the “underground”, as alternative cultures learn to meet their own needs and provide their own services. This non-commercial limitation of the Principia is to provide less limitations in other respects, and it is not an accident. The Principia is not simply a handbook, it is a demonstration.|$|E

40|$|We {{document}} {{basic facts}} about prices in online {{markets in the}} United States and Canada, which is a rapidly growing segment of the retail sector. Relative to prices in regular stores, prices in online markets are more flexible and exhibit stronger pass-through (60 - 75 percent) and faster convergence (half-life less than two months) in response to movements of the nominal exchange rate. Multiple margins of adjustment are active {{in the process of}} responding to nominal exchange rate shocks. Properties of <b>goods,</b> <b>sellers,</b> and markets are systematically related to pass-through and the speed of price adjustment for international price differentials. ...|$|R
40|$|Suppose that n buyers each {{want one}} unit and m sellers each {{have one or}} more units of a <b>good.</b> <b>Sellers</b> post prices, and then buyers choose sellers. In {{symmetric}} equilibrium, similar sellers all post one price, and buyers randomize. Hence, more or fewer buyers may arrive than a seller can accommodate. We call this frictions. We solve for prices and the endogenous matching function for finite n and m and consider the limit as n and m grow. The matching function displays decreasing returns but converges to constant returns. We argue that the standard matching function in the literature is misspecified and discuss implications for the Beveridge curve. ...|$|R
