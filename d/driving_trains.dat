In a single sided version the magnetic repulsion forces the conductor away from the stator, levitating it, and carrying it along in the direction of the moving magnetic field. He called the later versions of it magnetic river.|$|E
50|$|Five {{people were}} killed and {{thirteen}} were injured. The guard of the northbound train, Jonathan Brett-Andrews, had ambitions to become a driver and was in the driver's cab {{at the time of the}} collision; this was in defiance of the regulations. It is thought that his presence may have contributed to the accident and there were even suspicions that he might have been at the controls; he had been reprimanded twice before for <b>driving</b> <b>trains</b> when he should not have. However, this will never be known as he and both drivers were killed in the collision and the front ends of both trains were so badly damaged that it was not possible to ascertain the exact positions of the crew in the northbound train at the point of impact. Two passengers, a couple travelling in the leading coach of the northbound train, were also killed.|$|E
5000|$|ACP (alarm chain pulling) also {{causes a}} small lever to be {{released}} near the emergency brake valve (usually mounted near {{one end of the}} coach), which does not retract to its normal position even when the chain is released. This allows the driver (or guard) to find out in which coach the ACP actually occurred. When the coach is isolated, the lever needs to be manually reset. Until this is done, the lamp and buzzer in the locomotive cab are continuously activated. A circuit breaker controls the lamp and alarm bell in the locomotive cab; in cases where defective equipment causes the lamp and bell to go off, the driver can disable them by placing the MCB (miniature circuit breaker) in the [...] "Off" [...] position. Despite the obvious safety hazards, sometimes this is resorted to by drivers when <b>driving</b> <b>trains</b> through sections where spurious ACP incidents are very common.|$|E
40|$|The Dutch Council for Traffic Safety {{commissioned}} SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research {{to carry}} out a study. The aim is to investigate the transferability of the French accompanied <b>driving</b> <b>training</b> system to the Netherlands. This system allows persons aged 16 and over to start their driver training. During the driver training following on the instructor's driving lessons, at least 3000 kilometers will be driven accompanied by an experienced driver. The French accompanied <b>driving</b> <b>training</b> seems to be a promising system to considerably decrease the accident risk of young recently qualified drivers. An accompanied driving system {{as a part of the}} driver training is considered to have a sufficient safety potential to further study a Dutch application. Based on the French experiences, however, it is not possible to get a sufficient picture of the functioning of the accompanied <b>driving</b> <b>training</b> system in the Netherlands. A further study should be aimed at: (i) evaluating the safety effects of the system by means of a limited well controllable pilot study; (2) analysing the target group; and (3) analysing which organisational adjustments are necessary and possible in order to implement the system in the Netherlands...|$|R

5000|$|Karen Harrison {{became a}} mature {{student at the}} University of Oxford (Harris Manchester College), where she was an {{undergraduate}} studying for a degree in law. She once described {{the effects of this}} mid-life transition, explaining, [...] "I find studying hard, f***ing hard. But it's easier than <b>driving</b> <b>trains</b> for a living. It's hard to get too stressed about exams when you've experienced things like brake failure approaching a red signal, especially when you can see another train crossing the junction in front of you. I still miss the camaraderie of my mates in ASLEF. I miss them terribly. The folk at my college are the closest I've got to that old espirit de corps and they put up with an old bag like me with great stoicism." [...] After graduation, Harrison had plans to work as a barrister specialising in labour law and human rights.|$|E
30|$|There is {{a driver}} in the cabin, who is {{responsible}} for <b>driving</b> <b>trains</b> based on wayside or cabin signal, opening and closing door, observing the guideway, and stopping trains in case of emergency. In addition, automatic train protection (ATP) system prevents unsafe movements of trains in respect of the signals and the train speed.|$|E
30|$|Data {{validity}} {{was assessed}} by a reference group of subject-matter experts. This approach has already been used in studies involving train driver data [37, 38]. A panel of five train driving instructors with a minimum experience of ten years in <b>driving</b> <b>trains</b> reviewed the coding, category development, and thematic analysis of the data. Experience gained throughout ten years of practice conferred on them the status of experts in this field [42]. They cross-checked the data analysis in multiple rounds to ensure consistency in the process.|$|E
30|$|The pilot testing {{proved that}} the experience-based first-aid {{training}} focused on knowledge and skills {{as well as the}} psychological set-up is an effective part of a driver’s education.

40|$|The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) {{will have}} an impact on the <b>train</b> <b>driving</b> task and <b>train</b> driver behaviour. This paper {{presents}} part of the final study of series of studies that have been conducted as part of a three-year research project, which investigated the effects of ERTMS on train drivers’ behaviours. In recent times, a number of models of <b>train</b> <b>driving</b> have been developed in order to inform <b>train</b> <b>driving</b> technology design and understand the implications of the design of the <b>train</b> <b>driving</b> task on driver performance and behaviour. An expert knowledge elicitation study was conducted to evaluate existing <b>train</b> <b>driving</b> models and to generate human factors guidance on future ERTMS <b>train</b> <b>driving</b> models. The study consisted of a workshop which was conducted using rail Human Factors (HF) experts who have been directly involved with projects examining ERTMS. Current <b>train</b> <b>driving</b> models were evaluated and ideas generated about how these should be shaped in the future to include systems such as ERTMS. The findings of the study contributed to bridging the gap between the theoretical understanding of train drivers’ cognitive strategies and practical implementation of novel technologies by the rail industry...|$|R
