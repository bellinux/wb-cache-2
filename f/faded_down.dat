25|$|Mays hit his 600th {{home run}} off San Diego's Mike Corkins in September 1969. Plagued by {{injuries}} that season, he managed only 13 home runs. Mays enjoyed a resurgence in 1970, hitting 28 homers, and {{got off to}} a fast start in 1971, the year he turned 40. He had 15 home runs at the All-Star break but <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch and finished with 18. Mays helped the Giants win the division title that year, but they lost the NLCS to the Pittsburgh Pirates.|$|E
25|$|The 2012 Los Angeles Dodgers {{season was}} the 123rd for the {{franchise}} in Major League Baseball, and their 55th season in Los Angeles. The Dodgers celebrated the Golden Anniversary of Dodger Stadium, their home since 1962. It was a transitional {{year as the}} sale of the team from Frank McCourt to Guggenheim Baseball Management was not finalized until May 1. The new ownership group put their stamp on the team quickly by making a number of big trades and putting more money into the team than McCourt did. After a fast start, the team <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch and finished eight games behind the World Series Champion Giants.|$|E
2500|$|The Expos {{were widely}} {{predicted}} {{to win the}} NL East in Sports Illustrated, Baseball Digest and The Sporting News were among the publications that favoured Montreal. However, the team disappointed. Montreal {{finished third in the}} division with 86 wins. The Expos replaced Fanning with Bill Virdon in , and under their new manager, led the division in mid-July. However, the team <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch and finished with an 82–80 record. The Expos won more games between 1979 and 1983 than any other team in the NL East, but had only one postseason experience to show for it.|$|E

25|$|Mount St. Mary's {{began the}} season on November 14 with a 78–55 loss {{on the road}} against the #2-ranked team in the nation, Arizona. The Mountaineers were within seven points with 11 minutes to play before <b>fading</b> <b>down</b> the stretch.|$|R
2500|$|Tubby Smith's {{first season}} (2013–2014) {{proved to be}} a challenge. The Red Raiders led by Jaye Crockett started the season 8-5 in non conference only to fade during Big 12 play {{finishing}} with a 6-12 conference mark. Although the team <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch, [...] it showed that it could compete with the upper teams in the Big 12 as the Red Raiders won two games against ranked competition and lost many close games. The team finished with a 14-18 record overall and 9th in the 10 team Big 12. This season marked Smith's first losing season as a head coach in his career and proved that the rebuilding job in Lubbock was massive.|$|E

No doubt, his habitual gentleness made his occasional severity more felt, but at Mota his capacity for scolding was held in respect. I was told when I was last there, that I was no good, for I {{did not know how}} to scold, but that the Bishop perfectly well understood how to do it. Words certainly would never fail him in twenty languages to express his indignation, but how seldom among his own scholars had he to do it in one!' ...|$|E

60|$|The opened half-door {{was opened}} a little further, and secured at that angle for the time. A broad {{ray of light}} fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an {{unfinished}} shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, {{though they had been}} really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, {{that it would have been}} hard to say which was which.|$|E
60|$|So he had resolved; {{but things}} had {{arranged}} themselves, {{as they often}} do, rather than been arranged by him. During ten or twelve years no one had heard of Mary Thorne; the memory of Henry Thorne and his tragic death had passed away; the knowledge that an infant had been born whose birth was connected with that tragedy, a knowledge never widely spread, had <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> into utter ignorance. At the end of these twelve years, Dr Thorne had announced, that a young niece, a child of a brother long since dead, was coming to live with him. As he had contemplated, no one spoke to him; but some people did no doubt talk among themselves. Whether or not the exact truth was surmised by any, it matters not to say; with absolute exactness, probably not; with great approach to it, probably yes. By one person, at any rate, no guess whatever was made; no thought relative to Dr Thorne's niece ever troubled him; no idea that Mary Scatcherd had left a child in England ever occurred to him; and that person was Roger Scatcherd, Mary's brother.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Taurasi {{averaged}} 16.0 points, 4.2 {{rebounds and}} 4.5 assists per game while battling an ankle injury. She was an All Star {{for the second}} straight year, but the Mercury <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch and again missed the playoffs.|$|E
50|$|The Reds {{were coming}} off a {{successful}} season in 1898, earning a third-place finish with a 92-60 record. However, they once again <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch, as the team was in {{first place in the}} first week of September before slumping for the remainder of the season.|$|E
50|$|Sweden's Anders Holmertz overtook U.S. swimmer Matt Biondi about {{midway through}} the final stretch, but could not catch Armstrong near the wall to finish with a silver in 1:47.89.

50|$|There are {{dramatic}} {{shots of}} riders climbing mountains, often with breathtaking views, a struggle which Lelouch emphasises by slowly <b>fading</b> <b>down</b> the heartbeat-like music to near silence, stressing each rider's lone and silent battle with himself.

Sparse relevance profiles in hyperspectral data analysis <b>fade</b> <b>down</b> those spectral bands which are not necessary for classification. In particular, we consider the sparsity in the relevance profile enforced by LASSO optimization. The latter one is obtained by a gradient learning scheme using a differentiable parametrized approximation of the $l_{ 1 }$-norm, which has an upper error bound. We extend this regularization idea also to the matrix learning variant of LVQ as the natural generalization of relevance learning...|$|R
