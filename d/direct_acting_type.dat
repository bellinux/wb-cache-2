To determine the contact condition, the normal contact forces are calculated by using the lumped mass dynamic modeling. The line contact is considered between the cam and follower interface. The variations of dynamic stresses are presented {{as a function of}} camshaft rotational angle. Also the effects of various design parameters are investigated. clos...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of oral hepatitis C virus <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals has revolutionized the therapeutic field. Nowadays, multiple safe and highly effective antiviral regimens are commercially available to treat adults with hepatitis C infection. These new regimens {{for the first}} time, genuinely raise the prospects of eradicating hepatitis C virus. However, many challenges remain: from identifying infected individuals to optimizing treatment and ensuring global access to antiviral therapy to all population groups, including children. The only drugs currently approved for children with chronic hepatitis C virus infection are pegylated interferon and ribavirin. There are four registered ongoing pediatric trials assessing safety and efficacy of <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals but their current completion timelines are years away. Herein, we summarize {{the state of the}} art of <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals development for adult and children and highlight the crucial importance of overcoming barriers to treating children with hepatitis C virus...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 120 - 130 million {{individuals}} are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, {{although it is}} curable by therapy. Until recently, treatment of chronic hepatitis C {{was based on the}} combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin. A number of models have been developed to study the HCV lifecycle and screen for potential HCV inhibitors. They {{led to the development of}} antiviral agents that specifically target a viral function (<b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals), and host-targeted agents that inhibit HCV replication. <b>Direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals in clinical development include NS 3 - 4 A protease inhibitors (two of which, telaprevir and boceprevir, have recently been approved for treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in combination with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin), nucleoside/nucleotide analogue and non-nucleoside inhibitors of HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and NS 5 A inhibitors. Host-targeted agents include cyclophilin inhibitors. This article describes the <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals and host-targeted agents that have recently been approved or have been tested in HCV-infected patients and discusses their two current paths of clinical development: with or without interferon-α...|$|R

Recently, the treatment for chronic hepatitis C has been revolutionized with the introduction of interferon-free <b>direct</b> <b>acting</b> antivirals with favorable safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile.
