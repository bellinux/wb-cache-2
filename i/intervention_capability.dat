The {{aim of this study}} was to compare processes of care and mortality between academic and nonacademic hospitals in the contemporary era of acute myocardial infarction management. METHODS: We analyzed the original data from a prospective cohort study of 3059 patients, including 1714 with ST-segment elevation and 1345 with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, enrolled at 39 and 183 academic and nonacademic hospitals, respectively, in France. RESULTS: Unadjusted 1 -year mortality for academic and nonacademic hospitals was 10 % versus 15 % for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (P=. 01) and 13 % versus 14 % for patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (P=. 75). Patients treated in academic or nonacademic hospitals with percutaneous coronary <b>intervention</b> <b>capability</b> were more likely to receive reperfusion and recommended drug therapies than those treated in nonacademic hospitals without percutaneous coronary <b>intervention</b> <b>capability.</b> After adjusting for baseline characteristics, the hazards of death associated with admission to nonacademic hospitals with and without percutaneous coronary <b>intervention</b> <b>capability</b> relative to academic hospitals were 1. 13 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 79 - 1. 62) and 1. 65 (95 % CI, 1. 09 - 2. 49) for those with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 0. 95 (95 % CI, 0. 66 - 1. 36) and 1. 06 (95 % CI, 0. 72 - 1. 58) for those with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, respectively. Further adjustment for receipt of acute reperfusion and recommended drug therapies eliminated all differences in mortality between the study groups. CONCLUSION: Admission to academic hospitals was associated with a more frequent use of recommended therapies, conveying a survival advantage for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction...|$|E

Thus, securing a wireless link {{is essential to the}} security of a wireless network, and key generation algorithms are necessary for securing wireless links.

Traditional key agreement algorithms are not suitable for wireless ad-hoc networks since they consume scarce resources such as bandwidth and battery power. This paper presents a novel approach that couples the physical layer characteristics of wireless networks with key generation algorithms. It is based on the wireless communication phenomenon known as the principle of reciprocity which states that in the absence of interference both transmitter and receiver experience the same signal envelope. The key-observation here is that the signal envelope information can provide to the two transceivers two correlated random sources that provide sufficient amounts of entropy which can be used to extract a cryptographic key. In contrast, it is virtually impossible for a third party, which is not located at one of the transceiver’s position, to obtain o...|$|E
40|$|In {{communication}} systems where users share common resources, users ’ selfish behavior usually results in suboptimal resource utilization. There have been extensive works that model {{communication systems}} with selfish users as one-shot games and propose incentive schemes to achieve Pareto optimal action profiles as non-cooperative equilibria. However, in many communication systems, due to strong negative externalities among users, the sets of feasible payoffs in one-shot games are nonconvex. Thus, {{it is possible}} to expand the set of feasible payoffs by having users choose convex combinations of different payoffs. In this paper, we propose a repeated game model generalized by intervention. First, we use repeated games to convexify the set of feasible payoffs in one-shot games. Second, we combine conventional repeated games with intervention, originally proposed for one-shot games, to achieve a larger set of equilibrium payoffs and loosen requirements for users ’ patience to achieve it. We study the problem of maximizing a welfare function defined on users ’ equilibrium payoffs, subject to minimum payoff guarantees. Given the optimal equilibrium payoff, we derive the minimum <b>intervention</b> <b>capability</b> required and design corresponding equilibrium strategies.

40|$|We {{study the}} power control problem in {{wireless}} ad hoc networks with selfish users. Without incentive schemes, selfish users tend to transmit at their maximum power levels, causing significant interference to each other. In this paper, we study {{a class of}} incentive schemes based on intervention to induce selfish users to transmit at desired power levels. An intervention scheme can be implemented by introducing an intervention device that can monitor the power levels of users and then transmit power to cause interference to users. We mainly consider first-order intervention rules based on individual transmit powers. We derive conditions on design parameters and the <b>intervention</b> <b>capability</b> to achieve a desired outcome as a (unique) Nash equilibrium and propose a dynamic adjustment process that the designer can use to guide users and the intervention device to the desired outcome. The effect of using intervention rules based on aggregate receive power is also analyzed. Our results show that with perfect monitoring intervention schemes can be designed to achieve any positive power profile while using interference from the intervention device only as a threat. We also analyze the case of imperfect monitoring and show that a performance loss can occur. Lastly, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance improvement from using intervention rules and compare the performances of different intervention rules.

40|$|Reperfusion therapy {{decreases}} myocardium damage {{during an}} acute coronary event and consequently mortality. However, there are unmet {{needs in the}} treatment of acute myocardial infarction, consequently mortality and heart failure continue to occur in about 10 % and 20 % of cases, respectively. Different strategies could improve reperfusion. These strategies, like generation of warning sign recognition and being initially assisted and transferred by an emergency service, could reduce the time to reperfusion. If the first electrocardiogram is performed en route, it can be transmitted and interpreted in a timely manner by a specialist at the receiving center, bypassing community hospitals without percutaneous coronary <b>intervention</b> <b>capabilities.</b> To administer thrombolytic therapy during transport to the catheterization laboratory could reduce time to reperfusion in cases with expected prolonged transport time to a percutaneous coronary intervention center or to a center without primary percutaneous coronary <b>intervention</b> <b>capabilities</b> with additional expected delay, known as pharmaco-invasive strategy. Myocardial reperfusion is known to produce damage and cell death, which defines the reperfusion injury. Lack of resolution of ST segment is used as a marker of reperfusion failure. In patients without ST segment resolution, mortality triples. It is important to note that, until recently, reperfusion injury and no-reflow were interpreted as a single entity and we should differentiate them as different entities; whereas no-reflow is the failure to obtain tissue flow, reperfusion injury is actually the damage produced by achieving flow. Therefore, treatment of no-reflow is obtained by tissue flow, whereas in reperfusion injury the treatment objective is protection of susceptible myocardium from reperfusion injury. Numerous trials for the treatment of reperfusion injury have been unsuccessful. Newer hypotheses such as “controlled reperfusion”, in which the interventional cardiologist assumes not only the treatment of the culprit vessel but also the way to reperfuse the myocardium at risk, could reduce reperfusion injury...|$|R

However, as shown for first-generation drug-eluting stent, they may be counterbalanced by a potential higher risk of stent thrombosis, especially among ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients. In addition, diabetes {{has been shown}} to be an independent predictor of poor survival and repeated target vessel revascularization. No data have been reported so far on the long-term benefits and safety of new-generation drug-eluting stent in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction according to diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether diabetes may impact on the benefits from everolimus-eluting stent versus first-generation drug-eluting stent in patients undergoing primary angioplasty. METHODS: We combined data from two randomized trials (PaclitAxel or Sirolimus-Eluting Stent vs Bare-Metal Stent in Primary Angioplasty and randomized comparison of everolimus-eluting stents and sirolimus-eluting stents in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction) including consecutive ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients admitted within 12 h of symptom onset undergoing primary angioplasty and stent implantation at a tertiary centre with 24 -h primary percutaneous coronary <b>intervention</b> <b>capability.</b> Primary endpoint of this study was major adverse cardiac events at 3 -year follow-up. Secondary endpoints were as follows: (1) death, (2) reinfarction, (3) definite or probable ST and (4) target vessel revascularization at 3 -year follow-up. No patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS: Our population is represented by 680 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients treated with drug-eluting stent (180 enrolled in the PaclitAxel or Sirolimus-Eluting Stent vs Bare-Metal Stent in Primary Angioplasty trial, treated with first-generation drug-eluting stent, and 500 patients in the randomized comparison of everolimus-eluting stents and sirolimus-eluting stents in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, randomized to everolimus-eluting stent or sirolimus-eluting stent). Diabetes was observed in a total of 178 patients (26. 1 %) and associated with higher major adverse cardiac events, mortality, reinfarction, stent thrombosis and target vessel revascularization. Similar outcome was observed in terms of overall major adverse cardiac events, mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, with everolimus-eluting stent as compared to first-generation drug-eluting stent in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, whereas everolimus-eluting stent was associated with a significantly lower rate of stent thrombosis only in diabetic patients (1. 6 % vs 9. 6 %, hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) = 0. 15 (0. 02 - 0. 98), p = 0. 04) whereas no difference was observed in non-diabetic patients.

ResultsFrom April 2007 to May 2009, 500 patients with STEMI were randomized to EES (n = 250) or SES (n = 250). No difference was observed in terms of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between the groups. No difference was observed between the groups in terms of number of implanted stents per patient or total stent length. However, a larger reference diameter was observed with SES (3. 35 ± 0. 51 mm vs. 3. 25 ± 0. 51 mm, p = 0. 001), whereas patients randomized to EES more often received glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (54. 4 % vs. 42. 4 %, p = 0. 006).

SWIS will be designed to include the following capabilities: Well and field abandonment;Artificial Lift Services; Re-entry Drilling using CT including well side tracking anddeepening operations (Operations to include CT under-balanced drilling and ThroughTubing); Deployment and recovery of Sand Control Screens using CT as a conveying tool;Through Tubing Completions using CT as a conveying tool; Post-completion well clean-upoperations; Slick-line and electric line operations and sub-sea wellhead maintenance andrecovery. The SWIS concept vessel is a large scale wave piercing catamaran which will be maintainedon station and heading into the prevailing sea using a Dynamic Positioning System (DPS). Initial modelling of the response of the vessel to typical expected operating sea stateconditions is encouraging because the results indicate that this type of vessel will provide astable platform from which to carry out typical subsea well intervention procedures. The modelling has demonstrated that the vessel motions (other than heave) are minimalunder the expected operating conditions and will be compensated by the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR) and the CT. The heave amplitude and heave acceleration of the centre of gravity of the vessel will besuch that an off the shelf heave compensation system is available for the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR). Research has indicated that existing CT heave compensation systems can bereadily modified for use with SWIS to provide the required level of motion compensation tocarry out intervention procedures in moderately rough seas. The hypothesis that a catamaran based platform used for the above purpose has significantpotential economic benefits over a semi-submersible for common types of interventionprocedures is supported by the research completed. It is concluded that the savings resultingfrom the use of the SWIS vessel compared to a semi-submersible would be around USD 360, 000 per day. It is also concluded from the research and modelling completed that SWIS is a technicallyand economically viable system. Based on the survey carried out it has the potential for ahigh degree of utilization in the East Asian and Australian offshore regions due of the abovecost saving. It also has the potential for a high degree of utilisation in other offshore regions such as Brazil and West Africa where sea states are light to moderate...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{efficiency}} {{by improving}} locomotion methods {{is a key}} issue for underwater robots. In this paper, we investigate the power consumption of different underwater robotic systems and compare the energy efficiency of the different robots depending on the desired motion. In particular, we compare the energy efficiency of underwater snake robots, which can provide both inspection and <b>intervention</b> <b>capabilities</b> and thus are interesting candidates {{for the next generation}} inspection and intervention AUVs, with those of the widely used robots for subsea operations which are the remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). In order to compare the energy efficiency of underwater snake robots with the energy efficiency of the ROVs, a simulation study is performed comparing the total energy consumption and the cost of transportation of underwater snake robots and ROVs. The simulation results show that with respect to the cost of transportation metric and the total energy consumption the underwater snake robots are more energy efficient for all the compared motion modes compared to the ROVs.

40|$|The use of {{participatory}} sensing {{in relation}} to the capture of health-related data is rapidly becoming a possibility due to the widespread consumer adoption of emerging mobile computing technologies and sensing platforms. This has the potential to revolutionize data collection for population health, aspects of epidemiology, and health-related e-Science applications and as we will describe, provide new public health <b>intervention</b> <b>capabilities,</b> with the classifications and capabilities of such participatory sensing platforms only just beginning to be explored. Such a development will have important benefits for access to near real-time, large-scale, up to population-scale data collection. However, there are also numerous issues to be addressed first: provision of stringent anonymity and privacy within these methodologies, user interface issues, and the related issue of how to incentivize participants and address barriers/concerns over participation. To provide a step towards describing these aspects, in this paper we present a first classification of health participatory sensing models, a novel contribution to the literature, and provide a conceptual reference architecture for health participatory sensing networks (HPSNs) and user interaction example case study...|$|R
40|$|A {{semi-autonomous}} unmanned {{underwater vehicle}} (UUV), named LAURS, {{is being developed}} at the Laboratory of Sensors and Actuators at the University of Sao Paulo. The vehicle {{has been designed to}} provide inspection and <b>intervention</b> <b>capabilities</b> in specific missions of deep water oil fields. In this work, a method of modeling and identification of yaw motion dynamic system model of an open-frame underwater vehicle is presented. Using an on-board low cost magnetic compass sensor the method is based on the utilization of an uncoupled 1 -DOF (degree of freedom) dynamic system equation and the application of the integral method which is the classical least squares algorithm applied to the integral form of the dynamic system equations. Experimental trials with the actual vehicle have been performed in a test tank and diving pool. During these experiments, thrusters responsible for yaw motion are driven by sinusoidal voltage signal profiles. An assessment of the feasibility of the method reveals that estimated dynamic system models are more reliable when considering slow and small sinusoidal voltage signal profiles, i. e. with larger periods and with relatively small amplitude and offset.

40|$|As global populations age, {{conditions}} such as stroke and diabetes require individuals to use rehabilitation technology {{for many years to}} come due to chronic musculoskeletal, sensory, and other physical impairments. One in four males currently aged 45 will experience a stroke within 40 years and will often require access to prolonged rehabilitation. In addition, worldwide, one individual loses a limb every 30 s due to the complications of diabetes. As a result, innovative ideas are required to devise more effective prosthetic and orthotic devices to enhance quality of life. While Nitinol has already found much favor within the biomedical industry, one area, which has not yet exploited its unique properties, is in the field of physical rehabilitation, ranging from prosthetic and orthotic devices to assistive technology such as wheelchairs. Improved <b>intervention</b> <b>capabilities</b> based on materials such as Nitinol have the potential to vastly improve patients quality of life and in the case of orthoses, may even reduce the severity of the condition over time. It is hoped that this study will spark discussion and interest for the materials community in a field which has yet to be fully exploited...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Considerable new {{evidence}} has accumulated in randomized trials of myocardial reperfusion. The trials of catheter-based reperfusion compared with fibrinolytics have shown an advantage for angioplasty and stenting over pharmacologic therapy, even accounting for delays in transporting patients from facilities with <b>intervention</b> <b>capabilities.</b> On {{the basis of}} the recent trials, it is recommended that a regional center for infarct intervention be set up akin to regional trauma centers in the United States. Now that we have entered the third decade of myocardial reperfusion therapy, we can expect iterative improvement in all aspects, and ultimately a fused approach of pharmacology and mechanical therapies—to achieve the optimal outcomes and continue to lower the toll of fatality and morbidity of acute myocardial infarction (MI). (Circulation. 2003; 108 [suppl III]:III- 6 -III- 13.) Key Words: fibrinolysis myocardial infarction thrombosis Since the mid- 1980 s, there has been steady refinement inour approach to acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Although intravenous streptokinase was the initial pharmacologic reperfusion therapy validated to improve sur-vival, 1 more recent trials have shown the superiority of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and the equivalence of t-PA with reteplase or tenecteplase. 2 – 4 Furthermore, catheter-base...|$|R

This is interesting for {{inspection and monitoring}} operations, for instance within the subsea {{oil and gas industry}} and within marine archeology. In addition, underwater snake robots can provide both inspection and <b>intervention</b> <b>capabilities</b> and are thus interesting candidates for the next generation inspection and intervention AUVs. Furthermore, bioinspired locomotion through oscillatory gaits, like lateral undulation and eel-like motion, is interesting from an energy efficiency point of view. Increasing the motion efficiency in terms of the achieved forward speed by improving the method of propulsion is a key issue for underwater robots. Moreover, energy efficiency {{is one of the main}} challenges for long-term autonomy of these systems. In this study, we will consider both these two aspects of efficiency. This paper considers the energy efficiency of swimming snake robots by presenting and experimentally investigating fundamental properties of the velocity and the power consumption of an underwater snake robot for both lateral undulation and eel-like motion patterns. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the parameters of the gait patterns, the forward velocity and the energy consumption for different motion patterns. The simulation and experimental results are seen to support the theoretical findings.|$|R

40|$|People {{often feel}} uncomfortable in common social settings, {{sometimes}} {{to the point}} of damaging their lives. Though this type of problem affects all ages, genders and cultures, it is more visible in children. When confronted with this type of problem, children and adolescents are generally accompanied by therapists, while participating in Social Competence Training (SCT). SCT is a type of psychotherapeutic procedure in which patients must perform a set of tasks individually or in groups. The patient‟s activities outside the therapist‟s office have an important function in this type of therapy. However, therapists have no control over this process, which is supported only through questionnaires on paper, which patients must answer after completing the tasks, for discussion during the therapy session. With this intermittent level of therapist control, many times patients quit therapy or produce false data and answers. This is due to extremely low motivation when away from the therapist's office or parental control. Factors such as patient monitoring, promoting collaborative efforts and encouraging positive attitudes can improve the therapy process, and its results. Therefore, the need to conduct sessions outside the office, with the therapist, becomes apparent. This project aims to replace traditional questionnaires on paper with a mobile device, which would fully integrate the therapist in the SCT process, even outside the office. Therefore, it presents software, based on mobile devices, that supports in-sithu georeferenced group therapy which, besides having real-time monitoring and <b>intervention</b> <b>capabilities,</b> also allows for multi modal data gathering by the patients themselves. The concept, system and functions are defined, and directions for future work are discussed...|$|R
