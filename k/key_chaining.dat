50|$|Although the Cocoa text input {{system allows}} entry of many {{alternate}} and accented characters natively in macOS, a true compose-key solution isn't built in. At least {{one has been}} implemented using the Karabiner utility. That works with all applications, as does the use of keyboard drivers where Compose is implemented using the dead <b>key</b> <b>chaining</b> feature.|$|E
5000|$|On Microsoft Windows a few {{programs}} such as PuTTY provide compose-key support. To emulate the compose key for all software, keyboard shortcut utilities are often involved. There are also a number of open source utilities (such as WinCompose, AllChars, Compose-Keys or Compose). Installable keyboard layouts (such as this one) are available that contain a compose key {{assigned to one of}} the keys like [...] or [...] They work by using the dead <b>key</b> <b>chaining</b> feature that is more commonly used to input letters with multiple diacritics. Such keyboard layouts can also be programmed directly in C which is the language Windows drivers are written in, compiled using the free of charge Windows Driver Kit, and packaged using the free of charge Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4, compatible up to the latest versions of the OS.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{compelling}} need for a mode of operation that can efficiently provide authenticated encryption at a higher data rate, and is capable of making use of pipelining and parallel processing. This paper describes Random <b>Key</b> <b>Chaining</b> (RKC) block cipher mode of operation that fills this need. RKC mode makes use of Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG) and with the application of DRBG every block of plaintext is being encrypted with a different key bringing it closer to one-time pad approach. The slight variation of RKC mode {{can be used as}} a confidentiality mode that can be used in application like hard-disk compression with reduced computational cost...|$|E

We introduce a propagated trust relation model. Under this model, we propose fully self-organized procedures of <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> generation, <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> storage, <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> renewal, <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> distribution and <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> revocation.

Ponies sold as <b>key</b> <b>chains</b> were Milky Way, Dancing Butterflies, Sugarberry, Starbow, Rainribbon, Sunribbon and Baby Stockings, which came in either red or green.

50|$|Convenient {{and simple}} example for MIL was given in. Imagine several people, {{and each of}} them has a <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> that {{contains}} few keys. Some of these people are able to enter a certain room, and some aren’t. The task is then to predict whether a certain key or a certain <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> can get you into that room. To solve this problem we need to find the exact key that is common for all the “positive” <b>key</b> <b>chains.</b> If we can correctly identify this key, we can also correctly classify an entire <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> - positive if it contains the required key, or negative if it doesn’t.|$|R
3000|$|... μ TESLA {{protocol}} greatly {{reduces the}} computational strength of broadcast authentication and improves {{the speed of}} broadcast authentication. But its disadvantage is that it requires the node to store the message before the authentication key is published, causing storage problems and easily causing DoS attacks; during the initialization of the protocol, the base station sends the protocol initial information to the sensor node in a single broadcast mode. In addition, long network life cycles require long <b>key</b> <b>chains.</b> In {{order to reduce the}} cost of the <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> length and the initial information of the distribution protocol, Liu et al. proposed the layered μTESLA protocol. When layering μTESLA, the network life cycle is first divided into high-level time intervals, and then each high-level time interval is divided into low-level time intervals. Each interval generates a <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> of a corresponding length. The higher level <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> authenticates the initial information of the lower level key chain; the lower level <b>key</b> <b>chain</b> authenticates the broadcast data packet.|$|R
