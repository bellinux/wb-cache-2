40|$|Conventional voltage driven {{gate drive}} {{circuits}} utilise a resistor {{to control the}} switching speed of power MOS-FETs. The gate resistance is adjusted to provide controlled rate of change of load current and voltage. The cascode gate <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> has been proposed {{as an alternative to}} the conventional resistor-fed gate drive circuit. While cascode drive is broadly understood in the literature the switching characteristics of this topology are not well documented. This paper explores, through both simulation and experimentation, the gate drive parameter space of the cascode gate <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> and provides a comparison to the switching characteristics of conventional gate drive...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) diaphragm actuated by double-sided patterned electrodes. Au/Cr electrodes were deposited on bulk PZT wafers by sputtering while patterned by a lift-off process. SU- 8 thick film was used to form the structural layer. Double-spiral electrode induced in-plane poling and piezoelectric elongation are converted to an out-of-plane displacement due to the confined boundary condition. The influence of different <b>drive</b> <b>configurations</b> and electrode parameters on deflection has been calculated by finite element methods (FEM) using a uniform field model. Impedance and quasi-static displacement spectra of the diaphragm were measured after poling. Adouble-sided patterned electrode diaphragm can be actuated by more <b>drive</b> <b>configurations</b> than a single-sided one. Compared with a single-sided electrode drive, a double-sided out-of-phase <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> increases the coupling coefficient of the fundamental resonance from 7. 6 % to 11. 8 %. The displacement response of the diaphragm increases from 2. 6 to 8. 6 nmV 1. Configurations including the electric field component perpendicular to the poling direction can stimulate shear modes of the diaphragm. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} elevation and azimuth <b>drive</b> <b>configurations</b> on DSS- 13 antenna performance {{are presented as}} well as a study of gearbox stiffness and motor inertia. Small motor inertia and rigid gearboxes would improve the pointing accuracy up to a certain limit. The limit is imposed by critical values of gearbox stiffness and motor inertia introduced in the article. The critical values depend on the lowest structural frequency of the rate-loop model. The tracking performance can be improved by raising gearbox stiffness to the critical stiffness and reducing motor inertia to the critical inertia. An azimuth <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> with four <b>driven</b> wheels was also investigated. For the four-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>configuration</b> in azimuth, the cross-coupling effects are reduced and wind disturbance rejection properties improved. Pointing is improved substantially in the cross-elevation but is relatively unaffected in the elevation direction. More significant improvements can be achieved through either structural redesign (stiffening the structure) or new control algorithms or control concepts, which would eliminate the effect of flexible deformations on the antenna pointing accuracy. Although the study is performed for the DSS- 13 antenna, the results can be extended for other DSN antennas...|$|R
