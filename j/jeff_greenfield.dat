First, in an interview with CNN, Miller had a dispute with Judy Woodruff, Wolf Blitzer, and <b>Jeff</b> <b>Greenfield</b> when they questioned him on his speech, particularly on whether he had misinterpreted the context and full content of Kerry's votes, and the fact that Dick Cheney, as Defense Secretary, had opposed some of the same programs he attacked Kerry for voting against.|$|E

Also helping out with ABC's coverage were Jack Whitaker, Dick Schaap, Donna de Varona, Ray Gandolf, and ABC News reporters Stone Phillips, <b>Jeff</b> <b>Greenfield,</b> Judd Rose, and Bill Redeker.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy then restlessly {{wandered around}} the hotel, {{checking}} {{in on his}} staff. When asked if King's murder had {{reminded him of the}} 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, his brother, Kennedy replied, [...] "Well, that. But it makes me wonder what they might do to me too." [...] He told speechwriter <b>Jeff</b> <b>Greenfield,</b> [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world." [...] Greenfield later said, [...] "I could not {{for the life of me}} understand that callousness until, of course, I realized he had been thinking of the death of his brother." ...|$|E

5000|$|New York {{was one of}} the epicentres of the Latin-jazz crossover, so it is not {{surprising}} that the other major pop style to show a strong influence from bossa nova was the so-called [...] "Brill Building Sound", exemplified by the work of the New York-based songwriter teams such as Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Gerry Goffin & Carole King, Neil Sedaka & Howard <b>Greenfield,</b> <b>Jeff</b> Barry & Ellie Greenwich and especially Burt Bacharach and Hal David.|$|R

2500|$|Tom Brokaw asked rhetorically whether Obama or Kerry {{would be}} the man more remembered from the convention, while CNN's <b>Jeff</b> <b>Greenfield</b> called it [...] "one of the really great keynote speeches of the last quarter-century." [...] Howard Fineman noted that Obama's {{emphasis}} on parents, not government in teaching children was {{the same kind of}} language that could have been heard amongst Republicans. Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley stated, [...] "Obama trumped Bill Clinton. Clinton gave a good speech yesterday. Obama was better. That's hard to do in American politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Bradshaw says, [...] "A strange flavour, {{but this}} is an enjoyable and {{intelligent}} action film." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, and said that [...] "Three Kings {{is one of the most}} surprising and exciting movies I've seen this year" [...] and that the film is a [...] "weird masterpiece, a screw-loose war picture that sends action and humor crashing head-on into each other and spinning off into political anger." [...] <b>Jeff</b> <b>Greenfield</b> of CNN said [...] "This is a keeper".|$|E
2500|$|When CNN {{presenter}} <b>Jeff</b> <b>Greenfield</b> {{was asked}} why Chomsky was never on his show, {{he claimed that}} Chomsky might [...] "be {{one of the leading}} intellectuals who can't talk on television. [...] If you got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, [...] he's out". Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, {{and a whole lot of}} it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E
