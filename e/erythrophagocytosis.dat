Tropical Splenomegaly Syndrome is characterized by massive splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, marked elevations in levels of serum IgM and anti-malarial antibodies. The spleen is massively enlarged. It shows dilated sinusoids lined with reticulum cells. There is a marked <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> and lymphocytic infiltration of the pulp.

50|$|In {{asymptomatic}} infections the amoeba {{lives by}} eating and digesting bacteria and food {{particles in the}} gut, {{a part of the}} gastrointestinal tract. It does not usually come in contact with the intestine itself due to the protective layer of mucus that lines the gut. Disease occurs when amoeba comes in contact with the cells lining the intestine. It then secretes the same substances it uses to digest bacteria, which include enzymes that destroy cell membranes and proteins. This process can lead to penetration and digestion of human tissues, resulting first in flask-shaped ulcers in the intestine. Entamoeba histolytica ingests the destroyed cells by phagocytosis and is often seen with red blood cells (a process known as <b>erythrophagocytosis)</b> inside when viewed in stool samples. Especially in Latin America, a granulomatous mass (known as an amoeboma) may form in the wall of the ascending colon or rectum due to long-lasting immunological cellular response, and is sometimes confused with cancer.|$|E

40|$|SIRP-alpha (Signal Regulatory Protein alpha) is an {{inhibitory}} receptor on phagocytes. Its activation {{and consequent}} ITIM phosphorylation occur by binding to CD 47 {{present in the}} erythrocyte membrane, thus allowing SHP- 1 recruitment which dephosphorylates specific substrates involved in the mediation of varying physiologic effects. The aim of this work {{was to determine the}} role of dexamethasone and IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha on the expressions of SIRP-alpha and SHP- 1 and <b>erythrophagocytosis,</b> as well as to evaluate the regulation of SIRP-alpha and SHP- 1 in peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) of patients presenting with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) before and after glucocorticoid therapy. PBM cells from healthy donors were cultured in dexamethasone, IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha, or Hemin. The SIRP-alpha/SHP- 1 gene expressions were determined by real-time PCR, SIRP-alpha/SHP- 1 protein levels were determined by western blotting, and <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> was determined by microscopy. In vitro, IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha increased SIRP-alpha gene and protein expressions, as well as the SHP- 1 gene expression, in parallel to a decrease in <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> in PBM. Conversely, although the SIRP-alpha/SHP- 1 gene expressions were significantly increased, dexamethasone did not alter the SIRP-alpha/SHP- 1 protein expressions or <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> by monocytes. The SIRP-alpha/SHP- 1 expressions were significantly higher in the PBM of AIHA patients compared with normal or AIHA patients after glucocorticoid therapy. Only the SIRP-alpha gene expression was increased using the hemin culture. Our results confirm the key role of SIRP-alpha in the regulation of <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> and suggest that the SIRPalpha gene expression in AIHA patients before glucocorticoid therapy is increased due to heme release, and the decrease in the SIRP-alpha gene expression after glucocorticoid therapy is due to the indirect effect of this drug in reducing <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> and heme availability...|$|E

40|$|Acute-phase serum (APS) {{collected}} from Plasmodium berghei-infected rats inhibited phagocytosis of trypsinized rat erythrocytes and of erythrocytes from P. berghei-infected rats. Macrophages (M phi) incubated with APS or heat-aggregated acute-phase serum (HAAPS) for 6 h, followed by 18 h incubation in serum-free medium, exhibited {{significantly higher levels}} of phagocytosis than M phi similarly cultured but with normal rat serum. When APS was present at the time of assay, it inhibited <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> by M phi which had been in culture for 0 or 24 h. M phi activation by HAAPS was inhibited by 2 -deoxy-D-glucose, which suggests that activation by HAAPS is Fc-receptor mediated. Adsorption of APS with staphylococcal protein A abrogated the ability of APS to inhibit phagocytosis and that of HAAPS to effect M phi activation, suggesting that immune complexes are involved in both processes. Surface-bound immunoglobulins eluted from erythrocytes of P. berghei-infected rats promoted phagocytosis of trypsinized erythrocytes by HAAPS-activated M phi but not by resting M phi. These results indicate that the immunoglobulins which bind to infected or damaged erythrocytes during malarial infections promote <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> by activated M phi and that the immune complexes in serum from rats with acute malaria may inhibit <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> early in the infection but may, over time, induce changes in the M phi which later facilitate <b>erythrophagocytosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Individuals with {{sickle cell}} anemia are subject to serious infections caused {{by a number of}} bacteria, {{including}} Salmonella species and Staphylococcus aureus. It has been suggested that in {{sickle cell anemia}}, extensive <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> by macrophages may interfere with their antibacterial function and thereby predispose to infection. As a means of investigating this possibility, we evaluated the effects of erythrocyte ingestion on the Killing of Salmonella typhimurium by peritoneal macrophages and of S. aureus by alveolar macrophages. Monolayers of rabbit macrophages were exposed to erythrocytes or latex particles immediately before and during bacterial challenge. <b>Erythrophagocytosis</b> markedly inhibited intracellular killing of S. typhimurium by peritoneal macrophages (bacterial survival was 181 % of control) and of staphylococci by alveolar macrophages (bacterial survival was greater than 200 % of control). Exposure to latex particles depressed the bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages to a lesser degree. Next we investigated the possibility that <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> inhibits oxidative bactericidal mechanisms in macrophages. Hexose monophosphate shunt activity was stimulated by erythrocyte ingestion. However, zymosan-induced superoxide generation and chemiluminescence were suppressed by erythrocytes. Furthermore, a cell-free (hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase) system for chemiluminescence generation was also depressed in the presence of erythrocytes (intact or lysate) or by purified hemoglobin. These studies reveal that <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> inhibits macrophage antibacterial function, probably because of interactions between erythrocyte components and reactive products of phagocyte oxygen metabolism.

40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Entamoeba histolytica can invade both intestinal {{and extra}} intestinal tissues resulting in amoebiasis. During {{the process of}} invasion E. histolytica ingests red blood and host cells using phagocytic processes. Though phagocytosis {{is considered to be}} a key virulence determinant, the mechanism is not very well understood in E. histolytica. We have recently demonstrated that a novel C 2 domain-containing protein kinase, EhC 2 PK is involved in the initiation of <b>erythrophagocytosis.</b> Because cells overexpressing the kinase-dead mutant of EhC 2 PK displayed a reduction in <b>erythrophagocytosis,</b> it appears that kinase activity is necessary for initiation. Biochemical analysis showed that EhC 2 PK is an unusual Mn 2 +-dependent serine kinase. It has a trans-autophosphorylated site at Ser(428) as revealed by mass spectrometric and biochemical analysis. The autophosphorylation defective mutants (S 428 A, KD Delta C) showed a reduction in auto and substrate phosphorylation. Time kinetics of in vitro kinase activity suggested two phases, an initial short slow phase followed by a rapid phase for wild type protein, whereas mutations in the autophosphorylation sites that cause defect (S 428 A) or conferred phosphomimetic property (S 428 E) displayed no distinct phases, suggesting that autophosphorylation may be controlling kinase activity through an autocatalytic mechanism. A reduction and delay in <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> was observed in E. histolytica cells overexpressing S 428 A and KD Delta C proteins. These results indicate that enrichment of EhC 2 PK at the site of phagocytosis enhances the rate of trans-autophosphorylation, thereby increasing kinase activity and regulating the initiation of <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> in E. histolytica...|$|E

40|$|<b>Erythrophagocytosis</b> and {{inflammation}} from activated macrophages {{occur in}} distinct clinical scenarios. The presence of CD 8 + T cells and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production {{is required to}} induce disease in mouse models of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. We investigated the roles of a different class of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and IL- 13, in the induction of inflammatory tissue macrophage accumulation and/or hemophagocytosis. We found that large amounts of IL- 4, but not IL- 13, delivered via an implanted mini-pump or IL- 4 /anti–IL- 4 complexes, lead to substantial YM 1 + tissue macrophage accumulation, <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> within the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, decreased hemoglobin and platelet levels, and acute weight loss. This effect is not dependent {{on the presence of}} antibody or T cells, as treatment of Rag 2 −/− mice leads to similar disease, and IFN-γ neutralization during IL- 4 treatment had no effect. IL- 4 treatment results in suppression of IL- 12, elevation of serum IFN-γ, IL- 10, and the murine IL- 8 homolog KC, but not IL- 6, IL- 1 β, or tumor necrosis factor-α. Finally, mice transgenic for IL- 4 production developed tissue macrophage accumulation, disruption of splenic architecture, bone marrow hypocellularity, and extramedullary hematopoiesis.

In the present study, we demonstrated that lead could accelerate the splenic sequestration of erythrocytes through phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and subsequently increased <b>erythrophagocytosis.</b> In freshly isolated human erythrocytes, Pb 21 - induced PS exposure at relatively low concentrations (~ 0. 1 mM) by inhibiting flippase, a key aminophospholipid trans-locase for the maintenance of PS asymmetry and adenosine triphosphate depletion appeared to underlie this phenomenon.

In bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) silenced for p 62, RBC degradation is inhibited.

ADEP of monocytes was detected at 10 (- 2) - 10 (- 6) dilution of IgG-antibody fraction (original hemmagglutination titer; × 1600), and ADCC of lymphocytes and ADEP of granulocytes were detected at 10 (- 2) - 10 (- 4) and 10 (- 2) - 10 (- 3) dilution of this antibody fraction, respectively. Soluble cytotoxic factors were not released from lymphocytes, monocytes or granulocytes in this assay system, because no cytotoxic activity on (51) Cr-labelled human erythrocytes used as an adjacent cell was demonstrated by any leukocyte fraction in the presence of antibody-coated SRBC...|$|E
40|$|The {{phagocytosis}} of {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) is due to changes on the erythrocyte surface: specific modifications of RBC membrane components, alteration of surface molecules, loss of RBC membrane phospholipid asymmetry and irreversible oxidative damage of SH groups (Bratosin et al., 1998). In man <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> by neutrophils and monocytes is detectable in the autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria and has been observed in some patients manifesting clonal hematopoietic malignancies with myelodysplasia (Mukhopadhyay et al, 2003; Lewandowski et al., 2011). Phagocytosis by macrophages is a highly conserved phenomenon among vertebrates {{and it has been}} postulated that the pathophysiology of <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> may likewise be similar in reptiles and mammals (Nevill, 2009). In Caretta caretta the heterophils, analogous to the mammalian neutrophils, can phagocyte both parasitized and normal-appearing erythrocytes. On circulating blood smears stained with MGG-stained smears of circulating Caretta blood demonstrated that 4 - 51 % of the heterophils were emitting pseudopodia that made contact with erythrocytes and that others had progressively encircled individual erythrocytes. These are mature erythrocytes containing a typical inclusion body, recognized as Heinz body (Basile et al., 2011). Moreover, teardrop-shaped RBCs were also identified in the blood films suggesting that the phagocytosing cell aspirates or selectively removes the inclusion body from the erythrocyte and permits the resultant dacrocyte to remain in the circulation. A comparable phenomenon, the pitting function of the spleen, is well know in man. In this case the phagocytic cells of the spleen remove remnants of DNA (Jolly bodies) from denucleated erythrocytes and allow them to persist in circulation. This pitting results in a efficient removal of the inclusion bodies contained in RBC cytoplasm by releasing dacryocytes into circulation. The positivity to ALP MPO and CAE reactions also confirmed that the loggerhead’s phagocyting cells are heterophils. In conclusion loggerhead’s <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> is a defense mechanism allowing both the complete degradation of infected/parasitized erythrocytes and the pitting of the inclusion body and the release of an healthy erythrocyte into circulation.

40|$|African {{trypanosome}}s are the causative {{agents of}} Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT/ Sleeping Sickness) and Animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT/Nagana). A common hall-mark of African trypanosome infections is inflammation. In murine trypanosomosis, {{the onset of}} inflammation occurs rapidly after infection and is manifested by an influx of myeloid cells in both liver and spleen, accompanied by a burst of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines. Within 48 hours after reaching peak parasitemia, acute anemia develops and the percent-age of red blood cells drops by 50 %. Using a newly developed in vivo <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> assay, we recently demonstrated that activated cells of the myeloid phagocytic system dis-play enhanced <b>erythrophagocytosis</b> causing acute anemia. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism and immune pathway behind this phenomenon in a murine model for trypano-somosis. Results indicate that IFNγ {{plays a crucial role}} in the recruitment and activation of erythrophagocytic myeloid cells, as mice lacking the IFNγ receptor were partially protected against trypanosomosis-associated inflammation and acute anemia. NK and NKT cells were the earliest source of IFNγ during T. b. brucei infection. Later in infection, CD 8 + and t...|$|E
