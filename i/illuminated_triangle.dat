50|$|Rembrandt {{lighting}} is a lighting technique {{that is used}} in studio portrait photography. It can be achieved using one light and a reflector, or two lights, and is popular because {{it is capable of}} producing images which appear both natural and compelling with a minimum of equipment. Rembrandt {{lighting is}} characterized by an <b>illuminated</b> <b>triangle</b> under the eye of the subject on the less illuminated side of the face. It is named for the Dutch painter Rembrandt, who often used this type of lighting.|$|E

The MPO and the GRECO hybrid method can simplify the computations of the diffraction fields of the wedges by modifying the surface-normal vector of the target to redefine the surface equivalent currents. By using GPU-based reduction operation, we design a fast parallel summing method for the hybrid integrals over <b>illuminated</b> <b>triangles.</b> The hybrid method is validated by comparing the numerical results with those obtained through the serial computing program on a central processing unit, {{as well as through}} FEKO method of moments, which showed good agreement...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the solution to}} three problems in Computational Geometry. First we introduce a theorem to <b>illuminate</b> every <b>triangle</b> with three p 6 vertex-floodlights and we provide three proofs. Secondly we show that three p 4 vertex-floodlights suffice to illuminate every quadrilateral. Finally we provide a theorem for illuminating a cocircular convex n-gon P of n vertices {{with a set of}} k vertex-floodlights, (k ≤ n) whose total sum is pi...|$|R
50|$|All 2.3-16-valve 190 {{models are}} {{fitted with a}} Limited Slip Differential (LSD) as standard. They were also {{available}} with Mercedes' ASD system which was standard equipment on the 2.5-16v. The ASD is an electronically controlled, hydraulically locking differential which activates automatically when required. The electronic control allows varied amounts of differential lock from the standard 15% right up to 100%. It is not a traction control system however, and can only maximize traction rather than prevent wheel spin. Activation of the ASD system is indicated by an <b>illuminating</b> amber <b>triangle</b> in the speedometer.|$|R
5000|$|This close {{partnership}} between Cesi, van Heeck and Stelluti soon {{led to their}} founding the Accademia dei Lincei, together with Anastasio de Filiis, on 17 August 1603. There {{is no doubt that}} van Heeck {{played a key role in}} the conception and organization of the Academy. He was the most experienced, educated and famous member of the group, and he clearly took the lead in many of its ventures, though he was the second youngest among them. Like all its members, he adopted a pseudonym ("Illuminato"), an emblem (a quarter-moon <b>illuminated</b> by a <b>triangle</b> from the sun) and the motto [...] "A Patre luminum" [...] ('from the father of lights'). It was van Heeck who chose as the Academy's patron saint John the Baptist, the apostle of arcane visions. He also drafted its articles of association and devised its ceremonial.|$|R
25|$|The International jetty, also {{accessible}} via {{the security}} checkpoint A, {{is dedicated to}} flights with destinations outside Canada and United States. This jetty holds 18 gates: 50 through 53 and 55 through 68. Gates 53 and 62 are used exclusively for Passenger Transfer Vehicles. In this area, travellers can shop, eat and relax with a wide varieties of boutiques, restaurants, cafés {{and one of the}} biggest airport duty-free shops in Canada. There is also a Balnea SPA branch which offers travelers various spa facilities. At {{the far end of the}} jetty, there is a wide open space with a lot of natural lights through floor to ceilings windows and a big skylight in the rooftop. The masterpiece of the jetty is a work of art, called Veil of Glass, composed of different coloured glass <b>triangles</b> <b>illuminated</b> by spotlights, created by local artist ATOMIC3. Several murals and other works of art are also located in this jetty, including four from various Montréal museums.|$|R
40|$|Identities {{matter and}} this is {{especially}} true in multinational societies. In such societies, political identities play a chief variable in the political dynamics of the country. Identities receivetherefore much attention in most studies on this topic. In this perspective, communities are often seen as monolithic blocks at war with each other, along ethnic-linguistic lines. However, there is a missing link between identities and federal dynamics: it should be explored how identities shape the federal dynamics and how the federal dynamics shape identities. In Belgium and Canada, two multinational federations, the federal dynamics is much influenced by abipolar dynamics between the two main ethno-linguistic groups, which may stir fruitful comparisons and insight for the understanding of multinational federations. In both countries, identities and federal dynamics are intrinsically related to each other. Yet, their current political situation is quite different. While Belgium is stuck in a deep institutional crisis, Canada has now entered a period of – more or less – stability; even though the potential for tensions has not disappeared. The different path may be explained by the interactions between identities and federal dynamics within and between the two main linguistic groups. To explore these interactions, four citizens panels were organised in Montréal (Quebec), Kingston (Ontario), Liège (French-speaking Belgium) and Antwerp (Dutch-speaking Belgium). Each panel gathered 20 - 30 citizens for a half-day group discussion and thus provides insightful qualitative data. More specifically, different “identity triangles” – the identities of citizens in terms of “me”, “us”, and “them” – come out this original research and these <b>triangles</b> <b>illuminate</b> different perceptions and preferences for the future of their country. The results show the identity triangles within Canada are more dissimilar than within Belgium. It also reveals the proximity of some profiles between the two countries. Although a quantitative research would be needed to offer a greater leverage in terms of generalisations, such a qualitative study offer a deeper look into the identity and federal politics, which illuminate the dynamics at the heart of most multinational federations.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 69 - 70). Daphne du Maurier {{has long}} been considered chiefly as a writer of popular fiction. She is celebrated as a masterful constructor of plot and acclaimed for her ability to infuse novelistic narrative with a nameless and pervasive frisson of unease, {{but it is only}} recently that critics have begun seriously to investigate the shadowy complexities of her widely-read novels. In this thesis, three of du Maurier's best-known works 'Jamaica Inn', 'Rebecca' and 'My Cousin Rachel' are examined using psychoanalytic theory and close textual analysis together with autobiographical information. Each novel reveals an informing concern with the stability of identity, and the psychological perils by which the self is both shaped and haunted. In my discussion of Jamaica Inn, Julia Kristeva's theory of abjection elucidates Mary Yellan's confinement within the rigid boundaries of a violently imposed gender role, and her dangerous quest to transgress these limits. In the case of Rebecca, Nancy Chodorow's version of the female Oedipus complex <b>illuminates</b> the bisexual <b>triangle</b> in which du Maurier's nameless heroine finds herself trapped at Manderley, and brings into focus the anxiety which haunts her in her pursuit of maturity. Finally, in the chapter on My Cousin Rachel Jean Baudrillard's work on seduction and Gilles Deleuze's account of masochism help to explain Philip's compulsion to rid himself of his wealth, his land and the house in which he grew up, so that he might live like a servant with his cousin's maternal and alluring widow. In my reading of each of these novels, analysis uncovers a preoccupation with varying combinations of gender, sexuality and incest, a trinity of issues which beset the author in her own life, and which, in her fiction, inflect the protagonists' quest towards or away from a coherent identity. In conclusion it will be suggested that du Maurier's narratives are written with a double-edged pen: at once widely read, popular fiction, and darkly psychological, subvertive literature, in which deep-rooted social and cultural boundaries are destabilized...|$|R
