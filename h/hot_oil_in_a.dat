50|$|The {{traditional}} Kasaragodian way {{of cooking}} kalthappam {{is a bit}} different from other places. The batter of rice, coconut flakes, onions, cardamom and water is poured into <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> traditional utensil called uruli. Metal is placed over the uruli over which fire is placed in coconut shells. It is heated from above and below. This makes a crunchy shell all over.|$|E

50|$|Funnel cakes {{are made}} by pouring batter into <b>hot</b> cooking <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{circular}} pattern and deep frying the overlapping mass until golden-brown. The batter is commonly poured through a funnel creating its texture and giving its name. When made at concession stands, a pitcher with an integral funnel spout is employed. Alton Brown recommends they be baked with choux pastry, which expands from steam produced by its high water content.|$|R
5000|$|Oliebollen are {{a variety}} of {{dumpling}} made by using an ice cream scoop or two spoons to scoop a certain amount of dough and dropping the dough into a deep fryer filled with <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b> <b>In</b> this way, <b>a</b> sphere-shaped oliebol emerges. Oliebollen are traditionally eaten on New Year's Eve and at funfairs. In wintertime, they are also sold in the street at mobile stalls.|$|R

A rice flour batter is ladled into an emptied coconut shell bearing many small holes underneath, which is then held over <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> and moved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circular motion. The mixture will drip into the oil like thread, and forms a lattice-like layer on the oil as it fries to a solid crisp.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the effect of temperature on thermal softening behavior of black sweet-bamboo culms <b>in</b> linseed <b>oil.</b> Pressing test rig with a length scale and a pointer indicating specimen height was constructed. This apparatus was used to apply a compressive force to bamboo specimen immersed <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> linseed <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> boiler. Half circular cross-section specimens with thickness of 3 mm and length of 150 mm were dipped into water at room temperature to attain water saturated condition prior to immersing into linseed oil at various temperatures under the load of 20 N. Specimen height, used to calculate the degree of flatness, was measured as a function of time. The values of the final degree of flatness and the rate of degree of flatness were used for the analysis of thermal softening behavior of bamboo <b>in</b> linseed <b>oil.</b> It was found that thermal softening behavior of bamboo culms <b>in</b> linseed <b>oil</b> was divided into two temperature regimes with the glass transition temperature at 115 ºC. At low temperature regime, deformation occurred slowly and showed only a single stage of deformation, corresponding to deformation in the glassy state. At high temperature regime, specimens deformed slowly in the first stage followed by <b>a</b> rapid deformation <b>in</b> the second stage, corresponding to deformations in the glassy and rubbery states, respectively. Effect of temperature on the rate of softening was well described by means of the Arrhenius equation with the activation energy ranging from 18 kJ/mole to 32 kJ/mole...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of coupled heat and mass transport during frying and cooling of wood <b>in</b> contact with <b>oil</b> Abstract This paper proposes {{a model of}} coupled heat and mass (water, <b>oil)</b> transport <b>in</b> <b>a</b> porous medium (timber, 2 D geometries) soaked first <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> bath (), then <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold <b>oil</b> bath (). The timber is soaked at hot temperature to dry it (water vaporization, resulting in increased pressure and therefore vapor transport) and at cold temperature to treat it (vapor condensation, resulting in decreased pressure and oil transport). A model involving three equations, one for heat transfer (conduction, phase change), one for vapor transport (Darcy's law) and one for oil transport (Darcy's law) is developed (3 multiphysics equations). This gives a set of three equations {{that can be used}} to evaluate the changes in three independent intensive variables: T, p and (oil volume fraction). A Heavyside function is used for simulating vaporization and condensation. The change in density creates pressure, inducing vapor transport in the porous medium. Time-dependent solution allows the temperature boundary conditions to be changed to simulate the change of bath (T 180 T ∞ = °...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to experimentally verify the diffusion coefficients proposed by the various researchers. To validate these coefficients, drying experiments were carried out on impregnated and nonimpregnated paper and on pressboard samples. Taking into account the characteristics of the tested samples, two different experiments were performed: For nonimpregnated insulation, thermo-gravimetric experiments were performed determining the weight of a sample while being dried.. For impregnated paper, drying experiments were carried out <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> which samples were periodically extracted and analyzed by the Karl Fischer method. The drying experiments were simulated using a diffusion model, solved by finite element analysis. The simulations were carried out using the diffusion coefficients proposed by the various researchers. Finally, the experimental results were compared with the simulated ones, and the accuracy and the range of application of the various coefficients were determined.
