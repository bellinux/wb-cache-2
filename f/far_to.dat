5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how <b>far</b> <b>to</b> go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|After a curve to the northeast, CR149 passes {{under some}} power lines, {{intersecting}} with Cattall Road. There the highway {{turns to the}} north, and soon to the northeast, entering Livingston Manor. Immediately after entering the community, CR149 becomes more developed, with residential homes and commercial buildings now surrounding highway. After an intersection with Creamery Road, CR149 continues to the northeast through downtown Livingston Manor, ending at an intersection with CR178 (a former alignment of NY17). Interchange 98 on Route17 (the Quickway), is not <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the north and is accessible via CR178 and CR81.|$|E
5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the right during the course correction.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff City is yet {{to return}} to the FA Charity Shield, which was renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. However, between 2001 and 2006, the match was held at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. The closest Cardiff City has come so <b>far</b> <b>to</b> {{returning}} to the match was in 2008 when they reached the FA Cup Final once more, but lost by a goal to nil against Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from Göring on 10 May 1941, requesting Galland to intercept a Messerschmitt Bf 110 flown by Rudolf Hess heading for Scotland. Galland was unable to launch a full fighter sweep. However, Hess' flight was <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the north and he reached Scotland crashing his aircraft. Galland sent out fighters to conduct some sweeps so he could honestly claim to have carried out his orders but it was nearly dark and Galland ordered his pilots unused to night flying to stand down.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} months of 116AD, Trajan {{captured}} the Persian city of Susa. When Sanatruces II of Parthia gathered forces in eastern Parthia to challenge the Romans, his cousin Parthamaspates of Parthia betrayed and killed him: Trajan crowned him the new king of Parthia. Never again would the Roman Empire advance so <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the east.|$|E
5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
