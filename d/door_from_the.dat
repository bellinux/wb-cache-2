5|$|Cave 10 {{is located}} {{at a higher level}} than cave 9 and is {{difficult}} to reach as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has a recess with a seat. A cell {{to the left of the}} room has a seat in a recess. A <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cell leads to a half-cell which has a recess and seat. Traces of painting are seen on the ceiling. Outside the veranda to the left is a cistern.|$|E
5|$|Cave 12 {{is a small}} {{dwelling}} {{entered by}} a <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> veranda of cave 11. It has its own open veranda, which has a partly broken floor and ceiling and recessed benches {{on the left and}} right of the door to the middle room. The middle room has a small window {{to the left of the}} door and a seat recess in its right wall. In the back wall of the middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the ceiling of the middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
5|$|Number 10, {{also known}} as the Superintendent's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} limestone walls and a corrugated iron roof behind parapet walls. It is connected to the gatehouse with limestone walled buildings. The plan is roughly square and there is a <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> house into the prison from the north-east room of the ground floor. The house was initially built in 1853 for the Chaplain, but was taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and was later used by the prison administration.|$|E

5|$|The north transept, {{which had}} {{previously}} {{served as a}} vestry from which the Poor Law was administered, was used to house the church's William Hill & Son organ, which had been installed in 1852 in the now-removed western gallery; the south transept, which up to that date had {{been used as a}} mausoleum for the Cavendish family and was completely walled {{off from the rest of}} the church and accessible only via its own <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> churchyard, was opened up to the church. In 1890 Cambridge Chimes were added to the tower clock, in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.|$|E

25|$|In central Serbia, {{once the}} {{household}} members {{have gone to}} bed, an elderly woman of the family sticks a knife into the house <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inside. Alternatively, she puts a hawthorn stake by the door, hanging a wreath of garlic on it. This is done as a protection against curses, witches, and demons. For the same reason, children are rubbed with garlic on the palms, armpits, and soles before going to bed. In some regions, the men keep watch in shifts by the fireplace during the night, to keep the fire burning.|$|E

25|$|The esonarthex (or inner narthex) {{is similar}} to the exonarthex, running {{parallel}} to it. Like the exonarthex, the esonarthex is 4 m wide, but it is slightly shorter, 18 m long. Its central, eastern door opens into the naos, whilst another door, {{at the southern end of}} the esonarthex opens into the rectangular ante-chamber of the parecclesion. At its northern end, a <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> esonarthex leads into a broad west-east corridor that runs along the northern side of the naos and into the prothesis. The esonarthex has two domes. The smaller is above the entrance to the northern corridor; the larger is midway between the entrances into the naos and the pareclession.|$|E
25|$|In {{the base}} of the building, the banking hall, now called the Millennium Hall Ballroom, is used as {{function}} space. Separated by a metal and glass screen, the mezzanine levels are used as pre-function space and dining areas. Located by the 12th Street entrance on the ground floor, the lobby is decorated by the original vault <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> third-floor mezzanine, the bronze ceiling from the safe deposit box area, and the tellers' counters from the banking hall. Designed to mimic the building's original style, the lobby contains stainless-steel columns that replicate the ones found on the mezzanine, and the walls are of wood and marble. The ground floor also contains a Solefood Restaurant, Bar, and Lounge and a street-level, glass-walled news studio for the NBC affiliate WCAU.|$|E
25|$|The north {{aisle of}} the nave has at its east end, where it meets the north chancel chapel, a multi-facetted moulded arch with rounded half piers and part-octagonal capitals. Underneath the arch is the church organ. Within the aisle is a c.1888 stained glass window of three lights. On the north wall is an early 19th-century painted Royal arms, quatrefoil framed, with added note of De Ligne Gregory, rector H. Dodwell, and Thomas Plaskett. The south aisle {{contains}} two stained glass windows, one by Cox & Sons, c.1860. At {{the east end of}} the aisle is a doorway, Tudor arch headed, and spiral stairs to a loft above a previous rood screen, above which is another exit doorway. There is also a double aumbry. The arched doorway and <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south porch is at the west bay.|$|E

500|$|Keeps were {{traditionally}} {{built with}} an entrance at first-floor level, and Rochester's follows this pattern. A forebuilding {{attached to the}} north side guarded the entrance. A stone staircase began {{on the west side}} of the keep before turning and meeting the forebuilding, which could be entered by crossing a drawbridge across a gap [...] wide. There was another entrance in the west of the forebuilding, and at some point a new doorway was knocked through to the keep at the bottom of the drawbridge pit. The original <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> forebuilding into the keep was protected by a portcullis.|$|E
500|$|The castle site is now {{approximately}} [...] across. As of 2015, the derelict, roofless {{parts of}} the castle are in a poor structural condition and infested with ivy, with other parts suffering from death watch beetle. None of the earthworks or curtain wall survive, except for a small portion next to the gateway; this fragment of [...] wall is [...] thick and shows the original bank to have been as much as [...] high when viewed from the outside, but is now in danger of collapse. The wooden door {{on the left side}} of the gateway probably dates from around 1300, and the right <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> early-17th century, but they are currently unusable. There are some limited remains of the old walled garden interspersed in the modern housing estate. The main castle site is protected under law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
500|$|Forty-four {{seconds after}} Moosally's order, Lieutenant Buch {{reported}} that Turret Two's right gun was loaded {{and ready to}} fire. Seventeen seconds later, he reported that the left gun was ready. A few seconds later, Errick Lawrence, in Turret Two's center gun room, reported to Ziegler over the turret's phone circuit that, [...] "We have a problem here. We are not ready yet. We have a problem here." [...] Ziegler responded by announcing over the turret's phone circuit, [...] "Left gun loaded, good job. Center gun is having a little trouble. We'll straighten that out." [...] Mortensen, monitoring Turret Two's phone circuit from his position in Turret One, heard Buch confirm that {{the left and right}} guns were loaded. Lawrence then called out, [...] "I'm not ready yet! I'm not ready yet!" [...] Next, Ernie Hanyecz, Turret Two's leading petty officer suddenly called out, [...] "Mort! Mort! Mort!" [...] Ziegler shouted, [...] "Oh, my God! The powder is smoldering!" [...] At this time, Ziegler may have opened the <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> turret officer's booth {{in the rear of the}} turret into the center gun room and yelled at the crew to get the breech closed. About this same time, Hanyecz yelled over the phone circuit, [...] "Oh, my God! There's a flash!" ...|$|E

500|$|Back in Scranton, {{the rest}} of the {{employees}} are going to be forced to work on a Saturday to record their own sales as the website's sales, which is, according to Ryan, [...] "a temporary procedure to increase the legitimacy of the website." [...] With no one eager to participate, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) decides to ask everyone to stay in the office late instead of coming in for the Saturday. They all agree to the plan, and after working until 9:00pm, they are shocked to find the parking lot gates locked. [...] Jim had forgotten to tell the security guard that they were staying late. They are unable to return to the office because Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) locked the <b>door</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inside, and Dwight, miles away in New York, has both the spare and master keys. Jim repeatedly calls Hank the security guard (Hugh Dane). Pam accidentally injures Meredith by hitting her head with a football that was found in the parking lot. Sitting in the lobby area waiting for the security guard to arrive, the employees are clearly frustrated with Jim, and even vote by a show of hands that Andy and Angela are a better couple than Jim and Pam.|$|E
500|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry, dressed with gritstone. The nave {{measures}} 27feet 6inches by 15feet 6inches (8.4 by 4.7m), the chancel is 15feet 6inches by 11feet 9inches (4.7 by 3.6m), {{and the south}} chapel is 11feet 3inches by 16feet (3.4 by 4.9m). The building has a slate roof with copings of stone. At the west end, there is a gabled bellcote with one bell; crosses made of iron are fixed to the roofs of the chancel and south chapel. The nave of the church, which has two bays, was probably built in the 12th century. An entrance at {{the west end of}} the nave has been blocked up and plastered over on the outside. The chancel, which is smaller than the nave, and a chapel (on {{the south side of the}} building attached to the nave) were added in the 14th century, and the arches dividing the nave from the chapel and the chancel are of this date. The entrance <b>door,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, is positioned on the east side of the chapel and has a pointed archway. [...] Alongside the doorway is a stone inscribed with the year 1637, and next to that is a round-headed small window dating from the 12th century, reset in the chapel wall of later date. It has been suggested that this window may have been reused from the blocked nave entrance.|$|E
