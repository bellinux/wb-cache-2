50|$|The {{causes of}} common {{gynecomastia}} remain uncertain, but {{are thought to}} result from an imbalance between the actions of estrogen and androgens at the breast tissue. Breast prominence can result from enlargement of <b>glandular</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue,</b> chest adipose tissue (fat) and skin, and is typically a combination. As in females, estrogen stimulates the growth of breast tissue in males. In addition to directly stimulating male breast tissue growth, estrogens indirectly decrease secretion of testosterone by suppressing luteinizing hormone secretion resulting in decreased testicular secretion of testosterone. Furthermore, estrogens can increase blood levels of the protein sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which binds free testosterone (the active form) leading to decreased action of testosterone in male breast tissue.|$|E
50|$|Some {{asymmetric}} breast {{growth is}} normal in early adolescence, but asymmetry {{may be caused}} by trauma, fibroadenoma, or cysts. Most non-pathological asymmetry resolves spontaneously by the end of puberty; if it does not, surgical intervention is possible. Some adolescents may develop tuberous breasts, wherein the normal fat and glandular tissue grows directly away from the chest due to the adherence of breast fascia to the underlying muscle. Hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives are used to encourage outward growth of the breast base. Hypertrophy of breast tissue {{may or may not be}} a problem for an individual adolescent; back pain, kyphosis, shoulder pain, and psychologic distress may be cause for breast reduction surgery after development is complete. On the opposite end of the spectrum, breast tissue may not develop for a variety of reasons. The most common cause is low levels of estrogen (hypoestrogenism), which may result from chronic disease, radiation or chemotherapy, Poland syndrome, extreme physical activity, or gonadal dysgenesis.

50|$|Adipomastia, or lipomastia, {{also known}} colloquially as fatty breasts, is a {{condition}} defined as an excess of skin and adipose <b>tissue</b> in the <b>breasts</b> without true <b>breast</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>tissue.</b> It is commonly present in men with obesity, and is particularly apparent in men who have undergone massive weight loss.

The two conditions can usually be distinguished easily by palpation to check {{for the presence of}} glandular tissue. Another difference between the conditions is that breast pain/tenderness does not occur in pseudogynecomastia. Sometimes, gynecomastia and pseudogynecomastia are present together; this is related to the fact that fat tissue expresses aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of estrogen, and estrogen is produced to a disproportionate extent in men with excessive amounts of fat, resulting in simultaneous glandular enlargement.|$|R

Therefore, AGD has been adopted as dose index in mammography [8, 9] and it is routinely evaluated in quality assurance programs of mammography units.|$|R

Both systems have comparable scatter-to-primary ratios. In this study, 125 – 160 and 200 – 250 μm calcium carbonate grains were used to simulate microcalcifications and imaged by both DM systems. The calcium carbonate grains were overlapped with a 5 -cm-thick 50 % adipose∕ 50 % <b>glandular</b> simulated <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> slab and an anthropomorphic breast phantom (RMI 165, Gammex) for imaging at two different mean glandular dose levels: 0. 87 and 1. 74 mGy.

In order to characterize the attenuation properties of these materials, measurements in Hounsfield Units (HU) have been performed using a CT-scanner. Breast-equivalent plates have been imaged in different configurations (plates in and orthogonal to image planes), providing consistent results (+ 1. 3 HU). Breast density equivalent plates of different nominal breast density equivalences and sizes were measured, demonstrating both a good homogeneity within the plates (+ 1. 8 HU) and a good consistency between plates of the same nominal breast density equivalence (+ 1. 5 HU). In addition, dual energy CT provided mono-energetic HU from which mono-energetic linear attenuation coefficients of water and glandular and adipose equivalent materials were computed.

40|$|Abstract—The {{practice}} of elastography is generally limited to small applied compressions (typically 1 %), {{under the assumption}} of a linear stress-strain relationship in biological tissue. However, the recent reports of larger applied compressions and precompression levels to increase the strain contrast violate the above assumption. The nonlinear stress-strain relationships in different breast tissue types significantly alter the contrast in elastography, especially for large applied compression. The moduli of normal fibrous and <b>glandular</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> (along with cancerous lesions) are strain-dependent, with tissue stiffness increasing with applied compression. In this paper, we illustrate that the strain-dependence of the modulus has {{a significant impact on}} the elastographic contrast and on the contrast-to–noise ratio, and may even cause a reversal of the contrast in certain situations.

40|$|Introduction: Average glandular dose {{calculation}} in mammography with Mo-Rh target-filter and dose calculation {{for different}} situations is accurate and fast. Material and Methods: In this research, first of all, x-ray spectra of a Mo target bombarded by a 28 keV electron beam {{with and without}} a Rh filter were calculated using the MCNP code. Then, we used the Sobol-Wu parameters to write a FORTRAN code to calculate average glandular dose. Results: Average glandular dose variation was calculated against the voltage of the mammographic x-ray tube for d = 5 cm, HVL= 0. 35 mm Al, and different value of g.

40|$|Background: Accurate {{computation}} of {{the radiation}} dose to the breast {{is essential to}} mammography. Various the thicknesses of breast, {{the composition of the}} <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> and other variables affect the optimal breast dose. Furthermore, the glandular fraction, which refers to the composition of the breasts, as partitioned between radiation-sensitive glandular tissue and the adipose tissue, also has an effect on this calculation. Fatty or fibrous breasts would have a lower value for the glandular fraction than dense <b>breasts.</b> <b>Breast</b> <b>tissue</b> composed of half glandular and half adipose tissue would have a glandular fraction in between that of fatty and dense breasts. Therefore, the use of a computational code for average glandular dose calculation in mammography is a more effective means of estimating the dose of radiation, and is accurate and fast. Methods: In the present work, the Sobol-Wu beam quality parameters are used to write a FORTRAN code for glandular dose calculation in molybdenum anode-molybdenum filter (Mo-Mo), molybdenum anode-rhodium filter (Mo-Rh) and rhodium anode-rhodium filter (Rh-Rh) target-filter combinations in mammograms. The input parameters of code are: tube voltage in kV, half-value layer (HVL) of the incident x-ray spectrum in mm, breast thickness in cm (d), and glandular tissue fraction (g). Results: The average glandular dose (AGD) variation against the voltage of the mammogram X-ray tube for d = 4 cm, HVL = 0. 34 mm Al and g= 0. 5 for the three filter-target combinations, as well as its variation against the <b>glandular</b> fraction of <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> for kV= 25, HVL= 0. 34, and d= 4 cm has been calculated. The results related to the average glandular absorbed dose variation against HVL for kV = 28, d= 4 cm and g= 0. 6 are also presented. The results of this code are in good agreement with those previously reported in the literature. Conclusion: The code developed in this study calculates the glandular dose quickly, and it is complete and accurate.

This thesis focuses on several strategies to optimise the radiation treatment for patients with left-sided breast cancer. With respect to whole breast irradiation we concluded that: • the routine use of MR images in addition to the CT scan, when delineating either the <b>glandular</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> or the lumpectomy cavity, does not have added value. • tangential IMRT technique combined with a breath-hold technique should be the treatment technique of choice for left-sided breast cancer. • a breath-hold technique should and can be used in all left-sided breast cancer patients, regardless of age and breast size. • breath-hold in left-sided whole breast radiotherapy results in a less pronounced increase of coronary calcium score and, hence, could result in less radiation-induced cardio vascular damage.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the intra- and interobserver variation in delineation {{of the target}} volume of breast tumors on computed tomography (CT) scans in order to perform conformal radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical target volume (CTV) of the breast was delineated in CT slices by four radiation oncologists on our clinically used delineation system. The palpable <b>glandular</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> was marked with a lead wire on 6 patients before CT scanning, whereas 4 patients were scanned without a lead wire. The CTV was drawn by each observer on three separate occasions. Planning target volumes (PTVs) were constructed by expanding the CTV by 7 mm in each direction, except toward the skin. The deviation in the PTV extent from the average extent was quantified in each orthogonal direction for each patient to find a possible directional dependence in the observer variations. In addition, the standard deviation of the intra- and interobserver variation in the PTV volume was quantified. For each patient, the common volumes delineated by all observers and the smallest volume encompassing all PTVs were also calculated. RESULTS: The patient-averaged deviations in PTV extent were larger in the posterior (42 mm), cranial (28 mm), and medial (24 mm) directions than in the anterior (6 mm), caudal (15 mm), and lateral (8 mm) directions. The mean intraobserver variation in volume percentage (5. 5 %, 1 SD) was {{much smaller than the}} interobserver variation (17. 5 %, 1 SD). The average ratio between the common and encompassing volume for the four observers separately was 0. 82, 0. 74, 0. 82, and 0. 80. A much lower combined average ratio of 0. 43 was found because of the large interobserver variations. For the observer who placed the lead wire, the intraobserver variation in volume was decreased by a factor of 4 on scans made with a lead wire in comparison to scans made without a lead wire. For the other observers, no improvement was seen. Based on these results, an improved delineation protocol was designed. CONCLUSIONS: Intra- and especially interobserver variation in the delineation of breast target volume on CT scans can be rather large. A detailed delineation protocol making use of CT scans with lead wires placed on the skin around the palpable breast by the delineating observer reduces the intraobserver variation. To reduce the interobserver variation, better imaging techniques and pathology studies relating <b>glandular</b> <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> to imaging may be needed to provide more information on the extent of the clinical target volum...|$|E

One limitation of screening mammography is tissue superposition, particularly for dense breasts.

40|$|Background: Gynecomastia {{is defined}} as benign {{proliferation}} of male <b>breast</b> <b>glandular</b> <b>tissue.</b> To date, the pathophysiology of adolescent gynecomastia (AG) remains unclear. Kisspeptin is a polypeptide that {{plays an important role}} in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormonal axis. In this study, we investigated whether there is a relationship between kisspeptin and AG. Materials and Methods: This study included 40 males between 9 and 18 years of age diagnosed with gynecomastia. The control group consisted of 30 young healthy males in the same age range. The participants were evaluated with respect to anthropometric measurements (age, height, body weight, body mass index, breast and pubic stages and testicular volume). The levels of kisspeptin, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol (E 2), testosterone (T), and ratio of E 2 to T were measured in both groups. Results: The mean age was 13. 8 years. There were no differences between the groups in terms of anthropometric parameters, plasma gonadotropin levels, estrogen levels, and E 2 /T (P > 0. 05). Plasma kisspeptin (0. 77 and 0. 54 ng/mL, P < 0. 05) and T (253. 9 ng/dL and 117. 9 ng/dL) levels were significantly higher in the AG group than in the control group (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Kisspeptin levels are an important factor in AG...|$|R
30|$|Accessory <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> {{occurs in}} up to 0.2 – 6  % of the general {{population}} [26]. Ectopic <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> is subject to the same hormonal influences and risk of disease as eutopic <b>breast</b> <b>tissue.</b> During menses or pregnancy, hormonal stimulation can cause engorgement and discomfort. As a consequence, these patients typically complain of fullness and discomfort in this area. Ectopic <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> can undergo lactational change during pregnancy, and {{in the presence of a}} nipple-areolar complex it can give rise to lactation [26]. The axilla is the most common site in which accessory <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> can be found [27]. On mammography, ultrasound and MRI, accessory <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> has the imaging appearance of normal <b>breast</b> <b>tissue.</b> Primary carcinoma of ectopic <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> has been reported only in a small number of cases [27].|$|R
