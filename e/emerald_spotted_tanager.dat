It varies in shades of grey and brown, where its lightest is almost white. The frog has mottled yellow and black thighs, armpits, and groin. Occasionally, <b>emerald</b> <b>spots</b> are found on the back, which increase in number with age. A characteristic uncommon in the genus Litoria is pupils which appear cross-shaped.
