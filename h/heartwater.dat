50|$|<b>Heartwater</b> (also {{known as}} cowdriosis, nintas and ehrlichiosis) is a tick-borne rickettsial disease of {{domestic}} and wild ruminants. It is caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium (formerly Cowdria ruminantium) - an intracellular gram-negative coccal bacterium (also referred to as Rickettsia ruminantium). The disease is spread by bont ticks, which {{are members of the}} genus Amblyomma. Affected mammals include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and buffalo, but the disease has the biggest economic impact on cattle production in affected areas. The diseaseâ€™s name is derived from the fact that fluid can collect around the heart or in the lungs of infected animals.|$|E

5000|$|Borrelia {{bacteria}} are well described elsewhere {{in association with}} Ixodes ticks for causing Lyme disease in humans, but this disease also affects domestic dogs. Borrelia anserina is transmitted by Argas persicus to poultry, causing avian borreliosis in {{a wide spread of}} tropical and subtropical countries. [...] Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly Ehrlichia phagocytophila) is a bacterium of deer that spreads to sheep where it causes tick-borne fever in Europe, resulting in abortion by ewes and temporary sterility of rams. This bacterium invades and proliferates in neutrophil cells of the blood. This depletes these antibacterial cells and renders the host susceptible to opportunistic infections by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria which invade joints and cause the crippling disease of sheep called tick pyaemia. Anaplasma marginale infects marginal areas of red blood cells of cattle and causes anaplasmosis wherever boophilid ticks occur as transmitters. Anaplasma centrale tends to infect the central region of red blood cells, and is sufficiently closely related to An. marginale to have been used from long ago as a live vaccine to protect cattle against the more virulent An. marginale. Sheep and goats suffer disease from infection with Anaplasma ovis which is transmitted similarly to the anaplasmas described above. Ehrlichia ruminantium (formerly Cowdria ruminantium) is transmitted mainly by Amblyomma hebraeum and Am. variegatum in Africa, causing the severe disease <b>heartwater</b> in cattle, sheep, and goats.

50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{changes in}} the outer membrane proteins {{have led to the}} emergence of new strains which can infect a larger variety of hosts. <b>Heartwater,</b> caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium, is a prevalent tick borne disease of livestock in Africa and the Caribbean but also threatens the American mainland. Three strains have arisen from this species due to evolutionary change in their genomes. When sequencing their genomes, there were many active genomic modifications such as high substitution rates, truncated genes, and the presence of pseudogenes and tandem repeats. When analyzing substitution rates between the three strains in 888 orthologous coding DNA sequences, it was observed that there were only 3 coding DNA sequences that were biased towards non-synonymous substitutions that affect phenotype. In contrast, 181 coding DNA sequences were biased towards synonymous substitutions which do not affect phenotype. This indicates there was a selection pressure to maintain protein function, and this selection acted against the non-synonymous mutations.|$|E

Likewise, vaccination against redwater and anaplasmosis on 11, 8 and 14, 2 % of farms, respectively, appears to have had no beneficial effect on the mortality rates of these diseases. Many farmers still believe that very few or no ticks should be seen on cattle. In fact, it would appear that a considerable proportion of farmers find so few ticks on their cattle, that the frequency of acaricidal treatment is in many cases too high.

40|$|<b>Heartwater,</b> {{transmitted}} by Amblyomma spp., {{is considered one}} of the most important tick-borne diseases of cattle, goats and sheep in southern Africa, causing considerable losses through mortality and control costs. In support of a project developing a new inactivated vaccine, we have undertaken, an evaluation of the relative importance of <b>heartwater</b> in the major production systems in 9 countries of the SADC region. With the collaboration of Veterinary Departments, data on <b>heartwater</b> occurrence, control methods and production indices were collected and collated by livestock species and major livestock production system. Annual Reports of Veterinary Departments include only confirmed <b>heartwater</b> cases, probably only a very small proportion of the actual cases. This is mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining a definitive diagnosis, which requires examination of brain smears. Even though underestimated, <b>heartwater</b> was diagnosed in all production systems and in goats, sheep and cattle in all countries. Incidence and mortality are the most important parameters influencing economic impact. Control costs are important in some production systems and in these systems, it is difficult to estimate the proportion of control costs that should be allocated to different tick-borne diseases. This has tremendous impact on estimates of economic impact of <b>heartwater.</b> The estimated economic impact of <b>heartwater</b> in southern Africa varies by ecological, farm management and/or livestock policy circumstances. Highest economic losses due to <b>heartwater</b> occur when livestock are moved into a new area, either for restocking or for upgrading the existing indigenous breeds, and where there are significant fluctuations in the tick distribution and challenge. Some exotic species like Angora goats seems to be particularly susceptible. In contrast, indigenous livestock in the communal sector develop endemic stability.

We then use two more biologically detailed models to examine <b>heartwater</b> epidemiology. The first includes a carrier state and host mortality, and the second includes density dependence. The results from all three models indicate that a stable equilibrium with high disease levels is probably the standard situation for <b>heartwater</b> (R 0 between 5, 7 and 22, 4). More than 80 % of cattle become infected with <b>heartwater</b> if only 12 % of infected tick bites produce an infection in cattle, if tick burdens are as low as only five ticks per host per day, or if tick lifespans are as short as 7 d.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{economic}} impact of <b>heartwater</b> (Cowdria ruminantium infection) and model the impact of improved vaccines against the disease, a field study was conducted to provide data on livestock productivity indicators in Zimbabwe. Cross-sectional studies were performed in the two main agro-ecological regions, lowveld and highveld, where <b>heartwater</b> was thought to be endemically stable and epidemic, respectively. These studies were designed to provide data on livestock productivity and profitability, and other key production indicators from the smallholder (SH) and large scale commercial (LSC) production systems, and from beef, dairy, sheep and goat enterprises. The results show that the profitability of LSC beef farms, as indicated by overall positive gross margins, was similar (p> 0. 05) irrespective of location and whether or not <b>heartwater</b> cases were reported. Only LSC dairies that reported <b>heartwater</b> cases demonstrated a negative gross margin, though this was not significantly different from dairy farms that did not report <b>heartwater,</b> or from the beef farms.

The data from the two sites where Amblyomma had been found was pooled to represent the 'exposed' cohort, the others to represent the 'unexposed' cohort. The serological results of the cohorts were compared and expressed as relative risks and risk differences. Single and multiple seroconversions to the MAP-I branched were observed for both cohorts.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Heartwater,</b> a tick-borne disease {{caused by}} Ehrlichia ruminantium, is {{considered}} to be a significant cause of mortality amongst domestic and wild ruminants in South Africa. The main vector is Amblyomma hebraeum and although previous epidemiological studies have outlined endemic areas based on mortalities, these have been limited by diagnostic methods which relied mainly on positive brain smears. The indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) has a low specificity for <b>heartwater</b> organisms as it cross-reacts with some other species. Since the advent of biotechnology and genomics, molecular epidemiology has evolved using the methodology of traditional epidemiology coupled with the new molecular techniques. A new quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test has been developed for rapid and accurate diagnosis of <b>heartwater</b> in the live animal. This method can also be used to survey populations of A. hebraeum ticks for <b>heartwater.</b> Sampling whole blood and ticks for this qPCR differs from routine serumsampling, which is used for many serological tests. Veterinary field staff, particularly animal health technicians, are involved in surveillance and monitoring of controlled and other diseases of animals in South Africa. However, it was found that the sampling of whole blood was not done correctly, probably because it is a new sampling technique specific for new technology, where the <b>heartwater</b> organism is much more labile than the serumantibodies required for other tests. This qPCR technique is highly sensitive and can diagnose <b>heartwater</b> in the living animal within 2 hours, in time to treat it. Poor sampling techniques that decrease the sensitivity of the test will, however, result in a false negative diagnosis. This paper describes the development of a skills training programme for para-veterinary field staff, to facilitate research into the molecular epidemiology of <b>heartwater</b> in ruminants and eliminate any sampling bias due to collection errors. Humane handling techniques were also included in the training, in line with the current focus on improved livestock welfare...|$|E
