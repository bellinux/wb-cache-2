25|$|As seen on Hart's documentary, Hart {{proceeded}} to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who pleaded {{that he knew}} nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged. McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, known as The Undertaker, furious with McMahon, banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told he had to apologize to Hart. As recounted in Michaels' autobiography, he was told by McMahon not to say anything about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on Raw and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart. Hart {{proceeded to}} the dressing room to shower and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Remus had locked themselves in McMahon's office. When McMahon went to Hart's dressing room and tried to explain himself, Hart angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched. An altercation ensued, with Hart giving McMahon a single punch, dropping him to the floor. Although Vince's son, Shane McMahon, and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences. Hart angrily asked McMahon {{if he was going to}} screw him on the pay he was still owed, to which a groggy McMahon replied in the negative. In the <b>hallway</b> <b>outside</b> the dressing rooms, Hart's then-wife Julie angrily confronted Triple H and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart. McMahon had a black eye and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince off the floor and Vince rolling his ankle once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on WWE Confidential that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince's foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet immediately sprained his ankle and sent him back to the floor, from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco's action as a 'comedy.' Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.|$|E

40|$|Genetic Programming is used {{to create}} a {{reactive}} obstacle avoidance system for an autonomous mobile robot. The evolved programs take a black and white camera image as input and estimate the location of the lowest nonground pixel in a given column. Traditional computer vision operators such as Sobel gradient magnitude, median filters and the Moravec interest operator are combined arbitrarily. Five memory locations can also be read or written to. The first evolved program is now controlling the robot. When constructing a system, engineers typically practice iterative design, namely instantiating a design, evaluating it, and then modifying it in light of the evaluation.

500|$|The xx {{started to}} record the album in December with McDonald, who {{engineered}} the sessions. They would usually record at night after XL's staff had left, which Croft said made it feel [...] "isolated and quite creepy". To reproduce the sound he had heard on the band's demos, McDonald had them write down their instruments' settings and test {{different areas of the}} studio to determine where he should record each member. Sim, who played a Precision Bass manufactured in the 1970s, was often recorded in the <b>hallway</b> <b>outside</b> the studio with a Fender Bassman, one of several amplifiers McDonald experimented with for xx. Some of Qureshi and Croft's guitars were also done in the hallway. Qureshi played a Gibson SG with a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe or Blues Deluxe amplifier, while Croft played an Epiphone Les Paul on most of the album and a Gibson ES-335 on a few songs. For her lead guitar parts, Croft used a delay pedal and a Roland Micro Cube amplifier with a reverb setting, which McDonald felt would best replicate her [...] "icy", echo-filled sound on the demos.|$|E

Just before 9:00 a.m. (UTC-8), fourteen-year-old student James Scott Newman brought his mother's [...]38-caliber revolver to the school in his backpack. He removed the concealed pistol from his coat pocket and loaded it with three [...]38 caliber rounds while in the bathroom. [...] He chose his target, student Alexander Rueda, 14, at random in a <b>hallway</b> <b>outside</b> the cafeteria. [...] Before he started firing, a friend of Newman yelled at him to put the gun away, but Newman told him to run. He pulled the trigger twice but the gun did not fire because those chambers were empty. He then fired three times at Rueda. [...] One bullet hit Rueda in the arm and torso, and another ricocheted and hit student Kenzie McKeon, 14, in the leg from the shrapnel. [...] The two injured students had no prior relationship or arguments with Newman. [...] Several students and teachers heard the shots and the physical education teacher, Jencie Fagan, approached Newman and challenged him. Fagan managed to convince Newman to drop his gun and then restrained him until more staff arrived to help.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to assess the}} effectiveness of designating smoking rooms to control environmental tobacco smoke in nursing homes. Of the 39 nursing homes located in Toledo (a city in Ohio, USA) included in the preliminary survey, 33 facilities (85 %) allowed smoking, 14 facilities (36 %) allowed indoor smoking, and 13 facilities (33 %) provided a designated smoking area. Three of these 13 nursing homes with similar levels of care {{agreed to participate in}} study that was more comprehensive. The levels of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide (CO 2), respirable suspended particulate matter, nicotine, and solanesol were monitored at three locations within three nursing homes: a designated smoking room with an independent ventilation system, the adjacent <b>hallway</b> and <b>outside</b> the building. The concentrations of air contaminants, except CO 2, inside the designated smoking rooms were significantly higher than those in the <b>hallways</b> or <b>outside.</b> The concentration of CO 2 was similar in the smoking rooms and the hallways but significantly higher than the concentration outside.

2500|$|In the NBA Finals, the Mavericks {{faced the}} Miami Heat, held home-court {{advantage}} and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard Dwyane Wade. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free {{throw in the}} last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the last possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The tragic figure was Josh Howard, who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had {{to bring in the}} ball at backcourt rather than half-court for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by Alonzo Mourning's five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was fined a total of $250,000 for [...] "several acts of misconduct" [...] during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5.
