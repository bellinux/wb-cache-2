2500|$|According to Islamic {{tradition}} {{which describes}} this graphically, Jesus' descent {{will be in}} the midst of wars fought by al-Mahdi (lit. [...] "the rightly guided one"), known in Islamic eschatology as the redeemer of Islam, against al-Masīh ad-Dajjāl (the Antichrist [...] "false messiah") and his followers. Jesus will descend at the point of a white arcade, east of Damascus, dressed in yellow robes—his head anointed. <b>He</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> prayer behind al-Mahdi then join him in his war against the Dajjal. Jesus, considered as a Muslim, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay the Antichrist, and then everyone {{who is one of the}} People of the Book (ahl al-kitāb, referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, there will be one community, that of Islam.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "The Time of the Doctor" [...] (2013), the Time Lords {{reach out}} to the {{universe}} through a crack in time on the planet Trenzalore, broadcasting the message [...] "Doctor who?" [...] through time and space to draw the Doctor in. They also send through a truth field so that when the Doctor arrives <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> his real name, with the field making sure it's the real one, which will be a signal for them to return. As [...] "half the universe" [...] are at Trenzalore waiting for this, the Eleventh Doctor refuses as it will restart the Time War. When a very old and frail Doctor goes to meet his demise {{at the hands of the}} Daleks, Clara Oswald begs the Time Lords through the crack to intervene, and the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle through the crack before closing it, changing the Doctor's future and allowing him to defeat the Daleks and save Trenzalore.|$|E
2500|$|The {{political}} ideas {{during the time}} of assimilation policy are known by many Indians as the progressive era, but more commonly known as the assimilation era.(1890–1928). [...] The progressive era was characterized by a resolve to emphasize the importance of dignity and independence in the modern industrialized world. [...] This idea is applied to Native Americans in a quote from Indian Affairs Commissioner John Oberly: [...] " [...] must be imbued with the exalting egotism of American civilization so that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> ‘I’ instead of ‘We’, and ‘This is mine’ instead of ‘This is ours’." [...] Progressives also had a faith in the knowledge of experts. [...] This was a dangerous idea to have when an emerging science was concerned with ranking races based on moral capabilities and intelligence. [...] Indeed, the idea of an inferior Indian race made it into the courts. [...] The progressive era thinkers also wanted to look beyond legal definitions of equality to create a realistic concept of fairness. [...] Such a concept was thought to include a reasonable income, decent working conditions, as well as health and leisure for every American. [...] These ideas {{can be seen in the}} decisions of the Supreme Court during the assimilation era.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Awira taught ({{sometimes}} in {{the name}} of Rabbi Ammi, sometimes {{in the name}} of Rabbi Assi) that the words [...] "And the child grew, and was weaned ( [...] , va-yigamal), and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned" [...] in [...] teach that God will make a great feast for the righteous on the day that God manifests (yigmol) God's love to Isaac's descendants. After they have eaten and drunk, they will ask Abraham to recite the Grace after meals (Birkat Hamazon), but Abraham will answer that he cannot say Grace, because he fathered Ishmael. Then they will ask Isaac to say Grace, but Isaac will answer that he cannot say Grace, because he fathered Esau. Then they will ask Jacob, but Jacob will answer that he cannot, because he married two sisters during both their lifetimes, which [...] was destined to forbid. Then they will ask Moses, but Moses will answer that he cannot, because God did not allow him to enter the Land of Israel either in life or in death. Then they will ask Joshua, but Joshua will answer that he cannot, because he was not privileged to have a son, for [...] reports, [...] "Nun was his son, Joshua was his son," [...] without listing further descendants. Then they will ask David, and <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> Grace, and find it fitting for him to do so, because [...] records David saying, [...] "I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord." ...|$|E
