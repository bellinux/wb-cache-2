40|$|Spray {{distributors}} as used {{in conjunction}} with large diameter packed beds consist of a multiplicity of spray nozzles that produce a circular liquid distribution pattern, arranged in a rectangular grid with a large degree of overlap to avoid “dry spots”. This inherent non-uniformity is reflected in an uneven cross sectional distribution of the liquid, the extent of which depends on the factors such as spray angle, homogeneity of spray cones, nozzle pattern, and, importantly, the distance between the nozzles and the bed. The information on the performance of spray distributors is scarce and mainly qualitative, and therefore {{it is not surprising that}} rules for spray distributor design are unavailable in open literature. This paper aims at filling this gap and describes experiments carried out to characterize the liquid distribution of a 4 -nozzle distributor, equipped with full-cone, wide-angle spray nozzles. The TU <b>Delft</b> column <b>hydraulics</b> simulator with an internal diameter of 1. 4 m was used for this purpose. The test system was water/air at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. Particular attention was paid to the effects of the nozzle pressure and the spacing between the nozzles and the bed; however, the distance required to smooth out poor initial distribution to an acceptable level appeared to be impractical...|$|R

40|$|In the Dutch coastal zone, {{where the}} marine {{environment}} is highly dynamic owing to tidal currents, wind-driven, wave-driven, and density-driven currents and waves, the cohesive sediment dynamics is always a great concern to transportation authority and coastal managers. So far, a lot research has been contributed on the cohesive sediment dynamics such as transportation, deposition and resuspension. In addition, {{the origin of the}} cohesive sediment is also of a great interest to researchers. In this study, I will explore some underlying mechanics governing cohesive sediment dynamics with the help of numerical models based on Delft 3 D which is a powerful software package developed by WL | <b>Delft</b> <b>Hydraulics.</b> This study starts with the large-scale modelling of the North Sea using ZUNO grid, which has been verified by WL | <b>Delft</b> <b>Hydraulics.</b> During this research the original model is simplified due to the limitation of relevant data.

The simplification doesn’t cause significant change on the simulated results compared with the original model.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{modelling}} the maintenance of hydraulic structures, a failure model has been developed {{that is based on}} the only information that is commonly available: the amount of deterioration averaged over a bounded or an unbounded time-horizon. By introducing a prior density on the average deterioration per unit time, we can properly account for the uncertainty in a maintenance decision problem. The advantages of our Bayesian approach are that the failure model is based on a physical observable quantity, the deterioration, and that the probabilities of preventive repair and failure can be expressed explicitly conditional on the average deterioration.

40|$|Three image {{processing}} techniques are described {{to measure the}} modulation of the amplitude, phase speed, frequency, and wavenumber of short waves {{as a function of}} the phase of the long wave. First, long and short waves are separated by appropriate bandpass filtering. Secondly, the phase speed is computed by determining the local orientation in the space-time domain. Thirdly, Hilbert filters are used to compute the phase and amplitude of the long and short waves. Local wavenumbers and frequencies can then be estimated from spatial and temporal phase gradients, respectively.

In the suspension layer time-lag effects of the sediment concentration led to sediment fluxes in upstream direction. The suspended sediment was more confined to the near-bed region than according to diffusion theories, most likely due to turbulence damping. The horizontal time-dependent and net sediment fluxes were concentrated in the sheet flow and pick-up layer. Measured net sediment transport rates could be described as a linear relation with the third-order velocity moment near the bed...|$|E
