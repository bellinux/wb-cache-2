Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was <b>he</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> begin the descent.

5|$|On 28 June 1098, the crusaders {{defeated}} Kerbogha in a pitched battle {{outside the}} city, a victory caused by Kerbogha's inability {{to organize the}} different factions in his army.

25|$|On 11 June 1919, Rilke {{travelled}} from Munich to Switzerland. The outward {{motive was}} {{an invitation to}} lecture in Zurich, but the real reason was the wish to escape the post-war chaos and take up {{his work on the}} Duino Elegies once again. The search for a suitable and affordable place to live proved to be very difficult. Among other places, Rilke lived in Soglio, Locarno and Berg am Irchel. Only in mid-1921 was <b>he</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find a permanent residence in the Château de Muzot in the commune of Veyras, close to Sierre in Valais. In an intense creative period, Rilke completed the Duino Elegies in several weeks in February 1922. Before and after, Rilke rapidly wrote both parts of the poem cycle Sonnets to Orpheus containing 55 entire sonnets. Together, these two have often been taken as constituting the high points of Rilke's work. In May 1922, Rilke's patron Werner Reinhart bought and renovated Muzot so that Rilke could live there rent-free.|$|E
25|$|Williams had {{not been}} {{involved}} with experiments that had been carried out by troop carriers over the previous months and was therefore not {{up to speed on}} the latest pathfinder equipment and tactics, which were neglected during the planning phase of HUSKY. Moreover, the route chosen for the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing's operation was particularly difficult, involving three sharp turns over water in dim moonlight. Williams was unable to secure the necessary agreement from the naval commander, Vice Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt for a straighter route. Nor was <b>he</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> persuade the Twelfth Air Force to provide a fighter escort for his troop carriers or to fly searchlight neutralisation missions, although the RAF agreed to fly some missions against searchlights. On 21 May, Williams moved his headquarters from Casablanca to Oujda in order to observe the progress of training of the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing and the 82nd Airborne Division. At least one of his group commanders felt that Williams was over-optimistic about the proficiency of his crews.|$|E

25|$|In 1197 {{the most}} serious {{challenge}} to Sverre's kingdom arose. Several prominent opponents of Sverre, including Bishop Nikolas Arnesson of Oslo, who was a half-brother of King Inge Crouchback and archbishop Eirik Ivarsson. met at the marketplace of Halör in Skåne, then part of Denmark. They took a boy called Inge Magnusson, purported son of King Magnus Erlingsson as their figurehead-king. Their party was called the Bagler, from an old Norse word meaning crosier. The war between the Bagler, with the open support of the Church, and the birkebeiner was to last {{for the rest of}} Sverre's reign. They were not able to depose Sverre, but neither was <b>he</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> win a decisive victory against them. When Sverre died from disease in Bergen in 1202, he was the first king of Norway to die of natural causes since King Sigurd the Crusader in 1130. His last act was to advise his son and heir, Håkon Sverresson, to achieve a settlement with the Church. Håkon was taken to be the Birkbeiner's new king, and the bishops returned to Norway later the same year, releasing the country from the interdict. Deprived of most of his support, the Bagler King Inge was killed the same year.|$|E
500|$|As a captain, Willis has {{subsequently}} received mixed assessment. Botham retained {{fond memories}} of Willis the player, but remarked that Willis {{found it difficult to}} captain him because the men were of similar age. Willis, often noted for his enthusiasm, became an [...] "effective motivator" [...] as a captain; however, he was [...] "no outstanding tactical genius" [...] and [...] "towards the end his feelings bordered on disgust at the conviction that some of England's cricketers accepted failure too readily. Nor was <b>he</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> close himself off against media comment." [...] He was also characterised as a loner in the game, and a reluctant captain grateful to be placed back within the ranks after repeated defeats while he was at the reins.

2500|$|Angraecum sesquipedale is {{best known}} within the botany {{community}} for its association with the naturalist Charles Darwin. [...] After being sent several flowers of A.sesquipedale by James Bateman, Darwin noted the defining characteristic of the species, its extremely long spur. From his observations, Darwin surmised, in his 1862 publication On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilized by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing, {{that there must be}} a pollinator moth with a proboscis long enough to reach the nectar {{at the end of the}} spur. He arrived at this conclusion after attempting in vain to remove the pollinia of the flower using needles and bristles. Only after placing a cylinder with a diameter of 1/10 of an inch down the full length of the spur was <b>he</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> detach the pollinia upon retracting it.
