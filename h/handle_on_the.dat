5|$|The Kuching Orangutan Murals {{are vital}} {{images of a}} {{wheelbarrow}} filled with eight young orangutans and another baby orangutan swinging from a pipe. It was painted by Ernest Zacharevic along Power Street in the city on 27 April 2014. This latest mural is painted in Zacharevic's usual interactive style, with an actual wheelbarrow sliced into half and secured to the wall to enable the public to take selfies while holding onto the <b>handle.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the baby orangutan was painted over a nail on the wall, where people can 'place' items in its hand.|$|E

25|$|Most {{variants}} of the mitrailleuse were mounted on an artillery-style carriage. This made them heavy and cumbersome to <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield, with gun and carriage weighing up to 900kg (2,000lb).|$|E
25|$|Neti pots are {{typically}} made of metal, glass, ceramic or plastic. They rely on gravity, along with head positioning and repeated practice {{in order to}} rinse the outer sinus cavities. Typically they have a spout attached near the bottom, sometimes with a <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite side.|$|E
25|$|In June 1932 the Mussel II began flying as a landplane {{again with}} a central single wheel undercarriage, with wing tip and tail skids. It flew, but was hard to <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and reappeared in October with the central float but no land wheels. During 1933 it gained {{attention}} in races against speedboats. Its last flight was in September 1933.|$|E

25|$|The {{wide track}} and a {{steerable}} nosewheel made the aircraft easy to <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, {{and the short}} landing gear avoided the need for access ladders and service stands. The aircraft {{was designed to be}} simple to maintain, with more than 100 access panels and doors. An experienced ground crew could change an engine in about half an hour.|$|E
25|$|Some pubs {{disguise}} keg beer {{by having}} an imitation pump <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bar. If the bar staff have merely {{turned on a}} tap, or are just resting their hand on a very small handle with no pump action, then this is a keg beer. Exceptions are some pubs (in the north and occasionally elsewhere) which use electric pumps or the pubs in Scotland that use traditional air-pressure founts on cask ale.|$|E
25|$|Tilt-and-roll luggage or wheeled luggage, is {{a variant}} of luggage for {{travelers}} which typically contains two-fixed wheels on one end and a telescoping <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite end for vertical movement. Tilt-and-roll luggage is pulled and thus eliminates a traveler from directly carrying his or her luggage. In 1988, Northwest Airlines pilot Robert Plath invented tilt-and-roll luggage as travelers beforehand had to carry suitcases in their hands, toss garment bags over their shoulders, or strap luggage on top of metal carts.|$|E
50|$|Hesaka Station {{features}} {{one side}} platform {{capable of handling}} one line. Trains bound for Shiwaguchi and Miyoshi are <b>handled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper end (上り) of the platform, and trains bound for Hiroshima are <b>handled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower end (下り). The station is unmanned, featuring an automated ticket vending machine. The Hesaka Station building is a small waiting area with a galvanized roof.|$|R

25|$|The aircraft's design {{placed the}} wing behind {{the cabin and}} allowed easy entry via automobile-like doors {{on each side of}} the cabin. The {{propeller}} is well protected and provides safety on the ground in comparison to tractor configuration aircraft. The airfoil employed is a NACA 4418 giving high lift and a stable stall characteristics. The flaps are two-position and mechanically operated by a flap <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cabin floor between the seats. The engine starter is foot-actuated and the nose-wheel steering is connected to the control wheel.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, {{he became}} one of the most exciting and dominant players to play in the QMJHL. In the first half of the season, he and rookie Angelo Esposito formed one of the most explosive duos in the League. He became equally renowned for skating in front of the opposing team's bench and twirling his stick around and banging the <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice, as if to put a sword into a sheath, after scoring a goal, something that angered opposing players but captivated and inspired his head coach, Patrick Roy.|$|E
25|$|Grafting to {{involves}} the strong adsorption or chemical bonding of a polymer molecule to a surface from solution. This process is typically achieved through a coupling agent that links a <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface to a reactive group on {{either of the}} chain termini. Although simple, this approach suffers from the disadvantage of a relatively low grafting density {{as a result of}} steric hindrance from the already-attached polymer coils. After coupling, as in all cases, polymers attempt to maximize their entropy typically by assuming a brush or mushroom conformation. Thus, potential binding sites become inaccessible beneath this “mushroom domain”.|$|E

50|$|Nakafukawa Station {{features}} {{one side}} platform {{capable of handling}} one line. Trains bound for Shiwaguchi and Miyoshi are <b>handled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper end (上り) of the platform, and tains bound for Hiroshima are <b>handled</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower end (下り). The station building, as with the building at Kamifukawa Station, is used as convenient meeting place for {{the residents of the}} surrounding area. The station is unmanned but features an automated ticket vending machine.|$|R
50|$|To {{address the}} problem of <b>the</b> {{pressure}} hull's <b>handling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface, Laubeuf used a double-hull design, enclosing the rounded pressure hull (containing the crew and machinery) in a more boat-shaped outer hull, which was unpressurized, the space between given over to those features such as the ballast tanks, fuel tanks, which did not require pressurizing, or simply left open to the water when submerged. This gave a better hydrodynamic shape and led to improved <b>handling</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface.|$|R
500|$|Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork Media named [...] "Liquorice" [...] the [...] "Best New Track" [...] {{following}} its release; he praised {{the use of}} [...] "Pineapple Crush" [...] on the song, commenting: [...] "Lone's bright tones and winding sense of melody meshes well with Banks' light, airy vocals, while Azealia spits quick over 'Pineapple Crush's breakbeat rhythmic pattern without losing a <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beat, unleashing clever rhymes [...] without breaking a sweat." [...] In a mixed review, Alex Macpherson from Fact wrote that Banks [...] "feels slightly overwhelmed by its broad synth brushstrokes." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} were {{critical of the}} choice of setting. Though Lawrence claimed that it [...] "illustrated how good Pemberton and Shearsmith are at creating maximum tension on a minimal budget", others found that it interfered with their enjoyment of the episode. For Owen, it [...] "offered a definite production challenge that was made to look effortless ... but an appreciation of how well something was made isn't enough". Similarly, Lawrence felt that [...] "amid the karaoke din, {{it was hard to}} get a proper <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> characters or, indeed, really care about their fates".|$|E
500|$|Will Ferrell's {{character}} received {{criticism in}} the episode. White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting {{that she did not}} have a <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> character and that he was too [...] "downright normal" [...] and [...] "practically boring". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do". He further noted that [...] "nobody has come up with a good reason for him being here other than that he's Will Ferrell." ...|$|E

500|$|Three {{variants}} on {{the original}} Hotspur Mk I were created. The first was the heavily modified Mk II (Specification X.22/40 and X.23/40), which was redesigned partially to address changes in operational requirements and also to bolster the ground handling of the initial series of aircraft. In operations, rather than releasing the glider from a long distance away and allowing it to glide gently to the ground, {{it was decided that}} the towing aircraft would approach the landing zone and only then release the glider, requiring a more robust glider. The Hotspur Mk I wings had also shown considerable flex and the type had proved difficult to <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. In order to reduce stresses on the airframe, the fuselage was strengthened and wings were [...] "shortened" [...] by over eight ft each, resulting in a wingspan of [...] with the tips made square-cut and ailerons moved {{from the end of the}} wings to an inset position.|$|E
500|$|In Little Busters!, Riki meets {{five other}} girls {{attending}} {{his high school}} who later become members of the Little Busters, in addition to three more girls in Ecstasy; all eight are heroines in the game. The first is Komari Kamikita, a childish girl who takes great interest in fairy-tales, picture books, candy, and clothing with many layers of frills. She is very clumsy, though athletic, and will often not think before she acts. Haruka Saigusa is a schoolmate of Riki's from a different class, but always finds time to hang around in Riki's classroom. She incites uproars for her own personal enjoyment, which causes her twin sister, the public morals chairman Kanata Futaki, to chase after her. Kanata generally acts cold towards her sister, though gets annoyed when Riki gets close to Haruka. Kudryavka Noumi, known as [...] for short, is a girl who is one quarter Japanese, and three-quarters Russian. Despite having a poor <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> English language, {{she was able to}} skip a year in school due to credits obtained through studying abroad, making her the youngest member of the Little Busters. Kudryavka appears in Key's eighth game, Kud Wafter, as the main heroine.|$|E
500|$|One More Day was panned by {{fans and}} critics. IGN {{reviewer}} Jesse Schedeen described Amazing Spider-Man #545 as [...] "undoubtedly the worst comic Marvel published in 2007" [...] and a [...] "deus ex machina {{of the highest}} order." [...] He did admit that writer Straczynski [...] "had a great <b>handle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Peter/Mary Jane dynamic," [...] making their potentially final moments mean something, and that Quesada's artistic style made sense given the dark tone. However, he also dismissed the story as [...] "infuriating and downright disrespectful {{to anyone who has}} come to love Spider-Man comics over the years." [...] IGN published two [...] "Additional Take" [...] reviews for Amazing Spider-Man #545. Bryan Joel said that he'd been a [...] "vocal supporter" [...] of [...] "Brand New Day", but summarized the OMD story as [...] "flip, weightless, and painfully brief." [...] Richard George stated that [...] "One More Day" [...] "could prove to be the best example of editorial influence gone horribly, horribly wrong" [...] and [...] "in trying to preserve the appeal of Peter Parker, Joe Quesada has actually managed to fundamentally undermine the character." [...] Both Joel and George agreed with their colleague in complimenting Quesada's artwork. Tim Marchman of The Wall Street Journal stated that having Spider-Man make a deal with the devil-like Mephisto is [...] "the rough equivalent of having Z-movie director Uwe Boll film a studio-funded prequel to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver." ...|$|E
