50|$|A switchblade (also {{known as}} an {{automatic}} knife, pushbutton knife, ejector knife, switch, Sprenger, Springer, flick knife, or flick blade) {{is a type of}} knife with a folding or sliding blade contained in the handle which is opened automatically by a spring when a button, lever, or switch on the handle or bolster is activated. Most switchblade designs <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> blade, in which the blade is locked against closure when the spring extends the blade to the fully opened position.

50|$|Mauser's {{experimental}} Model 1906-08 pistol {{was designed}} to chamber this caliber. As the German Army seemed to show more official interest in the P-08 Luger than the C-96, Mauser developed a new design. In 1906, Mauser introduced the Model 1906-08 (or C/06-08) pistol in 9×25mm Mauser caliber, which used a detachable box magazine of 6, 10 or 15 rounds. This pistol had a similar layout to the C-96, with the magazine situated {{in front of the}} trigger group, but <b>incorporated</b> <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> system that was considerably different.

If the amount and quality of the data are sufficient, introduction of such additional parameters is valid for resolving spatially complex slip distributions. However, our purpose in this study is to propose a method, which analyze rather small amounts of low-quality data from the slip on the plate interface beneath the ocean bottom. Thus, we consider a more efficient method, which requires fewer parameters to be estimated.|$|R
50|$|Norton {{commissioned}} the McCandless brothers to design <b>a</b> complete <b>frame,</b> <b>incorporating</b> <b>a</b> swinging arm. McCandless' finished design was expensive, as it required over forty {{feet of the}} best Reynolds steel tubing. It was a welded twin loop with a swinging arm fitted with their own design of shock absorbers, with a heavily braced cross-over headstock. In two months a prototype motorcycle with the new frame was on the test track and it was tested on the Isle of Man {{in the winter of}} 1949. It performed well and Norton decided that the Norton works team would have motorcycles with the new frames. The Norton works was not well equipped so the sif-bronze welding was undertaken by the McCandless brothers who produced the eight frames for the racing team by hand.|$|R

The helix or worm was turned into the cork, then the bottle was held with the protruding corkscrew in the frame, with the lever hooked onto it. Pulling the lever extracted the cork. The mechanical advantage <b>incorporated</b> into these <b>frames</b> consisted of various types of rack and pinion, gear or lever mechanisms.|$|R

In order to fix the medial opening wedge osteotomy, Puddu developed a plate with a metal wedge that inserts into the osteotomy space. The plates have 2 and 4 holes with wedge heights ranging from 5 to 17.5  mm. A bony cut is made under the guide wires to within 1  cm medial of the lateral cortex. Wedges of different heights are driven into place in the osteotomy line. The plate with the appropriate wedge height is inserted anterior to the medial collateral ligament. Cancellous screws {{are used in the}} proximal holes whereas cortical screws for distal holes [36, 37]. In a recent revision, Puddu has produced a different plate where the posterior slope can be altered with an AP height-adjustable wedge block and <b>incorporates</b> <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> system of screws.|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) imaging {{of dynamic}} objects that rapidly {{undergoes}} structural changes, such as turbulent combusting flows, {{has been a}} long-standing challenge, mainly due to the common need for sequential image acquisitions. To accurately sense the 3 D shape of the sample, all acquisitions need to be recorded within a sufficiently short time-scale during which the sample appears stationary. Here we present a versatile diagnostic method, named Frequency Recognition Algorithm for Multiple Exposures (FRAME) that enables instantaneous 3 D imaging. FRAME is based on volumetric laser sheet imaging but permits several layers to be probed parallel in time and acquired using a single detector. To differentiate between the signals arising from the different layers <b>FRAME</b> <b>incorporates</b> <b>a</b> line-coding strategy, in which each laser sheet is given a unique spatial intensity modulation. Although the signal from all laser sheets overlap in the spatial domain, this line-coding approach makes them separated in the frequency domain {{where they can be}} accessed individually by means of digital filtering.
