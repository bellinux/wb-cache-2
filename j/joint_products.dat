40|$|This paper {{responds}} to Christian Gehrke's comment, {{and argues that}} the main conclusion of my earlier paper is sustainedâ€”that, contrary to Sraffa, Marx did not 'adopt' in any {{sense of the word}} the <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> method of treating fixed capital. It agrees with Gehrke that Torrens adopted a form of the <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> method, and that Malthus seems to have followed Torrens in this regard. However, it argues that Ricardo did not adopt the <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> method, not even in the one instance cited by Sraffa. Finally, it argues briefly that Marx's 'transformation of value' method of treating fixed capital and depreciation is superior to Sraffa's <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> method. ...|$|R

60|$|Their {{leaders will}} largely deny this last statement, but an {{examination}} of their utterances, their actions, and the situation will forestall such denial. In the first place, the conflict between labor and capital is over {{the division of the}} join product. Capital and labor apply themselves to raw material and make it into a finished product. The difference between the value of the raw material and the value of the finished product is the value they have added to it by their joint effort. This added value is, therefore, their <b>joint</b> <b>product,</b> and it is over the division of this <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> that the struggle between labor and capital takes place. Labor takes its share in wages; capital takes its share in profits. It is patent, if capital took in profits the whole <b>joint</b> <b>product,</b> that labor would perish. And it is equally patent, if labor took in wages the whole <b>joint</b> <b>product,</b> that capital would perish. Yet this last is the very thing labor aspires to do, and that it will never be content with anything less than the whole <b>joint</b> <b>product</b> is evidenced by the words of its leaders.|$|R

50|$|In microeconomics, joint product pricing is the firm's {{problem of}} {{choosing}} prices for <b>joint</b> <b>products,</b> which are {{two or more}} products produced from the same process or operation, each considered to be of value. Pricing for <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> {{is more complex than}} pricing for a single product. To begin with, there are two demand curves. The characteristics of each could be different. Demand for one product could be greater than for the other. Consumers of one product could be more price elastic than consumers of the other (and therefore more sensitive to changes in the product's price).|$|E

50|$|When setting {{prices in}} such a complex situation, microeconomic {{marginal}} analysis is helpful. In a simple case of a single product, the price is set at that quantity demanded where the marginal cost equals the marginal revenue. This is what is done when <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> are produced in variable proportions. Each product is treated separately. It might even be possible to construct separate cost functions. In the diagram below, to determine optimal pricing for <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> produced in variable proportions, one finds the intersection point of marginal revenue (product A) with the joint marginal cost curve. That quantity is then extended up to the demand curve for product A, which yields the profit-maximizing price for product A (point Pa in the diagram). The same is done for product B, yielding price point Pb1.|$|E

50|$|Joint cost is the {{collection}} of the common operation costs incurred before a point called, split-off point, where <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> are identified as individual products. It can also be defined as the cost to operate joint-product processes including the disposal of waste. With regard to joint costs, it is essential to allocate the joint cost for the different <b>joint</b> <b>products</b> for determining individual product costs. Several methods are used to allocate joint cost. These methods are mainly classified onto engineering and non-engineering methods. Non engineering methods are mainly based on the market share of the product; the higher market share, the higher proportion assigned to it e.g. net realizable value. In this method, the proportions are determined based on the sales value proportions. In the engineering based method, proportions are found based on physical quantities and measurements such as volume, weight, etc.|$|E
