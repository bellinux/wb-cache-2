25|$|According to the 2007 {{study by}} Memorial and Demos human rights organisations, Russian policemen lose their {{qualifications}} and professional skills during their duty tours in Chechnya. This conflict {{was linked to}} the rising brutality and general criminalisation of the Russian police forces.

Reliable numbers on police brutality are hard to come by, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>released</b> in 2006, the internal affairs department of Russia's Interior Ministry said that the number of recorded crimes committed by police officers rose 46.8% in 2005.

According to Amnesty International, torture of detainees in Russia is now endemic. Since 2007, police officers from outside Caucasus are now not only being sent to Chechnya, but to all the region's republics.|$|E
