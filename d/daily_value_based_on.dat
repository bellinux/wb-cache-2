40|$|With {{greenhouses}} it {{is possible}} to increase crop production and reduce significantly the water use. Additionally advancements in electronics and shortage of water have {{led to the development of}} “smart” or adaptive irrigation controllers that adjust the water application depth to plant needs, and thus increase water savings. The two most common types are soil moisture based and evapotranspiration based systems. In the first type, one or more sensors monitor the evolution of the soil water content, and trigger irrigation when a pre-defined soil moisture deficit is achieved, or a certain water tension is reached in the soil. The climate based systems usually measure one or more weather parameters and <b>based</b> <b>on</b> these establish the The objective of this work is to compare the performance of these two smart irrigation technologies for producing lettuce in greenhouses in southern Iberia. In the soil moisture methodology, Echo 5 sensors made by Decagon devices were used to monitor soil moisture content. The irrigation was set to start at three different soil moisture content, corresponding to a depletion of 10, 20 and 30 % of soil moisture content at 10 cm depth. For the evapotranspiration based method, the Hargreaves Samani reduced-set evapotranspiration estimates were used to control irrigation. A purpose built microcontroller was developed that calculates <b>daily</b> ETo <b>values</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> maximum and minimum temperature, and then makes daily water applications to compensate the exact amount of water lost to the Atmosphere. For this research specific The results indicate that the Eto based methodology is easier to use, and can provide excellent water use efficiency as long as it is previously calibrated. Smart irrigation <b>based</b> <b>on</b> soil moisture proved greater overall water use efficiency, although greater care needs to be taken in managing the system and ensuring a uniform water application near the sensor...|$|R
40|$|The pseudo-total {{and oral}} bioaccessible {{concentration}} of six potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in urban street dust was investigated. Typical pseudo-total concentrations across the sampling sites ranged from 4. 4 to 8. 6 mg kg− 1 for As, 0. 2 – 3. 6 mg kg− 1 for Cd, 25 – 217 mg kg− 1 for Cu, 14 – 46 mg kg− 1 for Ni, 70 – 4261 mg kg− 1 for Pb, and, 111 – 652 mg kg− 1 for Zn. This data compared favourably with other urban street dust samples collected and analysed {{in a variety}} of cities globally; the exception was the high level of Pb determined in a specific sample in this study. The oral bioaccessibility of PTEs in street dust is also assessed using in vitro gastrointestinal extraction (Unified Bioaccessibility Method, UBM). <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> a worst case scenario the oral bioaccessibility data estimated that Cd and Zn had the highest % bioaccessible fractions (median > 45 %) while the other PTEs i. e.

The pseudo-total and bioaccessible concentrations of PTEs in the samples has been compared to estimated tolerable <b>daily</b> intake <b>values</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> unintentional soil/dust consumption. Cadmium, Cu and Ni are well within the oral tolerable daily intake rates. With respect to As and Pb, only the latter exceeds the TDIoral if we model ingestion rate <b>based</b> <b>on</b> atmospheric ‘dustiness’ rather than the US EPA (2008) unintentional soil/dust consumption rate of 100 mg d− 1.

40|$|The {{presence}} of Pb {{in the environment}} can cause significant health problems. These issues are exasperated when the lead is in a more amenable form for potential ingestion. This study investigates the potential human health risk from Pb in urban street dusts. The lead levels in urban street dust in major city centres in northern UK have been compared to levels determined in 35 cities around the world. With a few exceptions, {{it was noted that}} the mean Pb levels in this study exceeded those found in other cities worldwide. Samples (n = 15) of urban street dust were collected across five city centres, and specifically in areas in which pedestrians are likely to concentrate, as well as near historical buildings. Typical total lead concentrations across all sampling sites ranged from 306 to 558 mg/kg. The human health risk was assessed using oral bioaccessibility testing of the urban street dust. The mean oral bioaccessibility data, irrespective of site and sample location, were in the range 43 ± 9 %. The total and bioaccessible concentrations of lead were compared to the estimated tolerable <b>daily</b> intake (TDIoral) <b>values</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> unintentional soil/dust consumption.

40|$|The use {{of digital}} {{technologies}} in livestock businesses {{can improve the}} efficiency of farmers managing welfare and productivity of their animals. One opportunity is to use high resolution livestock behaviour information to inform decision making.

In this paper, our focus was on livestock grazing behaviour {{in relation to the}} feed supply in extensive grazing systems. We investigated the use of a Deep Belief Network (DBN) to predict the Metabolizable Energy Intake (MEI) of sheep directly using sensors. With the complexity and the availability of more data forms especially in the sensor data, the use of DBN was evaluated as an analytical method that could be applied to improve farmer’s understanding of livestock grazing behaviour and feedbase management by the prediction of MEI <b>values</b> <b>daily.</b> <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> a field experiment, results generated from the DBN achieved with the MSE result of 5. 6 to the training dataset and the testing dataset of 11. 6.

40|$|SUMMARY To {{determine}} whether the intrarenal sodium-retaining effects of angiotensin II (A II) can produce chronic hypertension, we infused A II at a rate (1 ng/kg per min) that did not cause a measurable immediate rise in mean arterial pressure (MAP) for 10 days directly into the renal artery of five dogs with unilateral nephrectomy. Four additional control dogs with unilateral nephrectomy were infused intravenously with A II for 10 days at 0. 5 ng/kg per min. This intravenous infusion rate of A n was calculated to produce an increase in peripheral blood levels of AII at least as great as those achieved with the intrarenal infusion of AII. MAP was recorded continuously, 24 hours/day, and <b>daily</b> <b>values</b> for MAP <b>based</b> <b>on</b> approximately 720 sample points per day were determined by computerized data analysis. Intrarenal A II infusion produced an immediate fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and urinary sodium (UN. V) and potassium (UKV) excretion. MAP was unchanged during {{the first day of}} the infusion period. Both GFR and ERPF remained depressed for at least 6 days of the infusion. However, sodium balance was achieved on day 2 when MAP had increased by 9 mm Hg. Subsequently, MAP continued to increase, reaching + 15 mm Hg at the end of 10 days. In contrast, there was no sodium retention or hypertension during the first 48 hours of intravenous AII infusion; yet, during days 3 - 10, MAP did rise by 7 mm Hg. After the intrarenal infusion of A II was stopped on day 10, there were immediate increases in GFR, ERPF, UKV, and especially UN. V, and MAP returned to control levels after a few hours. The data indicate that the intrarenal effects of A II can produce chronic sodium retention and a sustained elevation in MAP and also prevent pressure natriuresis during the hypertension. Ore Res 44 : 154 - 160, 1979 IT IS well established that chronic infusion of an-giotensin II (A II) at a rate that causes only a small increase in arterial pressure initially, will in time produce prominent hypertension (McCubbin et al. ...|$|R
