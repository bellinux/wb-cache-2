25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E

Journalist Maureen Freely wrote of Millett's viewpoint regarding activism in her later years: [...] "The best thing about being a [...] is that she can say what she pleases because 'nobody's giving me a chair in anything.

500|$|Kristina Wilson, {{associate}} professor in the Department of Visual and Performing Arts at Worcester's Clark University, asked people on campus what they thought of Turtle Boy. One person replied [...] "Oh, that's Worcester's monument to bestiality." [...] Wilson said the sculpture is intended to portray [...] "innocence, joy, and rebirth," [...] and that historically Charles Y. Harvey came from an artistic tradition in which [...] "the human figure is the apex of beauty, and <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> can capture that is the demonstration of your artistic talents." [...] Regarding the artistic merit of the work, Wilson said: [...] "It's unfortunate, because it really does look like something untoward is going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{selection}} process, early contributor Chris Vrenna told Gannett News [...] "coming {{from the same}} emotional background, I feel, {{is more important than}} <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger". [...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So I took some young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it. [...] The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' [...] " ...|$|E
500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When people see the movie— {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{approximately}} 180 women in Antarctica in the 1990-1991 season. Women from several different countries were regularly members of over-wintering teams by 1992. The first all-women expedition reached the South Pole in 1993. Diana Patterson, {{the first female}} station leader on Antarctica, saw a change happening in 1995.

2500|$|Searle {{argues that}} this is impossible, since {{consciousness}} is a physical property, like digestion or fire. No matter how good a simulation of digestion you build on the computer, it will not digest anything; no matter <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> simulate fire, nothing will get burnt. By contrast, informational processes are [...] observer-relative: observers pick out certain patterns {{in the world and}} consider them information processes, but information processes are not things-in-the-world themselves. Since they do not exist at a physical level, Searle argues, they cannot have causal efficacy and thus cannot cause consciousness. There is no physical law, Searle insists, that can see the equivalence between a personal computer, a series of ping-pong balls and beer cans, and a pipe-and-water system all implementing the same program.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to {{the show}} has been {{generally}} positive. Many reviews have praised Mitchell's presentation of the programme, saying, [...] "Mitchell's quick, intelligent wit gives it an edge that it would otherwise lack." [...] Elizabeth Mahoney in The Guardian enthused: [...] "From the first moments of its plinky plonky theme tune, 'The Unbelievable Truth' is a delight... {{the success of the}} format isn't about how convincingly you can spin a tall story, but <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> can sneak incongruous true facts into a lot of silly nonsense. The pleasure here– David Mitchell's endearing squareness apart– is the depths to which this silliness sinks". Jane Anderson in The Radio Times described the show as [...] "the funniest thing I've heard on Radio 4 in years and I'm considering suing the network for irreparable damage to my sides" [...] and Chris Campling in The Times called it [...] "The most consistently entertaining comedy panel show of the past few years" [...] and praises David Mitchell's chairmanship.|$|E
2500|$|Zhao had {{developed}} strong interests in acting {{after her first}} acting experience, and decided to become an actress. In 1994, {{after graduating from the}} Wuhu Normal School, she gave up her job as an apprentice pre-school teacher. She moved from her hometown to Shanghai and was enrolled in Xie Jin Star Academy, an acting school founded by the legendary Chinese director Xie Jin, where she received structured acting training during 1994 - 1995. She was also selected by Xie to star his movie Penitentiary Angel (1996). This was her first substantial role. Though she did not find her own performance fulfilling, Zhao considered it a valuable experience and a good start of her career. The film landed her other roles in TV series including her first leading role in Sisters in Beijing (1996). [...] "I was too young to understand the role," [...] she said, [...] "but if you've been cast in a film by a famous director, no matter <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> did, other less-famous directors will also want to cast you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The NBL and the {{international}} UCI uses the [...] "Olympic" [...] or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> do with all the registered participant riders in your class racing all three times. It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your points total, {{the more likely you}} will advance. For instance if you come in 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If you come in Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men in your class translates to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would have a much better shot at making the Main than you. Even the person who came in 2nd+6th+6th or 35+25+35=95 would have a better shot even if you won the final moto.|$|E
2500|$|Mpath {{integrated}} many features into Mplayer in {{an attempt}} to stay competitive and support its community. [...] Most of these features came with an update to Gizmo in December 1997, among them were voice chat, a chalkboard system in game channels that anyone could view known as ScribbleTalk, a built-in browser known as WebViewer, personal messaging, as well a ratings and rankings system for Plus members. [...] The voice chat only allowed one person to speak at a time, but became extremely successful to the point where half of all Mplayer's service usage was from voice chat. [...] Mpath soon after split off a division to focus on VoIP technologies in early 1999 catering to non-gamers. [...] Ranked games were played in a separate lobby than normal games. [...] Ranking was determined <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> played relative to your opponent's rank. [...] In some games, this rank was only provisional until you played a certain number of games. [...] Later on, the rank icon only appeared after enough games were played. [...] Users could also customize their profiles by choosing a portrait from a set of pictures and edit their profile with HTML, however this latter feature was removed in later versions of gizmo.|$|E
