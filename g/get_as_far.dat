5|$|Cooley {{was born}} in Maryland, but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, {{when he arrived in}} East Florida, a {{province}} of Spanish Florida, as part of a military expedition. He established himself as a farmer {{in the northern part of}} the province before moving south, where he traded with local Indians and continued to farm. During the period in which the region was transferred from Spanish to U.S. governance, he sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the King of Spain and was evicting the Indians from their lands. Unhappy with the actions of the Spanish, he moved to the New River area in 1826 to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as possible from the Spanish influence.|$|E
25|$|Reaching the Caucasus oilfields {{was one of}} {{the main}} {{objectives}} of Adolf Hitler's invasion of the USSR in June 1941, but the armies of the Axis powers did not <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Georgia. The country contributed almost 700,000 fighters (350,000 were killed) to the Red Army, and was a vital source of textiles and munitions. However, a number of Georgians fought on the side of the German armed forces, forming the Georgian Legion.|$|E

Peter {{and the rest of the}} family go to his brother Rob's {{apartment}} in the city while Kate manages to get a flight back to the United States only to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as Scranton, Pennsylvania. She attempts to book a flight to Chicago but again, everything is booked. Unable to accept this, Kate is overheard by Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, who offers to let her travel with them to Chicago on their way to Milwaukee in a moving van, which she graciously accepts.|$|E

25|$|By early 1838, large vessels {{could only}} <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> {{as the end}} of Gawler Reach (near the current Birkenhead Bridge). Arrivals had to use smaller boats, {{traverse}} the mangrove swamps at low tide and climb sandhills to reach the road to Adelaide. A canal for the loading of sailing ships was constructed in 1838, and town acreages nearby surveyed and sold. By the years end deficiencies of the canal were clear. The canal was dry {{for most of the day}} and cargo movement very slow. Seagoing ships had to stop some distance from the settlement due to the mudbanks. Cargo and passengers covered the remaining distance in ships' boats. All had to traverse 2–300m of swamps after landing to reach sandhills, and eventually the road to Adelaide. The new port's first maritime casualty was the migrant ship Tam O'Shanter that ran aground on the outer sand bar. Later a small waterway in the port was named after the ship; the waterway later became the Port Adelaide Canal.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers next drive {{began on}} the final play {{of the third quarter}} and reached as far as the Patriots' 22-yard line, where Reed missed a 40-yard field goal to give the Patriots the ball back at their own 30-yard line. The Patriots {{proceeded}} to move into Steelers' territory, but on 3rd-and-13 from the Steelers' 43-yard line, a Cassel pass intended for Watson was intercepted by safety Troy Polamalu at the Steelers' 11-yard line and returned for 23 yards in the Patriots' fourth turnover of the second half. Three plays later, a 31-yard Willie Parker moved the Steelers to the Patriots' 28-yard line; they would <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the Patriots' 22-yard line before Reed kicked a 45-yard field goal to extend the Steelers' lead to 26–10. With less than six minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots began their next series from their own 44-yard line after Reed's kick was returned from the Patriots' 30-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Cassel found Gaffney open inside the Steelers' 25-yard line, but the wide receiver dropped the pass; Taylor threw the ball back toward Gaffney after the play, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that moved the Patriots into Steelers' territory. Seven plays later, on a first down from the Steelers' 14-yard line, Cassel was intercepted by linebacker Lawrence Timmons, who returned it 89 yards before being tackled at the Patriots' 1-yard line by Watson. Two plays later, Russell ran in for a 1-yard touchdown that gave the Steelers a 33–10 lead with less than three minutes to go in the game. The Patriots could not score on their next possession, ending the game and dropping the Patriots' record to 7–5.|$|E
500|$|After The Michigan Daily criticized his {{performance}} following the Marietta game, Maulbetsch [...] "threatened to desert the Michigan squad {{and give up}} football for good." [...] It reportedly took Yost several hours to coax Maulbetsch to report for practice again, {{and in the next}} game against Case, Maulbetsch did not play until the third quarter. [...] In the season's first big game, Michigan was soundly beaten by Michigan Agricultural College, 24–0, and most of Maulbetsch's runs [...] "didn’t even <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as his own line." [...] In the final four games of the season, matters got worse for Michigan and Maulbetsch, as the team went 0–3–1, scoring only 14 points in four games.|$|E

500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class tax cut and resistance to his proposal to allow gays in the military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as it did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And {{the timing of the}} announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability to lead the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began. [...] His [...] "presidential honeymoon" [...] period was thus extremely brief.|$|E
500|$|The I EP {{contains}} a single, 21-minute song of complex arrangements {{and was a}} hint of the forthcoming album, 2005's Catch Thirtythree. The EP, which was never played live by the band, was written and recorded during jamming sessions of Haake and Thordendal. On Catch Thirtythree, Meshuggah again used eight-string guitars, but utilized programmed drums for the first time also for the release, with the exception of two songs from 2001's compilation Rare Trax. The album was self-produced by the band and was recorded at the studio that Meshuggah shares with Clawfinger. Hagström notes, [...] "The eight-strings really have given us a whole new musical vocabulary to work with. Part of it is the restrictions they impose: you really can't play power chords with them; the sound just turns to mush. Instead, we concentrated on coming up with really unusual single-note parts, new tunings and chord voicings. We wanted to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> away from any kind of conventions and traditions as we could on the album, so the guitars worked out beautifully." ...|$|E
500|$|Luton {{have only}} managed to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as a {{planning}} {{application for a}} new ground once, when chairman David Kohler's Kohlerdome was proposed in 1995. The Kohlerdome was envisioned by Kohler as a 20,000 all-seater indoor arena with a retractable roof and pitch, hosting 85 capacity events each year. Kohler's plans, though ambitious, were perhaps not very realistic—the plans were turned down by the Secretary of State in 1998, with the reason given that the ground was not feasible unless the M1 motorway was widened. Kohler put the club on the market upon the plan's rejection and after a period under Cliff Bassett, the club came {{under the control of}} Mike Watson-Challis in 2000. Watson-Challis bought [...] of land by Junction 10 of the M1 in 2001, intending to move the club there, but once again, nothing came of the scheme. Most recently, in 2007, Jayten Stadium Limited were hoping to relocate the club to a new purpose built stadium at Junction 12, near Harlington and Toddington. This plan was very unpopular with both Luton Town supporters and the local authorities, but a planning application was still submitted by former chairman Bassett on the club's behalf. The application was withdrawn by the club almost immediately after the takeover by Nick Owen's Luton Town Football Club 2020 consortium in 2008.|$|E

500|$|Scott, Wilson and Shackleton left on 2 November 1902 {{with dogs}} and {{supporting}} parties. Their goal was [...] "to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> south {{in a straight}} line on the Barrier ice as we can, reach the Pole if possible, or find some new land". The first significant milestone was passed on 11 November, when a supporting party passed Borchgrevink's Farthest South record of 78°50′. However, the lack of skill with dogs was soon evident, and progress was slow. After the support parties had returned, on 15 November, Scott's group began relaying their loads (taking half loads forward, then returning for the other half), thus travelling three miles for every mile of southward progress. Mistakes had been made with the dogs' food, and as the dogs grew weaker, Wilson was forced to kill the weakest as food for the others. The men, too, were struggling, afflicted by snow blindness, frostbite and symptoms of early scurvy, but they continued southwards in line with the mountains to the west. Christmas Day was celebrated with double rations, and a Christmas pudding that Shackleton had kept for the occasion, hidden with his socks. On 30 December 1902, without having left the Barrier, they reached their Furthest South at 82°17′S. Troubles multiplied on the home journey, as the remaining dogs died and Shackleton collapsed with scurvy. Wilson's diary entry for 14 January 1903 acknowledged that [...] "we all have slight, though definite symptoms of scurvy". Scott and Wilson struggled on, with Shackleton, who was unable to pull, walking alongside and occasionally carried on the sledge. The party eventually reached the ship on 3 February 1903 after covering [...] including relays, in 93days' travel at a daily average of just over [...]|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{moved to}} Boulder, Colorado because he [...] "just wanted to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> from the New York {{environment}} as [...] could." [...] There, {{he wrote a}} film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due {{to the success of}} Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time [...] "skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado." [...] He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he [...] "tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh." [...] He claimed that [...] " [...] didn't know what [...] was doing," [...] and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: [...] "I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine." [...] Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stones [...] "Hot List" [...] in 1989. Meyer noted: [...] "The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that." [...] Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: [...] "In comedy circles, [...] taken on almost mythological proportions." [...] This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt [...] "embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richard Lamb {{argues that}} Macmillan was [...] "by {{far the best}} of Britain's postwar Prime Ministers, and his {{administration}} performed {{better than any of}} their successors". Lamb argues that it is unfair to blame Macmillan for excessively quick African independence (resulting in many former colonies becoming dictatorships), or for the Beeching Plan (which was accepted by Labour in 1964, although Macmillan himself had reservations and had asked civil servants to draw up plans for extra road-building), and argues that had he remained in power Macmillan would never have allowed inflation to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> out of hand {{as it did in the}} 1970s.|$|E

While the SLS {{was designed to}} connect {{with one of the}} other transcontinentals, its primary purpose lay in 19th-century industrial development exploiting the city's hinterland: the fast-disappearing easy timber, then primarily coal and iron. A theory, which later became profitable in fact, was that commuter trains could run along the SLS track, and be only twenty scenic minutes away {{from the center of the}} city.

2500|$|... "Endless running" [...] or [...] "infinite running" [...] {{games are}} {{platform}} {{games in which}} the player character is continuously moving forward through a usually procedurally generated, theoretically endless game world. Game controls are limited to making the character jump, attack, or perform special actions. The object of these games is to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as possible before the character dies. Endless running games have found particular success on mobile platforms. They are well-suited to the small set of controls these games require, often limited to a single screen tap for jumping. Games with similar mechanics with automatic forward movement, but where levels have been pre-designed, or procedurally generated to have a set finish line, are often called [...] "auto-runners" [...] to distinguish them from endless runners.|$|E
