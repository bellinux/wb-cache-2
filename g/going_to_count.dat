500|$|Baseball {{experts and}} sportswriters {{consider}} Hornsby {{to be one}} of the greatest hitters of all time. His lifetime batting average of [...]358 is only exceeded by Ty Cobb's career mark of [...]367. He won seven batting titles in total, a feat tied or exceeded by only five players (Cobb (11 or 12, depending on the source), Tony Gwynn (8), Honus Wagner (8), Rod Carew (7), and Stan Musial (7)). Hornsby led the National League in slugging percentage nine times, a record that still stands. He also hit more home runs, drove in more runs, and had a higher batting average than any other National League player during the 1920s, which makes him one of four players in baseball history (along with Honus Wagner, Ted Williams, and Albert Pujols) to win a decade [...] "triple crown". He hit a career total of 301home runs and was the first National League player to hit 300. His 264home runs as a second baseman was a major league record for that position until Joe Morgan surpassed him in 1984. Hornsby was also a very consistent hitter whether he was playing at home or on the road. His lifetime home batting average was [...]359, and his lifetime away batting average was [...]358. Ted Williams, who had the highest career batting average since Hornsby, said that Hornsby was the greatest hitter for power and average in baseball, and Frankie Frisch said of him, [...] "He's the only guy I know who could hit [...]350 in the dark." [...] Hornsby also holds second place on the unofficial major league record list of [...] "consecutive games with two or more hits" [...] with 13games, first place honors <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Count</b> Campau's 15-game streak. Hornsby is only the second right-handed batter in history to hit over [...]400 three times and is considered, according to the Los Angeles Times, to be the greatest right-handed hitter in history. He led the National League in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and total bases every year from 1920 to 1925. He is one of only two players (the other being Ted Williams) to win the batting Triple Crown more than once, but only Hornsby batted [...]400 on both occasions.|$|E
2500|$|The dissenting {{opinions}} strongly {{criticized the}} five justice majority for involving the Court in state-level affairs. Justice Stevens' dissent (joined by Justices Breyer and Ginsburg) concluded as follows: The per curiam opinion in Bush v. Gore did not technically dismiss the case, and instead [...] "remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion." [...] Gore's attorneys therefore {{understood that they}} could fight on, and could petition the Florida Supreme Court to repudiate the notion that December 12 was final under Florida law. However, Gore dropped the case, {{because he was not}} optimistic about how the Florida justices would react to further arguments and, as one of his advisers put it, [...] "the best Gore could hope for was a slate of disputed electors". In addition to this, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley argued that fighting on was futile because even if the Florida Supreme Court defied the U.S. Supreme Court and ordered a new recount, [...] "he GOP would take them straight back to Washington, where the [...] Supreme Court would repeat: 'You ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>count,</b> okay? So quit bothering us.'" ...|$|E

However, the radiogram reaches her just after the wedding has taken place.|$|R
50|$|The proportionator {{reduces the}} {{workload}} by avoiding {{the expense of}} increased counting. The efficiency increase is attained by employing PPS. Efforts <b>to</b> automate the <b>counting</b> process attack the variance problem at the wrong level of sampling. The better solution {{is to reduce the}} workload before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>counting</b> step. The optimal situation is to have all samples providing identical counts. The next best situation is to reduce the difference between samples.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the land}} in Cornwall was seized and {{transferred}} into the hands of a new Norman aristocracy, with the lion's share <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Robert, <b>Count</b> of Mortain, half-brother of King William and the largest landholder in England after the king. Some land was held by King William and by existing monasteries - the remainder by the Bishop of Exeter, and a single manor each by Judhael of Totnes and Gotshelm (brother of Walter de Claville).|$|R

6000|$|Saxton gasped. [...] "Bluff!" [...] he said. [...] "That's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>count</b> with me. You want a {{full hand}} {{to carry it}} through, and the one you're holding isn't strong enough. Now, I'll put down my cards." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the hall <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> <b>Count</b> (later Prince) Christian Wilhelm of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen between 1680 and 1700. It is decorated {{in the style of}} the high Baroque with 22 ceiling paintings about scenes from Ovid's [...] "Metamorphoses" [...] and 16 larger-than-life figures in the round made of stucco and represents Greek gods. The fact that this hall was originally designed during the Renaissance explains the unusual proportions (26.6 x 13.2 metres) and the relatively low ceiling of 4.8 metres.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016 Minamino {{participated in}} the Jr. Battle of Glory but he {{finished}} his block {{with all of his}} matches <b>going</b> <b>to</b> double <b>count</b> outs and he failed to reach the finals. On July 14, he defeated Yohei Nakajima for the Gaora TV Championship but he lost back to Nakajima on August 11. On September 25, 2016, Nagai and Minamino decided to disband Dark Kingdom in order to found their own stable named Dark Nightmare with Tatsuhito Takaiwa, Black Tiger V and Black Tiger VII.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Norman conquest {{most of the}} land was {{transferred}} to the new Breton–Norman aristocracy, with the lion's share <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Robert, <b>Count</b> of Mortain, half-brother of King William and the largest landholder in England after the king with his stronghold at Trematon Castle near the mouth of the Tamar. Cornwall and Devon west of Dartmoor showed a very different type of settlement pattern from that of Saxon Wessex and places continued, even after 1066, to be named in the Celtic Cornish tradition with Saxon architecture being uncommon.|$|R
6000|$|... "That kind {{of thing}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>count</b> in the new armies," [...] Dick replied. [...] "Being popular on {{guest-night}} at the mess won't help a man to hold his trench or work his gun under heavy fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>count</b> five," [...] {{continued}} Julius, [...] "and I guess, {{if you let}} me {{get past}} four, you needn't worry any about Mr. Brown. Maybe he'll send some flowers to the funeral, but YOU won't smell them! Are you ready? I'll begin. One--two three--four----" ...|$|E
6000|$|The old {{man looked}} at him with a curious little smile. [...] "The doctor Bob brought off didn't quite seem to know, but I could have told him. Guess I'm done, boy. It's quite likely I'll crawl out on deck for a little while, but how's that <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>count?</b> Nobody's going to have any more use for your father, Jimmy, and when the month is up Merril will take the {{schooner}} from him." ...|$|E

"No doubt," [...] he said, [...] "when {{they found}} the gates shut they remembered what I had said, that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> warn <b>Count</b> Charles and his friends, {{and went back to}} observe what these were doing; and the sight of their {{retainers}} going towards the gate must have told them which way they intended to leave; and they, no doubt, went down and hid up near the gate to watch the conflict, and to take advantage of it, if a chance offered, to get off themselves." ...|$|R
500|$|His manager Terry Francona said, [...] "He's {{taking more}} of what the {{pitchers}} give him, using the whole field. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work the <b>count</b> {{about as good as}} any hitter in baseball. Last year if he got a two-strike breaking ball, he might swing and miss. This year he's fouling it off, or taking it to right field." ...|$|R
50|$|Charles sent Guerin {{to expel}} Bernard of Septimania from Toulouse in 842 and then against Gothia in 843. After the Treaty of Verdun in August that year, {{he was the}} dux and marchio in Provence under Lothair. He may have {{inherited}} that office from Leibulf around 829. In 844, he received Autun, which had been stripped from Bernard's heir William. The French historian Pierre Andoque asserts that Bernard was captured in 843 by Guerin in Uzès and brought before Charles to be executed in 844. He was succeeded in 845 by Fulcrad as duke, with Marseille <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a <b>count</b> Adalbert.|$|R
60|$|But {{he did not}} go. Well, {{one might}} as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb. If he had lost this day of his life, he had lost it. He gave it up. He was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>count</b> his losses. She didn't care. She didn't care in the least. Then why should he? Should he be behind her in {{recklessness}} and independence? She was superb in her indifference. He wanted to be like her.|$|E

I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry the <b>Count</b> de Brensault. I have quite made up my mind. Perhaps you have not heard that it is all a mistake about my having a great fortune.

6000|$|... "Madam," [...] the Duke said, [...] "I {{trust that}} you will forgive my sending for you, but I am very much {{interested}} in the happiness of our little friend Miss Jeanne here.

60|$|GUNN [interrupting him] I {{know what}} youre <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say, <b>Count.</b> Youre <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{say that the}} whole thing seems to you to be quite new and unusual and original. The naval {{lieutenant}} is a Frenchman who cracks up the English and runs down the French: the hackneyed old Shaw touch. The characters are second-rate middle class, instead of being dukes and millionaires. The heroine gets kicked through the mud: real mud. Theres no plot. All the old stage conventions and puppets without the old ingenuity and the old enjoyment. And a feeble air of intellectual pretentiousness kept up all through to persuade you that if the author hasnt written a good play it's because hes too clever to stoop to anything so commonplace. And you three experienced men have sat through all this, and cant tell me who wrote it! Why, the play bears the author's signature in every line.|$|R

6000|$|It {{had been}} a very just remark of Cecilia's that Roderick would change with a change in his circumstances. Rowland had telegraphed to New York for another berth on his steamer, and from the hour the answer came Hudson's spirits rose to incalculable heights. He was radiant with good-humor, and his kindly jollity seemed the pledge of a {{brilliant}} future. He had forgiven his old enemies and forgotten his old grievances, and seemed every way reconciled to {{a world in which}} he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>count</b> as an active force. He was inexhaustibly loquacious and fantastic, and as Cecilia said, he had suddenly become so good that it was only to be feared he was going to start not for Europe but for heaven. He took long walks with Rowland, who felt more and more the fascination of what he would have called his giftedness. Rowland returned several times to Mrs. Hudson's, and found the two ladies doing their best to be happy in their companion's happiness. Miss Garland, he thought, was succeeding better than her demeanor on his first visit had promised. He tried to have some especial talk with her, but her extreme reserve forced him to content himself with such response to his rather urgent overtures as might be extracted from a keenly attentive smile. It must be confessed, however, that if the response was vague, the satisfaction was great, and that Rowland, after his second visit, kept seeing a lurking reflection of this smile in the most unexpected places. It seemed strange that she should please him so well at so slender a cost, but please him she did, prodigiously, and his pleasure had a quality altogether new to him. It made him restless, and a trifle melancholy; he walked about absently, wondering and wishing. He wondered, among other things, why fate should have condemned him to make the acquaintance of a girl whom he would make a sacrifice to know better, just as he was leaving the country for years. It seemed to him that he was turning his back on a chance of happiness--happiness of a sort of which the slenderest germ should be cultivated. He asked himself whether, feeling as he did, if he had only himself to please, he would give up his journey and--wait. He had Roderick to please now, for whom disappointment would be cruel; but he said to himself that certainly, if there were no Roderick in the case, the ship should sail without him. He asked Hudson several questions about his cousin, but Roderick, confidential on most points, seemed to have reasons of his own for being reticent on this one. His measured answers quickened Rowland's curiosity, for Miss Garland, with her own irritating half-suggestions, had only to be a subject of guarded allusion in others to become intolerably interesting. He learned from Roderick that she was the daughter of a country minister, a far-away cousin of his mother, settled {{in another part of the}} State; that she was one of a half-a-dozen daughters, that the family was very poor, and that she had come a couple of months before to pay his mother a long visit. [...] "It is to be a very long one now," [...] he said, [...] "for it is settled that she is to remain while I am away." ...|$|E

60|$|Richard {{undertook}} that Osmond {{should do}} so, and the Count, setting him down again, {{returned to the}} dais. Osmond, before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Count</b> that evening, ordered Sybald to come and guard the Duke's door. It was a long conference, for Hugh had come to Laon chiefly {{for the purpose of}} seeing how it went with his friend's son, and was anxious to know what Osmond thought of the matter. They agreed that at present there {{did not seem to be}} any evil intended, and that it rather appeared as if Louis wished only to keep him as a hostage for the tranquillity of the borders of Normandy; but Hugh advised that Osmond should maintain a careful watch, and send intelligence to him on the first token of mischief.|$|R
40|$|Aim: In our poster we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{present the}} Geothermal Power Project. The ALTENER II-Energy Framework Programme of the EC {{supports}} the referenced project.

5000|$|In March 2008, Cejas, a top {{fundraiser for}} Hillary Clinton, criticized the Democratic Party's National Committee after the {{committee}} penalized Michigan and Florida for holding their primaries early {{in violation of}} national party rules, barring their delegates from being seated at the Democratic convention the following summer. Cejas was quoted in The New York Times as saying, [...] "If you’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>count</b> my vote, I’m {{not going to give}} you my money," [...] referring to his 2007 contribution of $28,500.

It's not a game if pitchers throw one inning. It's not a game if managers try to get everyone on a bloated roster into the game.

50|$|Before the Thirty Years’ War, Ulmet was {{the biggest}} {{municipality}} in the middle Glan valley, and it held this distinction {{into the middle of}} the 19th century. This can be ascribed exclusively to a sound agricultural economy. Thus, with industry’s rise came a loss of status for Ulmet. After the Second World War came a drop in population, due not least of all to young people “fleeing the countryside” (Landflucht in German) and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the cities. <b>Counting</b> commuters at their workplaces disadvantaged their home communities and weekend commuters’ families’ homes, too, when it came to allocating funds from investment stock and income tax assessment.|$|R
5000|$|The opener {{was played}} on a bright Saturday {{afternoon}} at Royals Stadium and pitted Yankee ace Jim [...] "Catfish" [...] Hunter against left-hander and ex-Yankee Larry Gura. The Yankees {{got off to a}} quick start, scoring two in the first aided by a pair of George Brett throwing errors. Hunter was in top form and went the distance, not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a three-ball <b>count</b> the entire game. While the Royals were able to halve that margin going into the ninth, Roy White's two-run double {{in the top of the}} frame gave the Yanks two insurance runs that were the final scoring in a tidy 4-1 win.|$|R
5000|$|Recorded at Ocean Way studios, {{the song}} was {{intended}} as a Beach Boys pastiche, in a similar vein to The Beatles' Back in the USSR, though the vocal deliveries were more similar to 70s Beach Boys album tracks like [...] "Funky Pretty" [...] and [...] "The Trader". In attempt to get a Wall of Sound style of production, the recording featured two basses, two guitars and many keyboard tacks. The rhythm track was double tracked before further percussion was added. Costello said, [...] "There are 14 keyboards on 'The Other Side of Summer,' all playing the same thing, but nobody's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sit and <b>count</b> them." ...|$|R
