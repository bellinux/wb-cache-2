40|$|A further {{progress}} has been made in defining the ionosonde deduced equator (IDE) which characterises a latitudinal transition from the northern to southern hemisphere. It is now possible to define the global IDE location as the locus of the average position between geographic and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>equators.</b> A more complete insight to the phenomenon of the third equator (i. e. after geographic and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>equators)</b> was made possible due to availability of ionospheric height (h 2 ̆ 7 F) data from three stations positioned close to the IDE in the American and the far-east sectors. The IDE ionospheric signature (or E-type signature), detected at these stations, consists of bi-annual h 2 ̆ 7 F height increases. This signature however is not consistently observed during solar cycle and at times, particularly at sunspot minimum, a weak hemispheric signature is observed (i. e. the northern or southern hemisphere signature). In general, the height increase at the IDE are considerably smaller (by a factor of 4) than at other equatorial locations, indicating that the ionosphere at the IDE location becomes less disturbed. It is suggested that the equatorial longitudinal regions which can be associated with more consistent E-type signature are located in the central Pacific and at the east coast of America, close to the intersection points of the geographic and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>equators.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{effects of}} F-region neutral winds on the {{distribution}} of He(+) in the equatorial ionosphere have been examined using a theoretical model and an observational data set. It is shown by the model that components of neutral wind in the magnetic meridian up to only 50 m/s can produce He(+) gradients in the northern and southern sectors of a flux tube that differ by more than 80 percent. This is associated with interhemisphere transport velocities of He(+) as large as 15 m/s at 800 km. A substantial latitude gradient in the He(+) distribution across the dip equator also results from the redistribution of He(+). The changes in the He(+) concentration at the dip equator and the latitude distribution of H(+) in response to different neutral wind components is determined from the model and used to construct longitude distributions of He(+) to compare with observations made at equinox. Good agreement between the calculations and observations is obtained both at the geographic and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>equators</b> using the relationship between neutral winds, interhemispheric transport velocity and He(+) concentration derived from the model. If these relationships can be extrapolated to accommodate the different conditions expected during solstice, the He(+) distributions expected during this season can also be discussed...|$|R

30|$|Various {{electrical}} currents {{flow in the}} Earth’s ionosphere. At mid- and low latitudes, thermospheric {{winds and}} tides generate electrical currents in the E-region, around 110 km altitude, through {{a process known as}} the ionospheric wind dynamo (Richmond and Thayer 2000).

40|$|A {{realistic}} fully time-dependent computer model, denominated LION (Low-latitude Ionospheric) model, that simulates {{the dynamic}} {{behavior of the}} low-latitude ionosphere is presented. The time evolution and spatial distribution of the ionospheric particle densities and velocities are computed by numerically solving the time-dependent, coupled, nonlinear system of continuity and momentum equations for the ions O +, O 2 +, NO +, N 2 + and N +, taking into account photoionization of the atmospheric species by the solar extreme ultraviolet radiation, chemical and ionic production and loss reactions, and plasma transport processes, including the ionospheric effects of thermospheric neutral winds, plasma diffusion and electromagnetic E × B plasma drifts. The Earth's magnetic field is represented by a tilted centered magnetic dipole. This set of coupled nonlinear equations is solved along a given magnetic field line in a Lagrangian frame of reference moving vertically, in the magnetic meridian plane, with the electromagnetic E × B plasma drift velocity. The spatial and time distribution of the thermospheric neutral wind velocities and {{the pattern of the}} electromagnetic drifts are taken as known quantities, given through specified analytical or empirical models. The model simulation results are presented in the form of computer-generated color maps and reproduce the typical ionization distribution and time evolution normally observed in the low-latitude ionosphere, including details of the equatorial Appleton anomaly dynamics. The specific effects on the ionosphere due to changes in the thermospheric neutral winds and the electromagnetic plasma drifts can be investigated using different wind and drift models, including the important longitudinal effects associated with magnetic declination dependence and latitudinal separation between geographic and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>equators.</b> The model runs in a normal personal computer (PC) and generates color maps illustrating the typical behavior of the low-latitude ionosphere for a given longitudinal region, for different seasons, geophysical conditions and solar activity, at each instant of time, showing the time evolution of the low-latitude ionosphere, between about 20 ° north and south of the magnetic equator.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this short}} letter, we recall the {{differences}} between the Counter electrojet (CEJ), which is a phenomenon observed on the magnetically quiet days and the disturbance dynamo (Ddyn), which can be observed during and after a geomagnetic storm. The CEJ is well-known to occur near the <b>geomagnetic</b> dip <b>equator.</b> It can be identified by a reversal in the horizontal component (H) of the geomagnetic field daily regular variations. In contrasts to equatorial electrojet (EEJ) that flows eastward in the daytime the CEJ in considered to flow westward. The magnetic signatures of the reversed solar quiet (Sq) current at the low latitude during magnetic storms are due to the Ddyn. This disturbance (Ddyn) is produced by current systems that are driven by thermospheric storm winds originating from the Joule heating of enhanced high latitude currents. The DP 2 is the magnetic effect of current systems at high latitudes. These currents are associated with the coupling of magnetosphere and ionosphere through geomagnetic field lines. They are associated to the magnetospheric convection. During intense magnetic storms these high latitude currents are enhanced and their magnetic effects can extend toward the low latitudes This work shows that the study of magnetic perturbations makes it possible to understand the disturbances of the ionospheric electric currents. The use of an efficient treatment of the magnetic signals makes it possible to separate the magnetic effects of the different perturbations PPEF and DDEF. This was performed in the paper Nava et al.

5000|$|At heights between about 85 and 200 km however -the dynamo region-, solar X- {{and extreme}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation (XUV) is almost completely absorbed generating the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers. Here, the electrons are already {{bound to the}} geomagnetic field gyrating several times about these lines before they collide with the neutrals, while the positive ions still essentially move with the neutral gas. Thus, the electric conductivity becomes anisotropic. The conductivity parallel to an electric field E is called Pedersen conductivity. The conductivity orthogonal to E and the geomagnetic field Bo [...] is the Hall conductivity. Ohmic losses and thus Joule heating occur when Pedersen currents flow. The component parallel to Bo [...] still increases with altitude. Near the <b>geomagnetic</b> dip <b>equator,</b> a west-east directed electric field generates vertical Hall currents which cannot close. Therefore, a vertical polarization field builds up generating a horizontal Hall current which adds to the Pedersen current. Such enhancement is described by the Cowling conductivity. Pedersen and Hall conductivities reach maximum values near 120 to 140 km altitudes with numbers of about 1 mS/m during sunlit conditions. During the night, these numbers may decrease by a facor of ten or more. The values of these conductivities depend on local time, latitude, season and solar 11- year cycle. The height integrated conductivities become {{of the order of}} 50 S, or a total resistance of the dynamo region of about 1/50 = 0.02 Ohm during daytime conditions.|$|R
30|$|We have {{analyzed}} the Sq current system {{in terms of}} the Sq foci track variability with respect to longitude, day, season, and solar activity.

The computed Sq tracks seem to neither follow the geographic nor the <b>geomagnetic</b> or dip <b>equators.</b> We observe a pronounced scattering of the tracks over the SAA. Remarkably, the scattering appears to be very robust, irrespective of the dataset used. This systematic scattering manifests as a large shift of the southern hemisphere focus northwards during northern summer and southwards during the southern solstice. The shift of the southern Sq focus tracks with respect to the seasons is clearly evident. The physical mechanism of this systematic effect remains unclear. The longitudinal variations of the Sq foci are believed to have their origin from an influence of non-migrating tides as reported in recent studies and the anomalous weak amplitude of the geomagnetic main field over the SAA.|$|R

30|$|The {{observed}} NmF 2 at Chiang Mai {{are higher}} than that at Chumphon during the daytime which {{can be explained by}} the Equatorial Anomaly (Anderson, 1973). The equatorial and low-latitude regions show some unique behavior when compared with middle and high latitudes. The vertical electromagnetic drift is enhanced and the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) is intensified resulting in variations in the F-layer at equatorial and low-latitudes as follows: the F-layer is lifted up at the magnetic equator but the peak density decreases, however, the F-layer peak density increases at the crest of the anomaly (located at approximately 15 ° north and south of the magnetic latitude, moderated by the meridional wind from the magnetic equator to the crests of the anomaly). While Chumphon is close to the magnetic <b>equator</b> (<b>Geomagnetic</b> dip latitude + 3.0 °N), Chiang Mai is located at the northern anomaly crest (Geomagnetic dip latitude + 12.7 °N), causing higher NmF 2 median values at Chiang Mai. The location of both stations in relation to the Equatorial Anomaly explains the differences in electron density between the two stations.|$|R

During the International Equatorial Electrojet Year (IEEY) various experiments were performed along 5 ° W in West Africa from 1992 to 1995. Among other instruments, 10 stations equipped with magnetometers and telluric electric field lines operated along a meridian chain across the <b>geomagnetic</b> dip <b>equator</b> from November 1992 to December 1994. In the present work, the induced effects of space-weather-related geomagnetic disturbances in the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) influence area in West Africa were examined. For that purpose, variations in the north–south (E x) and east–west (E y) components of telluric electric field were analyzed, along {{with that of the}} three components (H,[*] D and Z) of the geomagnetic field during the geomagnetic storm of 17 February 1993 and the solar flare observed on 4 April 1993. The most important induction effects during these events are associated with brisk impulses like storm sudden commencement (ssc) and solar flare effect (sfe) in the geomagnetic field variations. For the moderate geomagnetic storm that occurred on 17 February 1993, with a minimum Dst index of − 110  nT, the geo-electric field responses to the impulse around 11 : 00  LT at LAM are E x[*] =[*]  520  mV km − 1 and E y [*]=[*]  400  mV km − 1. The geo-electric field responses to the sfe that occurred around 14 : 30  LT on 4 April 1993 are clearly observed at different stations as well. At LAM the crest-to-crest amplitude of the geo-electric field components associated with the sfe are E x [*]=[*]  550  mV km − 1 and E y [*]=[*]  340  mV km − 1. Note that the sfe impact on the geo-electric field variations decreases with the increasing distance of the stations from the subsolar point, which is located at about 5. 13 ° N on 4 April. This trend does not reflect the sfe increasing amplitude near the dip equator due the high Cowling conductivity in the EEJ belt...|$|R
