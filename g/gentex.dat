5000|$|<b>Gentex</b> {{was founded}} in 1974 by Fred Bauer as a {{manufacturer}} of fire protection products. [...] The company created the first dual-sensor photoelectric smoke detector, considered to be less prone to false alarms, while still quickly detecting smoldering fires. In the early 1990s, <b>Gentex</b> introduced a smoke detector equipped with a strobe light designed to alert the deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Today, <b>Gentex</b> manufactures a complete line of photoelectric detectors for fire alarm systems, standalone, and interconnect systems. <b>Gentex</b> also manufactures its Commander series horn/strobes, along with other notification appliances including speaker/strobes, mini-horns, bells, and weatherproof devices.|$|E

5000|$|... 2010: Lumus' {{technology}} received {{high level}} validation when the US Air Force selected <b>Gentex's</b> Scorpion Helmet Mounted Cueing System (which employs the Lumus PD-14), with Raytheon {{as the primary}} contractor, for the HMIT program for A-10 and F-16 Aircraft. This display and contract win {{marked the first time}} a full color HMD was selected for combat aviation. Subsequently, Lumus' display as part of Thales Visionix's (formerly Gentex)Helmet Mounted Cueing System has been selected for the CHMDS / Air Soldier program. Once the roll out was completed on this program, Lumus displays represented the majority of HMDs deployed in the worldwide combat aviation market.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, the Israeli company Lumus {{was founded}} by Dr. Yaakov Amitai to develop and market its Light-guide Optical Element (LOE) {{technology}} for eyewear displays (see-through wearable displays). The LOE is a patented optical waveguide that makes use of multiple partial reflectors embedded in a single substrate to reflect a virtual image into {{the eye of the}} wearer. Specifically, the image is coupled into the LOE by a [...] "Pod" [...] (micro-display projector) that sits {{at the edge of the}} waveguideâ€”in an eyeglass configuration, this is embedded in the temple of the glasses. The image travels through total internal reflection to the multiple array of partial reflectors and are reflected to the eye. While each partial reflector shows only a portion of the image,the optics are such that the wearer sees the combined array and perceives it as a single uniform image projected at infinity.The transparent display enables a virtual image to be seamlessly overlaid over the wearer's real world view. This is especially true when the source image comprises a black background with light color wording or symbology being displayed. Black is essentially see-through color, while lighter colored objects, symbols or characters appear to float in the wearer's line of sight. Conversely, full-screen images like documents, internet pages, movies which are typically brighter colors can be displayed to look like a large virtual image floating a few meter's away from the wearer.After years of R&D and building its patent portfolio, the company started officially selling product in 2008 with the PD-18: a top-down, transparent monocular display with SVGA resolution 32 degree FoV, and full color. The PD-18 and its derivative, the PD-14, were aimed at professional and military markets. In 2010 Lumus' technology received high-level validation when the US Air Force selected <b>Gentex's</b> Scorpion Helmet Mounted Cueing System (which employs the Lumus PD-14), with Raytheon as the primary contractor, for the HMIT program for A-10 and F-16 Aircraft. This display and contract win marked the first time a full-color HMD was selected for combat aviation.Subsequently, Lumus' display as part of Thales Visionix's (formerly Gentex)Helmet Mounted Cueing System has been selected for the CHMDS / Air Soldier program. Once the roll out has been completed on this program, Lumus displays will represent the majority of HMDs deployed in the worldwide combat aviation market.|$|R
