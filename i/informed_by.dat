Patients providing <b>informed</b> consent <b>by</b> themselves were compared with patients enrolled by proxy consent. Baseline clinical measures were compared between groups.

Other sources assert that a warning was conveyed by Croatian security and intelligence system services, indicating the Soviet Union and its then-president Mikhail Gorbachev as the source of the information. At midnight during the night of the 67 October, the Soviet ambassador to Belgrade was reported to have received government instructions to warn the Yugoslav military against attacking Zagreb.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{perceptions}} of information and communications technology (ICT) held by four preservice teachers as they engage in their first field-based practicum. Perceptions result from interactions between the participants? educational beliefs about ICT and their field-based experiences with it. The research was conducted using qualitative research techniques derived from narrative and collective case study methodology. Questionnaires completed prior to the practicum, journal entries created during the practicum, and open-ended interviews conducted immediately after the practicum, provide contextualized biographical and narrative data. Within-case {{analysis of the data}} resulted in the production of four individual case vignettes that reveal the significant experiences and prevailing beliefs of each participant. The narrative accounts render the participants? perceptions available and comprehensible to the reader. A cross-case analysis explores themes that hold across the four cases. It indicates that preservice teachers conceive ICT in terms of its perceived educational value and their perceived capacity to use it. These findings, it is suggested, can enlighten initial teacher education programs <b>by</b> <b>informing</b> theory, <b>by</b> <b>informing</b> practice, and <b>by</b> <b>informing</b> future research...|$|R

John Lennon was <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> his Aunt Harriet of her existence in 1964. John was so overcome by emotion, wanting to find his sister, that he placed an ad in the paper, and hired detectives to look for her.

He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E

However, Lisa is not fooled by his supposed genius and still believes Bart to be a moron; Skinner shares her belief, but takes advantage of Bart's departure from the school.|$|E
50|$|Another {{contribution}} of agenda-setting {{is to show}} the power of media. Since the study of 1940 presidential election in Erie County, Ohio, by Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues, little evidence of mass communication effects was found over the next twenty years. In 1960, Joseph Klapper's Effects of Mass Communication also declared the limited effect of media.

He feared they were Spartans but was <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E

Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E
