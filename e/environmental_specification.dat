40|$|Background of this Practice The {{development}} of California’s first building-related <b>environmental</b> <b>specification</b> started in early 2000, when the Department of General Services ’ (DGS’s) Procurement Division {{was in the}} process of issuing a request for bids for a three-year, $ 60 million open office systems furniture contract.

This specification was issued in December 2000, and included testing and selection criteria for indoor air quality as well as requirements for recycled contents and lighting.

40|$|International audienceWireless sensor {{networks}} are increasingly {{used in many}} emerging applications. This type of network is composed of hundreds of low-cost sensor nodes, but with a limited budget batteries, low communication range, limitedthroughput, reduced computing power, low memory and low storage capacity. Communication protocols are proposed in the literature to deal with technical challenges coming from low intrinsic resources of sensor nodes. In most of these studies, simulations comparing a proposed protocol with other existing protocols are performed {{to show that the}} proposed protocol provides overall better performance. However, the <b>environmental</b> <b>specification</b> that made these comparisons is very often neglected or non-existent. In this study we show that it is essential to have the simulation environment very well defined before considering whether a protocol provides better performance than others. To do this we use two duty cycle MAC protocols, the standard IEEE 802. 15. 4 and SlackMAC (a protocolthat we proposed). The aim of the paper is not to make an exhaustive comparison of protocols. We intuitively know that SlackMAC provides a better overall performance than the standard. What we are trying to show is the gap between performances according to simulation conditions. We will mainly focus on the topologies used and the capture effect. The results draw {{attention to the fact that}} it is essential to clearly define the simulation environment and also to reconcile the chosen conditions with the results when comparing the performances of two protocols...|$|E
40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. As {{its basic}} point of {{departure}} this thesis has a "neuro-epistemological" concern in that it aims to analyse the epistemological status of paradigms for modelling the organisation of brain processes and function. By rooting itself in a post-modernist frame of reference it aims to provide a contextually-driven meta-analysis of theories of brain function. This includes {{an analysis of the}} assumptive frameworks underlying both the current orthodoxy (the Computational Theory of Mind) and its polar opposite in ontological terms (the Microgenetic Theory). The latter theory is seen as being "subjugated" in the post-modernist sense via the implicit power relations held and practised through the hegemonic entrenchment of the former dominant discourse. An overview of the work of Maturana and Varela is then presented as a theory that has positioned itself as a Via Media between the two radically opposed ontologies. This Via Media is then critiqued from several angles in a way that lays the groundwork for a model of neural organization and function that is consistent with recent trends in the neurosciences as well as in cybernetics and that is offered as a candidate for a more useful Via Media. The general format of this new "Deconstructive Carving Model", which is applied at the levels of neurodevelopmental process, visual perception and consciousness is as follows: In the domain of explanation there is construed to occur a carving out of a form from a pre-given, featureless medium in a general direction from diffuse and amorphous to specific. This process, involving various active mechanisms, is constrained, guided or restrained (rather than informed) by local and global, internal and external contextual modulatory (rather than instructive) influences. It occurs in an iterative, dynamic manner that is systematic (rather than arbitrary) and is activity-dependent (rather than passive), utilizing both spatial and temporal mechanisms. Given the proposed nature of the nervous system as partially closed, the outcome of this interaction is seen as being state-dependent in that the very structure of the system (as partially open to <b>environmental</b> <b>specification)</b> will select what in the medium will serve as a perturbation and what it will allow as a con straining influence. Finally, a stable anchor for these multi-level processes is postulated in the form of relatively invariant peripheral body and body-image representational constraints...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} {{was to develop a}} conceptual model for information systems design based on a qualitative analysis of the fighter pilot 2 ̆ 7 s environment. The model was derived from the fighter pilot 2 ̆ 7 s conceptions and perceptions of his informational environment. The resultant model and the corresponding <b>environmental</b> <b>specification</b> can serve as the conceptual cornerstones for further development by providing the designers a common conceptual focal point for further information system design. The model used for overall information systems design was the Rolland 2 ̆ 6 Cauvet development model. This model identifies two independent development domains: requirements engineering and design engineering. This dissertation represents the requirements engineering work. The approach selected in developing the requirements engineering aspect was Checkland 2 ̆ 7 s Soft Systems approach. Checkland 2 ̆ 7 s approach was suited to this project due to its model building orientation and its ability to handle the complexity and flexibility dictated by real-world human activity. The cognitive model, recommendations, hypotheses, and conclusions serve as an important step toward development of the fighter pilot 2 ̆ 7 s ground-based information system. There had been very little research, however, that addressed the cognitive structure and processes pilots use to develop memory frames necessary for airborne situational awareness. The goal of this project was to develop the first stage of a process leading to an inquiry system that will be used to augment the pilot 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry and conceptual structure building to capture the inherent complexity of this multidimensional environment, the researcher observed fighter pilots in their natural environment utilizing the multiple-site case study methodology supplemented by other qualitative data sources. The researcher utilized these data to develop the conceptual model. In addition, findings were derived, recommendations were generated and hypotheses were extracted using the Checkland model as a guide. The Glaser and Struass Constant Comparative Method was used for data analysis. The researcher identified the information environment as having two distinctly different components: structure and process. Seven versions of the model were presented in this iterative development effort. The dissertation is concluded with a series of recommendations, implications and conclusions that serve as the link between the conceptual model and the future work on the information system that will be completed by design engineers...|$|E

40|$|The {{mantra of}} 'Faster, Better, Cheaper' has {{to a large}} degree been {{interpreted}} as using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) components and/or circuit boards. One of the first space applications to actually use COTS in space along with radiation performance requirements was the Expedite the Processing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack program, for the International Space Station (ISS). In order to meet the performance, cost and schedule targets, military grade Versa Module Eurocard (VME) was selected as the baseline design for the main computer, the Rack Interface Controller (RIC). VME was chosen as the computer backplane because of the large variety of military grade boards available, which were designed to meet the military <b>environmental</b> <b>specifications</b> (thermal, shock, vibration, etc.). These boards also have a paper pedigree in regards to components. Since these boards exceeded most ISS environmental requirements, it was reasoned using COTS mid-grade VME boards, as opposed to designing custom boards could save significant time and money.
