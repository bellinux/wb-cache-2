5|$|Captive whales have {{occasionally}} {{been known}} to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire {{on behalf of the}} whales to communicate with humans, as whales <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort.|$|E
5|$|Elvish {{greetings}} can {{be expressed}} both by voice and by hand, and often involve {{a combination of the}} two. Elvish greetings are often, but not always, used just prior to a conversation.

5|$|The pygmy {{right whale}} shares several {{characteristics}} with the right whales, although having dorsal fins separates them from right whales, and they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> distinctive jaw configuration.

5|$|There are two {{varieties}} of the two-colored bolete: borealis and subreticulatus. Both varieties <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> similar habitat {{to that of}} the main species, except they appear to be limited to just the North American continent. Both varieties also have a slightly different coloration than that of the two-colored bolete, have deeper pores, and are not as often eaten or used in regional recipes.|$|E
5|$|A {{neutron star}} {{is a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|American Sign Language {{is growing}} in {{popularity}} among many states. Many people {{in high school and}} colleges wanting to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.|$|E
5|$|Bennett and Crow founded Exploring the Arts, a {{charitable}} {{organization dedicated to}} creating, promoting, and supporting arts education. At {{the same time they}} founded (and named after Bennett's friend) the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Queens, a public high school dedicated to teaching the performing arts, which opened in 2001 and would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high graduation rate. On June 21, 2007, Bennett married Crow in a private civil ceremony in New York that was witnessed by former Governor Mario Cuomo.|$|E
5|$|Carbonaceous asteroids, {{as their}} name suggests, are carbon-rich. They {{dominate}} the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% {{of the visible}} asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.|$|E

5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} {{the look of}} the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Cultivars of Hippeastrum {{are popular}} indoor {{ornamental}} plants prized for their large brightly colored flowers (including red, pink, salmon, orange and white). As such they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important {{place in the}} floriculture trade for sale as cut flowers or potted plants. Although the market {{is dominated by the}} Netherlands, and South Africa, other areas of production include Israel, Japan and the United States (Florida). Brazil also produces 17 million Hippeastrum bulbs annually.|$|E
5|$|Currently, curium is {{not used}} as a nuclear fuel owing to its low {{availability}} and high price. 245Cm and 247Cm <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small critical mass and therefore {{could be used in}} portable nuclear weapons, but none have been reported thus far. Curium-243 is not suitable for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat. Curium-247 would be highly suitable, having a half-life 647 times that of plutonium-239.|$|E

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high star density, {{and therefore}} close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, {{are much more}} common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of}} an encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, the {{disconnect}} with local production {{has had an}} adverse effect on quality; for example, in the 1990s, some of the dried porcino mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus Tylopilus, which are rather similar in appearance, and when dried, are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from Boletus. Tylopilus species typically <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> bitter taste, a bitterness that is imparted to the flavour of the porcini {{with which they are}} mixed.|$|E
5|$|Living chelicerates {{have both}} {{compound}} eyes (only in horseshoe crabs, as the compound {{eye in the}} other clades {{has been reduced to}} a cluster of no more than five pairs of ocelli), mounted {{on the sides of the}} head, plus pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), mounted in the middle. These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At the other extreme, jumping spiders <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> wide field of vision, and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV-light.|$|E
