5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the man he was looking for. In Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon {{and said that he}} had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street {{whether or not they were}} headed for heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians as a result of his evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{believed}} that to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of a particular fairy could summon it to you and force it to do your bidding.

25|$|South of Black Fell is Tarn Hows, {{a picturesque}} work of {{landscape}} design initiated by James Marshall in the 1860s. This {{is one of}} the most popular destinations in the Lake District, the mixture of water, rock and arboretum being finely contrived. Now owned by the National Trust, the motor traffic is so great that a one-way system had to be initiated as early as the 1960s. Tarn Hows is maintained by a dam at the south west corner and circumnavigated by a broad, level path, providing access to all.

In the second half of his career he never made an effort which did not pay off 100 per cent. He reduced a race to a few simple calculations, a few danger men and a few places where it was necessary to make an effort.

500|$|The {{scabrous}} lyrics—"God {{save the}} Queen/She ain't no human being/There is no future/In England's dreaming"—prompted widespread outcry. Several major chains refused to stock the single. It was banned {{not only by}} the BBC but also by every independent radio station, making it the [...] "most heavily censored record in British history". That week, there was no number 1 hit in Britain, according to Lydon, et al. in The Filth and The Fury; the top spot was empty, because so many radio stations, the BBC, and individuals protested the song's content. Rotten boasted, [...] "We're the only honest band that's hit this planet in about two thousand million years." [...] Jones shrugged off everything the song stated and implied—or took nihilism to a logical endpoint: [...] "I don't see how anyone could describe us as a political band. I don't even <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the Prime Minister." [...] The song, and its public impact, are now recognised as [...] "punk's crowning glory".|$|E
500|$|In {{the three}} months {{since the end of}} [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", the Doctor, Amy, Rory and River Song have been {{attempting}} to track the Silence, an alien race who cannot be remembered after they are encountered. Ex-FBI agent Canton Delaware, under the ruse of capturing them as criminals, helps to reunite the group inside a special prison at Area 51 containing the TARDIS. Though they do not yet <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> or motive for the aliens, the Doctor's allies have discovered they exist across the entire planet, and have the ability to place post-hypnotic suggestions in humans they encounter. The Doctor plants a communication device called a nanorecorder in each of the group's hands to record audio of meetings with the Silence. As they travel to Kennedy Space Center shortly before the launch of Apollo 11, Amy tells the Doctor she was mistaken and is not pregnant as she previously had claimed.|$|E
500|$|Marc-Antoine Audette {{said that}} it took the duo {{about four or five}} days of calls to Palin's staff to finally {{be able to talk to}} her. They claimed that they started by talking to {{low-level}} people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a [...] "mission impossible". He claimed that [...] "after about a dozen calls", the duo [...] "started to realize it [...] might work, because her [...] staff didn't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the French President. They asked us to spell it." [...] Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls needed to talk to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel {{said that it}} took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.|$|E

500|$|When I {{was working}} on Season 1 of Adventure Time (2009? 2008?) we had to write a montage song for the episode [...] "Evicted!" [...] while Finn and Jake {{are looking for a}} new house.

500|$|Asteroids was {{conceived}} by Lyle Rains and programmed by Ed Logg with collaborations from other Atari staff. Logg {{was impressed with}} the Atari 2600 (then known as [...] "Atari Video Computer System") and joined Atari's coin-op division and worked on Dirt Bike, which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test. He developed Super Breakout after hearing that Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, wanted Breakout updated. Paul Mancuso joined the development team as Asteroids technician and engineer Howard Delman contributed to the hardware. During a meeting in April 1979, Rains discussed Planet Grab, a multiplayer arcade game later renamed to Cosmos. Logg did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the game, thinking Computer Space as [...] "the inspiration for the two-dimensional approach". Rains conceived of Asteroids as a mixture of Computer Space and Space Invaders, combining the two-dimensional approach of Computer Space with Space Invaders addictive gameplay of [...] "completion" [...] and [...] "eliminate all threats". The unfinished game featured a giant, indestructible asteroid, so Rains asked Logg: [...] "Well, why don’t we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up?" [...] In response, Logg described a similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces. Both agreed on the concept.|$|E
500|$|Phips sailed {{from the}} Downs on 12 September 1686, and on 28 November arrived in Hispaniola, Samana Bay, where they {{spent two weeks}} {{restocking}} their water and provender. The weather was bad, and the search consequently did not get under way {{for a few more}} weeks. January 12, Phips sent out Captain Rogers in the smaller Henry of London along with three Native American divers (Jonas Abimeleck and John Pasqua, name of other diver not listed) to search what was then called the Ambrosia Bank (now the Silver Bank). There was a bit more delay from weather but Peter Earle writes, [...] "There is no doubt that he knew exactly where he was going." [...] January 20, they spotted cannons from a shipwreck lying on the white sands of the reef. The ship they had found was the Almiranta of the Spanish silver fleet (later determined to be Nuestra Señora de la Concepción; the English did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the ship) wrecked in 1641. Over the next two days, the divers were able to bring up 3,000 coins and 3 silver bars. They decided to travel back to Phips' to let him know but {{this turned out to be}} a somewhat slow and treacherous trip among the reefs.|$|E
