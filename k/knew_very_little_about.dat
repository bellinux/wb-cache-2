5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> whales {{over the course of}} history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about.</b> He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Siegel, an {{attorney}} from Florida, {{learned of the}} case and felt that a hearing should be held about Eve's welfare. In January 2003, he initiated legal proceedings, seeking to bring the clone's parents to court so its health could be verified. Raël and Boisselier attacked the filing as an attempt to take a child from loving parents and announced that, in protest, they would not provide DNA for testing. An arraignment occurred on January 24 and was televised live on CNN; Boisselier and Clonaid's vice president, Thomas Kaenzig, were subpoenaed in lieu of the child's parents. In courtroom testimony, the vice president of Clonaid said he <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> the clone, and that Boisselier controlled all the information. She did not attend the hearing, and Kaenzig provided little information, angering the judge, who threatened contempt of court charges. Boisselier attended a second hearing on January 29, telling the court that the child was in Israel. The judge then ruled that the court had no jurisdiction. In late January, the science editor announced that he suspected the cloning announcements were a hoax. Around that time, Boisselier held a press conference at which she announced that the cloned baby's parents had cut off contact with her and would never speak to the press.|$|E

25|$|Rowell {{was born}} in Portland, Maine, on May 10, 1959. Her {{biological}} mother, Dorothy Rowell, was of English descent and a Mayflower descendant, and her birth father, whose surname was Wilson, was of African-American descent. Rowell <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> her father. Dorothy, who suffered from schizophrenia, took a taxi to a hospital {{to give birth to}} Rowell, leaving a son and two small daughters unsupervised. When she was 16 days old, Rowell, along with her two sisters, Sheree and Lori, was surrendered to child services.|$|E
25|$|Women Against Pornography's best-known tactic was {{a guided}} tour of the {{pornography}} and prostitution outlets in Times Square, which they led twice a week for a suggested contribution of $5.00. (In San Francisco, WAVPM had conducted similar tours in the red-light districts of that city.) Lynn Campbell suggested that people who did not consume pornography <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> the content of the pornography or the atmosphere in sex shops and live sex shows, and that actual guided tours of the sex industry in Times Square would provide an excellent educational tool. Susan Brownmiller planned an itinerary for the tour and wrote a script for the guides (with the help of information supplied by Carl Weisbrod, a police officer tasked with finding and closing down underground brothels in Midtown, and Maggie Smith, the owner of a neighborhood bar). The tours often involved unplanned encounters—being physically thrown out by enraged store managers, watching businessmen try to hide from the tourists, or talking briefly with nude performers while they took their breaks. After a reporter for The New York Times took one of the first tours and wrote a feature article for the Style section, WAP received coverage in People, Time, The Philadelphia Inquirer, European newspapers, local TV news programs and talk shows in New York City, and The Phil Donahue Show in Chicago.|$|E

500|$|A bid of £1m {{offered by}} Damien Hirst {{for the entire}} {{collection}} had apparently been rejected by the auctioneers, and the owners sued Bonhams, arguing that this offer should have been accepted. Shortly after the auction, Hirst wrote to The Guardian citing some of Potter's limitations as a taxidermist, saying [...] "You can see he <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> anatomy and musculature, {{because some of the}} taxidermy is terrible—there's a kingfisher that looks nothing like a kingfisher" [...] He also showed appreciation for the displays: [...] "My own favourites are these tableaux: there's a kittens' wedding party, with all these kittens dressed up in costumes, even wearing jewellery. The kittens don't look much like kittens, but that's not the point. There's a rats' drinking party, too which puts a different construction on Wind in the Willows. And a group of hamsters playing cricket." [...] About the auction, Hirst said, [...] "I've offered £1m and to pay for the cost of the auctioneer's catalogue – just for them to take it off the market and keep the collection intact – but apparently, the auction has to go ahead. It is a tragedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooper's only film {{appearance}} in 1942 was also his last under his Goldwyn contract. In Sam Wood's biographical film The Pride of the Yankees, Cooper portrays baseball star Lou Gehrig who established a record with the New York Yankees for playing in 2,130 consecutive games. Cooper {{was reluctant to}} play the seven-time All-Star, who only died the previous year from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) —now commonly called [...] "Lou Gehrig's disease". Beyond the challenges of effectively portraying such a popular and nationally recognized figure, Cooper <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> baseball and was not left-handed like Gehrig. After Gehrig's widow visited the actor and expressed her desire that he portray her husband, Cooper accepted the role that covered a twenty-year span of Gehrig's life—his early love of baseball, his rise to greatness, his loving marriage, and his struggle with illness, culminating in his farewell speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939 before 62,000 fans. Cooper quickly learned the physical movements of a baseball player and developed a fluid, believable swing. The handedness issue was solved by reversing the print for certain batting scenes. The film {{was one of the}} year's top ten pictures and received eleven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Cooper's third).|$|E

500|$|Countering these Japanese {{tactical}} advantages, the Allies {{enjoyed the}} strategic advantage of possessing superior intelligence about Japanese plans. The Japanese <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> Allied forces at Milne Bay, while the Allies received advance {{warning that the}} Japanese were planning an invasion. In mid-July codebreakers {{under the command of}} Commander Eric Nave informed MacArthur that toward the end of August the Japanese planned to attack Milne Bay. [...] They provided detailed information about the numbers of soldiers to expect, which units would be involved, their standard of training, and the names of the ships that the Japanese had allocated to the operation. MacArthur's Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Brigadier General Charles A. Willoughby, had anticipated a Japanese reaction against Milne Force, and interpreted the Japanese reconnaissance on 4 August as foreshadowing an operation. After Allied Naval Forces Ultra decrypted a message that disclosed that a Japanese submarine picquet line had been established to cover the approaches to Milne Bay, Willoughby predicted that an attack was imminent. In response, MacArthur rushed the 18th Infantry Brigade to Milne Bay. Major General George Kenney, the commander of the Allied Air Forces, ordered air patrols stepped up over the likely Japanese invasion routes. He also ordered pre-emptive air strikes against the Japanese airfields at Buna on 24 and 25 August, which reduced the number of Japanese fighters available to support the attack on Milne Bay to just six.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{relationship}} between early Christianity and Mithraism {{is based on a}} remark in the 2nd-century Christian writer Justin Martyr, who accused the Mithraists of diabolically imitating the Christian communion rite. Based upon this statement, Ernest Renan in 1882 set forth a vivid depiction of two rival religions: [...] "if the growth of Christianity had been arrested by some mortal malady, the world would have been Mithraic." [...] Scholar Edwin M. Yamauchi criticized Renan's inference, which he claimed, [...] "published nearly 150 years ago, has no value as a source. He [...] <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> Mithraism." ...|$|E

While he was familiar with Marx's early works, he had not read Capital when he wrote his own most important Marxist texts. Additionally, Althusser had [...] "contrived to impress his first teacher, the Catholic theologian Jean Guitton, with a paper whose guiding principles he had simply filched from Guitton's own corrections of a fellow student's essay," [...] and [...] "he concocted fake quotations in the thesis he wrote for another major contemporary philosopher, Gaston Bachelard." ...|$|E

2500|$|Finally, in 1998, Kokusai Green found a buyer. Although Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson {{was thought}} to be the frontrunner, the buyer turned out to be {{insurance}} tycoon and motivational speaker Art Williams, who previously owned the Birmingham Barracudas of the Canadian Football League (CFL). The team was $102million in debt at the time the sale closed. Williams <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> hockey, but was very visible and outspoken, and immediately pumped an additional $6million into the team's payroll. [...] He also cleared most of the debt from the Kokusai Green era. After taking control, Williams publicly assured the Espositos that their jobs were safe, only to fire them two games into the 1998–99 season. He then gave Demers complete control of hockey operations as both coach and general manager. The Lightning drafted Vincent Lecavalier in 1998, a player who would be a cornerstone of the team for years to come.|$|E
2500|$|The {{journalist}} Alexander McKee {{cast doubt}} on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in the 1953 USAF report, pointing out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of the city and were not in fact targeted during the raid. The [...] "hutted camps" [...] mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were camps for refugees. It is also stated that the important Autobahn bridge {{to the west of the}} city was not targeted or attacked, and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor any bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River. Commenting on this, McKee says: [...] "The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped". McKee further asserts [...] "The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure." ...|$|E

2500|$|French Canada {{aimed at}} {{encouraging}} {{the development of}} a sense of national pride and unity among Canadians during the years of World War II. Ryerson put forth a socio-economic analysis of the Quebec and in turn educated most English-speaking Canadians about a region they <b>knew</b> <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>about.</b> As a sequel to 1837, Ryerson's French Canada revealed [...] "the militant spirit of democracy among French Canadians" [...] in the hopes of uniting [...] "them with their Anglophone compatriots." [...] Ryerson did follow a certain [...] "great man" [...] approach to history when, in the early chapters, he emphasized the heroes [...] "who struggled for self-determination and/or Canadian unity"; this approach was complemented by an emphasis on [...] "the Quebec masses and their rise out of feudal subjugation toward political power." [...] Very much the Historical Materialist, Ryerson viewed the previous administrations of Quebec as working with representatives of English Canada and international capitalism to keep Quebec in economic subservience. Ryerson believed, [...] "The Toronto Tory and the Quebec corporatist meet on common ground: hostility to the democratic peoples' movement, [...] denial of our democratic heritage." [...] Following on his contentions laid out in 1837, Ryerson viewed the failure of English Canada to recognise their connection to French Canada and to fight hand in hand for the fullest democratic rights of the minority nation only served to deepen the power of reactionary influences and limit Canadian democracy and unity in general.|$|E
