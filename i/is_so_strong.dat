5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that not even light can escape.|$|E

Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E
5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes {{may contribute to the}} relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E

5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also {{an effect on the}} final shape.|$|E
5|$|Many seabirds show {{remarkable}} site fidelity, {{returning to}} the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour. This increases breeding success, provides a place for returning mates to reunite, and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site. Young adults breeding {{for the first time}} usually return to their natal colony, and often nest close to where they hatched. This tendency, known as philopatry, <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that a study of Laysan albatrosses found that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22m; another study, this time on Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica, found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony bred in the burrow they were raised in, and two actually bred with their own mother.|$|E
5|$|Two years {{pass and}} couple have their first child. Their family {{physician}} offers {{to perform an}} operation to restore May's sight. Despite Frank's worries that his wife will not love him if she should see his scarred face, Frank consents to the operation. The operation is a success and the doctor warns May not to remove the bandages as she will lose her sight again. May's desire to see her child <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that she removes the bandages and gazes upon her child. Upon trying to gaze upon her husband, who is standing in strong light, May is permanently blinded. The film concludes with May being content with her blindness and knowing that her baby is as beautiful.|$|E

5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} San Bruno Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. This weather pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the role}} of inter-domain {{interactions}} in protein folding and in energetics of stabilisation of the native structure, probably differs for each protein. In T4 lysozyme, the influence of one domain on the other <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that the entire molecule is resistant to proteolytic cleavage. In this case, folding is a sequential process where the C-terminal domain is required to fold independently in an early step, and the other domain requires {{the presence of the}} folded C-terminal domain for folding and stabilisation.|$|E

25|$|Police officers, soldiers, or militiamen {{have been}} implicated {{in most of the}} hundred or so murders of journalists since {{democracy}} was restored in 1986. Employed by corrupt politicians or hired as contract killers, they usually target local radio presenters who have upset the people they are working for. The same modus operandi is nearly always used: two masked men on a motorcycle gun the journalist down as he is leaving his place of work. For a few thousand dollars, they eliminate the person who has been too outspoken.

25|$|In general relativity, a {{black hole}} {{is defined as a}} region of spacetime in which the {{gravitational}} field <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> that no particle or radiation can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, black holes are thought to arise when massive stars undergo gravitational collapse, and many galaxies are thought to contain supermassive black holes at their centers. Black holes are also important for theoretical reasons, as they present profound challenges for theorists attempting to understand the quantum aspects of gravity. String theory has proved to be an important tool for investigating the theoretical properties of black holes because it provides a framework in which theorists can study their thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|All catfish, except {{members of}} Malapteruridae (electric catfish), possess a strong, hollow, bony leading spine-like ray on their dorsal and {{pectoral}} fins. As a defense, these spines may be locked into place {{so that they}} stick outwards, which can inflict severe wounds. In several species catfish can use these fin rays to deliver a stinging protein if the fish is irritated. This venom is produced by glandular cells in the epidermal tissue covering the spines. In {{members of the family}} Plotosidae, and of the genus Heteropneustes, this protein <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> it may hospitalize humans who are unfortunate enough to receive a sting; in Plotosus lineatus, the stings may result in death.|$|E
