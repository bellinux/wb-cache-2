25|$|In U.S. Army Air Forces use, the Norden bombsight was {{attached}} to its autopilot base, which was in turn connected with the aircraft's autopilot. The Honeywell C-1 autopilot {{could be used as}} an autopilot by the flight crew during the journey to the target area through a control panel in the cockpit, but was more commonly used under direct command of the bombardier. The Norden's box-like autopilot unit sat behind and below the sight and attached to it at a single rotating pivot. After control of the aircraft was passed to the bombardier during the bomb run, he would first rotate the entire Norden so the vertical line in the sight passed through the target. From that point on, the autopilot would attempt to guide the bomber so it followed the course of the bombsight, and pointed the heading to zero out the <b>drift</b> <b>rate,</b> fed to it through a coupling. As the aircraft turned onto the correct angle, a belt and pulley system rotated the sight back to match the changing heading. The autopilot was another reason for the Norden's accuracy, as it ensured the aircraft quickly followed the correct course and kept it on that course much more accurately than the pilots could.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to clarify the relationships between <b>drift</b> <b>rates,</b> population density, production rates, key environmental factors, and movements of adults within two populations of stream insects (a caddisfly [...] Oligophlebodes sigma and a mayfly [...] Baetis bicaudatus). Samples of benthic invertebrates (424 total) were collected every 2 8 days at four stations on Temple Fork of the Logan River, Utah, from October, 1967 to September, 1969. Samples of drift invertebrates (181 total) were collected every 14 days at three stations on Temple Fork during the same period. During summer months (June-September) a day and a night drift sample (681 total) were collected every other day. <b>Drift</b> <b>rates</b> of O. sigma larvae were greatest (5, 987 gm/year for O. sigma) when density in the benthos (256 mg/ 0. 1 m 2) and production (430 mg/ 0. 1 m 2 /year) were greatest. <b>Drift</b> <b>rates</b> were not related positively to density in the benthos over an entire year, but <b>drift</b> <b>rates</b> were correlated positively and significantly (r =. 78 and. 55 for day drift of O. sigma and B. biaaudatus, respectively) with density during the months of June-September for both O. sigma larvae and B. bicaudatus nymphs. Flow, distance below the spring source of Temple Fork, and densities of competing aquatic insects were other factors of significance in the multiple regression analyses of factors affecting <b>drift</b> <b>rates</b> of the two insects. The 17 independent variables in the multiple regression analyses accounted for 65 percent and 55 percent of the variability in day <b>drift</b> <b>rates</b> of o. sigma and B. bicaudatus, respectively. The adults of O. sigma (but not those of B. bicaudatus) undertook a definite upstream migration estimated at 2 - 3 km. This flight of adults resulted in a concentration of eggs being laid in the upper reaches of the stream. The advantage of the upstream flight may be that it stores reproductive products in areas where they are relatively safe from the effects of anchor-ice in the winter and floods in late winter and early spring...|$|R

From the observation obtained by the spectrometer of the Chinese Solar Broadband Radio Spectrometer in Huairou (SBRS/Huairou) around the flare, we find that this powerful flare has only a short-duration microwave burst of about only 5 minutes, and during the short-duration microwave burst, there are several kinds of fine structures on the spectrogram.

Artificial lights located near streams increase light levels experienced by stream invertebrates and we hypothesized light would depress night <b>drift</b> <b>rates.</b> We also hypothesized {{that the effect of}} light on <b>drift</b> <b>rates</b> would decrease over time as the invertebrates acclimated to the new light level over the course of one month’s exposure. These hypotheses were tested by placing Gammarus spp. in eight, 75 m × 1 m artificial flumes. One flume was exposed to strong (416 lx) artificial light at night. This strong light created a gradient between 4. 19 and 0. 04 lx over the neighboring six artificial flumes, while a control flume was completely covered with black plastic at night. Night-time light measurements taken in the Berlin area confirm that half the flumes were at light levels experienced by urban aquatic invertebrates. Surprisingly, no light treatment affected gammarid <b>drift</b> <b>rates.</b> In contrast, physical activity measurements of in situ individually caged G. roeseli showed they increased short-term activity levels in nights of complete darkness and decreased activity levels in brightly lit flumes.

30|$|In {{the physics}} of solar radio {{emission}}s, various emission mechanisms have been studied such as gyro-synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and plasma emissions. In the observed frequency range, plasma emissions have been mainly considered (e.g., Iwai et al., 2013). In the plasma emission theory, the frequency drift of emission features {{can be explained by}} (i) non-thermal electron beams, which are common in type III bursts (e.g., Suzuki and Dulk, 1985), or (ii) whistler-mode waves, thought to be the origin of fiber bursts (e.g., Kuijpers, 1975). Therefore, positive <b>drift</b> <b>rates</b> are interpreted as downward motions of the either emission source.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect on}} tipping from an additive periodic forcing in a canonical model with a saddle node bifurcation and a slowly varying bifurcation parameter. Here tipping refers to the dramatic change in dynamical behavior characterized by a rapid transition away from a previously attracting state. In {{the absence of the}} periodic forcing, it is well-known that a slowly varying bifurcation parameter produces a delay in this transition, beyond the bifurcation point for the static case. Using a multiple scales analysis, we {{consider the}} effect of amplitude and frequency of the periodic forcing relative to the <b>drifting</b> <b>rate</b> of the slowly varying bifurcation parameter. We show that a high frequency oscillation drives an earlier tipping when the bifurcation parameter varies more slowly, with the advance of the tipping point proportional to the square of the ratio of amplitude to frequency. In the low frequency case the position of the tipping point is affected by the frequency, amplitude and phase of the oscillation. The results are based on an analysis of the local concavity of the trajectory, used for low frequencies both of the same order as the <b>drifting</b> <b>rate</b> of the bifurcation parameter and for low frequencies larger than the <b>drifting</b> <b>rate.</b> The tipping point location is advanced with increased amplitude of the periodic forcing, with critical amplitudes where there are jumps in the location, yielding significant advances in the tipping point.
