5|$|Are You Experienced is {{the debut}} studio album by English-American rock band the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Released in 1967, the LP was an {{immediate}} critical and commercial success, and it {{is widely regarded as}} one of the greatest debuts in the history of rock music. The album features Jimi Hendrix's <b>innovative</b> <b>approach</b> to songwriting and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in psychedelic and hard rock music.|$|E
5|$|Adams wrote {{numerous}} {{letters and}} essays {{in opposition to}} the occupation, which he considered a violation of the 1689 Bill of Rights. The occupation was publicized throughout the colonies in the Journal of Occurrences, an unsigned series of newspaper articles that may have been written by Adams in collaboration with others. The Journal presented what it claimed to be a factual daily account of events in Boston during the military occupation, an <b>innovative</b> <b>approach</b> in an era without professional newspaper reporters. It depicted a Boston besieged by unruly British soldiers who assaulted men and raped women with regularity and impunity, drawing upon the traditional Anglo-American distrust of standing armies garrisoned among civilians. The Journal ceased publication on August 1, 1769, which was a day of celebration in Boston: Governor Bernard had left Massachusetts, never to return.|$|E
5|$|Despite his fervour, Saglio's {{negotiations}} with the local people were unsuccessful. Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this <b>innovative</b> <b>approach,</b> but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages. The project was eventually abandoned, and the Catholic missions house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} is to determine ways of improving the educational process in terms of physical training in a secondary comprehensive educational institution pursuant {{to the introduction of}} <b>innovative</b> <b>approaches</b> to organization of pupils’ activity. Materials and methods. The experience gained in organizing the educational process in terms of physical training demonstrates that secondary comprehensive educational institutions lack implementation of <b>innovative</b> <b>approaches</b> based on the learner-centered training. Results. The paper determines the relevant problems in the educational process improvement at physical training lessons. It reviews the theoretical aspects and conditions of implementation in the academic process of such modern <b>innovative</b> <b>approaches</b> as culturological, competency-based, synergetic, axiological, acmeological, and others, and outlines ways of implementing these approaches in the real academic process. The paper studies the consequences of the effect of the <b>innovative</b> <b>approaches</b> on ensuring the learner-centered training in the educational process. Conclusions. The implementation of the <b>innovative</b> <b>approaches</b> proves to be contributing to the increase in the level of organization of the educational process with the learner-centered approach applied. The research determines certain complications when organizing pupils’ training in secondary comprehensive educational institutions with <b>innovative</b> <b>approaches</b> implemented therein...|$|R

25|$|An $8.5 million {{state-of-the-art}} factory, {{which produces}} high grade industrial starch from cassava for export to key markets in Europe, Africa and Asia. The starch initiative created over 10,000 jobs and piloted a new <b>innovative</b> <b>approach</b> in rural industry development {{based on the}} concept of Corporate Village Enterprises. In addition, it was considered as a model in linking developing countries into the global supply chain through industrial agro-processing.

25|$|The {{wind tunnel}} used by German {{scientists}} at Peenemünde {{prior to and}} during WWII is an interesting example of the difficulties associated with extending the useful range of large wind tunnels. It used some large natural caves which were increased in size by excavation and then sealed to store large volumes of air which could then be routed through the wind tunnels. This <b>innovative</b> <b>approach</b> allowed lab research in high-speed regimes and greatly accelerated the rate of advance of Germany's aeronautical engineering efforts. By {{the end of the}} war, Germany had at least three different supersonic wind tunnels, with one capable of Mach 4.4 (heated) airflows.|$|E

Following prolonged and intensive negotiations with the Government of the Sudan and significant international pressure, the Government of the Sudan finally accepted the peacekeeping operation in Darfur.|$|E

25|$|It rapidly {{became clear}} that the Boer forces {{presented}} the British forces with a severe tactical challenge. What the Boers presented was a mobile and <b>innovative</b> <b>approach</b> to warfare, drawing on their experiences from the First Boer War. The average Boers who made up their Commandos were farmers who had spent almost all their working life in the saddle, both as farmers and hunters. They depended on the pot, horse and rifle; they were also skilled stalkers and marksmen. As hunters they had learned to fire from cover; from a prone position and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed, the game would either be long gone or could charge and potentially kill them.|$|E
25|$|By 1973, Lee {{was working}} {{extensively}} with Jennifer Hocking, {{the editor of}} Harpers & Queen, and later agreed to work with Anna Wintour, then an assistant fashion editor, on a shoot for the magazine. Impressed by her <b>innovative</b> <b>approach,</b> he soon formed a strong working relationship with her, also working on distinctive advertising shoots for clients including Coca-Cola, Guinness and American Express. Lee followed Wintour to New York City in 1975 and continued to collaborate, producing shoots for Viva (where she was now the fashion editor) for clients such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's. A success in New York {{as he had been}} in London and Paris, Lee produced a 40-page fashion supplement for The New York Times in 1976, and his work was also featured in Interview.|$|E
25|$|Next to Abney House on Church Street was Fleetwood House, used as {{the base}} for Newington Academy for Girls, {{which was founded in}} 1824 by, among others, the Quaker {{scientist}} and abolitionist William Allen and run in a most enlightened and imaginative way by Susanna Corder, who later emigrated for a while to Boston and emerged as a talented biographer. It lost exclusive use of attractive grounds {{in the eastern part of}} Abney Park on formation of the cemetery, leaving only the school house and a small garden for the private use of the students. However, they were welcome to use the new cemetery's educational arboretum and this, along with Abney Park as a whole, was rarely shared with many others in the early years of the new cemetery, except at weekends.

25|$|After {{returning}} to liberty, he mostly {{worked as a}} playwright and stage director in several Slovene language theatres in Ljubljana. During this time, {{he was among the}} first who introduced the surrealist and absurdist elements on Slovenian and Yugoslav stages. He established close contacts with the stage directors Žarko Petan and Bojan Štih who both shared some of Javoršek's modernist and progressive esthetic views. Javoršek managed to stage several plays based on the theories of Antonin Artaud and Alfred Jarry in the Drama Theatre of Ljubljana, directed by Štih. Because of this <b>innovative</b> <b>approach</b> that challenged the cultural policies of the Communist regime, Javoršek gained influence on the younger generation of Slovene artists and authors, known as the Critical generation, who departed from the prevailing humanistic and intimistic trend in Slovenian culture and literature of the time and embraced more metaphysical questions. Among those young authors were Dominik Smole, Taras Kermauner, Primož Kozak, and others. Javoršek had nevertheless a critical attitude to the younger generations and often disapproved their radical modernist approaches.|$|E
25|$|Beside the Boschetti, {{there is}} another garden, that of the Villa Belgiojoso Bonaparte. The villa, a {{commission}} which Piermarini received from Count Barbiano, was entrusted to his student Leopoldo Pollack who in 1790 designed a building {{in the style of}} a Lombard villa with a rear facade overlooking the garden while the outside facade was profoundly different. The facade on the street was much simpler: the main section together with two lateral components contained the entrance court which was separated from the street by three arches supported by Ionic Columns. The central part was decorated with a slightly projecting loggia with Doric columns supporting a cornice and a balustrade decorated with statues of pagan gods. The facade overlooking the garden, much more carefully designed over two levels, has a ground floor in bugnato ashlar while the two upper floors feature Doric columns with separate windows free of gables but with cornices of mythological bas-reliefs. Here too, there are two less-protruding lateral sections, surmounted by triangular gables with bas-reliefs representing the allegories of Il carro del Giorno and Il carro della Notte. Like his master when decorating the Scala, Pollack was assisted by Giuseppe Parini in choosing the decoration themes but the <b>innovative</b> <b>approach</b> was that the villa was to be designed in accordance with the requirements of the surrounding English garden.|$|E
500|$|The African {{slave trade}} was {{closely tied to}} the imports of war horses, and as the {{prevalence}} of slaving decreased, fewer horses were needed for raiding. [...] This significantly decreased the amount of mounted warfare seen in West Africa. By the time of the Scramble for Africa and the introduction of modern firearms in the 1880s, the use of horses in African warfare had lost most of its effectiveness. [...] Nonetheless, in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), cavalry and other mounted troops were the major combat force for the British, since the horse-mounted Boers moved too quickly for infantry to engage. [...] The Boers presented a mobile and <b>innovative</b> <b>approach</b> to warfare, drawing on strategies that had first appeared in the American Civil War. [...] The terrain was not well-suited to the British horses, resulting in the loss of over 300,000 animals. As the campaign wore on, losses were replaced by more durable African Basuto ponies, and Waler horses from Australia.|$|E
