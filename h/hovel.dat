5|$|The {{back story}} in the {{published}} synopsis differs from the actual production in a few aspects. When the organ grinder takes the children back to his <b>hovel,</b> the inter-title states {{they are forced to}} dance. In the synopsis, it states the children are instructed to dance to the hurdy-gurdy. The organ grinder does not play a hurdy-gurdy. In the published synopsis the parents are named Eugenie Freeman and Paul Temple. However, the letter the father receives is addressed to Paul Tilden. The letter informs him of Joseph Tilden's death and of the $100,000 inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} is postponed {{and the parents}} are out looking for work when a prospective tenant appears. Mrs. O'Brien shows him the room and he is interested, but {{does not know what}} to do with the children. Mrs. O'Brien puts the children out onto the street where they dance to the music played by an organ grinder. The organ grinder earns more money from their dancing and he entices the children to return to his <b>hovel</b> and teaches them to dance. The organ grinder instructs them to dance for money. The children are rescued by a theater manager and finds them a place in the theater program.|$|E
5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that is, {{the belief that the}} audience does not need to see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her <b>hovel.</b> While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for the father and the family dog to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E

5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but {{it is more likely that}} despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a <b>hovel,</b> and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E
5|$|Both Omar's {{father and}} uncle were killed {{following}} a mortar attack on Bakaara Market, where they worked. Omar {{was in the}} eighth grade at the time, and she dropped out of school in response to look after her siblings while her mother sold produce to provide for the family. Following the encouragement of her mother, she decided to take up running. She would train at Mogadishu Stadium, as the family lived nearby in a <b>hovel.</b> The stadium had a gravel running track, pitted with mortar craters from the ongoing Somali Civil War. When not running at the stadium, she would run on the streets of Mogadishu, facing harassment from local militants who did not believe that Muslim women should participate in sporting activities.|$|E
5|$|The Czech Catholics, {{who were}} led by Zdeněk of Šternberk, joined forces with Matthias in February 1469. Their united troops were encircled at Vilémov by George of Poděbrady's army. In fear of being captured, Matthias opened {{negotiations}} with his former father-in-law. They met in a nearby <b>hovel,</b> where Matthias persuaded George of Poděbrady to sign an armistice promising that he would mediate a reconciliation between the moderate Hussites and the Holy See. Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April. Here the papal legates came forward with demands including {{the appointment of a}} Catholic Archbishop to the See of Prague, which could not be accepted by George of Poděbrady. The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady. The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of Vladislaus Jagiello, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed king George of Poděbrady.|$|E

25|$|They were {{in reserve}} during {{the greater part}} of 18 June, but were brought up into the front line on the left later in the day, and {{received}} several French charges in square. Here Ellis received a musket-ball through the right breast. Feeling faint he rode out of the square towards the rear, but in getting over a small ditch fell from his horse and sustained further injuries. He was carried to a neighbouring <b>hovel</b> and his wounds dressed. In the evening of the 19 June, after the army had moved on, the hut caught fire. Ellis was rescued with great difficulty by Assistant-Surgeon Munro of his regiment, but not before he had received severe burns, to which he succumbed on the morning of 20 June 1815. He was buried at Waterloo.|$|E

But there were no back yards, or, rather, they were covered with one-storey <b>hovels,</b> cowsheds, in which people lived. The roofs of these <b>hovels</b> were covered with deposits of filth, in some places {{a couple of feet}} deep--the contributions from the back windows of the second and third storeys. I could make out fish and meat bones, garbage, pestilential rags, old boots, broken earthenware, and all the general refuse of a human sty.|$|R

Alberto, in drag and half-drunk, executes a surrealistic dance across the ballroom {{floor with a}} goofy carnival head made of papier-mâché. Returning home at dawn, Alberto is devastated to find his sister running off for good with her married lover. Fausto’s naive attempt to seduce Giulia results in his being humiliated and then fired by her husband. In revenge, he steals the statue of an angel in gold paint from his former employer, enlisting the loyal Moraldo to help him sell it to a monk. Suspicious, the monk turns down the offer. Fausto ends up giving the statue to a simple-minded peasant (Silvio Bagolini) who sets the angel on a mound outside his <b>hovel,</b> caressing it.|$|E

500|$|Seven-year-old Bok was {{captured}} by Giemma, {{a member of the}} slave hunting militia, who forced him to join a caravan of slaves, stolen produce, livestock and wares that the militia had captured in their raid of the Dinka settlement. When the members of the militia split up to return to their homes, Bok was taken by Giemma. Upon arriving at Giemma's residence, Francis was beaten by his captor's children with sticks and was called abeed. The word literally means [...] "slave" [...] and the stereotype is that of an inferior, demeaned, Negroid race. Francis was given quarters in a <b>hovel</b> near the pens of Giemma's livestock.|$|E

But if a Roman Catholic is jobless, and lives in the most ghastly <b>hovel</b> he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church".|$|E
2500|$|Casanova was {{cared for}} by his {{grandmother}} Marzia Baldissera while his mother toured about Europe in the theater. His father {{died when he was}} eight. As a child, Casanova suffered nosebleeds, and his grandmother sought help from a witch: [...] "Leaving the gondola, we enter a <b>hovel,</b> where we find an old woman sitting on a pallet, with a black cat in her arms and five or six others around her." [...] Though the unguent applied was ineffective, Casanova was fascinated by the incantation. Perhaps to remedy the nosebleeds (a physician blamed the density of Venice's air), Casanova, on his ninth birthday, was sent to a boarding house on the mainland in Padua. For Casanova, the neglect by his parents was a bitter memory. [...] "So they got rid of me," [...] he proclaimed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the square was the pillory called Kåken ("The [...] House", see Kåkbrinken), first {{mentioned}} in connection to the so-called [...] "Käpplinge murders" [...] (Käpplingemorden) {{in the first half of}} the 15th century - the story of a group German burghers who trapped a large number of prominent citizens in a <b>hovel</b> on Blasieholmen (at the time called Käpplinge) and burned them in. The Germans are said to have been led from the Royal Palace to the pillory. [...] Originally the pillory was placed atop a bricked prison where the despised executioner kept the sentenced, before shackling and whipping them, or even cutting their ears off, depending on the nature of their crimes. [...] The pillory was relocated to the present Norrmalmstorg in 1771 when the Stock Exchange Building and the present well were completed.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 June 1283, Dafydd ap Gruffudd was {{captured}} in the uplands above Abergwyngregyn close to Bera Mawr in a secret hiding place recorded as Nanhysglain. The site {{was no more than}} a <b>hovel</b> in a bog which may have been used previously by religious hermits. It is recorded that Dafydd, who had been betrayed, was [...] "severely injured" [...] during his capture. It is likely that his wife, daughters, niece and one of his sons were captured alongside him. His eldest son, [...] "Llywelyn ap Dafydd" [...] (aged about 15), was not there at the time because it is recorded that King Edward issued specific orders [...] "ad querendum filium David primogenitum" [...] to have him apprehended. Llywelyn ap Dafydd was detained later by [...] "men of his own tongue" [...] and taken into royal custody on 29 June. Following this any organised resistance ended until the uprising of Madog ap Llywelyn some eleven years later.|$|E
2500|$|Trigg was {{a prosperous}} grocer with a twin-gabled shop in Middle Row, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, {{as well as}} a number of other properties. He was a churchwarden, an {{overseer}} of the parish, and an important man locally. It is said that one night, he and two friends witnessed grave robbers at a local graveyard, and they vowed to make sure that this would not happen to them. Trigg stated in his will that his body should be committed for a minimum of 30 years to [...] "the West end of my <b>Hovel</b> to be decently laid there upon a floor erected by my Executor, upon the purlin for the same purpose, nothing doubting but that at the general Resurrection, I shall receive the same again by the mighty power of God." [...] According to Gentleman's Magazine of 5 Feb 1751, Trigg's will stated that he supposed that he would return to life after 30 years and then his estate would revert to him, and that he ordered that the barn be locked with the key inside his coffin so that he could let himself out. Shortly before he died, Trigg had negotiated with the parish authorities to rent his barn as the town's workhouse.|$|E
2500|$|Winston Churchill made {{repeated}} {{claims about}} the imminent fall of the Soviet Union throughout his political career.

The attempt to carry into practice those wild theories can only be attended with universal confusion, corruption, disorder and civil war." [...] Later, he made a similar prediction in a journal article in 1931. After World War II, speaking about the recently established Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe, he stated in 1954: [...] "The forces of the human spirit and of national character alive in those countries cannot be speedily extinguished even by large-scale movements of populations and mass education of children." [...] And in the epilogue to the one volume edition of his World War II memoirs, published in 1957, Churchill wrote: [...] "The natural forces are working with greater freedom and greater opportunity to fertilize and vary the thoughts and the power of individual men and women. They are far bigger and more pliant in the vast structure of a mighty empire than could ever have been conceived by Marx in his <b>hovel...</b> Human society will grow in many forms not comprehended by a party machine." ...|$|E
