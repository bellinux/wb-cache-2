5|$|To {{allow the}} Sa'iqa company to perform its landing, the Port Said Sector {{was to be}} {{supplied}} 24 assault <b>dinghies.</b> Only ten were received however, and on October 3, Second Army informed Khalid {{that there were no}} more <b>dinghies</b> available, and {{that he would have to}} improvise. Khalid resorted to renting two fishing boats. Consequently, the Sa'iqa company was tasked with simply isolating the fort; no attack from the east would be carried out.|$|E
5|$|The ships' {{standard}} {{crew was}} 31officers and 446enlisted men, {{with an additional}} 9officers and 41enlisted while serving as a second command flagship. After their reconstruction into training ships, the crew was substantially enlarged to incorporate the trainees, with 26officers and 658sailors, 75 of whom were naval cadets and 300 others were cabin boys. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including three picket boats, one launch, one pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and three <b>dinghies.</b> After their modernization, the boats were significantly revised; the number of picket boats was reduced to one, a barge and a launch were added, the <b>dinghies</b> were removed, and five more cutters were added.|$|E

5|$|The Mersea Week is {{a week-long}} August festival of boat racing {{organised}} by the West Mersea Yacht Club and Dabchicks Sailing Club, established in 1973. During the week, starting on Monday, there are races for many boat {{classes in the}} Blackwater Estuary, from Optimist <b>dinghies</b> to large yachts. The most celebrated event is the Round-the-Island race, where <b>dinghies</b> attempt to sail round the island in either direction, helped over the Strood by volunteers. On Saturday, there is a regatta at West Mersea, followed by a selection of water sports and a firework display at dusk. One of the popular events on Saturday is walking a greasy pole rigged {{over the side of}} the hosting Thames sailing barge.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Bayern class had a {{standard}} crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men; when {{serving as a}} squadron flagship, an additional 14 officers and 86 men were required. The vessels carried several smaller craft, including one picket boat, three barges, two launches, two yawls, and two <b>dinghies.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ships had {{a crew of}} twenty-one {{officers}} and 421 enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one barge, two yawls, and two <b>dinghies.</b> They were good sea boats, but were fairly stiff and suffered from severe roll. The cruisers were maneuverable, but were slow going into a turn. Steering was controlled by a single large rudder. They lost speed only slightly in a head sea, but lost up to sixty percent in hard turns.|$|E

He competed in the Fowey Regatta and the Prince of Wales Cup, coming fifth on the River Clyde in 1936. He also entered the competition at Lowestoft in 1937 and at Falmouth in 1938. Hichens had also taken up offshore yacht racing {{and was a member}} of the Royal Ocean Racing Club, competed three times in the Fastnet race, and crewed in the Channel race in June 1939.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The ships were described as good sea-boats, but were prone to heavy pitching. The ships were responsive and had a tight turning radius at low speed, but at hard rudder of 12degrees, the ships lost up to 70percent speed. The ships had a crew of 35officers and 708men normally, and when serving as a squadron flagship, they had an additional 13officers and 66men.

5|$|The troops {{tasked with}} {{isolating}} Fort Lahtzanit began crossing the canal in <b>dinghies</b> at 2:15p.m.. Ten minutes later {{they reached the}} east bank and proceeded to climb the sand wall. They succeeded in attracting Israeli fire, thereby facilitating the main assault force in its mission to attack the fort later on. The troops tasked with isolating the fort from the east reached and occupied a firing ramp prepared for tanks, and raised the Egyptian flag over it. This severely demoralized the Israeli soldiers inside Fort Lahtzanit. Soon after the Sa'iqa company (less one platoon) arrived at the firing ramp as well.|$|E
5|$|Brummer and Bremse were {{fitted with}} masts {{similar to the}} British Arethusa-class cruisers, and {{similarly}} to the British ships, the masts could be lowered and stored on the superstructure deck. Their bow was also modeled on the Arethusa-class ships to further disguise the vessels. The ships had a complement of 16officers and 293enlisted men. They carried several smaller vessels, including one picket boat, one barge, and two <b>dinghies.</b> The German Navy regarded the ships as excellent sea boats, having gentle motion. The ships were highly maneuverable and had a tight turning radius, and only lost slight speed in a head sea. In hard turns, they lost up to sixty percent speed. They were very , however.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{regarded}} in the German Navy as excellent sea boats {{with an easy}} roll; the ships rolled up to 30° with a period of 10seconds. They maneuvered easily; at hard rudder the ships lost up to 60percent speed and heeled over 9°. However, they suffered from severe vibration, particularly at the stern, at high speeds. They also had very wet bows, even in moderate seas. The ships had a crew of 33 officers and 650 enlisted men. However, when serving as a squadron flagship, the crew was augmented by an additional 13 officers and 66 enlisted men. While acting as a second command ship, 9 officers and 44 enlisted men {{were added to the}} standard crew.

Whereas {{most of the}} {{professional}} crews of the earlier sloop racing, which has since died-out, were probably Black, the restriction of <b>dinghy</b> racing to these clubs, with their membership historically restricted to white people, means that Bermuda Fitted <b>Dinghy</b> racing has maintained an exclusive, all-white reputation in Bermuda. Although {{it is true that}} mounting a <b>dinghy</b> campaign requires significant financial and personnel resource, new entries are welcomed regardless of race, and many of Bermuda's best-known fitted sailors are black, including Stevie Dickinson and Glenn Astwood.|$|R

5|$|The {{ships were}} very stable, {{primarily}} because of their wide beam. The ships suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Bismarck and Tirpitz were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of manoeuvring with rudder deflections as small as 5°. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3°, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when travelling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one launch, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two <b>dinghies.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from longitudinal steel frames. The hulls {{were divided into}} fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 72percent {{of the length of}} the keel. The Kriegsmarine regarded the ships as good sea boats, with gentle motion. At low speed, however, they were affected unpredictably by wind and currents. The ships heeled up to fourteen degrees and lost up to 50% speed with the rudder hard over at high speed. The ships had a standard complement of 42officers and 1,340enlisted men. Wartime modifications increased the crew to 51officers and 1,548sailors. The ships carried several smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, one launch, one pinnace, and two <b>dinghies.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames; over 90percent of the hulls used welding {{instead of the}} then standard riveting, which saved 15 percent of their total hull weight. This savings allowed the armament and armor to be increased. The hulls contained twelve watertight compartments and were fitted with a double bottom that extended for 92percent {{of the length of}} the keel. As designed, the ship's complement comprised 33officers and 586enlisted men. After 1935, the crew was dramatically increased, to 30 officers and 921–1,040 sailors. While serving as a squadron flagship, an additional 17 officers and 85 enlisted men augmented the crew. The second flagship had an additional 13 officers and 59 sailors. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including two picket boats, two barges, one launch, one pinnace, and two <b>dinghies.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sharon {{planned for}} Raviv's brigade to {{attack from the}} east, {{diverting}} Egyptian attention away from Deversoir. Erez was tasked with transporting a pre-constructed roller bridge to the crossing area at Deversoir, while one of his tank battalions would {{be attached to the}} paratroopers. Colonel Reshef was given the most critical tasks of all. Accordingly, his brigade was heavily reinforced to incorporate four armored and three mechanized infantry battalions, in addition to the division's reconnaissance battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Yaov Brom. His brigade would conduct a turning maneuver at 6:00 AM on October 15 south of Akavish Road, move through the sand dunes to reach Fort Lakekan, before heading north to occupy Fort Matzmed. Reshef's brigade would then split up to clear the Akavish and Titur Roads and seize the Chinese Farm, while occupying the crossing area and awaiting Matt's brigade. Matt's paratrooper brigade, containing an additional tank company and the armored battalion, would move south-west via Akavish to reach Fort Matzmed. From there, it would continue on to the Yard and cross the canal at 11:00 PM, using rubber <b>dinghies</b> and rafts for the tanks.|$|E
5|$|The cruisers' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames with yellow pine planking {{up to the}} upper deck. A layer of Muntz metal sheathing covered the hull to protect the wood from shipworm. The stem and sternposts {{were constructed}} with steel and timber. A bronze naval ram was fitted at the bow. The hull was divided into ten watertight compartments, and a double bottom was installed below the boiler rooms. The ships were good sea boats, but they rolled badly and the sponsons for the main guns caused severe vibration. Since Geier was laid down after the other five ships entered service, she was redesigned slightly to discard the sponsons, and so she did not suffer from bad vibration. They were very maneuverable, except for turns into the wind when steaming at low speed. The ships had a crew of 9officers and 152enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and two <b>dinghies.</b>|$|E

A total of 18countries or local Red Crosses sent Fr.2.3million CHF worth of cash to Sri Lanka. Sweden sent kr800,000 (2003 SEK) toward relief transport and distribution. The government of Japan sent ¥19.8million yen worth of tents, sheets, and other supplies to the country, The Iranian Red Cross sent $65,625 (USD) worth of blankets and tents to Sri Lanka, which helped about 240families. Australia's government sent about $400,000 (AUD) to UNICEF to help rebuild the damaged schools and other social services. The European Community Humanitarian Aid Office donated about €800,000 ($944,000 USD) to the country. The World Food Programme distributed meals to about 10,000families, while the World Health Organization provided water purification tablets, typhoid vaccines, and health kits to about 100,000people. During a peace agreement amid the ongoing civil war, the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka sent trucks with clothing and food to the affected areas. In July 2004, the Asian Development Bank provided $12.5million of the $17.5million needed to repair the damaged infrastructure, while the Sri Lankan government provided the remaining $5million.|$|E
