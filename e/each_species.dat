40|$|This work {{deals with}} a {{solution}} method to handle multicomponents reversible reactions occurring inside a porous catalyst pellet. The complexity of this problem arises {{from the fact that}} the effective diffusivities and Biot number, which characterizes the external mass transfer, are different for <b>each</b> chemical <b>species.</b> In mathematical terms, this means that <b>each</b> chemical <b>species</b> has its own subspace and, therefore, when the technique of finite integral transform is applied to solve this multicomponent problem, <b>each</b> chemical <b>species</b> is associated with its own integral transform kernel. The analytical solutions obtained for this problem are compact and simple for any further manipulation.

5|$|To the {{practical}} ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification {{in being able}} to ascertain the distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance, whether at rest, or during their flight; for not only every genus has something peculiar to itself, but <b>each</b> <b>species</b> has its own appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty.|$|E

40|$|We sampled {{lepidopteran}} caterpillars {{on three}} Byrsonima species (Malpighiaceae) in Central Brazil: Byrsonima crassa, Byrsonima verbascifolia and Byrsonima coccolobifolia between May 1993 and July 1994. Fifteen individuals of <b>each</b> plant <b>species</b> were censused weekly. Our main {{goal was to}} estimate the abundance and richness of lepidopteran larvae within <b>each</b> plant <b>species.</b> Only 13 % of the 1 621 sampled plants had caterpillars on their leaves. This percentage was similar within <b>each</b> plant <b>species.</b> We found a pattern of low abundance and high richness of lepidopteran species associated with Byrsonima. There were 48 morphospecies and 46 % of them occurred just once. There was a higher similarity between the fauna of B. crassa and B. verbascifolia than between these and B. coccolobifolia. Once {{it is known that}} hairy leaves can affect herbivore colonization and foraging strategy, we suggest that differences in the lepidopteran community associated with Byrsonima spp. are linked with different levels of pubescence on the leaf surface of <b>each</b> plant <b>species.</b> This tendency in Byrsonima is supported by the small number of caterpillars found on young leaves of B. crassa and B. verbascifolia, which are quite hairy...|$|R
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while <b>each</b> <b>species,</b> collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E
5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of <b>each</b> <b>species</b> are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E

The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of <b>each</b> <b>species.</b> The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E

Ex Del. 1847 (Euphorbiaceae), Psorospermum febrifugum Spach 1836 (Hypericaceae) and Syzygium guineense (Will.) DC var. guineense 1828 (Myrtaceae), Apis mellifera adansonii Latreille 1804 (Hymenoptera: Apidae) activity was observed on their {{flowers in the}} area of Ngaoundere, from January to May, in 2002 and 2003. Flowers of <b>each</b> plant <b>species</b> were prospected at least four days per month, between 7 am and 6 pm, for the registration of the nectar and/or pollen foraging behaviour of A. m. adansonii workers. Results show that A. m. adansonii harvested nectar and pollen of <b>each</b> plant <b>species.</b> The greatest number of workers foraging simultaneously on a plant varied from 9 in P. febrifugum to 3600 in S. g. guineense. A. m. adansonii workers were faithful to <b>each</b> plant <b>species.</b> A. senegalensis, C. macrostachyus, P. febrifugum and S. g. guineense could be cultivated and protected to increase honey production.

5|$|Collecting {{butterflies}} {{was once}} a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild.

5|$|Different species use {{different}} pheromones.

5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. <b>Each</b> <b>species</b> of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
