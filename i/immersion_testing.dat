50|$|The {{material}} has a hardness roughly {{equal to that}} of high-density polyethylene and is thermally stable to > 350 °C. It is chemically inert to all but the most powerful bases such as sodium amide and organo-sodium or lithium compounds. The material is extremely hydrophobic. Gross contamination of the material or marring of the optical surface can be remedied by sanding under a stream of running water. This surface refinishing both restores the original topography of the surface and returns the material to its original reflectance. Weathering tests on the material show no damage upon exposure to atmospheric UV flux.

50|$|While these charts cover {{a list of}} {{commonly}} encountered fluids, {{they may}} not have all the fluids. If there is a fluid whose compatibility is not listed anywhere, then a common test of compatibility is the <b>immersion</b> <b>testing.</b> A 1 to 2 inch sample of the tubing is immersed in the fluid to be pumped for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours, and the amount of weight change from before and after the immersion is measured. If the weight change is greater than 10% of the initial weight, then that tube is not compatible with the fluid, and should not be used in that application. This test is still a one way test, in the sense that there is still a remote chance that the tubing that passes this test can still be incompatible for the application since the combination of borderline compatibility and mechanical flexing can push the tube over the edge, resulting in premature tube failure.|$|E

The degradation rate, hydrogen evolution, ion release, surface layer and in vitro cytotoxicity of two Mg–Zn–Zr alloys, i. e.

40|$|Most {{ultrasonic}} techniques {{developed in}} the die casting industry were to inspect castings with simple geometries and machined surfaces. A technique could not be described as non-destructive if it required alteration of a surface prior to inspection.

As the signal-to-noise ratio is very important in quantifying sub-surface defects, the major factors relating to noise creation in the ultrasonic signal during ultrasonic <b>immersion</b> <b>testing</b> were identified and addressed. The application of ultrasonic testing to inspect rough surface aluminium die castings with sidedrilled holes to simulate porosity type defects is described in detail.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of pure copper, zinc {{and aluminum}} in selected commercial beverages was studied. Experiments were also {{conducted in the}} presence of citric and phosphoric acid to investigate their role in the corrosion process in these beverages. Two experimental approaches were used to investigate the corrosion behavior: a chemical method in which the dissolved metal concentration was measured after immersion of a sample in a beverage and an electrochemical method using the Tafel extrapolation technique. The metal surfaces were also examined by SEM/EDX after the <b>immersion</b> <b>tests</b> and electrochemical polarization. Among the important conclusions from this research are that the order in which the various beverages affect the corrosion rate as evaluated by Tafel extrapolation of the polarization curves did not agree with the order based on measurement of the dissolved metal concentration as determined by the <b>immersion</b> <b>tests</b> except when a 1 - day <b>immersion</b> <b>test</b> was used for Al. The dissolved Al, Zn and Cu concentrations obtained from short-term <b>immersion</b> <b>tests</b> differed from those measured in long-term tests, although the same ranking of the corrosiveness of the seven soft drinks was obtained after 1 - and 3 - day <b>immersion</b> <b>tests.</b> These discrepancies likely stem from the complicated dynamics of the corrosion of these metals and the various physical, chemical and electrochemical processes that take place in these beverages. No simple correlation was found between the beverage properties and composition and the dissolved copper, zinc and aluminum concentrations after immersion, whether based on short-term or long-term tests. However, the corrosion rate of copper in the 7 soft drinks as determined by the Tafel extrapolation method was found to depend on the pH. Uniform corrosion was observed in all iv cases except for Al immersed in Gatorade.

In conventional PE technique, called contact type PE, an ultrasonic transducer is in constant contact with a test piece, transmitting and receiving ultrasonic signals from the test specimen. The inherent shortcomings of PE are the need for; uniform couplant conditions, the ultrasonic transducer to remain {{in contact with the}} test object throughout the scan and a limitation to scan regular surfaced objects only.
