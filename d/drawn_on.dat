5|$|Ponies are taxonomically {{the same}} animals as horses. The {{distinction}} between a horse and pony is commonly <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> the basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.|$|E
5|$|The most {{traditional}} type of batik, called batik tulis (written batik), is drawn using only the canting. The cloth {{needs to be}} <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> both sides, and dipped in a dye bath three to four times. The whole process may take up to a year; it yields considerably finer patterns than stamped batik.|$|E

5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E

Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in pen and ink of the Arno valley, <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> 5 August 1473.|$|E

Thangka—a notable handicraft—is an elaborately hand painted religious scroll in brilliant colours <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> fabric hung in a monastery or a family altar and occasionally carried by monks in ceremonial processions. Chhaams are vividly costumed monastic dances performed on ceremonial and festive occasions, especially in the monasteries during the Tibetan new year.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E

5|$|Generalizing this problem, one can ask {{how many}} lines can be <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, {{such as the}} one {{illustrated}} above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician Hermann Schubert, who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals <b>drawn</b> <b>on</b> rock or clay. The earliest tools used to control horses were bridles of various sorts, which were invented nearly {{as soon as the}} horse was domesticated. Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, dated 35003000 BC.|$|E

5|$|Pauline Fowler {{is one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland (1940–2007) and Julia Smith (1927–1997).

40|$|What {{should be}} the place of finance in social theory? What is the {{relationship}} between finance and democracy? The article identifies four major frameworks that analyse finance: orthodox, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> Adam Smith; political economy, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> Marx; heterodox, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> Keynes and Minsky; and societal, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> Polanyi. These frameworks are critically analysed along five dimensions: the conceptualization of finance; the relations between finance and the economy; the relations between finance and the state; the relations between finance and society; {{and the nature of the}} social system. A new framework for the analysis of finance in society is constructed from these elements. This is used to analyse the relations between finance and democracy and the prospects for the regulation of finance...|$|R
