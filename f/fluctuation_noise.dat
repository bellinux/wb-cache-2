50|$|When the {{temperature}} increases, the Young's modulus {{of the material}} used to fabricate the moving structure decreases. This will leads to the softening of the moving structure. Meanwhile, thermal expansion and thermal conductivity will increase with {{the temperature}} inducing an internal stress in the moving structure. These effects can result in the shift of the resonant frequency of the moving structure which is equivalent noise for resonant frequency shift sensing and the voltage sensing as well. In addition, temperature rise will generate larger Johnson noise (affect the piezoresiative transduction) and also large mechanical <b>fluctuation</b> <b>noise</b> (affects the optical sensing). Therefore, advanced electronics for temperature effect compensation have to be used to improve the sensitivity.|$|E
5000|$|Phonon noise, {{also known}} as thermal <b>fluctuation</b> <b>noise,</b> arises from the random {{exchange}} of energy between a thermal mass and its surrounding environment. This energy is quantized {{in the form of}} phonons. Each phonon has an energy of order , where [...] is Boltzmann's constant and [...] is the temperature. The random exchange of energy leads to fluctuations in temperature. This occurs even when the thermal mass and the environment are in thermal equilibrium, i.e. at the same time-average temperature. If a device has a temperature-dependent electrical resistance, then these fluctuations in temperature lead to fluctuations in resistance. Examples of devices where phonon noise is important include bolometers and calorimeters. The superconducting transition edge sensor (TES), which can be operated either as a bolometer or a calorimeter, {{is an example of a}} device for which phonon noise can significantly contribute to the total noise.|$|E

[...] Boston UniversityThis paper {{presents}} an exposition {{of the significant}} theories of <b>fluctuation</b> <b>noise</b> for vacuum tubes in the space-charge-limited condition. The theories presented are for low frequencies, that is, frequencies where transit time effects are not-significant. The importance of noise in the general communications problem is discussed in Part I. In Part II {{the historical development of}} <b>fluctuation</b> <b>noise</b> theories is presented commencing with work of W. Schottky on the temperature-limited diode. The practical importance of the noise phenomenon to the tube manufacturers is pointed out. The historical development of thermionic emission theory is briefly traced beginning with C. Child's famous three-halves power law. The basic problem in the determination of space-charge conditions is next discussed. This is followed by excerpts from <b>fluctuation</b> <b>noise</b> investigations in 1925 by A. Hull and N. Williams. The progress of noise investigations from 1931 - 1940 is traced. Special reference is made to the work of B. J. Thompson, D. 0. Williams, and W. A. Harris in the development of practical engineering formulae. The achievements of the Radiation Laboratory of M. I. T. from 1941 - 1950 are noted. Part III presents a derivation of the original Shottky equation for temperature limited diodes [...] . [TRUNCATED] [...] . This equation is derived by use of Fourier series and probability theory. Part IV considers the space-charge picture in detail. The mechanism of thermionic emission is discussed in terms of the theory of work function and Richardson's equations. Reasons for preferring the T^ 2 version of Richardson's equations are given. The nature of the temperature - limited condition is next considered and is followed by a description of the space-charge-limited case. The reasons for noise reduction in space-charge-limited diodes is discussed by way of reference to the experimental work of A. Hull: and N. Williams. The opinions of other investigators on the cause of noise reduction are also noted. Part V discusses the various experimental confirmations of the Maxwell distribution law. Statistical mechanics is used to show how the Fermi-Dirac distribution law reduces to the Maxwell distribution law at emission temperatures. The T. C. Fry method of analysis of space-charge-potential distribution in diodes is next presented. This analysis takes into account the initial Maxwell velocity distribution of emitted electrons and enables a determination of space-charge-potential for all diode space-charge conditions.
