5|$|Composer Engelbert Humperdinck, after {{attending}} {{the debut of}} his opera Königskinder at the Metropolitan Opera, sailed on George Washington in early January 1911 in order to attend the opera's Berlin premiere. American sculptor George Grey Barnard returned to New York in April amidst controversy over some of his works. An organization called the National Society for Protection of Morals was protesting the presence of nude figures in sculptures he executed for the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. July saw George Washington transporting a menagerie of sorts. The liner was carrying a shipment from India of 6 white peacocks, 2 lions, 2 elephants, 150 monkeys, and some 2,000 canaries destined for the recently organized Saint Louis Zoological Park. In August, two men of note—both headed for Berlin—sailed on George Washington. Nathan Straus, co-owner with his brother Isidor of R.H. Macy & Company, sailed as the U.S. delegate {{to the third world}} congress for the protection of infants held in Berlin. Congressman Richard Bartholdt, charged by President Taft to deliver a statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben to the German government, sailed with the statue, which was a gift <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

60|$|What is more {{dramatic}} than the spectacle {{we have seen}} repeated, and doubtless long shall see--the popular judgment taking the successful candidates on trial in the offices--standing off, as it were, and observing them and their doings for a while, and always giving, finally, the fit, exactly due reward? I think, after all, the sublimest part of political history, and its culmination, is currently issuing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> I know nothing grander, better exercise, better digestion, more positive proof of the past, the triumphant result of faith in human-kind, than a well-contested American national election.|$|E
6000|$|As for my countrymen, I grew better {{acquainted with}} many of our {{national}} characteristics during those four years than in all my preceding life. Whether brought more strikingly out by the contrast with English manners, or that my Yankee friends assumed an extra peculiarity {{from a sense of}} defiant patriotism, so it was that their tones, sentiments, and behavior, even their figures and cast of countenance, all seemed chiselled in sharper angles than ever I had imagined them to be at home. It impressed me with an odd idea of having somehow lost the property of my own person, when I occasionally heard one of them speaking of me as [...] "my Consul"! They often came to the Consulate in parties of half a dozen or more, on no business whatever, but merely to subject their public servant to a rigid examination, and see how he was getting on with his duties. These interviews were rather formidable, being characterized by a certain stiffness which I felt to be sufficiently irksome at the moment, though it looks laughable enough in the retrospect. It is my firm belief that these fellow-citizens, possessing a native tendency to organization, generally halted outside of the door to elect a speaker, chairman, or moderator, and thus approached me with all the formalities of a deputation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> After salutations on both sides,-- abrupt, awful, and severe on their part, and deprecatory on mine,--and the national ceremony of shaking hands being duly gone through with, the interview proceeded by a series of calm and well-considered questions or remarks from the spokesman (no other of the guests vouchsafing to utter a word), and diplomatic responses from the Consul, who sometimes found the investigation a little more searching than he liked. I flatter myself, however, that, by much practice, I attained considerable skill in this kind of intercourse, the art of which lies in passing off commonplaces for new and valuable truths, and talking trash and emptiness {{in such a way that}} a pretty acute auditor might mistake it for something solid. If there be any better method of dealing with such junctures,--when talk is to be created out of nothing, and within the scope of several minds at once, so that you cannot apply yourself to your interlocutor's individuality,--I have not learned it.|$|E

5000|$|Chapter 20, [...] "The Seventies: Under Control?", covers {{political}} corruption and American disillusion {{with the government}} during the 1970s. Zinn argues that the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the exposure of crimes committed by the CIA and FBI during the decade were done {{by the government in}} order to regain support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> without making fundamental changes to the system. According to Zinn, Gerald Ford's presidency continued the same basic policies of the Nixon administration. Other topics covered include protests against the Honeywell Corporation, Angela Davis, Committee to Re-elect the President, the Watergate scandal, International Telephone and Telegraph's involvement in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, the Mayagüez incident, Project MKULTRA, the Church Committee, the Pike Committee, the Trilateral Commission's The Governability of Democracies, and the People's Bi-Centennial.|$|E

40|$|Reconnecting to Work {{conference on}} {{consequences}} of, and solutions to, unemployment The conference “Reconnecting to Work ” {{was held on}} April 1 - 2, 2011 as the US suffered its worst job market since the Great Depression. Reconnecting to work indeed! With 9 - 10 % unemployment and little sign of substantive job growth in the foreseeable future, American workers needed more help to find work {{than at any time}} since the 1930 s. Even if job growth were miraculously to pick up, most workers would have trouble keeping their heads above water for years to come. For three to four decades the benefits of economic growth have gone almost entirely to a small sliver of wealthy Americans. The vast bulk of workers struggled with stagnant real wages and high consumer debt to remain in the middle class. Inequality rose to levels off the map for a major advanced country and exceeded levels in most third world countries. Contrary to what many Americans believe, social mobility in the US was below that for most other advanced countries. i Something or someone had taken shared prosperity and full employment <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> Something or someone was dismantling the road to the middle class on which the US was built and with it the American Dream.

30|$|Seeing this inscription, one {{instantly}} {{remembers the}} first words of Greek thought: “Whence things have their origin, thence also their destruction happens, as is the order of things (katà tò chreón); for they execute the sentence upon one another—the condemnation for the crime—in conformity with the ordinance of Time (katà tèn toû chrónou táxin)”z. War and thought, thus united in this infernal circle, which art bravely (though in vain) tries to conjure with {{the arrangement of the}} names. The second inscription aspires to lend a patriotic “air” to the Memorial (a sober one, it must be acknowledged). Now it is the Nation who speaks (in the third person and in indirect speech), not the “us” of the initial words: the set of all of those who lost their dear ones and, in general, of a whole people shocked by a war they ended. A stupid war, without winners or losers. Only death and destruction. Nevertheless, the final “message” is fortunately mitigated by the inscription’s last words. Simple and proud words, which remind us that this extraordinary funerary monument belongs to the People, and not to Power. Compare the conventional beginning with the second sentence: “Our Nation honors the courage, sacrifice, and devotion to duty and country of its Vietnam veterans. This memorial was built with private contributions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> November 11, 1982 ”. Meaningfully enough, what is usually said in conventional monuments, “erected by public subscription”, is not said here, but “built with private contributions”. At last, the so long desired identification between private life, assumed responsibly, and public monument, has been accomplished.|$|E
