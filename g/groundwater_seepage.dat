30|$|In the Toki granite, {{groundwater}} flow is fracture-controlled (joints and faults) (Illman et al. [2009]). Hence, groundwater from both boreholes and seepage {{passed through the}} granitic fractures and/or fracture networks. The concentrations of major constituents in the <b>groundwater</b> <b>seepages</b> in the − 300  m gallery were different from the concentrations in the 09 MI 20 borehole groundwater, even though both sample locations are at the same depth (Table  1). Around the study area, the groundwater chemistry is Na-Ca-HCO 3 type at shallow depths, whereas it is Na-(Ca)-Cl type at deep levels (Iwatsuki et al. [2005]). Although the concentration of Cl− in borehole groundwater increased with depth, that in the <b>groundwater</b> <b>seepages</b> were higher than in boreholes at the same depth (− 300  m) (Table  1).

30|$|The {{weathered}} layer {{as compared}} to the other two subsurface layers or geological units exhibits the lowest range resistivity values (19 – 281  Ωm). This low resistivity values could be attributed to loosely bonded sediments and probably conductive fluids and clay minerals (with anomalously low resistivity values of less than 65  Ωm). Clay minerals exhibit a plasticity nature which allows it to swell when wet and contract when dry. A continuous motion of this within the weathered layer leads to the development of cracks and differential settlement. The presence of cracks and other inclined features (probably fractures) serve as conduit for water movement to the surface resulting to events of <b>groundwater</b> <b>seepages</b> in the weathered layer.

With the development of industry and agriculture, city population increasing, more and more water is needed, as well as the groundwater. It causes the groundwater over-extraction, and a series of serious environment problems such as region’s groundwater cone of depression, land subsidence, seawater inbreak, water quality deteriorate. It is very necessary for us to study groundwater resource. Traditionally, 2 D data model is used and 2 D planes and slice are represented the result, not the true 3 D, so it is difficult to analyse groundwater resource exactly. Therefore, Volume visualization technology is introduced into the field of groundwater resource. Volume visualization technology is that scatter sampling in finite space, each value of sampling point will be one or more properties, which represent its physical property. So it is very suitable to represent the true 3 D geo-phenomena, such as the existent condition of groundwater, the groundwater cone of depression and the <b>groundwater</b> effluent <b>seepage</b> field.

30|$|Temperature is an {{important}} factor influencing in-stream processes (Allan and Castillo 2009). Increased solar radiation following harvest to the stream edge often resulted in higher maximum stream temperatures (up to 25 to 30 °C) and diurnal temperature ranges of up to 12 °C in the warmer northern latitudes of New Zealand and where the hydrology was dominated by surface and sub-surface flow (Baillie et al. 2005; Boothroyd et al. 2004; Graynoth 1979; Quinn and Wright-Stow 2008) (Table  1). Streams with cooler base flow temperatures, overhead logging slash cover and inputs from <b>groundwater</b> <b>seepages,</b> mediated the impact of reduced shade and increased solar radiation on water temperatures after harvest at some sites (Table  1) (Fahey and Stansfield 2006; Pruden et al. 1990). It is likely that, in some streams, temperatures after harvest are exceeding levels and duration periods considered stressful for some sensitive aquatic invertebrates and fish species (≥ 23 °C for aquatic invertebrates and[*]≥[*] 28 °C for indigenous fish) (Olsen et al. 2012; Quinn et al. 1994; Richardson et al. 1994).|$|R
