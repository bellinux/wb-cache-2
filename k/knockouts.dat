5|$|The TNA <b>Knockouts</b> Tag Team Championship was a women's {{professional}} wrestling tag team championship {{owned by}} the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the pathological roles of postnatally up-regulated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) expression in ZBTB 20 <b>knockout</b> mice in postnatal growth retardation, metabolic dysfunction, and pre-mature mortality. Methods: ZBTB 20 and AFP <b>knockout</b> mice were generated by crossbreeding ZBTB 20 <b>knockout</b> mice with AFP <b>knockout</b> mice. The postnatal growth, survival rate, and blood glucose of ZBTB 20 /AFP double <b>knockout</b> mice were observed and {{compared with those}} of ZBTB 20 <b>knockout</b> mice. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} postnatal growth, survival, and glucose homeostasis between ZBTB 20 /AFP doube <b>knockout</b> mice and ZBTB 20 <b>knockout</b> mice. Conclusion: The postnatally upregulated liver AFP in ZBTB 20 <b>knockout</b> mice is not associated with the growth retardation, hypoglycemia, or pre-mature mortality.

Pak 4 <b>knockout</b> mice are embryonic lethal, while Pak 5, Pak 6, and Pak 5 /Pak 6 double <b>knockout</b> mice are viable and fertile. Our previous work {{found that the}} double <b>knockout</b> mice exhibit locomotor changes and learning and memory deficits. We also found some differences with Pak 5 and Pak 6 single <b>knockout</b> mice and the present work further explores the potential differences of the Pak 5 <b>knockout</b> and Pak 6 <b>knockout</b> mice in comparison with wild type mice. The Pak 6 <b>knockout</b> mice were found to weigh significantly {{more than the other}} genotypes. The double <b>knockout</b> mice were found to be less active than the other genotypes. The Pak 5 <b>knockout</b> mice and the double <b>knockout</b> mice performed worse on the rotorod test. All the <b>knockout</b> genotypes were found to be less aggressive in the resident intruder paradigm. The double <b>knockout</b> mice were, once again, found to perform worse in the active avoidance assay. These results indicate, that although some behavioral differences are seen in the Pak 5 and Pak 6 single <b>knockout</b> mice, the double <b>knockout</b> mice exhibit the greatest changes in locomotion and learning and memory...|$|R
5|$|In 2011, Madison Rayne {{would start}} a rivalry with Mickie James over the <b>Knockouts</b> Championship, and would {{successfully}} defend the title against her at Genesis and Against All Odds, after Tara interfered in both matches. During the feud, Tara began claiming that Rayne {{had gone too}} far in her brutality towards Mickie James, but was forced to follow her orders due to being under exclusive contract with her, and not TNA. After Rayne lost the <b>Knockouts</b> Championship to James at Lockdown, James agreed to give her a rematch on the condition that if she is unable to regain the title, Tara would be released from her contract with Rayne. On May 15 at Sacrifice, Tara became a fan favorite after knocking out Rayne during her match with James, costing her the <b>Knockouts</b> Championship and guaranteeing herself a release from her contract with Rayne.|$|E
5|$|On the January 5, 2012 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, Kim and Rayne {{retained}} their tag team titles against James and Traci Brooks. Three days later at Genesis, Kim defeated James by disqualification {{to retain the}} <b>Knockouts</b> Championship. On February 12 at Against All Odds, Kim successfully defended the <b>Knockouts</b> Championship against Tara, during which Madison Rayne walked out on her <b>Knockouts</b> Tag Team Championship partner. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Rayne won a battle royal to become the number one contender to Kim's <b>Knockouts</b> Championship.

On March 18 at Victory Road, Kim successfully defended the <b>Knockouts</b> Championship against Rayne. On the March 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim and Rayne reconciled and remained together as a team. On April 15 at Lockdown, Kim defeated Velvet Sky in a steel cage match, following a distraction from Rayne, to retain her title. Afterwards, Kim went on a losing streak against Brooke Tessmacher, which led to TNA naming Tessmacher the number one contender to her title. On May 13 at Sacrifice, Kim defeated Tessmacher, pinning her with {{her feet on the}} ropes, for another successful title defense. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim successfully defended her title against Tessmacher and Velvet Sky in a three-way match. On May 20, Kim became the longest reigning TNA <b>Knockouts</b> Champion in history by breaking Madison Rayne's previous record of 188 days.

5|$|On the September 24 {{episode of}} Impact!, Tara teamed {{with the new}} <b>Knockouts</b> Champion ODB to {{challenge}} Sarita and Taylor Wilde for the TNA <b>Knockouts</b> Tag Team Championship, but they lost after Awesome Kong interrupted and distracted her during the bout. During the following two weeks of Impact!, Tara and Kong both received one-on-one <b>Knockouts</b> Championship matches from ODB, but both of them ended up losing after the other interfered in the match. At Bound for Glory, ODB defeated both Tara and Kong in a three-way match to retain the title. During the match, Tara was confronted by mixed martial artist Kim Couture {{to set up an}} MMA fight between the two, which, however, never came to fruition. At Turning Point, Tara defeated Kong in a Six Sides of Steel match. On November 26, Tara won a ten-woman battle royal to earn a shot at the <b>Knockouts</b> Championship at Final Resolution. At the event, she defeated ODB to win the <b>Knockouts</b> Championship for the second time. On the January 4, 2010 episode of Impact!, Tara lost the title back to ODB. Two weeks later at Genesis, Tara defeated ODB in a two out of three falls match to regain the title, making her a three-time champion.|$|E
40|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS) is {{the most}} common form of inherited mental retardation. The syndrome results from the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is encoded by the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR 1) gene. FMR 1 and its two paralogs, fragile X–related genes 1 and 2 (FXR 1 and - 2), form the Fmr 1 gene family. Here, we examined long-lasting synaptic plasticity in Fmr 1 <b>knockout,</b> Fxr 2 <b>knockout,</b> and Fmr 1 /Fxr 2 double <b>knockout</b> mice. We found that metabotropic glutamate receptor–dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) in the hippocampus was affected in Fmr 1 <b>knockout,</b> Fxr 2 <b>knockout,</b> and Fmr 1 /Fxr 2 double <b>knockout</b> mice at young ages (4 – 6 wk old). In addition, Fmr 1 /Fxr 2 double <b>knockout</b> mice showed significant deficiencies relative to either Fmr 1 or Fxr 2 <b>knockout</b> mice in baseline synaptic transmission and short-term presynaptic plasticity, suggesting FMRP and FXR 2 P may contribute in a cooperative manner to pathways regulating presynaptic plasticity. However, compared with wild-type littermates, late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) was unaltered in all <b>knockout</b> mice at 4 – 6 mo of age. Interestingly, although Fmr 1 /Fxr 2 double <b>knockout</b> mice exhibited a more robust enhancement in mGluR-LTD compared with that in Fmr 1 <b>knockout</b> mice, Fxr 2 <b>knockout</b> mice exhibited reduced mGluR-LTD. Furthermore, unlike Fmr 1 <b>knockout</b> mice, mGluR-LTD in Fxr 2 <b>knockout</b> mice required new protein synthesis, whereas mGluR-LTD in Fmr 1 /Fxr 2 double <b>knockout</b> mice was partially dependent on protein synthesis. These results indicated that both FMRP and FXR 2 P function in synaptic plasticity and that they likely operate in related but independent pathways...|$|R
