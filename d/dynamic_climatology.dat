40|$|The {{evaluation}} of forecast performance plays {{a central role}} both in the interpretation and use of forecast systems and in their development. Different evaluation measures (scores) are available, often quantifying different characteristics of forecast performance. The properties of several proper scores for probabilistic forecast evaluation are contrasted and then used to interpret decadal probability hindcasts of global mean temperature. The Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), Proper Linear (PL) score, and IJ Good’s logarithmic score (also referred to as Ignorance) are compared; although information from all three may be useful, the logarithmic score has an immediate interpretation and is not insensitive to forecast busts. Neither CRPS nor PL is local; this is shown to produce counter intuitive evaluations by CRPS. Benchmark forecasts from empirical models like <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Climatology</b> place the scores in context. Comparing scores for forecast systems based on physical models (in this case HadCM 3, from the CMIP 5 decadal archive) against such benchmarks is more informative than internal comparison systems based on similar physical simulation models with each other. It is shown that a forecast system based on HadCM 3 out performs <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Climatology</b> in decadal global mean temperature hindcasts; <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Climatology</b> previously outperformed a forecast system based upon HadGEM 2 and reasons for these results are suggested. Forecasts of aggregate data (5 -year means of global mean temperature) are, of course, narrower than forecasts of annual averages due to the suppression of variance; while the average “distance” between the forecasts and a target {{may be expected to}} decrease, little if any discernible improvement in probabilistic skill is achieved...|$|E

40|$|In {{any actual}} forecast, the future {{evolution}} {{of the system is}} uncertain and the forecasting model is mathematically imperfect. Both, ontic uncertainties in the future (due to true stochasticity) and epistemic uncertainty of the model (reﬂecting structural imperfections) complicate the construction and evaluation of probabilistic forecast. In almost all nonlinear forecast models, the evolution of uncertainty in time is not tractable analytically and Monte Carlo approaches (”ensemble forecasting”) are widely used. This thesis advances our understanding of the construction of forecast densities from ensembles, the {{evolution of the}} resulting probability forecasts and methods of establishing skill (benchmarks). A novel method of partially correcting the model error is introduced and shown to outperform a competitive approach. The properties of Kernel dressing, a method of transforming ensembles into probability density functions, are investigated and the convergence of the approach is illustrated. A connection between forecasting and Information theory is examined by demonstrating that Kernel dressing via minimization of Ignorance implicitly leads to minimization of Kulback-Leibler divergence. The Ignorance score is critically examined in the context of other Information theory measures. The method of <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Climatology</b> is introduced as a new approach to establishing skill (benchmarking). <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Climatology</b> is a new, relatively simple, nearest neighbor based model shown to be of value in benchmarking of global circulation models of the ENSEMBLES project. ENSEMBLES is a project funded by the European Union bringing together all major European weather forecasting institutions in order to develop and test state-of-the-art seasonal weather forecasting models. Via benchmarking the seasonal forecasts of the ENSEMBLES models we demonstrate that <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Climatology</b> can help us better understand the value and forecasting performance of large scale circulation models. Lastly, a new approach to correcting (improving) imperfect model is presented, an idea inspired by [63]. The main idea is based on a two-stage procedure where a second stage ‘corrective’ model iteratively corrects systematic parts of forecasting errors produced by a ﬁrst stage ‘core’ model. The corrector is of an iterative nature so that at a given time t the core model forecast is corrected and then used as an input into the next iteration of the core model to generate a time t + 1 forecast. Using two nonlinear systems we demonstrate that the iterative corrector is superior to alternative approaches based on direct (non-iterative) forecasts. While the choice of the corrector model class is ﬂexible, we use radial basis functions. Radial basis functions are frequently used in statistical learning and/or surface approximations and involve a number of computational aspects which we discuss in some detail...|$|E

For most applications it is important that the climatology represents not only long term mean values but also the links between ozone and dynamic input parameters. These dynamic input parameters should be easily accessible from auxiliary datasets or easily measureable, and obviously should have a high correlation with ozone. For ozone profile these parameters are mainly total ozone column and temperature profile data. This was the outcome of a user consultation carried out in the framework of developing a new, <b>dynamic</b> ozone profile <b>climatology.</b> The new ozone profile climatology is based on the Neural Network Ozone Retrieval System (NNORSY) widely used for ozone profile retrieval from UV and IR satellite sounder data. NNORSY allows implicit modelling of any non-linear correspondence between input parameters (predictors) and ozone profile target vector. This paper presents the approach, setup and validation of a new family of ozone profile climatologies with static as well as dynamic input parameters (total ozone and temperature profile). The neural network training relies on ozone profile measurement data of well known quality provided by ground based (ozonesondes) and satellite based (SAGE II, HALOE, and POAM-III) measurements over the years 1995 – 2007. In total, four different combinations (modes) for input parameters (date, geolocation, total ozone column and temperature profile) are available. The geophysical validation spans from pole to pole using independent ozonesonde, lidar and satellite data (ACE-FTS, AURA-MLS) for individual and time series comparisons as well as for analysing the vertical and meridian structure of different modes of the NNORSY ozone profile climatology.

40|$|ABSTRACT-Within the {{framework}} of a detailed <b>dynamic</b> <b>climatology</b> of the large-scale circulation over the Northern Hemisphere, data from 15 yr of daily 700 -mb maps havc been used to investigate the temporal behavior of hemispherically averaged geostrophic zonal and meridional indices. A number of such indices were derived for both fixed and variable latitude bands. Their mean annual pattern, interannual variability, and time history through the 15 yr of record have been established. The absence of statistically significant correlations between zonal and meridional flow on a short-term time scale (days to weeks) is established, while high correlations are apparent on the annual scale. The 15 -yr record also indicates the sensitivity of the meridional indices to changes in the analysis techniques used to derive the hemispheric gridpoint data from the raw radiosonde observations. Finally, the capability of attaining a high resolution in time (about 3 days on the average) because of the daily data record allows a much more detailed description of the annual change in the large-scale circulation character than was previously possible by means of monthly averages. Certain times of the year appear to be fairly quiet while, at other times, distinct breaks in the circulation patterns are evident. This is a first indication that hemispheric wide singularities indeed exist. 1...|$|E

40|$|While {{state-of-the-art}} {{models of}} Earth's climate system have improved tremendously {{over the last}} 20 years, nontrivial structural flaws still hinder their ability to forecast the decadal dynamics of the Earth system realistically. Contrasting the skill of these models not only with each other but also with empirical models can reveal the space and time scales on which simulation models exploit their physical basis effectively and quantify their ability to add information to operational forecasts. The skill of decadal probabilistic hindcasts for annual global-mean and regional-mean temperatures from the EU Ensemble-Based Predictions of Climate Changes and Their Impacts (ENSEMBLES) project is contrasted with several empirical models. Both the ENSEMBLES models and a "dynamic climatology" empirical model show probabilistic skill above that of a static climatology for global-mean temperature. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>climatology</b> model, however, often outperforms the ENSEMBLES models. The fact that empirical models display skill {{similar to that of}} today's state-of-the-art simulation models suggests that empirical forecasts can improve decadal forecasts for climate services, just as in weather, medium-range, and seasonal forecasting. It is suggested that the direct comparison of simulation models with empirical models becomes a regular component of large model forecast evaluations. Doing so would clarify the extent to which state-of-the-art simulation models provide information beyond that available from simpler empirical models and clarify current limitations in using simulation forecasting for decision support. Ultimately, the skill of simulation models based on physical principles is expected to surpass that of empirical models in a changing climate; their direct comparison provides information on progress toward that goal, which is not available in model-model intercomparisons...|$|E

S. Calculations of 81 mainly kinematic/dynamic variables are made at mandatOlY upper levels. The 24 cases used for each sample are drawn from the period 1979 - 1986. The area studied includes much of the lower elevations of the Mid-Atlan-tic and New England states. Only SELS events occurring within 3 hours after standard upper-air sounding times (0000 and 1200 UTC) {{are added to the}} SELS sample. Calculations of each variable are made at a reference point located near the reported severe convective location for SELS events and at Trenton, New Jersey for the non-SELS events. A t-test is per-formed to determine if {{there was a significant difference}} between the two samples for each variable. The significance testing reveals that 21 of the 81 variables had sample mean differences that are significant at the ten percent level or better. Compared to the non-SELS convective sample, the SELS environment tended to be a bit warmer and drier in the lower troposphere, had a steeper lapse rate in the mid-troposphere, had more convergent lower-tropospheric winds, had less cyclonic flow in the mid-troposphere, and had slowerflow speed in the upper-troposphere. The absolute differ-ences tended to be small even for variables having significant sample differences, indicating that the environment above the boundary layer just prior to a severe convective event is only marginally different to that for ordinary convection for the variables tested. 1...|$|E

As a result this subject is being reviewed separately (Yarnal, 1985; Yarnal and Kiladis, 1985). Several books containing sections relevant to this review have appeared recently. After a prolonged gestation period, Volume 15 in the World Survey of Climatology series has been published (Van Loon, 1984). This volume covers the climate of the ocean areas of the world- plus Iceland- an area representing about 70 per cent of the earth’s surface. Yet one for which little information has been available. Two other data-sparse, but greatly contrasting areas, {{have been the subject}} of books; Papua New Guinea (McAlpine et al., 1983) and Antarctica (Schwerdtfeger, 1984). All have a modern approach to climatology and, wherever possible, include sections on a wide range of circulation features as well as the heat balance. Another major work (Houghton, 1984), aims to explain the main lines of research in the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) though much of the book lies outside the scope of this review.

O objetivo desta pesquisa é fornecer diretrizes para coleta de dados experimentais de temperatura, visto que não existe uma norma adequada que oriente este procedimento metodológico em edificações. Esta investigação foi realizada a partir das abordagens espacial e {{temporal}} da Climatologia Dinâmica, como forma de conhecer a influência das flutuações do tempo meteorológico (episódios climáticos), sobre os valores das temperaturas internas das duas edificações experimentais. As séries de dados de temperaturas de bulbo seco e superficiais internas foram coletadas em uma células de teste com cobertura verde e outra com telhado cerâmico convencional, por meio de termopares instalados em locais prédeterminados. Os dados de radiação solar global e das principais variáveis climáticas foram registrados pela estação meteorológica automática do Centro de Ciências da Engenharia Aplicadas ao Meio Ambiente (CCEAMA), da Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos (EESC-USP). Os resultados foram analisados a partir da elaboração de gráficos e tabelas, com auxílio das cartas sinóticas e imagens de satélite, para identificação do episódio representativo e escolha dos dois dias típicos experimentais. Concluiu-se que, em cada célula de teste, a distribuição das temperaturas superficiais internas é praticamente uniforme, mas em relação à temperatura de bulbo seco existe um pequeno gradiente vertical de temperatura na célula convencional. Neste sentido, as temperaturas superficiais podem ser coletadas de qualquer ponto, desde que a superfície seja uniforme. Para as coletas de temperaturas de bulbo seco é recomendado que sejam realizadas em local equidistante de todas as superfícies, mas a altura para posicionamento dos sensores poderá variar de acordo com cada estudo. Portanto, este trabalho contribuirá de maneira significativa para futuros estudos na área da conforto humano e adequação ambiental de edificações.

This research was based on the spatial and temporal approaches of <b>dynamic</b> <b>climatology</b> to know the influence of weather fluctuations (climatic episodes) on internal temperatures of values. The data series of dry bulb temperature and internal surface temperatures were measured in a test cell with green roof and the other with conventional ceramic roof by thermocouples installed at predetermined locations. The data of solar radiation and the main climatic variables were recorded by the automatic weather station at the Center of Science Engineering Applied to the Environment (CCEAMA), School of Engineering of São Carlos (EESC-USP). The results were analyzed by means of charts and tables, and verified by satellite imagery and synoptic maps for the identification of the representative episode and choice of two typical experimental days. The results led {{to the conclusion that the}} distribution of the internal surface temperature is almost uniform in the two test cells, but in relation to the dry bulb temperature there is a small vertical temperature gradient in the conventional cell. In this way, the surface temperature can be collected at any point, provided that the surface is uniform.
