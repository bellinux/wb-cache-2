5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other <b>high-tech</b> <b>companies</b> such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E

Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington public utility districts to ensure flow, flood control, and power generation objectives are met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are required to meet standards under the US Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association of}} <b>high-tech</b> <b>company</b> IPO underpricing with fundamental risk. The objective {{of the study is}} to analyze academic literature on <b>high-tech</b> <b>company</b> valuation, IPO underpricing and why these specific valuation environments are considered as uncertain. Moreover, the study discusses about the fundamental value of company and most importantly, fundamental risk and its implications on <b>high-tech</b> <b>company</b> valuation and IPO underpricing. The primary objective of the study is by using statistical analyses to study whether IPO underpricing is associated with fundamental risk in high-tech context. The study is quantitative in nature and the research question is being analyzed both with OLS regression and logistic regression models. The sample of the study covers <b>high-tech</b> <b>company</b> IPOs during 1990 - 2011 specified by SIC and NAICS industry codes. The analysis studies whether IPO underpricing is associated with fundamental risk and moreover, whether fundamental risk is associated differently with different levels of underpricing. The results indicate that IPO underpricing is not primarily the cause of fundamental risk. However, analyzing the independent variables more in-depth interesting relations are found that support the findings of prior literature on the association of fundamental risk and IPO underpricing. Moreover, the results from logistic regression give more insight about the relation between different levels of underpricing and fundamental risk...|$|R
