5|$|The {{intricacies of}} Laotian affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese {{interference}} in them, {{led to a}} mutual policy of each ignoring the other, {{at least in the}} public eye. However, this didn't prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Laos's neutrality by protecting and expanding their supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention {{came in the form of}} building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its <b>fight</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Communists and constantly bombing the trail.

5|$|A {{major element}} of the plot {{is based on the}} wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), {{released}} in 1964. Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai ("Buddhist Palm style"), from a young age and used it at the end of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast's name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), and the <b>fight</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Landlady and her husband are also references to the Palm of Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it. Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha's wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer to themselves as Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha's The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{struggle}} which threatened {{to ruin the}} Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society. The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district. This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the <b>fight</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.|$|E
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to <b>fight</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E

5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss <b>fight</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E

5|$|As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light {{features}} {{a variety of}} firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player uses in combat. The game's protagonist, Artyom, also {{has the ability to}} kill an enemy directly with his melee weapon. Artyom has three weapons slots. Players can put any weapon into these slots without restriction. Players have access to four different secondary weapons, including throwing knives, claymores, incendiary grenades, and hand grenades. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack the player in swarms, while humans <b>fight</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same firearms available to the player. The player can knock out or kill most human enemies instead of shooting them, using stealth to avoid detection. As enemies are inefficient in spotting the player character in darkness, players can turn off oil lamps and light bulbs to gain an advantage over their opponents.|$|E

5|$|As the GTA and PVE launch further {{attacks on}} the Shivans, it is quickly {{discovered}} that what is left is unorganised, leading the alliance to co-ordinate a full invasion of their main strongholds, as other systems they occupied slowly return under Terran and Vasudan control. But as the last remaining threat from the Shivans is crushed, officers in the highest echelons of the GTI effect an attempt to cover-up plans for a coup against the GTA by going after the Krios, the only ship aware of the plot and thus {{a threat to their}} plans. However, the pilots sent out by the Krios during the final <b>fight</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Shivans, return early, arriving in time to discover the treason and alert GTA command. Realising that much of the GTI has gone rogue and fighting against the alliance, the remnants of the GTI loyal to the GTA cause is merged with its battle-groups and begins conducting operations to bring down the ringleaders, including the capture of the Repulse.|$|E
5|$|Augusta, Lady Gregory retold many of {{the legends}} of Cú Chulainn in her 1902 book Cuchulain of Muirthemne, which paraphrased the originals but also romanticized some of the tales and omitted most of the more violent content. This first {{translation}} was very popular, supported by the Celtic Revival movement. It featured an introduction by her friend William Butler Yeats, who wrote several pieces based on the legend, including the plays On Baile's Strand (1904), The Green Helmet (1910), At the Hawk's Well (1917), The Only Jealousy of Emer (1919) and The Death of Cuchulain (1939), and a poem, Cuchulain's <b>Fight</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sea (1892).|$|E
