25|$|On September 5, after further {{evidence}} {{was written in}} the record and the prosecution and defense made their closing statements, Ward formally sentenced Heirens to three life terms. As Heirens waited to be transferred to Stateville Prison from the Cook County Jail, Sheriff Michael Mulcahy asked Heirens if Suzanne Degnan suffered when she was killed. Heirens answered:I can't tell you if she suffered, Sheriff Mulcahy. I didn't kill her. Tell Mr. Degnan to please look after his other daughter, because whoever killed Suzanne <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
25|$|Amarthiel's captain Mordrambor breaks free, killing many Rangers. Soon {{he leads}} an army out of Annúminas, to find Amarthiel's Ring, Narchuil. The player {{attempts}} to find Narchuil before Amarthiel can, searching the ancient ruins of the Trollshaws. After much searching, it turns out Narmeleth, Laerdan's daughter, who originally caused Amarthiel's fall in Fornost, has become possessed by her. But all searching seems in vain, when it is revealed Amarthiel has already found Narchuil. However, Elrond does not fall for her trickery again; he realizes Narchuil <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and Laerdan knows where.|$|E

Once the countdown until detonation has begun, Cortana directs the Chief to a fighter still docked in the Pillar of Autumn hangar. Gunning the engines, the Chief and Cortana escape the ring just as the Autumn explodes, ending {{the threat of the}} Flood. Cortana scans for survivors and realizes that they are seemingly the only two who have survived. Cortana tells the Master Chief that the fight is finished, to which the Chief replies, [...] "No. The Covenant <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and Earth is at risk.

2500|$|In {{a review}} in the Sunday Herald Sun Bryan Patterson gave Like It Like That a 4 out of 5 star rating and said, [...] "Happily, Sebastian's big soul songs have more of an upbeat New York sound than the slick and imposed LA {{production}} {{that seems to be}} the fate of most Idol winners. It is now time to forgive and forget that Sebastian had his start in a sometimes exploitative and often tacky TV talent show. When you're good – really good – inauspicious starts don't really matter Sebastian has paid his dues and finally found his sound. And it's good music, all written or co-written by the young man." [...] The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying, [...] "Sebastian steps up in songwriting and performance on the soul tracks which were no doubt inspired by his Memphis sessions detour. [...] "All to Myself" [...] is a knock-out song, and book-end song [...] "Attention" [...] is a sexy, hip-swinging soul number which perfectly showcases Sebastian's vocal range." [...] American radio announcer and music journalist Tony Peters wrote, [...] "Great soul music <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> you just gotta hunt for it. In this case, that means going halfway around the world. [...] "All to Myself" [...] and [...] "Attention" [...] both have that classic Motown stompin' feel that makes you move your feet, while [...] "Bring Yourself" [...] has conversational lyrics akin to Stevie Wonder's best work. Sebastian had a hand in composing the entire album, and he doesn't just re-write classic soul songs. He's obviously immersed himself in the genre and can truly add to it." ...|$|E

This isn’t like Captain America with the Winter Soldier story and Cap’s really gone. This is an ongoing story, another chapter in the life of Batman, so I think even people who are fans of Bruce and who think no one else can be Batman will be entertained by this.

The letter was of the reminiscent [...] "do you remember" [...] kind--a wistful letter of backward glances. And, amongst other things, [...] "surely you remember old Nelson," [...] he wrote.|$|R

40|$|Scientists have {{described}} around 1. 5 million species on Earth - {{but how many}} <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to <b>be</b> discovered? This {{is one of the}} most heated debates in biology. Discounting microbes, plausible estimates range from about half a million to more than 50 million species of unknown animals, plants and fungi. This biodiversity matters because it could be used to fight human diseases, produce new crops, and offer innovations to help solve the world's problems. Why is there so much uncertainty in the numbers? The biggest reason, I argue, is that a lot of biodiversity is surprisingly hard to find or identify. This has profound implications for nature conservation and for our understanding of life on Earth...|$|R
