5|$|Welded {{titanium}} {{pipe and}} process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) {{are used in}} the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in Oil & Gas <b>downhole</b> applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery). Other applications include ultrasonic welding, wave soldering, and sputtering targets.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or <b>downhole</b> heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, America's first {{district}} heating system in Boise, Idaho was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1900. The first known {{building in the}} world to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County, Oregon, whose construction was completed in 1907. A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charlie Lieb developed the first <b>downhole</b> heat exchanger in 1930 to heat his house. Steam and hot water from geysers began heating homes in Iceland starting in 1943.|$|E
25|$|On wells {{with gas}} lift capability, many {{operators}} consider it prudent {{to install a}} valve, which will isolate the Aannulus {{for the same reasons}} a DHSV may be needed to isolate the production tubing in order to prevent the inventory of natural gas <b>downhole</b> from becoming a hazard as it became on Piper Alpha.|$|E
25|$|In the oil industry, calcium {{carbonate}} {{is added to}} drilling fluids as a formation-bridging and filtercake-sealing agent; {{it is also a}} weighting material which increases the density of drilling fluids to control the <b>downhole</b> pressure. Calcium carbonate is added to swimming pools, as a pH corrector for maintaining alkalinity and offsetting the acidic properties of the disinfectant agent.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1940s, {{radioactive}} tracers {{have been used}} by the oil industry. Tagged at the surface, water is then tracked <b>downhole,</b> using the appropriated gamma detector, to determine flows and detect underground leaks. I-131 has been the most widely used tagging isotope in an aqueous solution of sodium iodide. It is used to characterize the hydraulic fracturing fluid to help determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
500|$|Rotary {{drilling}} is {{the main}} method of drilling for minerals and {{it has also been}} used for ice drilling. It uses a string of drill pipe rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. [...] The cuttings are removed from the fluid {{at the top of the}} hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire <b>downhole</b> assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the <b>downhole</b> motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. [...] The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the <b>downhole</b> assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. [...] Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E

50|$|The {{alternative}} to surface generated steam is <b>downhole</b> steam generation that reduces heat loss and maintains high quality steam in the reservoir {{that allows for}} more heavy oil and oil sands production at a faster rate. <b>Downhole</b> steam generators were first proposed by the major oil companies in the early 1960s. Over the last 50 years multiple <b>downhole</b> steam technologies have been developed such as the DOE and SANDIA <b>downhole</b> combustion system known as Project Deep Steam that was field tested in Long Beach, CA in 1982, but was a failure.

50|$|Bailers are <b>downhole</b> {{tools that}} are {{generally}} long and tubular shaped, {{and are used}} for both getting samples of <b>downhole</b> solids (sand, scale, asphaltines, rust, rubber and debris from well servicing operations) and for 'bailing' the unwanted <b>downhole</b> solids from the well. Bailers are attached either via threaded connection or releasable <b>downhole</b> tool to the wireline toolstring, and are manipulated from surface by the wireline operator. Bailers usually have an interchangeable bottom (the shoe) which also houses a check to keep the solids from falling or washing out of the bottom.|$|E
50|$|Intelligent {{completion}} {{technology is}} designed to optimize well, production and reservoir management processes by enabling operators to remotely monitor and control well inflow or injection <b>downhole,</b> at the reservoir, without physical intervention.

50|$|Slickline {{looks like}} a long, smooth, unbraided wire, often shiny, silver/chrome in appearance. It comes in varying lengths, {{according}} to the depth of wells in the area it is used (it can be ordered to specification) up to 35,000 feet in length. It is used to lower and raise <b>downhole</b> tools used in oil and gas well maintenance to the appropriate depth of the drilled well. In use and appearance it is connected by the drum it is spooled off of {{in the back of}} the slickline truck to the wireline sheave a round wheel grooved and sized to accept a specified line and positioned to redirect the line to another sheave that will allow the slickline to enter the wellbore. Slickline is used to lower <b>downhole</b> tools into an oil or gas well to perform a specified maintenance job <b>downhole.</b> <b>Downhole</b> refers to the area in the pipe below surface, the pipe being either the casing cemented in the hole by the drilling rig (which keeps the drilled hole from caving in and pressure from the various oil or gas zones <b>downhole</b> from feeding into one another) or the tubing, a smaller diameter pipe hung inside the casing.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly, seismic {{interferometry}} {{is finding}} a place in exploration and production. SI can image dipping sediments adjacent to salt domes. Complex salt geometries are poorly resolved using traditional seismic reflection techniques. An alternative method calls {{for the use of}} <b>downhole</b> sources and receivers adjacent to subsurface salt features. It is often difficult to generate an ideal seismic signal in a <b>downhole</b> location. Seismic interferometry can virtually move a source into a <b>downhole</b> location to better illuminate and capture steeply dippingsediments on the flank of a salt dome. In this case, the SI result was very similar to that obtained using an actual <b>downhole</b> source. Seismic interferometry can locate the position of an unknown source and is often utilized in hydrofrac applications to map the extent of induced fractures. It is possible that interferometric techniques can be applied to timelapse seismic monitoring of subtle changes in reservoir properties in the subsurface.|$|E

Permanent <b>downhole</b> gauges continue to evolve into many different types of sensors.|$|E
50|$|Spontaneous {{potential}} can {{be measured}} by placing one probe of a voltmeter at the Earth's surface (called surface electrode) and the other probe in the borehole (called <b>downhole</b> electrode), where the SP is to be measured.

50|$|These {{tools are}} {{primarily}} used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) {{located in the}} tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a <b>downhole</b> tool attached to the wireline toolstring {{that is used to}} 'run' another tool that is meant to be left <b>downhole</b> when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a <b>downhole</b> 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected <b>downhole</b> profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection {{to the top of a}} variety of different tools, including but not limited to, <b>downhole</b> chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop <b>downhole</b> tool which is pinned in place.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the arrival}} of modern <b>downhole</b> motors and better tools to measure {{inclination}} and azimuth of the hole, directional drilling and horizontal drilling was much slower than vertical drilling due {{to the need to}} stop regularly and take time-consuming surveys, and due to slower progress in drilling itself (lower rate of penetration). These disadvantages have shrunk over time as <b>downhole</b> motors became more efficient and semi-continuous surveying became possible.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>downhole</b> {{safety valves}} {{installed}} {{as part of}} the completion design are classed as [...] "tubing retrievable".
