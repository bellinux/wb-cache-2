5|$|Arran {{also has}} three rare endemic species of tree, the Arran Whitebeams. These are the Scottish or Arran {{whitebeam}}, the cut-leaved whitebeam and the Catacol whitebeam, which are amongst the most endangered tree {{species in the}} world. They are found in a protected national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 283 Arran whitebeam and 236 cut-leaved whitebeam were recorded as mature trees in 1980.

Consequently, the services of the NZRFU-appointed coach Jimmy Duncan were not used; his appointment had caused opposition from many in the squad who believed his expertise was not required, and that an extra player should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> on tour instead. After a six-week voyage, the team arrived in Plymouth, England on 8September 1905.|$|E

5|$|Gram {{quantities}} of various copper salts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and {{the generation of}} reactive oxygen species that damage DNA. Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits {{has been reported to}} be at least 3 ppm in the diet. However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency, growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.|$|E
5|$|Many {{vegetarian}} {{restaurants and}} producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher.

Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.|$|E

5|$|The Penguin Jazz Guide {{commented that}} Hope's {{compositions}} were strongly melodic, with some containing concepts of fugue and canon taken from classical music, but retaining foundations in the blues.

5|$|Two further hat-tricks <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> in women's Tests; by Pakistan's Shaiza Khan in 2004, and Australia's Rene Farrell in 2011. Farrell's hat-trick {{is one of}} five in women's {{international}} cricket {{that did}} not involve a fielder, as two of the batsmen were dismissed leg before wicket (lbw), and one was bowled. Sana Mir's WT20I hat-trick in 2015 similarly contained two lbws and one bowled, while Julie Harris' women's One Day International (WODI) hat-trick during the 1993 Women's Cricket World Cup and Rumana Ahmed (WODI) hat-trick in 2016 ware both made up of three consecutive lbws and Dane van Niekerk (WODI) hat-trick in 2013 had two bowled and one lbw. The first hat-trick in women's One Day Internationals was made just six days prior to Harris', by Carole Hodges, during the same competition. Those remain the only hat-tricks to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> in women's World Cups, though Ekta Bisht took a hat-trick for India during the 2012 Women's World Twenty20, the equivalent competition for women's Twenty20 International cricket.|$|E
