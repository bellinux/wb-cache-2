When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2s songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the success}} of the singer's 1993 career best-selling album Music Box, Carey and her {{management}} at Columbia Records began devising ideas and strategies for subsequent projects. Carey's then-husband, Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia's parent label Sony Music Entertainment, began mapping out possible follow ups for the singer during the pinnacle years of her career. During initial discussions regarding the thought of doing a Christmas-themed album with Carey and her writing partner of over four years, Walter Afanasieff, fear arose that it was not commercially expedient or wise to release holiday music at the peak of one's career, as it was more often equated with a release towards the end of a musician's waning career. Afanasieff recalled his sentiments during initial discussions for a holiday record: [...] "Back then, you didn't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums. It wasn't a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs. So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday, 'Hey, you know, we're putting out a Christmas album. No big deal.'" [...] Ultimately, with Mottola's persistence and Carey's initiative to be a [...] "risk-taker" [...] as Afanasieff put it, the song and its parent album, Merry Christmas, began taking form in early-mid 1994. Recording for the album began in June, while the Carey-Afanasieff songwriting duo penned [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] in late August. Often referencing herself a festive person and demonstrating a usual penchant for her love of all things Christmas, Carey began decorating the home she shared with Mottola in upstate New York (which also came equipped with a personal recording studio) with Christmas ornaments and other holiday-inspired trinkets. In doing so, Carey felt she could capture the essence and spirit of what she was singing and make her vocal performance and delivery more emotive and authentic. The songwriting pair carved out the chords, structure and melody for the song in just a quarter of an hour: [...] "It's definitely not 'Swan Lake,' ' admits Afanasieff. 'But that's why it's so popular — because it's so simple and palatable!". At first, Afanasieff admitted that he was puzzled and [...] "blanched" [...] as to where Carey wanted to take the melody and vocal scales, though she was [...] "adamant" [...] in her direction for the song. In an interview with Billboard, Afanasieff described the type of relationship he and Carey shared in the studio and as songwriters for the song and in general:It was always the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we finished writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic Sings. 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.Then for the next week or two Mariah would call me and say, 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> bit?' We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the sessions began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.Afanasieff flew back to California where he finished the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments with the thought of giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, but for the most part people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E

Although Dirac’s work describing the electromagnetic force was the logical sequel to a brief but intense development of the new quantum theory, it promptly gave rise to seemingly insurmountable difficulties. In a letter written in February 1928, Wolfgang Pauli suggested to Dirac that {{a fundamental change in}} perspective would likely be needed. Working with Werner Heisenberg, Pauli had calculated the self-energy of a single electron interacting with its own electromagnetic field. The value, they were chagrined to learn, turned out to be infinite. “What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this?</b> ” Pauli challenged. During the 1930 s, QFT was the instrument for important developments such as Enrico Fermi’s theory of beta decay (1934) and, {{at the end of the}} decade, Pauli’s derivation of the connection between spin, Bose-Einstein statistics, and Fermi-Dirac statistics.

40|$|Contract farming- a safer option? CUE: For {{small-scale}} farmers, {{increasing their}} production of cash crops {{can be a}} big risk. For while food crops can be eaten, cash crops are only valuable if they can be sold, and sold for a good enough price to repay the costs of production, harvesting, packaging and transport. Millions of farmers remain at a subsistence level of production, because for them the risk of growing a crop that they cannot sell is too great. But some have found {{a way out of this}} poverty trap through contract farming. In Tanzania, for example, the Multi-flower company has made contracts with numerous small-scale farmers, who produce flower seeds for export to Holland. Lazarus Laiser spoke to Evaline Swai, a buyer for Multi-flower to find out whether contract farming had proved to be a successful way for their small-scale growers to cultivate and market a cash crop. Evaline begins by explaining what happens when a farmer applies to have a contract with the company. IN:		?The first one is the farmer ? OUT:		? We can?t buy your product? DUR?N	 4 ? 27 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: A secure market - one of the important benefits of contract farming. Transcript Swai	The first one is the farmer must have land, half an acre or one acre and so on. After ensuring that the farmer has land for any crops, we explain to them about flower seeds production, price, cultivating flower seeds, is it easy or difficult. All that information we give to our farmers, and later on some they agree to grow flower seeds. Laiser	Do you have anywhere to sign? Swai	Yes we have a contract, which we sign between the farmer and our company. Laiser	What happens if the supplier or the grower fails to supply the products to you? Swai	It is not normal to bring the stock seed and plant and not supply to our company. But if the weather problem is the one that can affect the supplier to supply the seeds, we can see ourselves. Because our field officer after delivering the flower seeds to our grower, the job of the field officer is to follow that grower, in order to give him the lesson in how to grow, how to cultivate. So when our field officer visits that farm, he can know what problems are facing that farmer. But if it is farmer negligence, we come back to our contract. We can give him the information about ?What do you do for our production? You will break your contract! So watch out! Do this and this!? But this problem has not occurred in our production contract. Laiser	Now is it easy for you to fail to buy the product from the grower? Swai	No, never. Because the contract shows everything: the quantity what we can expect from him, the price of that variety, maybe the month of harvesting, and so on. Everything is in our contract. So if we can refuse to purchase the product from our farmer, the contract is what he can use to stop us. Laiser	What can you say about the advantages and disadvantages of contract farming? Swai	First of all advantages, you cannot lose the market, your market is clear. Secondly you minimise your production costs. The stock seed you can receive without any payment, because we offer the stock seed to our growers free-of-charge. Also they can get how to plant from our field officers free-of-charge. Even if disease occurs on your farm you can call in the field officer from Multi-flower company, and he will come to give you advice. Thirdly, when you make a rotation for flower seeds with other crops, it is very good, because the land will be made fertile when you grow flower seeds. Laiser	Disadvantages? Swai	Maybe, maize and beans, the people watch the market. They can store the crops until the price is high, but the flower seeds you can?t. You have to harvest and sell it to the company immediately, for the same price. Laiser	What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> way of farming? Do you think it is a very good way for the farmers, that they are benefiting too? Swai	Contract farming is very good because it is helping all the sides. For the company, to keep the farmer not selling to other companies. For the grower, the standard marketing - not for the price to be higher or lower, it will be standard; if it is 10, 000 per kilo it?s 10, 000 per kilo. Without a contract, maybe you can harvest 1000 kg of flower seeds, and the company tells you ?We can?t buy your product?. End of track. For subsistence farmers who want to start growing cash crops, the danger that they will not find a good market may be a strong disincentive. Contract farming may be one solution, as it guarantees that farmers will have a market.
