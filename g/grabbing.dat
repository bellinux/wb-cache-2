5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by <b>grabbing</b> them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E

50|$|While the ADA {{guidelines}} provide {{specifics on}} {{the placement of}} <b>grab</b> bars in public locations, they do not require a specific style. The British Doc M regulations specify a minimum contrast between bars and background. Many public facilities opt for the cheapest <b>grab</b> bars, which usually have an institutional look. However, <b>grab</b> bars are actually available in many styles, finishes and colors. Manufacturers have begun to understand the need {{to blend in with}} home decor, offering <b>grab</b> bars that have style and pizazz. For the home, <b>grab</b> bars {{do not need to be}} ADA compliant, but those guidelines should be considered. In addition to straight <b>grab</b> bars, there are fold-out bars, those that clamp onto the side of the bathtub, L-shaped, U-shaped and corner <b>grab</b> bars. <b>Grab</b> bars are also made with built in LED lighting and can come in many different colours.|$|R

5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by <b>grabbing</b> one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E

50|$|One major {{difference}} between the <b>Grabber</b> and the Gravity Gun is that the <b>Grabber</b> has a limited charge, and thus can only hold onto an object for several seconds.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has investigated}} whether {{a combination of}} DEM and MBD {{can be used for}} a reliable and accurate environment for predicting <b>grab</b> unloading performance. A <b>grab</b> is a type of bulk material handling equipment used for unloading materials such as coal and iron ore from vessel to shore. Both a <b>grab</b> and iron ore pellets have been modelled and coupled into a co-simulation. Particle stiffness reductions and coarse graining techniques have been developed and applied to reduce computational costs. The developed large scale coupled grab-pellets model compared very well with validation experiments conducted on a bulk terminal with a scissors <b>grab.</b> A demonstration of virtual prototyping of <b>grabs</b> showed that when this model is implemented in the <b>grab</b> design process significant improvements in <b>grab</b> performance can be achieved.

5|$|Shiina, {{given name}} unknown, {{otherwise}} {{referred to by}} his nickname , is another adult friend of Shuichi and Yoshino. He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had many friends in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but he sometimes does bold and unexpected things, such as <b>grabbing</b> Yoshino's crotch when he first meets Yoshino because he feared that, because Yoshino was dressed as a boy at the time, Yuki might be having an illicit affair with Yoshino.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana {{was largely}} a yotsu-sumo wrestler, favouring {{techniques}} which involved <b>grabbing</b> his opponent's mawashi or belt. His preferred grip was migi-yotsu (right hand inside, left hand outside his opponent). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, a simple force out, which accounted for 52 percent of his victories. He also regularly employed uwatenage, or overarm throw, {{and this was the}} technique he used to defeat Asashōryū in the second of their two meetings, in September 2002.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the event was a Hell in a Cell bout between Batista and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship.

Batista performed a spinebuster onto the steel steps on Triple H, which was followed with a Batista Bomb for the win to retain the title. After the Hell in a Cell match, Triple H was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E
50|$|Self-dumping <b>grabs</b> {{also have}} a single {{supporting}} rope or chain. The lower girder contains a linkage mechanism with hooks which connect to the upper girder, holding the <b>grab</b> closed. When the <b>grab</b> is lowered onto the spoil, weights release the hooks and allow the <b>grab</b> to open when lifted. A lever may also be fitted {{to this type of}} mechanism to which a long trip rope can be attached which, when pulled by a banksman, releases the catches in the mechanism and allows the <b>grab</b> to open in mid air (e.g. above a lorry or a hopper). The <b>grab</b> usually is fitted with a hydraulic damper to restrict the speed of opening. The clamshell bucket on the left hand side of the photograph on this page at Cardiff is a self-dumping chain <b>grab.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} season, Chamberlain surpassed {{his rookie}} season statistics as he averaged 38.4 points and 27.2 rebounds per game. He became {{the first player to}} break the 3,000-point barrier and the first and still only player to break the 2,000-rebound barrier for a single season, <b>grabbing</b> 2,149 boards. Chamberlain also won his first field goal percentage title, and set the all-time record for rebounds in a single game with 55. Chamberlain was so dominant on the team that he scored almost 32% of his team's points and collected 30.4% of their rebounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{prevalent}} hunting strategy observed is hover gleaning, {{in which the}} tit-tyrant flies upwards from its perch and then hovers midair while <b>grabbing</b> prey from the vegetation. A third and less frequently used strategy is flycatching, in which the bird flies away from its shrub to grab prey in midair. Prey can be grabbed either close to the bird's perch or at a short distance, which often requires the bird to pursue its prey. When pairs flycatch cooperatively, one bird quietly lurks within the shrub while the other snatches nearby insects; after about a dozen attacks, the birds switch positions.|$|E
