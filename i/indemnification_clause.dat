5000|$|An {{example of}} letting the indemnitor control costs is (in this case a {{contractor}} for a homeowners association-HOA), [...] "Contractor shall indemnify, defend (by counsel reasonably acceptable to Association) and hold harmless the Association" [...] Companies and HOAs also use indemnity to protect directors, since few would serve as directors if their risks were not indemnified. Negotiation is important for both parties, [...] "Just about all homeowner association management contracts have a provision which states that the HOA shall indemnify the manager under certain circumstances... There are several ways the <b>indemnification</b> <b>clause</b> can be drafted and both management and HOA {{must take into account}} what protects each the best" ...|$|E

In order to explain why some corporations disclose {{more information on this}} topic than others, first, the literature on liability of directors, remedies against these liabilities and motives for voluntary disclosure is researched. After that, empirical research is performed to determine if listed corporations in The Netherlands significantly differ in disclosing information regarding a granted <b>indemnification</b> <b>clause</b> and a concluded directors’ and officers’ liability insurance...|$|E

For example, in California <b>indemnification</b> <b>clauses</b> do not cover certain risks unless {{the risks are}} listed in the contract, while in New York a brief clause, [...] "X shall defend and indemnify Y for all claims arising from the Product" [...] does make X responsible for all claims against Y. Indemnity can be extremely costly, since X's liability insurance typically does not cover claims against Y, but X still has to cover them.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is rooted}} in market for technologies theory and organizational economics to answer to a call for additional research on the processes and organizational mechanisms through which firms implement their patent strategies. The first chapter investigates the organizational configurations that lead to success in granting a patent and capture value from innovation. Using a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fs/QCA) of 20 firms, the chapter explores the role of different combinations of centralization of decision-making, cross-functional involvement, and codification {{of information on the}} timely ability to secure protection to an invention through patent grant. The second chapter provides a micro analysis of the overall management of the technology licensing process. Using multiple case studies, the research found two configurations to organise the capabilities and governance of decision making in technology licensing. In the first configuration, the management of licensing is based on a combination of internal flow of information, stand-alone coordination mechanisms and inside-out negotiating capabilities, which are the capabilities to convince external partners of the validity of the technology. In the second configuration, licensing is orchestrated through an external flow of information, shared coordination mechanisms and outside-in negotiating capabilities, which are the capabilities to convince members of the same organization of the validity of the license agreement and to moderate the various internal debates related to the agreement. The last chapter examines the role of <b>indemnification</b> <b>clauses</b> on intellectual property (IP) rights in the case of licensing deals and discusses the implications for the optimal design of licensing contracts. The study proposes that <b>indemnification</b> <b>clauses</b> on intellectual property rights operate as signals to share the risk and reduce moral hazard in licensing contracts. Building on market for technology literature and contract theory, the research found that the inclusion of IP <b>indemnification</b> <b>clauses</b> in technology licensing is correlated with a higher likelihood of selecting a payment schemes based on a combination of lump sum and royalty rate. Furthermore, the effect is amplified when the licensee and licensor operate in distant technological domains...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{develops}} how Washington courts {{historically have}} interpreted construction industry <b>indemnification</b> <b>clauses.</b> The Article first addresses the substantive {{and the primary}} issue of liability, vel non, under construction industry indemnification provisions. After offering a historical analysis of Washington case law on the subject, the Article analyzes the recent statutory amendments to section 4. 24. 115 of the Washington Revised Code, which substantially impact {{the current state of}} the law and which should resolve many unsettled or ambiguous issues in the case law. This Article then discusses some unique issues that have arisen in the context of attempts to judicially enforce these indemnification provisions. Finally, this Article proposes a model indemnification provision that equitably formulates the clause, taking into account the precepts enunciated in Washington case law and statutes. This Article discusses certain non-industry cases when principles enunciated in those cases bear upon issues and principles germane to the interpretation of indemnity clauses in construction industry cases. Notwithstanding this brief discussion, the primary focus of this Article is upon the interpretation and enforcement of indemnity clauses in construction industry contracts...|$|R
40|$|Because {{the cost}} and {{incidence}} of hazardous waste contamination are soaring and because the courts favor broad interpretations of CERCLA 2 ̆ 7 s liability provisions, counsel for prospective purchasers of commercial real estate must take certain prepurchase precautions to minimize potential CERCLA liability. This Comment pro- vides practical suggestions as to the aim and form of those precautions. In Part II, this Comment first examines the basic statutory framework and liability scheme of CERCLA. Part III discusses the common law principles of successor liability and their relation to CERCLA 2 ̆ 7 s liability mechanism. Finally, in Part IV, this Comment presents a variety of preventive law steps to lessen exposure to hazardous waste liability under CERCLA. Part IV begins by discussing buyers 2 ̆ 7 and sellers 2 ̆ 7 goals when negotiating a real estate purchase and the environmental risks that generally inhere in such a transaction. Part IV then demonstrates in successive subsections how to identify, evaluate, and allocate the risks of a specific purchase. This Comment provides examples of a condition, representations, and an <b>indemnification</b> <b>clause,</b> all of which may serve as protective devices in real estate contracts to allocate these risks. Part IV also considers how courts in four recent cases have responded to buyers 2 ̆ 7 and sellers 2 ̆ 7 attempts to enforce indemnity clauses to avoid CERCLA liability...|$|E
40|$|On March 31, 2010, Access Copyright {{applied to}} the Copyright Board to certify a tariff that would govern the {{relationship}} between the organization {{and the members of the}} Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) and the Association of Community Colleges of Canada (ACCC). Previously, the relationship had been governed by a series of license agreements between the organizations which had been periodically renewed. But Access Copyright chose not to seek renewal of the licenses, and {{applied to the}} Board to certify a general tariff that would cover all post-secondary institutions for the period of 2011 through 2013. Access Copyright was not merely trying to carry forward the terms of previous licensing agreements in the form of a Board certified tariff. Rather, they were seeking a tariff with a much higher rate, wider scope and broader application; one which would place new burdens on the institutions, their staff and students, and which would also jeopardize many of the rights of academic staff and students. This working paper reviews the terms of the Proposed Tariff and its progeny licenses and discusses several of the arguments that have been raised against them. The first general grouping is that many of the provisions are ambiguous, counterintuitive and are based on problematic definitions which attempt to extend the reach of the compensable activities beyond what is authorized by Canadian law. The second broad issue is the lack of value in the Proposed Tariff itself. The third general grouping deals with the audit, reporting, monitoring and survey (ARMS) provisions in the Proposed Tariff and the progeny licenses. With respect to the Proposed Tariff, we argue that several of its terms are also ultra vires the Copyright Act and would not have survived scrutiny had they been fully litigated. While recent developments have cast a new light on these issues, many of the concerns raised in this report about the Proposed Tariff remain unresolved. Despite strong arguments to the contrary, and their previous opposition to the Proposed Tariff at the Board; AUCC, ACCC and several institutions still felt that a license with Access Copyright was needed. In January 2012, Access Copyright announced they had reached licensing agreements with the University of Toronto and the University of Western Ontario, the terms of which were substantially similar to the proposed tariff. Following the “lead” of UWO and the University of Toronto, AUCC and ACCC have since announced a similar agreement with Access Copyright, resulting in a “Model License,” and they have since dropped their opposition to the Proposed Tariff at the Copyright Board. In this report, we refer to the UWO and University of Toronto agreements and the AUCC/ACCC model licenses as the “progeny” of the Proposed Tariff because despite some differences, they are substantially similar in many respects. To date, some institutions have accepted the Model License, others have rejected it, and many others had not yet announced their intentions as of the end of July 2012. This paper is divided into five sections. Following this introduction, section 2 will address some of the definitional problems in the Proposed Tariff and progeny licenses in more detail. First and foremost are the definitions of “copy” and “course collection” which increase the scope of the statutory reproduction right and create other burdens. These overbroad definitions are foundational problems with the tariff/licenses which not only exceed the scope of owners 2 ̆ 7 statutory rights, but will have the potential to substantially impede the delivery of course materials, adversely impact faculty and student privacy rights, and ultimately threaten academic freedom. The other problematic definition involves the “Secure Network,” along with various limitations that flow from this definition. The third part of this report will ask the question: What value would institutions obtain under the Proposed Tariff and its progeny licences? A review of section 3 of the Proposed Tariff and its progeny indicates that the scope of the permissions does not add very much to what is already permitted under fair dealing and other limitations and exceptions in the Copyright Act. In addition, the scope of Access Copyright 2 ̆ 7 s repertoire is ambiguous, and the value of the <b>indemnification</b> <b>clause</b> in the progeny licenses is very limited. The fourth section will turn to the audit, reporting, monitoring, and survey (ARMS) provisions in the Proposed Tariff. We argue that these measures are overbroad and ultra vires the Copyright Act. They should be substantially scaled back if not entirely eliminated from any eventual tariff order. And while these ARMS provisions have been cast in modified terms in the progeny licenses, these corresponding provisions remain highly problematic. The last section will look at the implications of more recent developments (including the UWO and UofT licenses of January 30 th, the AUCC and ACCC Model License, and the withdraw of AUCC from objector status at the Board) for the tariff proceedings which are still pending at the Board. It will close with a summary of the recommendations made throughout this report. And while a full treatment of the implications of the passage of Bill C- 11 in June and the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s historic July pentalogy is beyond the scope of this report, they will also be considered throughout this report. Therefore, the overall purpose of this report is to identify and address some of the key issues that have been raised from the outset about the Proposed Tariff dispute, as they remain largely unresolved. In addition to highlighting flaws with the Proposed Tariff and its progeny licenses, we will offer some suggestions for how an effective and fair tariff or license could be crafted. We are calling this report a Working Paper as it is very much still a work in progress given the fast pace of current developments and the still unsettled state of the issues. Many institutions have yet to announce whether they will accept or reject the model license agreement and the status of the tariff proceedings before the Copyright Board still needs to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|Some leases contain <b>indemnification</b> <b>clauses</b> that {{indemnify}} lessors, on an after-tax basis, {{for certain}} tax benefits that the lessor may lose if {{a change in}} the tax law precludes realization of those tax benefits. The issue is the appropriate accounting by the lessor and lessee for indemnification payments. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that, although the indemnification payments may appear to meet the definition of contingent rentals in Statement 13, as amended by Statement 29, such payments are not of the nature normally expected to arise under contingent rent provisions. Further, due to the close association of the payments to specific aspects of the tax law, the payments should be accounted for in a manner that recognizes the tax law association. The original lease classification should not be changed. Lessors receiving indemnification payments should allocate the payments into two parts: (1) that resulting from any investment tax credit (ITC) lost and (2) that relating to all other tax effects. The portion relating to ITC should be accounted for consistent with the lessor's Copyright © 1986, Financial Accounting Standards Boar...|$|R
