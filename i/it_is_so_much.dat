2500|$|Other views {{focused on}} other aspects, {{including}} the possible topical statements; John Loftis argues that [...] "this afterpiece {{in the form}} of ballad opera seems, in its rendering of Court gossip, to be a dramatization of Lord Hervey's Memoirs". Thomas Cleary wrote that the [...] "Grub-Street Opera is a much better play than the two-act Welsh Opera. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> improved that the impossibility of staging it [...] must have infuriated Fielding. Thomas Lockwood believes that both The Welsh Opera and The Grub-Street Opera are characterized by a [...] "spirit of fun" [...] but are complicated by the 18th-century politics that gave them birth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lure of the}} {{countryside}} could prove a distraction to an active boy, who needed to be pulled back into line. Henry Dowes wrote to Cromwell in September 1534 explaining that he had used every effort to advance Gregory in his studies, but “forcause summer was spent {{in the service of}} the wild gods, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to be regarded after what fashion youth is brought up.” However, by April 1535, Dowes was able to report to his father that [...] "his improvement is greater than at any time here before, partly because he is brought into some awe and dread, and is ready to give himself to learning when required, partly because those things which formerly alienated his mind from study are now withdrawn." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1894, Alexander III {{died and}} Nicholas mounted the throne as Emperor. At the time, Nicholas had no children, thus {{according}} {{to the laws of}} succession of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke George became Tsarevich (formally Tsesarevich, denoting the heir presumptive or heir apparent to the throne as opposed to any son of the Tsar, although the latter title fell into disuse in 1721 and was gradually supplanted by the more specific use of Tsarevich). George's ill-health had forced him to relocate to Likani. It was impossible for him to return to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his father, Alexander III. The doctors had forbidden it. Nicholas wrote to his brother, [...] "... constantly pray to God to send you a full and speedy recovery, and to comfort you, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more difficult to be alone after such great sorrow than it is for us who are at least together!" [...] George also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George wrote to his brother, [...] "I am terribly sad that I have not yet been able to see your daughters and get to know them; but what can I do! It means it's not my fate, and everything is the will of God." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] said Kate, {{giving her}} maidenly {{assurance}} when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> too late! Just {{at this moment}} Mrs. Growler came into the kitchen, and Kate's promises and her sister's cautions were for the moment silenced.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> cannot <b>be</b> doubted {{but that}} I was the easier to persuade myself {{of the truth}} of such a {{doctrine}} as this when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for my ease and for the repose of my mind to have <b>it</b> <b>be</b> so:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{could not}} give up his idea of {{provoking}} a quarrel; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the simplest way! He bent his eyes on her upturned face, with the darkest frown he could achieve. [...] "You are not discreet. You mustn't bully me!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is very kind, Mr. Lancaster," [...] said Olive, {{breaking}} the silence, [...] "for {{you to come}} to see us instead of writing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> pleasanter for friends--" ...|$|E

60|$|I am by {{no means}} sure that if the good people of Milby had known {{the truth about the}} Countess Czerlaski, they would not have been {{considerably}} disappointed to find that it was very far from being as bad as they imagined. Nice distinctions are troublesome. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> easier to say that a thing is black, than to discriminate the particular shade of brown, blue, or green, to which it really belongs. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> easier to make up your mind that your neighbour is good for nothing, than to enter into all the circumstances that would oblige you to modify that opinion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good Heaven!' said Mr Dombey, {{sweeping}} the Captain's property from him, as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> crumb indeed. 'Take these things away.
