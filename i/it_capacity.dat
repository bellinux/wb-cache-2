25|$|Evaporators are {{generally}} installed as a set, where two evaporators are coupled {{to a single}} distiller. For reliability, large ships will then have a pair of these sets. It is possible to arrange these sets of evaporators in either parallel or in series, for either maximum or most efficient production. This arranges the two evaporators so that the first operates at atmospheric pressure and high temperature (the maximum output case), but then uses the resultant hot output from the first evaporator to drive a second, running at maximum vacuum and low temperature (the maximum efficiency case). The overall output of feedwater may exceed the weight of steam first supplied, as up to 160% of <b>it.</b> <b>Capacity</b> is however reduced, to 72% of the maximum.|$|E

50|$|The {{phrase is}} also used in {{business}} computing and information technology as a synonym for capacity management. <b>IT</b> <b>capacity</b> planning involves estimating the storage, computer hardware, software and connection infrastructure resources required over some future period of time. A common concern of enterprises is whether the required resources are in place to handle an increase in users or number of interactions. Capacity management is concerned about adding central processing units (CPUs), memory and storage to a physical or virtual server. This has been the traditional and vertical way of scaling up web applications, however <b>IT</b> <b>capacity</b> planning has been developed {{with the goal of}} forecasting the requirements for this vertical scaling approach.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic premise}} of dynamic {{infrastructures}} is to leverage pooled IT resources to provide flexible <b>IT</b> <b>capacity,</b> enabling {{the allocation of}} resources in line with demand from business processes. This is achieved by using server virtualization technology to pool computing resources wherever possible, and allocating these resources on-demand using automated tools. This allows for load balancing and is a more efficient approach than keeping massive computing resources in reserve to run tasks that take place, for example, once a month, but are otherwise under-utilized.|$|E

50|$|The higher heat {{capacity}} of liquids allows for more dense IT environments and higher <b>IT</b> <b>capacity.</b> With most liquid technologies, the IT itself becomes more efficient. This {{is caused by}} the reduced or eliminated dependence on air handling within the IT chassis. Individual components are cooled more effectively and can therefore be used with higher amounts of energy and closer to each other. When liquid penetrates the IT space, internal fans are reduced or completely eliminated which saves energy. This also reduces the emergency power requirements within the facility.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{improvements}} to the station were undertaken at the station in 1939.

50|$|SpectreRF is {{an option}} to the Spectre Circuit Simulator from Cadence Design Systems. It adds a series of {{analyses}} that are particularly useful for RF circuits to the basic capabilities of Spectre. SpectreRF was first released in 1996 and was notable for three reasons. First, it was arguably the first RF simulator {{in that it was}} the first to be designed for large bipolar and CMOS RF circuits; it used shooting methods as its base algorithm; and it pioneered the use of Krylov subspace methods. The use of shooting methods gave SpectreRF remarkable robustness and the Krylov methods gave <b>it</b> <b>capacity</b> that was roughly 100 times greater than existing simulators at the time. Previously such simulators were designed to simulate very small GaAs integrated circuits and hybrids. These simulators were based on harmonic balance and could reliably simulate circuits with tens of transistors whereas SpectreRF could simulate circuits with thousands of transistors.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{observers}} {{disagree that}} any meaningful [...] "productivity paradox" [...] exists and others, while acknowledging the disconnect between <b>IT</b> <b>capacity</b> and spending, view it {{less as a}} paradox than a series of unwarranted assumptions {{about the impact of}} technology on productivity. In the latter view, this disconnect is emblematic of our need to understand and {{do a better job of}} deploying the technology that becomes available to us rather than an arcane paradox that by its nature is difficult to unravel. Some point to historical parallels with the steam engine and with electricity, where the dividends of a productivity-enhancing disruptive technology were reaped only slowly, with an initial lag, over the course of decades, due to the time required for the technologies to diffuse into common use, and due to the time required to reorganize around and master efficient use of the new technology. As with previous technologies, an extremely large number of initial cutting-edge investments in IT were counterproductive and over-optimistic. Some modest IT-based gains may have been difficult to detect amid the apparent overall slowing of productivity growth, which is generally attributed to one or more of a variety of non-IT factors, such as oil shocks, increased regulation or other cultural changes, a hypothetical decrease in labor quality, a hypothetical exhaustion or slowdown in non-IT innovation, and/or a coincidence of sector-specific problems.|$|E
