5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine <b>is</b> <b>given</b> shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose <b>is</b> <b>given</b> at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination <b>is</b> <b>given</b> at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination <b>is</b> <b>given</b> during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E
