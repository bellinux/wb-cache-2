5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} {{the validity of}} the species as early as 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> an aberrant and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E

It was reportedly the size of a horse, with a spotted body covered in scales.

Despite many aviation historians disputing the claim, it still appears in current accounts of the sinking of the Bismarck.|$|E

5|$|In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen {{offered a}} {{different}} approach. Answering criticisms {{that there was}} no mention of this incident in any of the many non-Christian sources, he insisted that it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside. To suggestions <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> an eclipse, Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark, which make no mention of the sun.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> good public relations, and any revenue that arose from the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E

Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action. It's possible that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> constraining itself, but that strategy is a mistake. It should have been put into action immediately. Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter-attacked.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2008, Ice {{was arrested}} in Palm Beach County on a battery charge for {{allegedly}} kicking and hitting his wife. He was released the following day after she declared {{that her husband had}} only pushed her. In court, the couple's neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> a verbal argument. Ice was ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Ice that he could only contact his wife via telephone. On April 29, 2008, Ice's lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the case dropped after providing the state attorney with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the system}} was not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that {{the system was}} indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> subtropical.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> his personal opinion.|$|E

5|$|In {{military}} affairs, {{the use of}} infantry with specialised roles increased. Along {{with the}} still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use {{partly because of the}} increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries. The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour. Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> used as an explosive and not as a weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who {{is unable to}} have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father. As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> a trick to frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Romani has, however, been {{surrounded}} with controversy and criticism. It {{has been suggested}} that, like {{the attack on the}} Suez Canal in 1915, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> a raid to disrupt maritime traffic rather than a determined attempt to gain control of the canal. That the Ottoman Empire's intention was to strongly occupy Romani and Kantara is supported by preparations in the southern territory of Palestine adjacent to, and extending into, the Sinai. These included extending the Palestine railway system to Wadi El Arish, with a good motor road beside the railway. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that place just before the Battle of Magdhaba.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{religion in}} Aalborg {{as in the}} rest of Denmark is Christianity. Aalborg is the seat of a bishop within the Lutheran State Church of Denmark. The cathedral of this bishopric is the Budolfi Church, originally built no later than 1132 by Viborg's Bishop Eskil. This church was considerably smaller than the current one, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> a parish church. The existing structure was completed in the late 14th century, {{on the grounds of the}} former church, and was listed for the first time in the Atlas of Denmark in 1399. The church was named after St Botolph, an English abbot and saint. The church is constructed in the Gothic style. In 1554 Aalborg was made a diocese and, after consideration, St Budolfi Church was made the seat of the Bishop of Aalborg. Aalborg is also home to the former Catholic church, the Abbey of Our Lady, converted from a Benedictine nunnery.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, {{there were many}} other occupations. The pig-breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> utilized by a poor scholar {{to pay for a}} formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military background or a title as marquess was the pig-breeder Gongsun Hong (公孫弘) of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics could not only make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (郎中令). Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasions—such as with Luan Da (d. 112 BCE)—an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was socially acceptable for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned only a modest income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy; like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being a butcher was another lowly occupation, yet there is one case where a butcher became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress He (d. 189 CE) and her brother, the regent He Jin (d. 189 CE), came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials.|$|E
