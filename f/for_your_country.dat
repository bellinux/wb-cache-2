Ultimately, competing <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country</b> on the world's biggest sporting stage is a pinnacle. It brings memories and experiences that last a lifetime.|$|E

She stated: [...] "I don't think it's my job to try and influence people which way they should vote." [...] Following Barack Obama's inauguration, she told Rolling Stone that she supported the president: [...] "I've never seen this country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive. I'm so glad this was my first election." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon Bradman's {{death in}} February 2001, Brown became the oldest living Australian Test cricketer, greatly {{amused by the}} fame {{that came with the}} title. Highly {{regarded}} by Australian cricketers of the modern era, Steve Waugh invited Brown to present Test debutant Adam Gilchrist with his baggy green. The humble Brown was surprised, thinking himself an unworthy choice. [...] Waugh disagreed, opining that [...] "Bill is a baggy green icon who represents all that is good about playing <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country.</b> He is humble, self-effacing and respectful, proud to have been afforded the honour of being an Australian Test cricketer, and a man who always looks for the positive in people." [...] In March 2008, Brown died in Brisbane at the age of 95. He was the last surviving Invincible to have played Test cricket before World War II and his death leaves only four living members of Bradman's 1948 team.|$|E

6000|$|... "But you must!" [...] he {{interrupted}} impatiently. [...] "You must {{listen to me}} for every reason--politically <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country's</b> sake, personally because I shall offer you and give you happiness and a position you could never find elsewhere." ...|$|R
500|$|But here I {{would not}} be misunderstood. By the love of our country, I do not mean loyalty to our King, for that is a duty of another nature, and a man may be very loyal, in the common sense of the word, without one grain of public good in his heart. Witness this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that since the {{beginning}} of the world, no nation upon earth ever shewed (all circumstances considered), such high constant marks of loyalty in all their action and behaviour as we have done; and at the same time, no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called public spirit ... therefore, I shall think my time not ill-spent if I can persuade most and all of you who hear me, to shew the love you have <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country</b> by endeavouring in your several situations to do all the public good you can. For I am certain persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Goldwater's {{statements}} in the 1990s alienated many social conservatives. He endorsed Democrat Karan English in an Arizona congressional race, urged Republicans to lay off Bill Clinton over the Whitewater scandal, and criticized the military's ban on homosexuals: He said that [...] "Everyone knows that gays have served honorably in the military {{since at least the}} time of Julius Caesar" [...] and that [...] "You don't need to be 'straight' to fight and die <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country.</b> You just need to shoot straight." [...] A few years before his death he addressed establishment Republicans by saying, [...] "Do not associate my name with anything you do. You are extremists, and you've hurt the Republican party much more than the Democrats have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Niven had {{particular}} scorn {{for those}} newspaper columnists covering the war who typed out self-glorifying and excessively florid prose about their meagre wartime experiences. Niven stated, [...] "Anyone who says a bullet sings past, hums past, flies, pings, or whines past, has never heard one—they go crack!" [...] He gave a few {{details of his}} war experience in his autobiography, The Moon's a Balloon: his private conversations with Winston Churchill, the bombing of London, {{and what it was}} like entering Germany with the occupation forces. Niven first met Churchill at a dinner party in February 1940. Churchill singled him out from the crowd and stated, [...] "Young man, you did a fine thing to give up your film career to fight <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country.</b> Mark you, had you not done so − it would have been despicable." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving as}} {{boss of the}} Luciano family in the 1950s, Costello {{suffered}} from depression and panic attacks. During this period Costello sought help from a psychiatrist, who advised him {{to distance himself from}} old associates such as Genovese and spend more time with politicians. In the early 1950s, U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee began investigating organized crime in New York in the Kefauver hearings. The Committee summoned numerous mobsters to testify, but they refused to answer questions at the hearings. The mobsters uniformly cited the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, a legal protection against self-incrimination. However, when Costello was summoned, he agreed to answer questions at the hearings and not take the Fifth Amendment. As part of the agreement to testify, the Special Committee and the U.S. television networks agreed not to broadcast Costello's face. During the questioning, Costello nervously refused to answer certain questions and skirted around others. When the Committee asked Costello, [...] "What have you done <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country</b> Mr. Costello?", he famously replied, [...] "Paid my tax!". The TV cameras, unable to show Costello's face, instead focused on his hands, which Costello wrung nervously while answering questions. Costello eventually walked out of the hearings.|$|E

6000|$|... "Because {{you have}} been an English spy," [...] was the quiet reply. [...] "It may {{surprise}} you that I know that, but I do know. I have been a spy for Prince Shan in Paris.

6000|$|... "That America adopts {{our view}} as to the high seas traffic," [...] Fischer replied. [...] "This would mean the {{stopping}} of all supplies, munitions and ammunition from America to England. We offer you an alliance. We ask only <b>for</b> <b>your</b> real and actual neutrality {{for the remainder of}} the war. We offer a great and substantial advantage, a safeguard <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country's</b> future, in return for what? Simply that America will pursue the course of honour and integrity to all nations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nikasti," [...] he enjoined, [...] "listen to me, <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country's</b> sake. The promise {{contained}} in that letter is barely worth the paper {{it is written}} on, {{so long as the}} British fleet remains what it is. But, apart from that, I tell you here, of my own profound conviction--and I will prove it to you before many days are past--Germany does not intend to keep this promise." ...|$|R

It shall save your dislocating the industries of the country and sowing the seeds of a disturbing and yet inadequate militarism. I offer you, in short, a German alliance against Japan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you're needed here. You'd {{be more of}} {{a soldier}} here. You could do more <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>country</b> than if you gave a hundred lives. Can't you see that?" ...|$|E
