40|$|An {{effective}} {{technique to}} the design of dual band coaxial waveguide feed <b>horn</b> for <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> excitation has been developed and tested. Matching the feed horn with free space in upper frequency range is achieved by dielectric insert disposed inside the circular waveguide fabricated in interior conductor of open ended coaxial waveguide. The presence of dielectric insert causes the high level of reflection in lower frequency range from the boundary between the open end of coaxial waveguide and free space. A novel technical solution of highly complicated matching problem has been proposed. The matching design was performed as the series of finite thickness diaphragm arranged on outer surface of interior conductor of coaxial waveguide. To obtain the rigorous solution of given electromagnetic problem for the complicated structure consisting of a great number of connected coaxial waveguide sections and dielectric insert, a new effective approach has been proposed. The distinctive feature of this approach consists in combination of rigorous procedure based on computation of generalized scattering matrices and another rigorous procedure based on the finite difference time domain method. To combine these essentially different approaches, the metallic discontinuity equivalent to overall investigated structure was employed. An optimization of equivalent matching structure has been performed by the variant of the evolution strategy method. The obtained design with metallic discontinuities was converted into real structure comprising the dielectric insert. The final calculations of real structure were performed by the finite difference time domain method. The effectiveness of proposed technique was confirmed by the results of testing the developed feed <b>horn</b> in <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> are {{characterized}} by very high gains (30 dB and higher) and narrow main beams. They are widely used in satellite and line-of-sight microwave communications {{as well as in}} radar. <b>Reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> operate on principles known long ago from the theory of geometrical optics. The first reflector system was made by Hertz back in 1888 (a cylindrical reflector fed by a dipole). The radiation fields from aperture antennas, such as slots, open-ended waveguides, <b>horns,</b> <b>reflector</b> and lens <b>antennas,</b> are determined from the knowledge of the fields over the aperture of the antenna. In this paper, we analyzed the effects of feeds relating to the parabolic reflectors such as waveguide and horn.

The different layers are all composed of homogeneous and uniaxial anisotropic metamaterials, which can be obtained from simple metal-dielectric structures.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaMultimode {{rectangular}} horn radiators {{have been}} in widespread use as <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> feed elements for many years. These horns provide equal E and H planes over moderate bandwidths. With a few simple additional design considerations, however, these same horns can operate over two separate frequency bands. Dual mode operation is achieved by designing to prohibit generation of higher order beamshaping modes for lower operating band. Thus the horn operates as a square pyramidal horn at the low band and as a traditional multimode horn in the upper band. Upper band performance is not affected; however, efficiency in the lower band is somewhat less due to unequal beamshapes characteristic of square pyramidal horns. A horn utilizing these design concepts was developed and tested. Resultant <b>horn</b> geometry, corresponding <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> aperture efficiencies and beamshapes at both bands are presented...|$|R

40|$|PhDThis thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the radiation characteristics of corner <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas.</b> The influence of the design parameters on the radiation characteristics are assessed using an analytical method and the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD method for corner <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> which are electrically small to medium sized antennas is developed in detail. The important subject of the Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABCs) is studied including a study of Mur ABC and Perfectly Matched Layers. It is shown that both methods reduce the reflections from the boundaries sufficient so that the far-field radiation pattern can be computed accurately. An analytical solution to compute the far-field radiation pattern for infinite comer <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> is derived and used to understand the radiation mechanisms. Based on those results, the FDTD method is used to conduct a parametric study on finite sized comer <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas.</b> Experimental antennas have been built and measured in order to verify the computational predictions. Very good agreement is reported The novel idea of a variable beam-width comer <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> is developed and practical designs of such an antenna are presented. The principle is to design the comer <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> such that the beam-width of the antenna can be precisely modified. Data on the gain and beam-width are presented.

40|$|Parabolic {{symmetric}} and offset <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> adaptively illuminated using a novel triple-mode feedhorn (TE 11 +TM 01 +TE 21) {{with different}} mode combinations and impedance and radiation performances are presented.

40|$|<b>Reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> {{design is}} a mature field and most aspects were studied. However, of that most {{previous}} work is distinguished {{by the fact}} that it is narrow in scope, analyzing only a particular problem under certain conditions. Methods of analysis of this type are not useful for working on real-life problems since they can not handle the many and various types of perturbations of basic antenna design. The idea of an integrated design and analysis is proposed. By broadening the scope of the analysis, it becomes possible to deal with the intricacies attendant with modem <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> design problems. The concept of integrated <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> design is put forward. A number of electromagnetic problems related to <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> design are investigated. Some of these show how tools for <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> design are created. In particular, a method for estimating spillover loss for open-ended waveguide feeds is examined. The problem of calculating and optimizing beam efficiency (an important figure of merit in radiometry applications) is also solved. Other chapters deal with applications of this general analysis. The wide angle scan abilities of <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> is examined and a design is proposed for the ATDRSS triband <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna.</b> The development of a general phased-array pattern computation program is discussed and how the concept of integrated design can be extended to other types of antennas is shown.

40|$|Radar {{systems are}} well known {{since the end of}} world war II and are widespread. The basic concept of radar is {{relatively}} simple: the system uses the propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves and works by radiating electromagnetic energy in the space and detecting the echo reflected by the objects (named “target”). The information related to the target is available in the echo signal: the range, or distance, to the target is found from the time it takes for the radiated energy to travel to the target and back; the angular location is detected using narrow beam width directive <b>antennas</b> (i. e. <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas).</b> The ability to discern about the nature and size of the target depends on the radar resolution which is related to the bandwidth and to the electrical size of the antenna. The physical principles of radar are suitable also to the weather radars, used to detect the precipitations at long distance, where the "object of interest” (the target) are the particles of rain and clouds. The detection of these objects involves radar operating at multiple frequencies located in S and C bands, where the wavelength (from 15 to 3. 75 centimeters) is comparable to the size of hydrometeors. Radar systems use directive antennas, such as mechanically steered parabolic <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> and planar phased arrays. Aim of these antennas is to concentrate the energy in a narrow beam width of about 1 ° or 2 °. This characteristic not only concentrates the energy on the target itself, but also permits a measure of its direction. In this work we have studied the substitution of <b>reflector</b> <b>horn</b> feeds with printed log-periodic planar feeds in order to obtain the same performance of the horn antennas, but with considerable advantages in terms of weight and cost. The design of log-periodic feeds has been focused on the feed antenna network, and their possible improvements with respect to the state-of-the-art. In the first chapter, a general description of radar systems is given, introducing the Probert-Jones equation for meteorological target. The second and third chapter provide a brief description of antennas concepts and an introduction to <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas.</b> The chapter four is fully dedicated to <b>reflector</b> <b>horn</b> <b>antennas</b> and printed microstrip feed with a brief description of the state-of-art. Finally, in chapter five, three printed log-periodic feed for <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> are presented. The first structure is a printed log-periodic array (LPDA) operating over the C, X and Ku bands. The antenna feeding structure consist of two coaxial cables, in order to realize an infinite balun which provides the required broadband input matching. The second coaxial cable mirrors the first one, connected to the antenna input, and is capable of both stabilizing the antenna phase center and improving the radiation pattern. Both the simulated and measured results have show that the LPDA can be successfully user as a wide band feed for <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas.</b> The second feed consists of a LPDA operating between 3 and 6 GHz, and fed with a coplanar waveguide. The structure has been designed starting from Carrel’s theory, optimized using CST MICROWAVE STUDIO 2012 and then realized. The comparison between simulated and measured results shows that the proposed antenna can be used as feed for reflector broadband applications in the whole operating frequency band, with a very good input matching and a satisfactory endfire radiation pattern. The results obtained with these two printed LPDA provided the starting point for the design of a high gain “V-shaped” log-periodic feed for weather radar applications, operating in S and C band and fed by the dual coaxial cable configuration. The developed feed provides very good input matching and a symmetric radiation pattern both in E-plane and H-plane, with a reasonable gain over the whole operating bandwidth. This feed may be recommended for usage in weather radar systems having a transmitting power less than 400 KW, allowing a discrete operational range. ...|$|R
