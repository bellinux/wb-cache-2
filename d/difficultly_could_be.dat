30|$|Both {{optimized}} shea butters had {{the same}} fatty acids composition, but {{a difference in the}} content <b>was</b> noticed and <b>could</b> <b>difficultly</b> <b>be</b> explained. However, the higher proportion of UFA (51.19  ±  0.19  %) recorded by the beige shea butter was in conformity with Marantz et al. (2004) repartition about west Africa shea butters. The palmitic and linoleic acids proportions were, at far more important than those of Marantz et al. (2004), despite of the absence of adulteration supposed by Mégnanou and Niamké (2014) for Ivorian marked shea butters. This situation far from constituting a scientific problem <b>could</b> <b>be</b> taken into account for a best detail in shea butter characterization as function to the country. More precisely, a correlation might be established between shea trees genetic and agro-morphological characters and their butters physicochemical and biochemical characteristics.|$|R

30|$|The intraductal growth <b>could</b> <b>be</b> very {{insidious}} at imaging {{because it}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> small in dimension and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> masked by pancreatitis signs.

Whereas {{in the case of}} a lesion that is exclusively intraductal, this is very difficult to observe at imaging; in the majority of these cases, diagnosis is possible only after surgery. At US, lesions may appear hyperechoic and difficult to separate from adjacent pancreatic parenchyma. At CT, often, these lesions are not visible. MR <b>could</b> <b>be</b> useful due to cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) because it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> possible to see a filling defect because lesions could appear hypointense compared to surrounding fluid and it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> possible to see them enhance following the administration of contrast agent.|$|R
