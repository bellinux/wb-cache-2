The editors of Lobster described the revelations as Britain's Watergate and the biggest story since World War Two. The relevations were subsequently confirmed by former MI5 officer Peter Wright in his book Spycatcher.|$|E

5|$|The company's <b>first</b> <b>account</b> {{was funded}} by a US$5million {{fixed-income}} investment through Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of World Bank in 1987. In the mid-1980s, the firm changed its business focus from currency and interest rate management to global bonds and currencies for institutional investors. As a fixed income and currency adviser to institutional clients, the company gained {{a reputation as a}} currency trader and a developer of techniques for overlying currencies. In 1990, it launched a hedge fund portfolio using monies from Kodak and Loews Corporation and began formally offering its currency overlay products to its clients.|$|E
5|$|For Galileo, {{the tides}} {{were caused by}} the {{sloshing}} back and forth {{of water in the}} seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his <b>first</b> <b>account</b> of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} {{accounts of}} Thomas's life are recounted in both Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus. According to the <b>first</b> <b>account,</b> Thomas {{first appeared in}} 803 accompanying general Bardanes Tourkos, and pursued a military career until launching his revolt in late 820. In the second version, he came to Constantinople as a poor youth and entered {{the service of a}} man with the high court rank of patrikios. Then, discovered trying to commit adultery with his master's wife, Thomas fled to the Arabs in Syria, where he remained for 25 years. Pretending to be the murdered emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797), he then led an Arab-sponsored invasion of Asia Minor, but was defeated and punished. Classical and Byzantine scholar J.B. Bury tried to reconcile the two narratives, placing Thomas's flight to the Abbasid Caliphate at around 788 and then having him return to Byzantine service before 803, while the Russian scholar Alexander Vasiliev interpreted the sources as implying that Thomas fled to the Caliphate at Constantine VI's deposition in 797, and that his participation in Bardanes's revolt must be discounted entirely. The second version of Thomas's story is explicitly preferred by Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus, and is the only one recorded in 9th-century sources, namely the chronicle of George the Monk and the Life of Saints David, Symeon, and George of Lesbos. Nevertheless, the French Byzantinist Paul Lemerle came to consider it an unreliable later tradition created by his rival Michael II to discredit Thomas, and rejected it altogether, preferring to rely on the <b>first</b> <b>account</b> alone. Most modern scholars follow him in this interpretation.|$|E

25|$|Progress on Le Griffon was {{fraught with}} problems. Suffering from cold and low on supplies, {{the men were}} close to mutiny. The uneasy truce with the Indians was tested by threats and {{attempts}} of sabotage and murder. Tonti learned {{of a plan to}} burn the ship before it could be launched, so he launched ahead of schedule and Le Griffon entered the waters in early May, 1679. Hennepin's <b>first</b> <b>account</b> says she was a vessel of about 45 tons; his second says 60 tons. Because his second account has numerous exaggerations and cases where he credits himself for things that La Salle had done, Hennepin's <b>first</b> <b>account</b> is considered more reliable. In any case, Le Griffon was larger than any other vessel on the lakes at the time, and as far as contemporary reports can confirm, the first named vessel. Her fitting out continued {{the next couple of months}} and when La Salle arrived in July he was encouraged by her readiness.|$|E
25|$|Other {{concerns}} about {{media coverage of}} this case related to the press' repetition of the first police report, without adequate attribution.

25|$|The Welsh Indians {{were not}} claimed until later.

There is no genetic or archaeological evidence that the Mandan {{are related to the}} Welsh, however, and John Evans and Lewis and Clark reported they had found no Welsh Indians. The Mandan are still alive today; the tribe was decimated by a smallpox epidemic in 1837–1838 and banded with the nearby Hidatsa and Arikara into the Three Affiliated Tribes.|$|E
25|$|In 1891, American otorhinolaryngologist John Roe {{presented}} {{an example of}} his work: a young woman on whom he reduced a dorsal nasal hump for cosmetic indications. In 1892, Robert Weir experimented unsuccessfully with xenografts (duck sternum) in the reconstruction of sunken noses. In 1896, James Israel, a urological surgeon from Germany, and in 1889 George Monks of the United States each described the successful use of heterogeneous free-bone grafting to reconstruct saddle nose defects. In 1898, Jacques Joseph, the German orthopaedic-trained surgeon, published his <b>first</b> <b>account</b> of reduction rhinoplasty. In 1928, Jacques Joseph published Nasenplastik und Sonstige Gesichtsplastik.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding {{whether or not}} Pocahontas saved John Smith exists largely because Smith wrote two very different accounts of his captivity. The first one, published in 1608, included a generally flattering description of Powhatan and his tribe. This <b>first</b> <b>account</b> contained no mention of almost being slain by Powhatan. It was not until Smith released his second account around 1622 that he described any cruel treatment by Powhatan, and his supposed rescue by Pocahontas. Because Smith's two accounts consist of very different facts, and because the second was released only after Pocahontas had gained prominence in England, many hypothesize that Smith embellished {{the story of his}} captivity with respect to Pocahontas.|$|E

After Uter kills his rival and forcibly marries Ygerne, the newborn Arthur is given into the foster care of Antor (Ector), while Ygerne's daughters from the previous marriage are wed to King Lot and King Ventres (Nentres), and her illegitimate daughter Morgan is sent away to a nunnery and becomes known as Morgan le Fay (the <b>first</b> <b>account</b> of Morgan being Igraine's daughter and learning magic in a convent).|$|E
25|$|Imperial Mali is {{best known}} through three primary sources: {{the first is the}} account of Shihab al-'Umari, written in about 1340 by a geographer-administrator in Mamluk Egypt. His {{information}} about the empire came from visiting Malians taking the hajj, or pilgrim's voyage to Mecca. He had first-hand information from several sources, and from a second-hand source, he learned of the visit of Mansa Musa. The second account is that of the traveller Ibn Battuta, who visited Mali in 1352. This is the <b>first</b> <b>account</b> of a West African kingdom made directly by an eyewitness; the others are usually second-hand. The third great account is that of Ibn Khaldun, who wrote in the early 15th century. While the accounts are of limited length, they provide a fairly good picture of the empire at its height.|$|E
25|$|Nasr opposed Thimal's {{appointment}} {{and sought to}} take sole control of Aleppo. There are two accounts about Nasr's seizure of power, both agreeing that Nasr took the Aleppo citadel while Thimal was away. In the <b>first</b> <b>account</b> by Ibn al-Adim, Nasr and his men seized the citadel by force when Thimal was in the Kilabi tribal camps in Aleppo's outskirts attempting to persuade his estranged wife {{to return to the}} city. In reaction, Thimal mobilized his Kilabi loyalists with the goal of retaking Aleppo by force, but the arrival of Romanos's forces spurred the Kilabi chieftains to mediate the dispute between Nasr and Thimal. In the ensuing agreement, Nasr would control the Syrian portion of the emirate from Aleppo, while Thimal would rule the Mesopotamian portion from al-Rahba on the Euphrates River.|$|E
