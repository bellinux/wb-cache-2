40|$|We {{consider}} discrete spin {{models on}} planar graphs and lattices with <b>frustrated</b> interactions. We first analyze the Ising model with <b>frustrated</b> plaquettes.

In the case that all plaquettes are <b>frustrated,</b> the field iπ/ 2 applies uniformly at all dual sites and the partition function can be evaluated in the thermodynamic limit which exhibits no phase transitions. A corollary of our mapping is that the Ising model with p <b>frustrated</b> plaquettes is dual to an p-spin Ising correlation function in zero field.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in quantifying the molecular basis of protein kinase activation and allosteric regulation by cancer mutations has fueled computational studies of allosteric signaling in protein kinases. In the present study, we combined computer simulations and the energy landscape analysis of protein kinases to characterize the interplay between oncogenic mutations and locally <b>frustrated</b> sites as important catalysts of allostetric kinase activation. While structurally rigid kinase core constitutes a minimally <b>frustrated</b> hub of the catalytic domain, locally <b>frustrated</b> residue clusters, whose interaction networks are not energetically optimized, are prone to dynamic modulation and could enable allosteric conformational transitions. The {{results of this study}} have shown that the energy landscape effect of oncogenic mutations may be allosteric eliciting global changes in the spatial distribution of highly <b>frustrated</b> residues. We have found that mutation-induced allosteric signaling may involve a dynamic coupling between structurally rigid (minimally <b>frustrated)</b> and plastic (locally <b>frustrated)</b> clusters of residues. The presented study has demonstrated that activation cancer mutations may affect the thermodynamic equilibrium between kinase states by allosterically altering the distribution of locally <b>frustrated</b> sites and increasing the local frustration in the inactive form, while eliminating locally <b>frustrated</b> sites and restoring structural rigidity of the active form. The energy landsape analysis of protein kinases and the proposed role of locally <b>frustrated</b> sites in activation mechanisms may have useful implications for bioinformatics-based screening and detection of functional site...|$|R

A planar graph is a collection of vertices and (noncrossing) edges. Place Ising spins at vertices of G which interact with competing interactions along the edges.

40|$|We find a close {{correspondence}} between generalized Bell inequalities {{of a special}} kind and certain <b>frustrated</b> spin systems.

Similarly, the Pearle-Braunstein-Cave inequality corresponds to a <b>frustrated</b> even ring with the corresponding signs + [...] . +-. Upon this correspondence, the violation of such inequalities by the entangled singlet state in quantum mechanics {{is equivalent to the}} spin system possessing a classical coplanar ground state, the energy of which is lower than the Ising ground state's energy.
