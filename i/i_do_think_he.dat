60|$|BERTLEY. No, no, we mustn't {{joke about}} it. [Gravely.] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> should be spoken to.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{can you be}} so disagreeable, Dolores, {{when you}} know it was all on business. Though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is the most {{interesting}} man I ever did see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Bryan, I {{think this}} man's book disgraceful; he simply runs his sex-idea to death. Really, we aren't all quite so obsessed as that. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{ought to be}} put in his own lunatic asylum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your uncle! I was so {{amazed and}} stupefied {{yesterday}} that I don't know whether I told him, and if <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> believed me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma doesn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a {{very good}} boy," [...] Kate said; [...] "but you see, papa, mamma is a woman, and perhaps she doesn't {{understand}} boys and girls as well as <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> good, and he told me he never told stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be {{sure you}} could," [...] said she; [...] "and I think {{it one of the}} meanest things he ever did to deprive you of that amusement. There were those nice people at the Isle of Cats (wasn't it?) who wrote and asked you so very kindly to give them an address. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might have let you go to the Isle of Cats." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. B.--You are a kind, affectionate creature, Miss Prior. I do {{not very}} much like the gentleman who {{recommended}} you to Arabella, you know. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> sent my son a good governess for his children.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{could just}} colour it a little. It {{would be such}} a grand thing to get him away, and he in this miserable condition! If he were once on his travels, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would soon begin to forget it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{suppose you}} ought to have asked Aunt Jane's leave; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> must be a ridiculous young man if he could not attend to his proper work because you did not go after him when you were only just come home.' ...|$|E
60|$|Duneka's {{indifference}} {{even more}} than his shunting my precious manuscript into the street brought back my cloud of doubt, for it indicated a loss of faith in me. To him I was a squeezed lemon. Nevertheless I took his hint. Sullivan, I knew and liked, and while I had small hope of interesting him in The Middle Border, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might buy {{one or two of}} my short stories.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have long}} {{suspected}} that Thomas Hutter {{was not my}} father, though <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might have been Hetty's, but now we know he {{was the father of}} neither. He acknowledged that much in his dying moments. I am old enough to remember better things than we have seen on this lake, though they are so faintly impressed on my memory that the earlier part of my life seems like a dream." ...|$|R
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] The All-seeing knows, [...] <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had {{a living}} Child.-- [...] But whither did you carry him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But one {{can hardly}} {{expect him to}} reduce at once. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is sincere in his promises, but he will be careless, even in {{ordinary}} expenditure. I don't say this is what ought to be, but I fear it will be. All the prudence and self-denial must be upon her side.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Frink whispered, [...] "Hope the doc {{gives the}} strikers hell! Ordinarily, I don't {{believe in a}} preacher butting into {{political}} matters--let him stick to straight religion and save souls, and not stir {{up a lot of}} discussion--but at a time like this, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> ought to stand right up and bawl out those plug-uglies to a fare-you-well!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} that will do no good. It will not be for the first time. Lady Conway has been his dread {{from the time of}} his own marriage; and if she should come to Northwold, he will be in despair. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> must be right; she must be making a dead set at Louis.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Although I never {{supposed}} that he (Napoleon) possessed, allowing for some difference of education, the liberality of conduct and political views which were sometimes exhibited by old Hyder Ali, yet <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might {{have shown the}} same resolved and dogged spirit of resolution which induced Tipu Sahib to die manfully upon the breach of his capital city with his sabre clenched in his hand. Sir Walter Scott, commenting on the abdication of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean the}} Bishop; though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> {{has shown a}} great want of what I may call liberality towards a clergyman in his diocese." ...|$|R
60|$|I hadn't {{expected}} {{dear old}} Freddie {{to sing with}} joy {{when he found out}} what had happened, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might have shown a little more manly fortitude. He leaped up, glared at the kid, and clutched his head. He didn't speak for a long time, but, on the other hand, when he began he did not leave off for a long time. He was quite emotional, dear old boy. It beat me where he could have picked up such expressions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good night, Cox," [...] said Miss Palliser, as {{they passed}} by the pack. [...] "Poor Mr. Maule! I did pity him, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> does care for it, though he is so impassive. He would be with us now, only he is chewing the cud of his {{unhappiness}} in solitude half a mile behind us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush! little woman, don't {{talk about}} that. He had his faults, dear, {{as we all}} have, {{but he had a}} great deal to worry him, and perhaps we did not make {{allowances}} enough for him, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was really fond of you, Lucy, and when people are dead we should never speak ill of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! this pestilent toe!" [...] groaned the sufferer. [...] "Sir William won't hear of my moving yet. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is {{the most}} {{completely}} obstinate and pig-headed man that I have ever met. I {{tell him that he}} has mistaken his profession, and that I could find him a post at Constantinople. We need a mule out there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{shall be}} here, sir," [...] he said, [...] "and I thank you heartily for {{engaging}} him; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> means {{this time to}} behave himself." ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not answer}} for a minute. His gaze rested on the passing throng, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> saw it. His answer was no answer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do not know. He {{went out}} with his hawk, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> could have gone {{anywhere}} else. Did they say so to my mother?' ...|$|R
60|$|By getting ashore {{half a mile}} {{above the}} creek, there was a farm-road {{that would lead to}} the house by a cut so short, as nearly to bring us there as soon as Neb could {{possibly}} arrive with his dire, but false intelligence. The place was pointed out to the captain, who had extracted our secret from us, and who good-naturedly consented to do all we asked of him. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would have gone into the creek itself, had it been required. But we were landed, with our bag of clothes--one answered very well for both--at the place I have mentioned, and, taking turn about to shoulder the wardrobe, away we went, as fast as legs could carry us. Even Rupert seemed to feel on this occasion, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had a good deal of contrition, as he must have recollected the pain he had occasioned his excellent father, and dear, good sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you think, Master Lirriper?" [...] Geoffrey exclaimed as {{they joined}} him. [...] "We have asked Mr. Vere {{to take us}} with him as pages {{to the war in}} the Low Country, and though he said we were not to be hopeful about his reply, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will take us. We are to go round to Westminster at one o'clock to see him again. What do you think of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{it is very}} sad; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will be a better, more steadfast man: he has learnt his weakness, {{and where}} to find strength, as he never had before. And {{the effect on the}} school is remarkable. That there should be so much {{tenderness}} of conscience and apprehension of the guilt of impurity among the children of the heathen in among many brought up in familiarity with sin, is a matter for much thankfulness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What! was he {{obliged to}} be baptized? Is he so delicate? Oh, Arthur! tell me; I {{know he is}} tiny, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was ill.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And she {{was always}} fearing it," [...] said Fanny. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> He never {{seems to think that}} evil will come to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But as you say, it is said. He told {{me about}} it, not long afterwards, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would have dared had there been anything--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not mean}} to say that young men ought to do all these things, {{whatever}} they are,--getting into debt, and betting, and living fast. Of course it is very wrong. But when a young man has been brought up in that way, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> ought not to be thrown over by his nearest and dearest friends"--that last epithet was uttered with all the emphasis which Emily could give to it--"because he falls into temptation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{goes about}} the house, scarce {{speaking}} a word, {{and seems to}} have lost almost all his energy. He has ceased to read the family prayers, and to hold forth morning and night. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> considers that the Lord has cheated {{him out of his}} lawful vengeance. It is awfully sad, Walter, though it is strange, to see such a travesty of religion as the tenets of my grandfather and some of the old men who, like him, represent the views of Cromwell's soldiers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, he's a hound," [...] she sighed, as {{if there}} could be no doubt on that point. [...] "It don't seem right for him {{to be in the same}} room with Ellen. But it's for her to say. I feel more and more that we can't {{interfere}} without doing harm. I suppose that if she were not so innocent herself she would realize what he was better. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> appreciates her innocence. He shows more reverence for her than for any one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next door to it," [...] {{answered}} Harold Bird. [...] "That {{last shot}} took him {{directly in the}} throat. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will bother us any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Silence," [...] said Susan, [...] "Deacon Enos {{is a good}} man: <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{means to}} injure any one; {{there must be some}} mistake about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only that?" [...] said Mary, laughing. [...] "I do {{that every}} night, alone with God; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>He</b> {{will be the}} farther off for your being here!" ...|$|R
