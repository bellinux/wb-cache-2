40|$|BACKGROUND: Mass media {{campaigns for}} stroke {{awareness}} encourage {{the public to}} recognise stroke symptoms and respond to stroke in a timely manner. However, {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that media messages can influence behaviour after stroke onset. The <b>F.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> T. (Face Arm Speech Time) test is a common stroke recognition tool used in public education campaigns. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the <b>F.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> T. campaign on health service use in Ireland, which has had no previous exposure to <b>a</b> <b>F.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> T. media campaign. METHODS: An interrupted time series design was used to detect behaviour change after the introduction of the first Irish <b>F.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> T. campaign in presentations of patients with suspected stroke to two emergency departments (EDs), serving a population of about 580 000. RESULTS: There was a significant change in ED attendance of patients with reported stroke symptoms after the introduction of the <b>F.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> T. campaign (β= 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 43 to 1. 24; p CONCLUSIONS: This first Irish <b>F.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> T. campaign had an initial impact on ED attendance of patients with stroke symptoms. However, the campaign effects were not sustained in the long term. Results indicate that prehospital delay in accessing acute stroke services is a complex process with involvement of factors other than stroke knowledge and intention to call 911...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{generate}} normative {{data for}} the phonological and semantic verbal fluency tests (VFT) in Spanish-speaking pediatric populations. METHOD: The sample consisted of 4, 373 healthy children from nine countries in Latin America (Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Puerto Rico) and Spain. Each participant was administered the VFT {{as part of a}} larger neuropsychological battery. Scores for letters <b>F,</b> <b>A,</b> <b>S,</b> and animals and fruit categories were normed using multiple linear regressions and standard deviations of residual values. Age, age 2, sex, and mean level of parental education (MLPE) were included as predictors in the analyses. RESULTS: The final multiple linear regression models showed main effects for age on all scores, such that scores increased linearly as a function of age. Age 2 had a significant effect in Chile (animals), Cuba (A letter, fruits), Ecuador (animals, fruits), Honduras (F letter), Mexico (animals, fruits), Peru (fruits), and Spain (S letters, animals, fruits). Models showed an effect for MLPE in Chile (A letters, animals, fruits), Ecuador (S letter, animals, fruits), Guatelama (F, S letter, animals), Honduras (animals), Mexico (<b>F,</b> <b>A,</b> <b>S</b> letters, animals, fruits), Puerto Rico (A, letters, animals), and Spain (all scores). Sex scores were found significant in Chile (animals), Ecuador (A letter, fruits), Mexico (F letter, fruits), Paraguay (<b>F,</b> <b>A,</b> <b>S</b> letters, fruits), Puerto Rico (F letter, animals, fruits), and Spain (F letter, fruits). CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest multi-national Spanish speaking-pediatric normative study in the world, and as such it will allow neuropsychologists from these countries to have a more accurate way to interpret the phonological and semantic VFT in pediatric populations...|$|R
