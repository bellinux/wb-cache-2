40|$|Abstract. In network interdiction problems, <b>evaders</b> (e. g., hostile agents or data packets) may {{be moving}} through a network towards targets {{and we wish}} to choose {{locations}} for sensors in order to intercept the <b>evaders</b> before they reach their destinations. The <b>evaders</b> might follow deter-ministic routes or Markov chains, {{or they may be}} reactive, i. e., able to change their routes in order to avoid sensors placed to detect them. The challenge in such problems is to choose sensor locations economically, balancing security gains with costs, including the inconvenience sensors inflict upon innocent travelers. We study the objectives of 1) maximizing the number of <b>evaders</b> captured when limited by a budget on sensing cost and 2) capturing all <b>evaders</b> as cheaply as possible. We give optimal sensor placement algorithms for several classes of spe-cial graphs and hardness and approximation results for general graphs, including for deterministic or Markov chain-based and reactive or obliv-ious <b>evaders.</b> In a similar-sounding but fundamentally different problem setting posed by [7] where both <b>evaders</b> and innocent travelers are re-active, we again give optimal algorithms for special cases and hardness and approximation results on general graphs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Multiple-pursuer multiple-evader games raise {{fundamental}} and novel problems in control theory and robotics. In this paper, we propose a distributed {{solution to this}} problem that simultaneously addresses the discrete assignment of pursuers to <b>evaders</b> as well as the continuous control strategies for capturing individual <b>evaders.</b> The resulting hybrid controller for each pursuer consists of both local coordination protocols guaranteeing that distinct <b>evaders</b> are captured by distinct pursuers, and time-varying potential fields ensuring capturability of single <b>evaders.</b> The overall hybrid system guarantees not only the mutual exclusion property of the assignment for all initial conditions, but also capturing all <b>evaders</b> after exploring at most a polynomial number of discrete assignments. Therefore, our distributed approach dramatically reduces the combinatorial nature of purely discrete assignment problems. Our scalable approach is illustrated with nontrivial computer simulations. ...|$|R
