I just think that, whereas The Commitments was very much a labour of love, Commitments 2 is <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> act of cynicism." ...|$|E

500|$|Feathers on the alula or bastard wing are not {{generally}} considered to be flight feathers in the strict sense; though they are asymmetrical, they lack the length and stiffness of most true flight feathers. [...] However, alula feathers are <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> aid to slow flight. [...] These feathers—which are attached to the bird's [...] "thumb" [...] and normally lie flush against the anterior edge of the wing—function {{in the same way as}} the slats on an airplane wing, allowing the wing to achieve a higher than normal angle of attack– and thus lift– without resulting in a stall. [...] By manipulating its thumb to create a gap between the alula and the rest of the wing, a bird can avoid stalling when flying at low speeds or landing.|$|E
500|$|Retrospectively, Kristan Reed of Eurogamer called Another World [...] "one of {{the most}} visionary and memorable games of its time." [...] Reviewing the 15th Anniversary Edition in 2010, Eurogamer's John Walker called it [...] "still utterly beautiful", adding that the game's art style is [...] "just fantastic. Chahi's design is exquisitely simple and {{enormously}} evocative. Built from spare polygons, its paper-craft-like animation conjures the world, the creatures and the threat wonderfully." [...] In a 2014 review of the 3DS version, Bob Mackey of USGamer opined [...] "Another World is <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> experience every gamer should have— {{and not just for}} the sake of checking out a historical curiosity. Another World still feels incredibly forward-thinking, almost as if Chahi had developed a game for this decade's indie scene without even realizing it." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "James Bond Theme" [...] {{was written}} by Monty Norman and was first orchestrated by the John Barry Orchestra for 1962's Dr. No, {{although}} the actual authorship of the music has {{been a matter of}} controversy for many years. In 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from The Sunday Times newspaper, which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as [...] "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> instrument of rock 'n' roll... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes." [...] Barry composed the scores for eleven Bond films and had an uncredited contribution to Dr. No with his arrangement of the Bond Theme.|$|E

Maurice Binder created the title sequence and introduced the gun barrel motif that appears in all the Eon Bond films. Monty Norman wrote the accompanying soundtrack, which included the [...] "James Bond Theme", heard in the gun barrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits; the theme was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as [...] "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> instrument of rock 'n' roll... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable.

500|$|The episode's main theme {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "universal and timeless, but also specific and personal: growing up and dealing with change." [...] The episode makes it clear that Stan's pre-adolescent battle with cynicism is not necessarily representative of all [...] "tweens"; one reviewer described the character's problem as more common to depression. The episode also mocks how [...] "cynical culture breeds cynical audiences," [...] typified in the [...] "contemptuous trailers" [...] for predictable films during the scene set at the cinema, which often end with the insult [...] "Fuck you!" [...] Sean O'Neal, in the episode's review at The A.V. Club, linked the episode's theme to modern culture: [...] "The Internet has turned nearly everyone into a cynic." [...] Time reviewer James Poniewozik disagreed with his assessment, but did note that [...] "there's <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> argument that the instant dissection of all experience online encourages a kind of protective dismissiveness." [...] The episode was also interpreted as a satire of immediate online responses from fans, who criticize South Park as stale but continue to watch regardless.|$|E

500|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{originally}} classified Ypresiomyrma as incertae sedis (Latin for [...] "of uncertain placement") within the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, as the ants {{could not be}} identified to any tribe level. However, a 2008 paper by Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel, Switzerland, expressed doubt that members of Ypresiomyrma were even ants. He notes {{that the development of}} the malar area (an area between the compound eyes and the mandibles) was different and not reduced, as a reduced malar is synapomorphic (key diagnostic traits) in Myrmeciinae. Baroni Urbani further notes that the antennae's shape on the type species could not be properly determined, making its true placement within Formicidae indeterminable. However, the antennae of Y. rebekkae has an elongated scape which means the fossil is <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> ant, as this feature is a key diagnostic trait for Formicidae. Due to this, Baroni Urbani believed that Ypresiomyrma could only be confidently classified as incertae sedis within the family Formicidae. A subsequent report by Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky describing new myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald and colleagues without mentioning the comments of Baroni Urbani.|$|E
500|$|Barb Richards, {{director}} of music for WAJI {{said that the}} cast's introduction of new music prompted the station to finally add music from the cast. Richards referenced the 21.9million downloads and 5.2million albums sold since the series since its May2009 premiere, but commented, [...] "Still, I believe {{that people want to}} hear originals over remakes, so up until the 'Glee' cast's original music it didn't make sense for us to play each latest cover, other than to spotlight it the day of the show." [...] However, Richards complimented the original [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] saying its lyrics would [...] "resonate with kids and parents" [...] and said that she liked it when she first heard it and when she saw it on the show. She also commented that it [...] "is good on its own, and having the Glee name on it gives it a leg up". Dave McKay, program director at WPST also echoed Richards' sentiments that the Glee sales were reason to add them to airplay, adding [...] "Not many artists or songs enjoy the type of exposure that 'Glee' provides. Plus, the audience that watches the show is the audience we target, so the fit seems perfect [...] since 'Glee' music sells, there is <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> appetite for it." ...|$|E
500|$|While Kiedis was in rehab, {{the band}} sought a new {{producer}} {{for their next}} album. [...] Aspiring producer Michael Beinhorn was looking for work at EMI Records after several unsuccessful projects on other labels, when a man working at EMI approached Beinhorn and suggested that he work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as [...] "no one [...] {{what to do with}} them". [...] Beinhorn recalled of the situation: [...] "Though their music all seemed kind of abstract, there was <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> excitement to it. [...] I thought they needed a lot of arrangement help ... I also quickly learned that [...] at the record label actually hated the Chili Peppers, like openly reviled them so bad that they didn't even want them to succeed. [...] It was the weirdest thing." [...] He contacted the band to meet up, and instead of arranging a formal meeting, the band proposed to meet him at a club in New Orleans called Tipitina's. [...] Beinhorn was impressed by the band's originality and non-conformist attitude and decided to work with the band. Kiedis then sat down with Beinhorn to discuss the recording of the album; Kiedis planned to record the album in ten days and write the songs during the recording sessions.|$|E

500|$|Monty Norman {{was invited}} to write the soundtrack because Broccoli liked {{his work on the}} 1961 theatre {{production}} Belle, a musical about murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen. Norman was busy with musicals, and only accepted to do the music for Dr. No after Saltzman allowed him to travel along with the crew to Jamaica. The most famous composition in the soundtrack is the [...] "James Bond Theme", which is heard in the gunbarrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits, and was written by Norman based on a previous composition of his. John Barry, who would later go on to compose the music for eleven Bond films, arranged the Bond theme, but was uncredited—except for the credit of his orchestra playing the final piece. It has occasionally been suggested that Barry, not Norman, composed the [...] "James Bond Theme". This argument {{has been the subject of}} two court cases, the most recent in 2001, which found in favour of Norman. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as [...] "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> instrument of rock 'n' roll... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to The North Stands for Nothing {{was generally}} positive. Several reviewers noted {{on the balance}} that While She Sleeps have between melody and the heavier elements of their sound. Metal Hammer reviewer Terry Bezer, specifically complimented the track [...] "Hearts Aside Our Horses"– enthusing that it is [...] "a lesson in how to be both progressive and hook laden at once." [...] Adam Kennedy of Kerrang! complimented the band for putting [...] "their own spin" [...] on metalcore. Saying that they test and respect the genre's conventions in equal measure– specifically noting their use of a piano interlude on [...] "Trophies" [...] while suggesting that [...] "tearing heads off is their forte". In his review for Big Cheese, Lais Martin Wairing enthused that the band are [...] "very promising," [...] comparing them to Bring Me the Horizon but offering that While She Sleeps [...] "deserve success in their own right." [...] The album also received some minor criticism, with several reviewers picking up on the short overall length of the CD and While She Sleeps' similarities to other bands. In a generally favorable review for The New Review, Jen Rochester said that the CD [...] "is over before you know it," [...] while concluding that [...] "it’s <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> effort worth checking out." [...] Similarly, Dom Wyatt of Dead Press! said that The North Stands for Nothing {{is very similar to}} Hollow Crown by Architects but that it is a [...] "cracking debut" [...] that While She Sleeps should be proud of.|$|E
500|$|Azeem Ahmad of MusicOMH {{positively}} reviewed Good Girl Gone Bad Live {{giving it}} four stars and wrote that [...] "it isn't {{going to win}} over any new fans, but buying it won't disappoint the many that already exist". According to him the songs are different from their recorded versions and sound [...] "infectiously upbeat but in a more grown-up way than the album". Ahmad concluded that even the [...] "cringey" [...] American pronunciation of [...] "Manchester" [...] and associated drivel can't take away the vocal strength of [...] "Rehab". He further praised the interlude [...] "Scratch" [...] calling it [...] "impressive". Ahmad concluded that [...] "If anyone was still wondering, Rihanna isn't miming during this show but the DVD's audio might be little bit {{out of sync with}} the video." [...] A reviewer of Blu-ray.com was more critical stating that even though the transfer does not has serious technical flaws, the video can not pair to Live from the Royal Albert Hall (2009) by American rock band The Killers. According to the reviewer there are few close-ups that look soft and also a lot of motion-judder that ranges from mild to strong. He stated that the camera positioning during a lot of acts in not [...] "overly convincing" [...] and some close-ups are too dark. However, according to him contrast levels are good. The reviewer concluded that [...] "all in all, consistency is <b>definitely</b> <b>an</b> issue with Good Girl Gone Bad; parts of the show look great in high-definition, but there are also certain parts of it that are far from convincing." [...] At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Good Girl Gone Bad Live received a nomination for Best Long Form Music Video, but lost to Runnin' Down a Dream (2007).|$|E

[...] Camille Mann of CBS News described the video as a [...] "avant-garde short film" [...] and noted that Gaga was [...] "pushing [...] boundaries."
