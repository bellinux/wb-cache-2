40|$|The thermal {{properties}} and fire behaviour of polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic-mechanical analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and <b>glow</b> <b>wire</b> <b>test.</b> In order {{to study the}} morphological structure of the materials obtained, TEM and XRD analyses were also carried out. The nanocomposites were prepared using the melt intercalation technique in a co-rotating intermeshing twin screw extruder. Particular attention was given to studying the influence of different processing conditions (barrel temperature profile and screw rate) and compositions of PP-nanoclay blends (clay content, use of compatibiliser) on the {{thermal properties}} of the nanocomposites. The results show that all the properties analysed were strongly influenced by the nanocomposite composition; instead, the processing conditions greatly affect only the dynamic-mechanical properties. DSC curves show that the crystallinity is deeply influenced {{by the presence of}} the clay in the matrix, owing {{to the fact that the}} filler acts as nucleating agent. DMA curves show that materials processed at low temperature profile and high shear stress, i. e. when a good clay dispersion is achieved, are characterised by an enhanced modulus, thus indicating that the incorporation of clay into the PP matrix remarkably enhances its stiffness and has good reinforcing effects. TGA traces in oxidizing atmosphere show a drastic shift of the weight loss curve towards higher temperature and no variation of the onset temperature (i. e. the temperature at which degradation begins). The TGA analyses in inert atmosphere show instead marked increase of this parameter (about 200 degrees C) and no shift of weight loss curves. Glow wire results highlight that polymer nanocomposites are characterised by enhanced fire behaviour...|$|E

Here, formulations with aluminium diethyl phosphinate meet the <b>glow</b> <b>wire</b> ignition <b>test</b> (GWIT) [...] at 775 °C and the <b>glow</b> <b>wire</b> flammability <b>test</b> (GWFI) at 960 °C. Another important criterion in E&E applications is the Comparative Tracking Index (CTI), which determines the risk of electrical tracking of insulating material that is exposed to contaminating environments and surface conditions. With formulations containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate, the highest requirement of 600 V (numeric value of the highest voltage at which an electrical insulating material withstands 50 drops of electrolytic test solution) is achieved. Further benefits of polyamides and polyesters containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate are low smoke density which makes them suitable for rolling stock applications to EN 45545, as well as good light stability which is needed for outdoor applications.|$|R

At a deactivation deflection of 1  mm, Morelli produced a force of 3.18  g. This force is not enough to induce the biological response needed to produce dental movement in most patients [21].

25|$|In 1878, Edison {{began working}} on a system of {{electrical}} illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, {{something that would be}} needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a <b>glowing</b> <b>wire</b> in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).|$|R
