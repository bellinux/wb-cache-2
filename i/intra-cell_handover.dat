50|$|A {{special case}} is possible, {{in which the}} source and the target {{are one and the}} same cell and only the used channel is changed during the handover. Such a handover, in which the cell is not changed, is called <b>intra-cell</b> <b>handover.</b> The purpose of <b>intra-cell</b> <b>handover</b> is to change one channel, which may be {{interfered}} or fading with a new clearer or less fading channel.|$|E
30|$|An <b>intra-cell</b> <b>handover</b> (IHO) scheme {{applied to}} both {{macrocell}} and femtocells is proposed in [9] {{to mitigate the}} cross-tier interference. The scheme relies on a received signal strength -based power control mechanism when the IHO scheme fails in getting free sub-channels in the interfering femtocell. [10] proposed a hybrid resource coordination for a mixed macrocell and femtocell deployment, where the MBS can notify the femtocell to release the interfered allocated resources relieving the victim MUE from interference. Even if the proposals in [9] and [10] improve the performance of MUEs, they cause nonnegligible throughput deteriorations to FUEs. It is shown that a proper combination of IHO and power control techniques reduces the outage probability for nonsubscribers {{compared to that of}} closed and open access.|$|E
40|$|The IEEE 802. 11 {{standard}} {{defines the}} different bit rates and modulation schemes {{to which a}} WLAN device may adapt according to the channel quality. User mobility may also {{have an impact on}} the available bit rate. This paper presents a study of the bit rate evolution along time for devices that move according to the Random Waypoint mobility pattern in WLAN cells. Simulation has been applied in order to obtain statistical results that permit to characterize the evolution of the bit rate behavior along time and to compute average results in the ideal case (without interference) and in the presence of interfering devices. Our results can be useful in the solution of optimization problems in which decision on where to connect must be taken based on some minimum guaranteed bit rate. They also can be useful in the design of inter and <b>intra-cell</b> <b>handover</b> methods and load balancing schemes. Postprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|Next-generation {{cellular}} networks {{will provide}} higher cell capacity by adopting advanced physical layer techniques and broader bandwidth. Even {{in such a}} next-generation system, boundary users would suffer from low throughput due to severe inter-cell interference (ICI) and unbalanced user distributions among cells, unless additional schemes to mitigate this problem are employed. In this paper, we tackle this problem by jointly optimizing partial frequency reuse (PFR) and load-balancing schemes in a multi-cell network. We formulate this problem as a network-wide utility maximization problem and propose optimal offline and efficient online algorithms to solve this. Our online algorithm {{turns out to be}} a simple mixture of inter- and <b>intra-cell</b> <b>handover</b> mechanisms for existing users and admission control and cell-site selection mechanisms for newly arriving users. A remarkable feature of the proposed algorithm is that it uses a notion of expected throughput as the decision making metric, as opposed to signal strength in conventional systems. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our online algorithm can not only closely approximate network-wide proportional fairness (PF) but also provide two types of gain, interference avoidance (IA) gain and load balancing (LB) gain, which yield 20 ∼ 100 % throughput improvement of boundary users (depending on traffic load distribution), while not penalizing total system throughput. We also demonstrate that this improvement cannot be achieved by conventional systems using universal frequency reuse and signal strength as the decision making metric...|$|E
30|$|Several {{handover}} {{techniques have}} been proposed to support QoS provisioning in IEEE 802.16 -based systems. With regard to the handover issues in IEEE 802.16 e network systems, analytical models {{have been proposed}} in [8 – 13], which have been validated to some extent through simulations. Nevertheless, only a few research articles have studied handover issues in IEEE 802.16 j network systems. A reducing inter-cell handover events (RIHE) based on cell id information in multi-hop relay system is proposed in [14] to decrease handover signaling overhead, latency, and unnecessary handovers. The authors propose a handover method that reduces inter-cell handover but increases <b>intra-cell</b> <b>handover</b> events by modifying the BSID format into the hierarchical BS/RS ID. Becvar et al. [15] propose an optimal handover scanning procedure (OHSP) in IEEE 802.16 j network systems to reduce the management information overhead and to maximize the user data throughput. The modification of scanning procedure {{is based on the}} uplink direction by adding identification addresses of all recommended stations for scanning into one scanning request message. In [16], this article presents handover schemes in multi-hop cellular networks (HSMCN) where RSs are located either inside a cell or on the boundary between two adjacent cells. By deploying RSs on the boundary between two adjacent cells, the service-interruption time caused by inter-cell handover is reduced. Yun et al. [17] propose a fast handover scheme (FHS) to reduce the handover signaling cost and to decrease handover delay by applying fast handovers for mobile IPv 6 (FMIPv 6) to IEEE 802.16 j networks, which determines the cross-subnet handover in advance through the interaction of MAC layer messages. Sultan et al. [18] perform simulation study of three handover techniques (SSTHT) within the IEEE 802.16 j standards and prove that the macro diversity handover (MDHO) outperforms the HHO and fast base station switching. MDHO is the process by which an MS maintains connection with two or more access stations called a diversity set. In [19], a topology-aware macro diversity handover technique (TMDHT) is proposed to improve the conventional MDHO.|$|E
