60|$|Few people passed. The {{man out of}} {{the last}} house passed on his way home; she heard his {{footsteps}} clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time {{there used to be a}} field there in which they used to play every evening with other people's children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it--not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field--the <b>Devines,</b> the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home.|$|E

Tilly escaped unscathed, the only damage being one of her brand new stilettos - the left one. Their terrified neighbours called the police resulting in Jim being arrested and charged over the incident. He was later acquitted, on 16 January 1931, because Tilly refused to testify. The <b>Devines</b> separated in the early 1940s and were finally divorced in January 1944.

5000|$|Devine became infamous in Sydney, {{initially}} as a prostitute, {{then later}} as a brothel madam and organised crime entrepreneur. The NSW Vagrancy Act 1905 prohibited men from running brothels; it did nothing to stop women with criminal gangs' support and bribes to the police from running criminal enterprises. Historian Larry Writer has noted that the <b>Devines</b> ran diversified operations. Elite [...] "call girls" [...] were available for politicians, businessmen and overseas guests of significance, while [...] "tenement girls" [...] were young working class women who resorted to casual prostitution to supplement their drug spendings, clothings and meagre earnings during times of Australian criminal and narcotic culture, absence of a comprehensive welfare state and unemployment. Older female prostitutes, [...] "boat girls", catered to itinerant sailors or working class-men. Devine {{does not seem to}} have run similar operations for the gay sex market during this time because she believed it was not right.|$|E
5000|$|Strang was {{nominated}} for the [...] "Best Supporting Actor" [...] award in the 2000 TV Guide Television Awards. The character of Rangi was famous for the risky and abstract storylines he went through. Two notable storylines included the character recovering from paraplegia and dating his suspected sister. One particular storyline for the character was cut completely {{in that it was}} seen far too controversial. The storyline was to see offscreen lovers - Strang and Katrina <b>Devines</b> characters - Rangi and Minnie participate in an affair whilst Rangi was dating Minnies mother - Ellen. The incestuous relationship between Rangi and Donna proved {{to be one of the}} soaps most iconic storylines, with the wedding episode being singled out as one of Shortland Streets best bits. Rangis death proved memorable with fans hoping the character was [...] "doing a Tom Neilson" [...] and would return. The death remained the last death of a core cast member for 3 years. The storyline that saw Rangi nearly die at the hands of a drunk Rachel, was voted by fans as one of the shows most iconic moments.|$|E
50|$|After Lombardis {{retirement}} as Packers {{head coach}} following Super Bowl II, the aging team {{went into a}} period of decline under new coach (and former defensive coordinator) Phil Bengtson. Individually, Robinson continued to shine. He was named 1st Team All-Pro by the NEA and UPI in 1968. In 1969, he was again named 1st Team All-Pro by the NEA and UPI and was also chosen for the 1st Teams of the New York Daily News, PFW and The Sporting News. Robinson suffered a setback during the 1970 season when he tore his Achilles tendon, but {{was ready for the}} start of the 1971 season. By then, Bengtson had been replaced as Packers head coach by Dan Devine. Robinson did not get along with Devine and would later state that, while he felt that Vince Lombardi was the best coach he ever played for, Devine was his worst coach at any level: high school, college, or pros. Although the team rebounded from a 4-8-2 record in <b>Devines</b> first season to finish 10-4 and win the NFC Central Divisional title, the 1972 season would be Robinsons last in a Packers uniform.|$|E
