5|$|The next day, {{the player}} {{and the newly}} {{assembled}} army of Ferelden fight their way through Denerim, which has been overrun by the Darkspawn. After fighting {{their way through the}} Darkspawn horde and conquering the Archdemon atop Denerim's highest tower, the player must <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> or Alistair/Loghain delivers the killing blow. The Archdemon killed, the leaderless Darkspawn army retreats from Denerim, marking the end of the Fifth Blight. However, if the ritual with Morrigan was not performed, whoever slays the Archdemon also perishes. The story ends with a ceremony attended by the people of Ferelden during which the player and their companions are honored for saving the kingdom. Lastly, an epilogue details in text and pictures the ramifications of the player's in-game choices, including the future of Ferelden and the fates of his or her companions.|$|E

Furthermore, Spinefarm had been bought by the big company Universal Music Group in 2002, forcing the band to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> would continue with Spinefarm, which would mean that their future albums would be released worldwide by UMG.

25|$|Stella Browne was {{a leading}} birth control campaigner, who {{increasingly}} began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced {{by the work of}} Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and other sexologists. She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy. In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> wanted to be mothers or not.|$|E
25|$|The Danish krone is {{currently}} used by both of its dependent territories, Greenland and Faroe Islands, with their monetary policy {{controlled by the}} Danish Central Bank. If Denmark does adopt the euro, separate referendums would be required in both territories to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> should follow suit. Both territories have voted {{not to be a}} part of the EU in the past, and their populations will not participate in the Danish euro referendum. The Faroe Islands use a special version of the Danish krone notes that have been printed with text in the Faroese language. It is regarded as a foreign currency, but can be exchanged 1:1 with the Danish version. On 5 November 2009 the Faroese Parliament approved a proposal to investigate the possibility for euro adoption, including an evaluation of the legal and economic impact of adopting the euro ahead of Denmark.|$|E

25|$|The votes {{challenged}} by Miller's team {{were put in}} separate boxes, leaving it to the lawsuit to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> would be counted for Murkowski. On November 11, the Miller campaign alleged it had received reports of voter intimidation and fraud {{and that it would}} be filing a lawsuit in Alaska state court asking for voters rolls for certain precincts to determine whether the precincts had counted more ballots than there were registered voters. Miller told Fox News Channel on November 18 that his campaign may request a recount, investigate the voting machines, and look into whether the absentee ballots for the military were mailed in a timely fashion. The federal judge held the suit could be decided by reference to State law, and directed Miller to file in State court, which he did on November 22, stopping the certification of election results and possibly delaying the seating of a second Senator for Alaska at the beginning of the new term in January.|$|E
25|$|The non-Hungarian {{population}} of the territory ceded by the First Vienna Award {{can be divided into}} three groups – those who left already before the Award came into force, those who remained in their place during the war and until it was integrated to Czechoslovakia again and those who were expelled from the region. The Czechoslovak press reported after the Munich Agreement that border adjustments with Hungary were imminent, so the Czechoslovaks had five weeks to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> stayed or left. According to Janics those officials and farmers who opted to move away (81,000 people) were given administrative, military and public safety support and they were provided road vehicles and railway wagons to transport their property. Deák estimates the number of state employees and Czech colonists who left territory before the arrival of the Hungarian army as one half while the total number of Slovaks who left territory before December 1938 (voluntarily or by forced expulsion) is unknown and can be estimated only by comparison of two censuses from 1930 and 1938 and assumed population growth. His estimate is about 50,000 people of Slovak nationality.|$|E
25|$|Some {{persons have}} a {{disorder}} of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, {{as well as}} persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients {{who are able to}} perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there {{would seem to be a}} strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> want to live.|$|E

Furtado and Timbaland cannot <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> want to begin dating or instead flirt with others on the dance floor.

500|$|The {{issue of}} Parliament's {{authority}} in the colonies became a crisis after Parliament passed the Coercive Acts (known as the Intolerable Acts in the colonies) in 1774 to punish the Province of Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party of 1773. Many colonists saw the Coercive Acts {{as a violation of}} the British Constitution and thus a threat to the liberties of all of British America. In September 1774, the First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia to coordinate a response. Congress organized a boycott of British goods and petitioned the king for repeal of the acts. These measures were unsuccessful because King George and the ministry of Prime Minister Lord North were determined not to retreat on the question of parliamentary supremacy. As the king wrote to North in November 1774, [...] "blows must <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are to be subject to this country or independent".|$|E
