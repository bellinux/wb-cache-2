Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of these severe vivax malaria cases is still poorly understood. In Brazil, the proportion of vivax malaria cases has been steadily increasing, as have {{the number of cases}} presenting serious clinical complications. The most frequent syndromes associated with severe vivax malaria in Brazil are severe anaemia and acute respiratory distress. Additionally, P. vivax infection may also result in complications associated with pregnancy. Here, we review the latest findings on severe vivax malaria in Brazil. We also discuss how the development of targeted field research infrastructure in Brazil is providing clinical and ex vivo experimental data that benefits local and international efforts to understand the pathogenesis of P. vivax.

The investigation shows which main fields they have been working in, especially which applicant countries have co-operated with which countries in which fields? The objective of this investigation has been to find patterns of co-operation and we have tried to answer the following questions: Which behaviour concerning the co-operation can be found especially in the fields of “ Information Society Technologies ” and “Quality of life and management of living resources” and on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>programme</b> “International Co-operation”? Which partners of member states of the European Union have been working with Eastern European partners in European projects in which fields? We have been using the data of CORDIS for the investigation. For structuring, visualising and analysing the huge amount of data the bibliometric method BibTechMonTM has been used. BibTechMonTM has been developed at the Department of Technology Management of ARC Seibersdorf research GmbH and uses the co-word analysis (Kopcsa and Schiebel, 1998). Furthermore conventional statistics are applied to find answers to our questions. With this analysis we could show clearly that the structured and visualised information is useful for all sorts of different organisation especially within Europe...|$|E
40|$|A key {{dilemma in}} global health {{is how to}} {{allocate}} funds between disease-specific "vertical projects" {{on the one hand}} and "horizontal programmes" which aim to strengthen the entire health system on the other. While economic evaluation provides a way of approaching the prioritisation of vertical projects, it provides less guidance on how to prioritise between horizontal and vertical spending. We approach this problem by formulating a mathematical program which captures the complementary benefits of funding both vertical projects and <b>horizontal</b> <b>programmes.</b> We show that our solution to this math program has an appealing intuitive structure. We illustrate our model by computationally solving two specialised versions of this problem, with illustrations based on the problem of allocating funding for infectious diseases in sub–Saharan Africa. We conclude by reflecting on how such a model may be developed in the future and used to guide empirical data collection and theory development...|$|R

It presents data on aid flows and other, non-concessional, development finance for water supply and sanitation from members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), non-DAC providers of development assistance, and multilateral agencies including the World Bank, regional development banks, UN and other agencies. It also examines results achieved in the water and sanitation sector and lessons learned from recent evaluations. Trends in aid to water Aid for water and sanitation doubled over the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1980 - 1989) and has nearly doubled again since 2002. The first rise reflected an increasing share of aid to the sector; the more recent rise reflected an increase in the overall volume of aid. In 2010 - 11, DAC countries ’ bilateral annual aid commitments to the water and sanitation sector rose to USD 4. 9 billion (Table 1). Taking into account non-DAC Highlights Aid was instrumental in encouraging progress toward the MDG targets on water supply and sanitation.

40|$|Background: South Africa's Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi {{inherited}} an HIV epidemic and a weak {{public health}} system {{when he took}} office in 2009. His priorities were to establish a national programme to address HIV and to create a system of national health insurance (NHI) to increase access to affordable and high-quality health care. By 2015, Motsoaledi's work on HIV was considered as a success; however, work on the creation of NHI was stymied. Here, we aimed to compare the design, promotion, and implementation of the national HIV programme—a primarily vertical programme—with that of NHI, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>programme.</b> Methods: In January and February, 2015, we conducted 20 semi-structured interviews in South Africa with government leaders, civil society, researchers, health-care practitioners, private insurers, and international non-governmental organisations. We analysed interviews and available quantitative data from government, academic, and industry sources and distilled key themes in two teaching cases. Findings: We identified several key differences between the HIV programme and NHI efforts, including the role that leadership and politics play in health policy and care delivery; the effect of historical, economic, and cultural context on outcomes and leaders' ability to institute change; and the importance of strategy in planning and decision making. We noted both contextual barriers (such as public distrust of government) and catalysts (demand for HIV treatment) in the programmes. Furthermore, the approach used by the Minister of Health sometimes hindered programme success (for example, the exclusion of private insurers from NHI design) and sometimes enabled success (such as the engagement of civil society in the HIV response). For both programmes, the availability or absence of outcomes data affected the Minister's ability to advocate for change and to make strategic decisions about how to invest in health. Interpretation: The comparison of South Africa's well known and effective HIV programme with its stalled NHI efforts—both led by the same person with very different results––sheds light on important considerations when approaching complex, large-scale change. Our analysis of the politics of health systems shows how explicit acknowledgement of the political nature of health will lead to more effective health promotion strategies and policies. Political leaders can either drive or hinder the implementation of evidence-based public health practices.

40|$|The 2008 Maputo Declaration {{calls for}} the {{development}} of dedicated national laboratory policies and strategic plans supporting the enhancement of laboratory services in response to the long-lasting relegation of medical laboratory systems in sub-Saharan Africa. This study describes the extent to which laboratories are addressed in the national health policies and plans created directly following the 2008 momentum for laboratory strengthening. National health policies and plans from 39 sub-Saharan African countries, valid throughout and beyond 31 December 2010 were collected in March 2012 and analysed during 2013. Laboratories were addressed by all countries. Human resources were the most addressed topic (38 / 39) and finances and budget were the least addressed (< 5 / 39). Countries lagging behind in national laboratory strategic planning at the end of 2013 (17 / 39) {{were more likely to be}} francophone countries located in West-Central Africa (13 / 17) and have historically low HIV prevalence. The most common gaps anticipated to compromise the implementation of the policies and plans were the disconnect between policies and plans, under-developed finance sections and monitoring and evaluating frameworks, absence of points of reference to define gaps and shortages, and inappropriate governance structure. The availability of laboratory policy and plan implementation can be improved by strictly applying a more standardised methodology for policy development, using harmonised norms to set targets for improvement and intensifying the establishment of directorates of laboratory services directly under the authority of Ministries of Health. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>programmes</b> such as the Global Health Security Agenda could provide the necessary impulse to take the least advanced countries on boar...|$|R

40|$|Background: An {{integrated}} and comprehensive hospital/community based health programme is presented, {{aimed at reducing}} maternal and child mortality and morbidity. It is run {{as part of a}} general programme of health care at a rural hospital situated in northern Tanzania. The purpose was through using research and statistics from the programme area, to illustrate how a hospital-based programme with a vision of integrated healthcare {{may have contributed to the}} lower figures on mortality found in the area. Such an approach may be of interest to policy makers, in relation to the global strategy that is now developed in order to meet the MDGs 4 and 5. Programme setting: The hospital provides reproductive and child health services, PMTCT-plus, comprehensive emergency obstetric care, ambulance, radio and transport services, paediatric care, an HIV/AIDS programme, and a generalised healthcare service to a population of approximately 500 000. Programme description and outcomes: We describe these services and their potential contribution to the reduction of the maternal and neonatal mortality ratios in the study area. Several studies from this area have showed a lower maternal mortality and neonatal mortality ratio compared to other studies from Tanzania and the national estimates. Many donor-funded programmes focusing on maternal and child health are vertical in their framework. However, the hospital, being the dominant supplier of health services in its catchment area, has maintained a horizontal approach through a comprehensive care programme. The total cost of the comprehensive hospital programme described is 3. 2 million USD per year, corresponding to 6. 4 USD per capita. Conclusion: Considering the relatively low cost of a comprehensive hospital programme including outreach services and the lower mortality ratios found in the catchment area of the hospital, we argue that donor funds should be used for supporting <b>horizontal</b> <b>programmes</b> aimed at comprehensive healthcare services. Through a strengthening of the collaboration between government and voluntary agency facilities, with clinical, preventive and managerial capabilities of the health facilities, the programmes will have a more sustainable impact and will achieve greater progress in the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality, as opposed to vertical and segregated programmes that currently are commonly adopted for averting maternal and child deaths. Thus, we conclude that horizontal and comprehensive services of the type described in this article should be considered as a prerequisite for sustainable health care delivery at all policy and decision-making levels of the local, national and international health care delivery pyramid. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Community {{involvement}} {{has been}} {{employed in the}} development of both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> health <b>programmes.</b> In Uganda, there is no empirical evidence on whether and how communities are involved in their health services. Aim and Setting: The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the existence of community involvement in health services and to identify its support mechanisms in Namayumba and Bobi health centres in Wakiso and Gulu districts, respectively. Methods: Participants were selected with the help of a community mobiliser. Key informants were selected purposively depending on their expertise and the roles played in their respective communities. The focus group discussions and key informant interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were analysed manually for emerging themes and sub-themes. Results: Several themes emerged from the transcripts and we categorised them broadly into those that promote community involvement in health services and those that jeopardise it. Easy community mobilisation and several forms of community and health centre efforts promote community involvement, whilst lack of trust for health workers and poor communication downplay community involvement in their health services. Conclusion: Community involvement is low in health services in both Namayumba and Bobi health centres. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{outbreak}} of taro leaf blight (TLB) in 1993 devastated taro production in Samoa. In response, several exotic taro cultivars from Palau, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Philippines, {{reported to have}} tolerance to TLB, were introduced to meet local production demand. The cultivars were highly recommended and were instrumental in establishing the TLB <b>horizontal</b> resistance breeding <b>programme</b> in Samoa. However, despite their positive impact the need to introduce more diversity to enrich a potentially narrow genepool was recognized. Several exotic cultivars of South East Asian origin were later introduced via the Secretariat of the Pacific Community - Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees (CePaCT) in 2004 and were incorporated into the breeding programme to support the generation of breeding lines; they were characterized by improved disease resistance, good palatability and drought tolerance. Unlike previous breeding cycles, progeny from the crosses between taro of Asian origin {{and those of the}} Pacific showed a huge diversity in types. Regional networks, namely TaroGen and TANSAO, made it easier for the Samoan breeding programme to freely access the much needed genetic diversity from Asia. Consequently Samoan farmers are now planting several varieties generated from the first combination of taro from Asia and the Pacific with two promising progenies favoured by farmers and highly recommended for export by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries...|$|R
40|$|A while ago, "Zephyr" {{was issued}} to the Greek {{academic}} community, a new portal that enables uniform {{access to the}} catalogues of the Greek Academic Libraries, {{in order to make}} easier locating the available books, periodicals and other material. The main objective is to provide a tool that will promote the development of digital collaboration between the Greek Academic Libraries. Zephyr was created within the Libraries <b>Horizontal</b> Action <b>programme</b> (3 rd Community Support Framework Program, 2000 - 2006), by the Information and Technology Services Unit of the University of Crete Library. This product implements a Virtual Union Catalogue for the Libraries that participate in the consortium of the Greek Academic Libraries. The environment, accessible via World Wide Web and based on the international protocol Z 39. 50 for searching heterogeneous sources of information, offers many possibilities to users. The search in selected indexes, in one or more catalogues simultaneously and the record retrieval, take place in a user-friendly interface, suitable for beginners and experienced users. Advanced services are offered to users that register with Zephyr. Creating their own personal Zephyr page, they are given a permanent private space, where they may edit and elaborate the data from the searches they make, anytime and from any place. In this way, they can save search queries, save records etc. All services and possibilities are thoroughly described in an online user guide. This solution, new for the Greek standards, encountered several problems during implementation. Not only in the development phase but during the first period of use as well, the difficulties related to a system of virtual union catalogue have been observed. These difficulties arise mainly because of the heterogeneity of the various catalogues and overcoming them is a point of further investigation and a field of cooperation between Libraries. After a few months of operation, the statistical analysis of the data related to Zephyr usage, lead to some interesting conclusions. Taking them into account and keeping constant to our main purpose, i. e. to fulfill in the best way the needs related to bibliography search in the Greek community, we plan improvements and addition of services...|$|R
40|$|Taro {{production}} in Samoa was devastated with the 1993 taro leaf blight (TLB) outbreak, destroying a crop vital for food security and foreign exchange. Exotic taro cultivars {{from the northern}} Pacific and the Philippines, with reported TLB tolerance, were introduced and used to establish a TLB <b>horizontal</b> resistance breeding <b>programme.</b> However, despite their positive impact the need to enrich a potentially narrow gene pool to prevent future disasters was recognized. More diversity from Southeast Asia was introduced via a Pacific regional genebank in 2004. Unlike previous breeding cycles, progeny which incorporated these new introductions from Asia showed a huge diversity in types. The new progeny, when evaluated, demonstrated improved TLB resistance and palatability, higher yields, better quality (yellow-fleshed corms) and importantly are well liked by many people in Samoa. Further, a cost benefit analysis clearly showed that the cumulative result of the largely publically-funded taro crop improvement programme far outweighed costs. The access and use of non-Pacific diversity was made possible through formal and informal seed systems, {{and the existence of}} regional networks linking Samoa to other Pacific countries and Asia. A recently established global network for edible aroids means that these improved taro cultivars are now being cultivated in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The existence of such networks and genetic diversity will become increasingly important with climate change reinforcing interdependence and the need for global connectivity. This paper discusses the importance of formal and informal approaches to crop improvement, using the case study of taro in Samoa as an example. © ISHS...|$|R
