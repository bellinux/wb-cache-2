40|$|Citizens can be {{resistant}} to environmental changes {{which may be}} disruptive to their ideology, affections, and rootedness to place. Changes {{may be even more}} disruptive if citizens perceive them to occur too rapidly. How communities assess these changes in their neighborhoods is linked to their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with initiatives <b>executed.</b> <b>Satisfaction</b> is one mechanism by which individuals respond to environmental and social changes because it embodies judgmental and cognitive processes in how they assess policies that affect their well being. This research purports that citizens’ acceptance of brownfields redevelopment is related to their perception of community improvements. This research therefore uses public satisfaction as a measure in assessing the perception of success of three brownfield redevelopment projects in Passaic County New Jersey. Their perception of satisfaction results after they have objectively assessed attributes of their social and physical environment. This research uses a variety of quantitative tools with supporting qualitative documentation to explain the effects that the community changes have on the neighborhoods’ perceived success of the redevelopment projects. A survey of 129 respondents residing near three brownfields redevelopment projects in three municipalities in Passaic County New Jersey was conducted. The purpose was to discover the relationship between changes in the built environment and social neighborhood and the level of acceptance or satisfaction with the redevelopment project. Affected citizens’ sentiment of what is valued in a prospective and actual redevelopment exercise was sought. To complement the respondents’ ‘observed changes’ public officials, were questioned and Council Minutes were reviewed in each municipality. Minutes dated from before to after the redevelopments and also newspaper reports were perused for mention of any changes that could be attributed to the redevelopments. The results of this survey indicate that citizens regard improvements in the built environment as well as the social environment as highly significant criteria in evaluating brownfields redevelopment beneficial use. Citizens have high expectations from these brownfield redevelopment projects and tend to be more responsive and supportive when more than one observed positive and less negative changes in the built environment were observed. Brownsfield redevelopment projects received ratings that are more positive when the end use is consistent with citizens’ values and lifestyles and not detract from it. Therefore, this research gives insight to policy makers of how this policy is impacting neighborhoods and to provide guidance to assess how they are progressing towards achieving a major brownfields sustainable goal which is improvement in citizens’ quality of life.  ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an IEEE 802. 15. 6 {{wireless}} body area networks (WBAN) medium {{access control}} protocol is developed to support a wireless USB (WUSB) application as a protocol adaptation layer (PAL). However, current WBAN protocol still does not have well-defined QoS mapping and resource allocation mechanisms to support multimedia streams with requested QoS parameters. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Resource Management Mechanism (RMM). The proposed method provides fair and adaptive QoS provisioning to isochronous streams according to current traffic loads and their requested QoS parameters through <b>executing</b> a <b>satisfaction</b> of QoS algorithm at WUSB/WBAN host. From simulation results, it is shown that the proposed RMM method improves the efficiency of time-slot utilization while it maximizes QoS provisioning...|$|R
40|$|In the {{well-developed}} {{problem solving}} system, much goal satisfaction activity will not involve {{the use of}} heuristic methods. Rather, a problem will activate a known, general strategy which, if successfully <b>executed,</b> guarantees goal <b>satisfaction.</b> To be applicable {{in a variety of}} contexts, such a strategy must be specified in a high level abstraction space. Solutions to tactical details, necessary to bind a strategy to an actual situation, will be based upon similar strategies at lower abstraction levels. The problem solving system will be expected to operate in situations where several, non-independent goals await satisfaction. To function effectively in such situations, the system mus...|$|R
40|$|This thesis compares and {{analyses}} two free, online tools, called Reverso Localize and SYSTRANLinks, which have both machine translation and website localisation capabilities. The {{aim of this}} work was to subjectively evaluate {{the performance of the}} tools, as well as <b>execute</b> an end-user <b>satisfaction</b> evaluation. In order to do so, an evaluation centering around three EAGLES characteristics (functionality, usability, and efficiency) was designed. From the results it was possible to create recommendations for both tools in order to improve their systems as well as their end-user satisfaction scores, and to state which one more effectively localised and translated the text website provided...|$|R
60|$|Epochal as {{starting}} {{the car was}} the drama of parking it before he entered his office. As he turned from Oberlin Avenue round the corner into Third Street, N.E., he peered ahead for a space {{in the line of}} parked cars. He angrily just missed a space as a rival driver slid into it. Ahead, another car was leaving the curb, and Babbitt slowed up, holding out his hand to the cars pressing on him from behind, agitatedly motioning an old woman to go ahead, avoiding a truck which bore down on him from one side. With front wheels nicking the wrought-steel bumper of the car in front, he stopped, feverishly cramped his steering-wheel, slid back into the vacant space and, with eighteen inches of room, manoeuvered to bring the car level with the curb. It was a virile adventure masterfully <b>executed.</b> With <b>satisfaction</b> he locked a thief-proof steel wedge on the front wheel, and crossed the street to his real-estate office {{on the ground floor of}} the Reeves Building.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{tries to}} verify the impact of income and income of {{reference}} group on subjectively experienced happiness. The thesis is following the findings of "tunnel" effect in the countries of former Eastern Bloc (Senik, 2008). By OLS estimation of sample from fourth wave of European Values Study I found the presence of weak positive effect of income on happiness. However we cannot conclude causal relationship from our findings. Effect of reference group income is not consistent across estimated models, but I found some possible suggestions of "tunnel" effect. I also found lower effect of absolute income for employed than for the remaining population in the sample. Estimations were also <b>executed</b> with life <b>satisfaction</b> variable confirming the propriety of distinguishing between happiness and life satisfaction concepts...|$|R
40|$|The diploma paper {{discusses}} the construction {{processes of the}} housing-business facility. The process for each preparation phase for the construction is dealt with. The phases range from the initial studies, {{the composition of the}} investment programme, and numerous variants, to the project variable of the ideational project. In the project engineering phase, the basis of which is the ideational project, we were encountering the consent requirements, and the solving of problems. The preparation includes the execution of public tenders of subcontractors, the conclusion of contracts and the acquisition of the building permit. During the execution the building permit was completed two times. The building was terminated twice and the termination still continues (basement level under the structure and archaeological reasons). In every case of modification the project was analysed forward and financially. The number of residence buildings changed from 93 to 76. The continuation of building is foreseen for in 2010 and the termination is foreseen in the first months of the year 2012. The sale of individual residence buildings to buyers is foreseen in June 2012. We plan that despite the problems the project will be <b>executed</b> to the <b>satisfaction</b> of the buyers and the investor...|$|R
