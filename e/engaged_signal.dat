30|$|Biologically, {{the most}} {{remarkable}} characteristic of arrestins is their ability to bind hundreds of different GPCRs and numerous non-receptor partners. Arrestins exist {{in at least three}} distinct conformations: free, receptor-bound, and microtubule-bound. Structurally, an important feature of arrestins is high flexibility in every state. X-ray crystallography and biophysical studies clearly show that in both free and receptor-bound state arrestins explore a wide range of conformations. Conceivably, the conformational spaces covered by free, receptor- and microtubule-bound arrestins partially overlap. This flexibility likely underlies remarkable functional versatility of arrestins and represents the structural basis for the ability of arrestins to scaffold signaling pathways. The functionality of free arrestins and their separated elements paves the way for the use of arrestin-based molecular tools to manipulate cellular signaling for experimental and, potentially, therapeutic purposes. The correlation of functional capabilities with high probability of disorder suggests that in search of arrestin elements <b>engaging</b> <b>signaling</b> proteins the field needs to pay closer attention to more disordered parts.|$|R

So far, FTY 720 was mainly considered to target trafficking of immune cells but not brain cells such as neurons. Herein, we analyzed FTY 720 's potential to directly alter neuronal function. In CNS neurons, we identified a FTY 720 governed gene expression response. FTY 720 upregulated immediate early genes (IEGs) encoding for neuronal activity associated transcription factors such as c-Fos, FosB, Egr 1 and Egr 2 and induced actin cytoskeleton associated genes (actin isoforms, tropomyosin, calponin). Stimulation of primary neurons with FTY 720 enhanced neurite growth and altered growth cone morphology. In accordance, FTY 720 enhanced axon regeneration in mice upon facial nerve axotomy. We identified components of a FTY 720 <b>engaged</b> <b>signaling</b> cascade including S 1 P receptors, G 12 / 13 G-proteins, RhoA-GTPases and the transcription factors SRF/MRTF.

40|$|Type I interferons (IFNs) are {{important}} in the immune response. After pathogen detection, host cells rapidly trigger innate immune mechanisms such as inflammatory cytokines production, thus leading to the eradication of the invading virus. Such mechanisms <b>engage</b> <b>signaling</b> cascades which, in the initial phase of infection, lead to the activation of the NF-κB pathway and IFN regulatory factors (IRF- 3, IRF- 7) which directly control the production of IFNs. Proper regulation of IFN induction takes place by ubiqutination and allows to maintain {{a balance between the}} activation and inhibition of the immune system response due to an infection. Studies in recent years indicate that ubiquitination of proteins can affect both proteasomal degradation as well as the non-canonical pathway which results in the regulation of their activity. The type of ubiquitination primarily depends on the attachment of ubiquitin chain to thetarget protein but also on the activity of proteases from DUBs family. The ubiquitin pathway holds many potential therapeutic targets. Thus, the more detailed understanding of the mechanism of ubiquitination and the role of ubiquitin involved in IFNs production pathways may provide a turning point for both antiviral therapy and autoimmune diseases...|$|R

Expression of LMP 2 A and LMP 2 B had no effect on the morphology of squamous epithelial cells in monolayer culture, but their expression was associated with an increased capacity to spread and migrate on extracellular matrix. Although the mechanisms by which LMP 2 A and LMP 2 B promote cell spreading and motility are unclear, the use of selective pharmacological inhibitors has established a role for tyrosine kinases in this phenotype but ruled out contributions of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase C. The ability of LMP 2 B to induce a phenotype that is virtually indistinguishable from that of LMP 2 A suggests that regions of the LMP 2 protein in addition to the cytosolic amino terminus are capable of inducing phenotypic effects in epithelial cells.

Theta burst stimulation in the MT reliably induced long-term potentiation in the MT-ACC pathway in normal rats, but was occluded in the VH state.

40|$|Approximately 15 – 20 % {{of global}} cancer {{incidence}} is causally linked to viral infection, yet the low incidence of cancers in healthy infected individuals suggests that malignant conversion of virus-infected cells occurs {{after a long}} period {{as a result of}} additional genetic modifications. There are four families of viruses that are now documented {{to be involved in the}} development of human cancers which include members of the polyomavirus, hepadnavirus, papillomavirus and herpesvirus families. Although a number of these viruses are implicated in the aetiology of lymphomas or leukaemias, the vast majority are associated with malignancies of epithelial cells. In epithelial tissues, several classes of proteins are involved in maintaining tissue architecture, including those that promote cell–cell adhesion, and others, which mediate cell–matrix interactions. Proteins representative of all classes are frequently altered in malignant tumour cells that possess invasive and metastatic properties. Malignant tumour cells acquire mechanisms to degrade basement membranes and invade the underlying tissue. Many viruses encode proteins which <b>engage</b> <b>signalling</b> pathways that affect one or more of these mechanisms.

Direct inhibition of GSK- 3, that <b>engages</b> Wnt <b>signaling</b> downstream of the Wnt receptor, increases b-catenin nuclear translocation and b-cell proliferation but results in lower insulin content. Our current goal was to engage canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling at the receptor level to significantly increase human b-cell proliferation while maintaining a b-cell phenotype in intact islets. We adopted a system that utilized conditioned medium from L cells that expressed Wnt 3 a, R-spondin- 3 and Noggin (L-WRN conditioned medium). In addition we used a ROCK inhibitor (Y- 27632) and SB- 431542 (that results in RhoA inhibition) in these cultures. Treatment of intact human islets with L-WRN conditioned medium plus inhibitors significantly increased DNA synthesis, 6 fold in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Moreover, this treatment strikingly increased human b-cell proliferation, 20 fold above glucose alone. Only the combination of L-WRN conditioned medium with RhoA/ROCK inhibitors resulted in substantial proliferation. Transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling demonstrated that L-WRN medium provoked robust changes in several signaling families, including enhanced b-catenin-mediated and b-cell-specific gene expression. This treatment also increased expression of Nr 4 a 2 and Irs 2 and resulted in phosphorylation of Akt.

In the present study, we utilized an omega- 3 diet during early life as a metabolic preconditioning to alter the course of TBI during adulthood. TBI animals under omega- 3 deficiency were more prone to alterations in energy homeostasis (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; AMPK phosphorylation and cytochrome C oxidase II; COII levels) and mitochondrial biogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 -alpha; PGC- 1 α and mitochondrial transcription factor A; TFAM). A similar response was found for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its signaling through tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). The results from in vitro studies showed that 7, 8 -dihydroxyflavone (7, 8 -DHF), a TrkB receptor agonist, upregulates the levels of biogenesis activator PGC- 1 α, and CREB phosphorylation in neuroblastoma cells suggesting that BDNF–TrkB signaling is pivotal for <b>engaging</b> <b>signals</b> related to synaptic plasticity and energy metabolism. The treatment with 7, 8 -DHF elevated the mitochondrial respiratory capacity, which emphasizes the role of BDNF–TrkB signaling as mitochondrial bioenergetics stimulator. Omega- 3 deficiency worsened the effects of TBI on anxiety-like behavior and potentiated a reduction of anxiolytic neuropeptide Y 1 receptor (NPY 1 R).
