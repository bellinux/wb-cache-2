This paper displays the features of permeability stress sensitivity in tight gas sandstone in Kirthar fold belt lower Indus Basin, Sindh, Pakistan. The experiments performed under a range of pore pressure and confining stress, {{and the results were}} analyzed by integrating with microstructural observations. The results obtained were used, to explore the combined effects of changing pore pressure on slippage and absolute permeability. The results revealed that the stress sensitivity increases as the permeability decreases; this is because of existence of microfractures and the presence of larger pore throat radius. In addition, the effective pore size was calculated from the gas slip parameter, and at low confining stress levels, this value was in the same order of magnitude as the microfracture width. Moreover, the pore size calculated from gas slip parameters was reduced at higher stress levels, which indicated <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>fractures</b> closures.|$|E

40|$|In-situ testing, {{ultrasonic}} C-scans, and metallography {{were used}} {{to show that a}} crack-divider delamination form of thin-sheet toughening occurs in wrought Low Carbon Arc Cast (LCAC) unalloyed molybdenum, Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) molybdenum, and TZM molybdenum at temperatures {ge} the Ductile to Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT). Cracking along boundaries relieves mechanical constraint to free ligaments that may plastically stretch to produce toughening. Anisotropy in fracture toughness with lower values in the short-transverse direction is shown to produce the crack divider delaminations at the crack tip in the LT and TL orientations. The delamination zone increases with increasing stress-intensity to sizes significantly larger than the plastic zone, which leads to large increases in fracture toughness by the thin sheet toughening mechanism. Fracture in ODS Mo-alloys proceeds mainly along <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> to produce small ligaments that exhibit ductility for both LT and TL orientations resulting in a lower DBTT and higher toughness values at lower temperatures than observed in LCAC and TZM. A combination of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>fracture</b> and cleavage is prevalent in LCAC molybdenum and TZM. The predominance for microcracking along <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> to leave fine, ductile ligaments in ODS molybdenum can be attributed to a fine-grained microstructure with {approx} 1 - 2 {micro}m thickness of sheet-like grains.

At the atomistic level, the computer model is capable of treating bicrystals {{under the influence of}} external load and temperature with dynamic periodic boundary conditions along the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> plane and a dynamic boundary condition perpendicular to the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> plane. At the microscopic level, the computer model is capable of treating the sample with microstructure defined by the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> character distribution under the influence of an external load to predict the intergranular fracture propagation under stress. The fracture behavior of many $ Sigma$ <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> has been investigated at the atomistic level for Cu, Ni, and Ni$ sb 3 $Al, and the fracture resistance of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> was predicted. It has been found that <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> energy and <b>fracture</b> resistance greatly depend on the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> structure. Symmetrical $ Sigma$ 3 twin boundaries and low angle $ Sigma 1 $ boundaries are particularly strong in resisting intergranular fracture, while some other low $ Sigma$ boundaries are also strong, but <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> with high energies are not at all fracture resistant. The calculated correlation between fracture resistance and misorientation of <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> is in accordance with the experimental data. The calculated fracture resistances of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> for Ni$ sb 3 $Al alloy are not significantly different from those for pure Ni. This suggests that the tendency to intergranular fracture is not due merely to the poor <b>fracture</b> resistance of <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries.</b> One must also consider the overall <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> character distribution. In order to find the role of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> character distribution on the intergranular fracture in brittle polycrystalline materials, the crack path, crack arrest distance, and fracture toughness have been investigated at the microscopic level with the different fraction of low-energy <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries,</b> <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>fracture</b> resistance, orientation distribution of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> planes, and <b>grain</b> shape factor. The simulations have indicated that with an increase in the fraction of low energy <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries,</b> the <b>fracture</b> toughness increases while the crack arrest distance decreases. With {{an increase in the number}} of low energy <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> which are aligned parallel to the stress axis, one observes an increase in the fracture toughness and a decrease in the crack arrest distance. By increasing the grain shape factor, the fracture toughness decreases while the crack arrest distance increases. If five grain diameter is defined as the critical length, and more than 25 % of <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> are of low-energy with the highest fracture resistance, such as $ Sigma$ 3 twin <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries,</b> the intergranular crack formed initially cannot propagate further due to the presence of fewer random boundaries, and the polycrystalline materials will show high ductility.

Concrete particles 10 mm in size are treated individually in a single mode cavity microwave (2. 45 GHz, 2 kW) test apparatus. The microwave induced effects are quantified by single particle impact testing on a fast Hopkinson bar. Analysis of impact traces reveals a thorough embrittlement of concrete particles from microwave treatment and fragment analysis confirms the potential of microwaves for selective liberation of the raw constituents of concrete. These results validate that microwaves and comminution can be combined to liberate concrete’s raw constituents...|$|R
40|$|Ni_ 3 Al thin foils with 315 to 357 μm {{thickness}} {{were successfully}} fabricated by cold rolling. X-ray pole figures showed {{the formation of}} { 110 } rolling textures with various rolling directions in the foils cold rolled over 83 % reduction. The deformation microstructure consists of fine slip traces and coarse and wavy shear bands. Banded deformation structure was observed in some foils. In the foils cold rolled to 83 % reduction, the Vickers hardness number reached over 600 and the ultimate tensile strength over 1. 7 GPa, irrespective of rolling texture and deformation microstructure. The cold rolled foils showed no tensile elongation, but {{it was possible to}} bend the foils. The foils recrystallized at temperatures over 1273 K had some tensile ductility (3. 0 to 14. 6 %), though the polycrystalline Ni_ 3 Al is known to be brittle due to severe <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>fracture.</b> Electron backscatter diffraction measurements revealed that the large amount of total <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> area consists of low angle (LAB) and ∑ 3 coincidence lattice boundaries. This large fraction is probably a chief cause of the observed ductility...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two main}} issues {{regarding}} thin film debonding. The first is the nucleation of interfacial cracks, while {{the second is the}} propagation of cracks. From a mechanical testing point of view, scratch testing primarily serves to address the former issue, while indentation testing is a method of addressing the latter. A new probing technique has been developed to test thin film mechanical properties. In the Microwedge Scratch Test (MWST), a wedge shaped diamond indenter tip is drawn along a fine line, while simultaneously being driven into the line. The authors compare microwedge scratching of Zone 1 and Zone T thin film specimens of sputtered W on SiO{sub 2 }. Symptomatic of its poor mechanical properties, the Zone 1 film displays three separate crack systems. Because of its superior <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> strength, the Zone T film displayed only one of these [...] an interfacial crack system. Using bimaterial linear elastic fracture mechanics, governing equations are developed for propagating interfacial cracks, including expressions for strain energy release rate, bending strain, and mode mixity. <b>Grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>fracture</b> strength information may be deduced from the Zone 1 films, while adhesion may be inferred from the Zone T films...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} {{tests were conducted}} on the notched plates of SNCM 8 steel tempered at low temperatures in 3. 5 % NaCl solution environment. The effects of notch radius and plate thickness on nucleation and growth of cracks were analysed from a viewpoint of fracture mechanics. The results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) The time to crack nucleation at the notch root t_n was correlated to the notch radius ρ and the stress intensity factor K_ 0 by the following equation: t_n= 5. 8 x 10 ^ (K_ 0 /√) ^ (2) The relation between crack growth rate and stress intensity factor was divided into three regions I, II and III. In regions II and III, the growth rate {{was found to be}} higher in thicker specimens than in thinner ones, while there was no thickness effect on growth rate in region I including K_ (3) Scanning electron microscopic observations of fracture surfaces indicated that intergranular fracture along prior austenite <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> was predominant in the region of low stress intensity factors and that the fraction of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>fracture</b> area in the total fracture surface decreased with increasing stress intensity factor...|$|R
