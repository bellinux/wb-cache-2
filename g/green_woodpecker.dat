5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
50|$|The gorge {{is home to}} {{many species}} of flora and fauna, {{including}} <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> otters. and badgers.|$|R
50|$|Ospreys, otters, red kites, peregrines and hen {{harriers}} can {{be found}} here together with <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and nightjars.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{animal species}} in the wood include badgers, roe deer, kingfishers, spotted flycatchers, sparrowhawks, spotted and <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> as well as Natterer's, noctule, pipistrelle, brown long-eared and Daubenton's bats.|$|R
25|$|Bird species {{include more}} common lapwings, mallards, quails and pheasants. Common {{woodland}} and parkland birds during the nesting season include great tit, blue tit, long-tailed tit, Eurasian nuthatch, European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> great spotted woodpecker, golden oriole, nightingale, blackcap, common chaffinch, hooded crow, European magpie, common wood pigeon, feral pigeon, white wagtail and barn swallow.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} animal live on Lüneburg Heath, {{particularly}} birds that are {{at home in the}} wide, open landscape, some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas. These include the: black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), the nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), the woodlark (Lullula arborea), the great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor), the red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), the northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), the wryneck (Jynx torquilla), the European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Picus viridis), the stonechat (Saxicola torquata), the Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), the common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the black stork (Ciconia nigra). In the Lüneburg Heath the population of the very rare black grouse is rising continually. In 2007 78 were counted, 13 more than in the previous year. Since 2003 the number of grouse has doubled.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker is the most common, but the black woodpecker, the European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and the lesser spotted woodpecker are also themselves common. The population of white-backed woodpecker, a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals {{in the whole country}} in 2004, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003, and then a new couple in 2010. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the grey-headed woodpecker is becoming more common. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian pygmy owl and the Ural owl. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park. Apart from these species, there are the common buzzard, the Eurasian hobby, or even, among others, the European honey buzzard.|$|E

500|$|John Brewer, {{writing in}} the London Review of Books, says that for his Birds, [...] "Bewick had {{acquired}} national renown as the artist who most truthfully depicted {{the flora and fauna}} of the British countryside." [...] He adds that [...] "Bewick's achievement was both technical and aesthetic." [...] In his view, Bewick [...] "reconciled nature, science and art. [...] His engravings of British birds, which represent his work at its finest, are almost all rendered with the precision of the ornithologist: but they also portray the animals in their natural habitat– the grouse shelters in his covert, the <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> perches on a gnarled branch, waders strut by streams..." [...] He observes that [...] "Most of the best engravings include a figure, incident or building which draws the viewer's eye beyond and behind the animal profile in the foreground. Thus the ploughboy in the distant field pulls our gaze past the yellow wagtail..." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>GREEN</b> <b>WOODPECKER</b> (Picus viridis).--The {{laugh and}} the tap may be heard {{all through the}} Spring days. In 1890 Picus major, a small, black, and spotted French Magpie, as Devonians call it, was found, {{but we have no}} other right to claim it.|$|E

60|$|It {{was plain}} {{that he had}} no {{accurate}} knowledge of birds; if he had caught sight of a kingfisher or <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> he would probably have described it as a sort of peacock. Of the goose, he only knew that it is a ridiculous, awkward creature, proverbial for its stupidity, although very good to eat; and it wounded him to find that any one could think so meanly of his intelligence and taste as to imagine him capable of greatly admiring any bird called a goose, or any bird in any way related to a goose.|$|E
60|$|I shall ask for {{no other}} song, {{but there will be}} other creatures there. Down the tall grey trunk of a beech tree before me a {{squirrel}} will slip--down, down nearly to the mossy roots, then pause and remain so motionless as to seem like a squirrel-shaped patch of bright chestnut-red moss or lichen or alga on the grey bark. And on the next tree, but a little distance off, I shall presently catch sight of another listener and watcher--a <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> clinging vertically against the trunk, so still as to look like a bird figure carved in wood and painted green and gold and crimson.|$|E
6000|$|Even some of {{the less}} common and less tame birds care as little for {{a man on a}} bicycle as they do for a cow. Not long ago a peewit trotted leisurely across the road not more than ten yards from my front wheel; and on the same day I came upon a <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> enjoying a dust-bath in the public road. He {{declined}} to stir until I stopped to watch him, then merely flew about a dozen yards away and attached himself to the trunk of a fir tree at the roadside and waited there for me to go. Never in all my wanderings afoot had I seen a yaffingale dusting himself like a barn-door fowl! ...|$|E

60|$|Just when I had got so {{far with}} the thought of what my dream was to be, I raised my eyes from the fire and allowed them to rest attentively {{for the first time on}} a {{collection}} of ornaments crowded together in a niche in the wall at the side of the fireplace. The ornamental objects one sees in a cottage are as a rule offensive to me, and I have acquired the habit of not seeing them; now I was compelled to look at these. There were photographs, little china vases and cups with boys or cupids, and things of that kind; these I did not regard; my whole attention was directed to a pair of glass-fronted cases and the living creatures in them. They were not really alive, but dead and stuffed and set up in life-like attitudes, and one was a squirrel, the other a <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The squirrel with his back to his neighbour sat up on his mossy wood, his bushy tail thrown along his back, his two little hands grasping a hazel-nut, which he was in the act of conveying to his mouth. The <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> was placed vertically against his branch, his side towards his neighbour, his head turned partly round so that he looked directly at him with one eye. That wide-open white glass eye and the whole attitude of the bird, with his wings half open and beak raised, gave him a wonderfully alert look, so that after regarding him fixedly for some time I began to imagine that, despite the old dead dusty look of the feathers, there was something of life still remaining in him and that he really was watching his neighbour with the nut very intently.|$|E
6000|$|Coming {{in by the}} moated palace I stood {{once more}} on the Green before that west front, {{beautiful}} beyond all others, {{in spite of the}} strange defeatures Time has written on it. I watched the daws, numerous as ever, still at their old mad games, now springing into the air to scatter abroad with ringing cries, only to return the next minute and fling themselves back on their old perches on a hundred weather-stained broken statues in the niches. And while I stood watching them from the palace trees close by came the loud laugh of the <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The same wild, beautiful sound, uttered perhaps by the same bird, which I had often heard at that spot ten years ago! [...] "You will not hear that woodland sound in any other city in the kingdom," [...] I wrote in a book of sketches entitled [...] "Birds and Man", published in 1901.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it is hard}} {{to imagine}} a birdless Wells. The hills, {{beautiful}} with trees and grass and flowers, come down to it; cattle graze on their slopes; the peewit has its nest in their stony places, and the kestrel with quick-beating wings hangs motionless overhead. Nature is round it, breathing upon and touching it caressingly on every side; flowing through it like the waters that gave it its name in olden days, that still gush with noise and foam from the everlasting rock, to send their crystal currents along the streets. And with nature, in and around the rustic village-like city, live the birds. The <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> laughs aloud from the group of old cedars and pines, hard by the cathedral close--you will not hear that woodland sound in any other city in the kingdom; and the rooks caw all day from the rookery in the old elms that grow at the side of the palace moat. But the cathedral daws, on account of their numbers, are the most important of the feathered inhabitants of Wells. These city birds are familiarly called [...] "Bishop's Jacks," [...] to distinguish them from the [...] "Ebor Jacks," [...] the daws that in large numbers have their home and breeding-place in the neighbouring cliffs, called the Ebor Rocks.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{breeding}} population of pied flycatcher. Other birds commonly observed here include the jay, long-tailed tit, magpie, nuthatch, raven, treecreeper, {{and the great}} spotted and <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> The buzzard, kestrel and sparrowhawk are common raptors, while merlin and peregrine falcon have been observed more rarely.|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} well used by walkers, runners, swimmers, {{wildlife}} enthusiasts and cyclists: a footpath combined with National Cycle Route 61 runs along virtually its entire length. A {{wide variety of}} bird life can be seen along the river, including <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> cormorants, lapwing and red kites.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{a mixture}} of pasture and woodland. Birds include long-tailed tits, robins, great spotted and <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> and there are orange tip and {{speckled}} wood butterflies.

6000|$|That {{was truly}} unkind of him, for, {{as a matter}} of fact, and to begin at the (apparent) beginning, I was born in the village of Lyndsey in Kent--the prettiest country spot, as I believe, in all that county's million acres. So it remains to this day {{in spite of the fact}} that since my {{childhood}} its little church with its decaying stones and unfading twelfth--or is it thirteenth?--century glass has been [...] "restored," [...] and the lord of the manor has felled some of its finest trees, including a grove of sweet chestnuts on Bitchett Heath whose forefathers came over with the Romans. But he has not yet succeeded in levelling the barrow on Chizzel Hill. From my window I looked out (indeed, look out at this moment) to the wave-like crest of this beloved hill across a long straggling orchard, and pastures in the valley, where cattle grazed and sheep wandered, and unpolled willows stooped and silvered in the breeze. I never wearied of the hill, nor ever shall, and when, in my girlhood, my grandfather, aware of this idle, gazing habit of mine, sent me from Geneva a diminutive telescope, my day-dreams multiplied. His gift, as an old Kentish proverb goes, spread butter on bacon. With his spyglass to my eye I could bring a tapping <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> as close as if it were actually laughing at me, and could all but snuff up the faint rich scent of the cowslips--paggles, as we called them, in meadows a good mile away.|$|E
60|$|As they advanced, {{the path}} still tended upwards, running from heath into copses of holly and yew, and so back into heath again. It was joyful {{to hear the}} merry whistle of {{blackbirds}} as they darted from one clump of greenery to the other. Now and again a peaty amber colored stream rippled across their way, with ferny over-grown banks, where the blue kingfisher flitted busily from side to side, or the gray and pensive heron, swollen with trout and dignity, stood ankle-deep among the sedges. Chattering jays and loud wood-pigeons flapped thickly overhead, while ever and anon the measured tapping of Nature's carpenter, the great <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> sounded from each wayside grove. On either side, as the path mounted, the long sweep of country broadened and expanded, sloping down {{on the one side}} through yellow forest and brown moor to the distant smoke of Lymington and the blue misty channel which lay alongside the sky-line, while to the north the woods rolled away, grove topping grove, to where in the furthest distance the white spire of Salisbury stood out hard and clear against the cloudless sky. To Alleyne whose days had been spent in the low-lying coastland, the eager upland air and the wide free country-side gave a sense of life and of the joy of living which made his young blood tingle in his veins. Even the heavy John was not unmoved by the beauty of their road, while the bowman whistled lustily or sang snatches of French love songs in a voice which might have scared the most stout-hearted maiden that ever hearkened to serenade.|$|E
6000|$|I have perhaps {{written at}} too great length of this bird. The {{nightingale}} was after all {{only one of}} the fifty-nine species I succeeded in identifying during my sojourn at the village. There were more. I heard the calls and cries of others in the wood and various places, but refused, except {{in the case of the}} too elusive crake, to set down any in my list that I did not see. It was not my ambition to make a long list. My greatest desire was to see well those that interested me most. But those who go forth, as I did, to look for birds that are a sight for sore eyes, must meet with many a disappointment. In all those fruit and shade trees that covered the village with a cloud of verdure, and in the neighbouring woods, not once did I catch a glimpse of the <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> a beautiful conspicuous bird, supposed to be increasing in many places in England. Its absence from so promising a locality seemed strange. Another species, also said to be increasing in the country--the turtledove, was extremely abundant. In the tall beech woods its low, montonous crooning note was heard all day long from all sides. In shady places, where the loud, shrill bird-voices are few, one prefers this sound to the set song of the woodpigeon, being more continuous and soothing, and of the nature of a lullaby. It sometimes reminded me of the low monotone I have heard from a Patagonian mother when singing her [...] "swart papoose" [...] to sleep. Still, I would gladly have spared many of these woodland crooners for the sake of one magpie--that bird of fine feathers and a bright mind, which I had not looked on for a whole year, and now hoped to see again. But he was not there; and after I had looked for myself, some of the natives assured me that no magpie had been seen for years in that wood.|$|E
