Some analysts believe that two investors can analyze the same {{information}} and reach different conclusions regarding the intrinsic value of the company, {{and that there is}} no systematic or standard way to value a stock.

2500|$|Specific risk is {{the risk}} {{associated}} with individual assets - within a portfolio these risks can be reduced through diversification (specific risks [...] "cancel out"). Specific risk is also called diversifiable, unique, unsystematic, or <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risk.</b> Systematic risk (a.k.a. portfolio risk or market risk) refers to the risk common to all securities—except for selling short as noted below, systematic risk cannot be diversified away (within one market). Within the market portfolio, asset specific risk will be diversified away to the extent possible. Systematic risk is therefore equated with the risk (standard deviation) of the market portfolio.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the vulnerability of}} households in rural India, based upon the ICRISAT panel survey. We employ both ex ante and ex post measures of vulnerability. The latter are decomposed into aggregate and <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> and poverty components. Our decomposition shows that <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> account for the largest share, followed by poverty and aggregate risks. Despite some degree of risk-sharing, the landless or small farmers are vulnerable to <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks,</b> forcing them to reduce consumption.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{managerial}} incentive contracts is examined {{in a setting}} in which economic agents are risk averse, and the actions of manages can affect asset returns which contain both systematic and <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks.</b> It is shown that {{in the absence of}} moral hazard, owners of assets will insure managers against <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks,</b> but with moral hazard, contracts will depend on both systematic and <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks.</b> The traditional recommendation of asset pricing models, namely, to focus only on systematic risks, is thus proved to be valid only when there is no moral hazard. The major empirically testable predictions of the model are (1) managerial incentive contracts will generally depend on systematic as well as <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks,</b> (2) <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> will generally be important in investment decisions, (3) the managers of firms with relatively high levels of <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> will have compensations that are less dependent on their firms' excess returns, and (4) the compensations of managers of larger firms will be relatively more dependent on the excess returns of their firms. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} new {{approach}} to analyze potentially omitted non-diversifiable factors in the <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> from multi-factor asset pricing models. It is shown that if there is an omitted non-diversifiable hidden factor, the <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> will contain persistent cross-sectional memory. An extended Rescaled Variance test generalized from L. Giraitis, P. Kokoszaka, R. Leipus, and G. Teyssiere [1] with finite forecast horizon is provided to investigate the cross-sectional memory of forecast errors in multifactor pricing models. Under the null hypothesis that <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> contain only short memory when there is no hidden non-diversifiable factor, we demonstrate that the extendedT-sample Rescaled Variance test statistic approximates a functional of weighted Brownian Bridge, which is distributed asymptotically as the T-sample Watson’s statistic presented by Maag [2]. Using this approach, our empirical tests that compare forecast errors from the CAPM and Fama-French [3] model with the excess returns of 1391 firms indicate that there is a strong likelihood that the CAPM may require further identification of hidden non-diversifiable factor(s). Yet, there lacks convincing evidence that the Fama-French [3] model has an omitted non-diversifiable factor in <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{economic}} modeling, model outcomes depend {{heavily on}} the nature of risk. Modelers often incorporate aggregate risk through shocks to endowments (budget constraints), productivity, monetary policy, or external factors like terms of trade. <b>Idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> can be introduced through mechanisms like individual labor productivity shocks; if agents possess the ability to trade assets and lack borrowing constraints, the welfare effects of <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> are minor. The welfare costs of aggregate risk, though, can be significant.|$|R
50|$|According to one {{macroeconomic}} model {{including a}} financial sector, hedging <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risk</b> can be self-defeating as {{it leads to}} higher systemic risk, as it takes on more leverage. This makes the system less stable. Thus, while securitisation in principle reduces the costs of idiosyncratic shocks it ends up amplifying systemic risks in equilibrium.|$|E
5000|$|In {{portfolio}} theory, {{risks of}} price changes {{due to the}} unique circumstances of a specific security, {{as opposed to the}} overall market, are called [...] "idiosyncratic risks". This specific risk, also called unsystematic, can be nulled out of a portfolio through diversification. Pooling multiple securities means the specific risks cancel out. In complete markets, there is no compensation for idiosyncratic risk—that is, a security's <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risk</b> does not matter for its price. For instance, in a complete market in which the capital asset pricing model holds, the price of a security is determined by the amount of systematic risk in its returns. Net income received, or losses suffered, by a landlord from renting of one or two properties is subject to <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risk</b> due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.|$|E

50|$|Systematic risk {{plays an}} {{important}} role in portfolio allocation. Risk which cannot be eliminated through diversification commands returns in excess of the risk-free rate (while <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risk</b> does not command such returns since it can be diversified). Over the long run, a well-diversified portfolio provides returns which correspond with its exposure to systematic risk; investors face a trade-off between returns and systematic risk. Therefore, an investor's desired returns correspond with their desired exposure to systematic risk and corresponding asset selection. Investors can only reduce a portfolio's exposure to systematic risk by sacrificing returns.|$|E

The paper establishes a relationship between the volume of trade in nominal assets, the stochastic characteristics of the price shocks and the covariance between the price and idiosyncratic shocks. ...|$|R
50|$|Consider an {{investor}} who purchases stock in many firms from most global industries.

50|$|Systematic or {{aggregate}} risk {{arises from}} market structure or dynamics which produce shocks or uncertainty faced by all {{agents in the}} market; such shocks could arise from government policy, international economic forces, or acts of nature. In contrast, specific risk (sometimes called residual risk or <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risk)</b> is risk to which only specific agents or industries are vulnerable (and is uncorrelated with broad market returns). Due to the idiosyncratic nature of unsystematic risk, it can be reduced or eliminated through diversification; but since all market actors are vulnerable to systematic risk, it cannot be limited through diversification (but it may be insurable). As a result, assets whose expected returns are negatively correlated with broader market returns command higher prices than assets not possessing this property.|$|E
40|$|Enterprise risk {{management}} (ERM) encompasses {{the spectrum of}} identifying and analyzing risk from an integrated, company-wide perspective in a structured and disciplined approach in aligning strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge with a purpose of evaluating and managing the uncertainties facing the enterprise as it creates value. ERM essentially lays concern for managing the firm’s <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> apart from the systematic risks. However, the neo-classical finance theory (NCFT) postulates that managing the firm’s <b>idiosyncratic</b> <b>risks</b> is irrelevant.
