5|$|The {{other major}} {{factors in the}} decline of coal {{were related to the}} massive {{under-investment}} in Rhondda mines over the past decades. Most of the mines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> were sunk between the 1850s and 1880s, which, as a consequence, meant they were far smaller than most modern mines. The Rhondda mines were in comparison antiquated, with methods of ventilation, coal-preparation and power supply all of a poor standard. In 1945 the British coal industry cut 72 per cent of their output mechanically, whereas in South Wales the figure was just 22 per cent. The only way to ensure the financial survival of the mines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> was massive investment from the NCB, but the 'Plan for Coal' paper drawn up in 1950 was overly optimistic in the future demand for coal, which was drastically reduced following an industrial recession in 1956 and an increased availability of oil.|$|E
5|$|A {{short period}} of glacial {{conditions}} returned between 12,650 and 11,550 years BP, known in Britain as the Loch Lomond Stadial (and elsewhere as the Younger Dryas stadial), when the Gulf Stream current ceased to flow past the British Isles. Small cirque and valley glaciers formed in north and east facing valleys, including Grisedale and the coves {{on the east side}} of Helvellyn. The results are seen in moraines of unsorted boulder gravel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys,</b> the spectacular coves with steep headwalls, and the sharp arêtes formed where the rock was eroded on both sides between adjacent glaciers.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of playing fields <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys,</b> many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded but many of the clubs survive to this day.|$|E

5|$|Many petroglyphs or carved {{images of}} dogs were found near {{religious}} centers and chiefly residential areas indicating their venerated status and {{importance in the}} culture. A survey by American archaeologist Sidsel N.

5|$|The Dorset is {{an ancient}} breed that was most likely {{developed}} from horned sheep that lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> and pastures of southwestern England. Dorset Horn sheep were imported into the United States in 1860, and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891. Today, the Dorset is found in two varieties globally, Horned and Polled. In the Horn variety, both ewes and rams have horns, while the polled variety have no horns at all. Polled Dorsets are ideal for commercial settings {{because they do not}} have horns that can get caught in fencing or cause damage when they butt.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Switzerland is multifaceted. While some {{dishes such as}} fondue, raclette or rösti are omnipresent {{through the}} country, each region {{developed}} its own gastronomy according to the differences of climate and languages. Traditional Swiss cuisine uses ingredients {{similar to those in}} other European countries, as well as unique dairy products and cheeses such as Gruyère or Emmental, produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> of Gruyères and Emmental. The number of fine-dining establishments is high, particularly in western Switzerland.|$|E

60|$|The hygrometric {{state of}} the {{atmosphere}} of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> differs most decidedly from that of <b>the</b> hills. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> dew is constantly formed, which is owing {{to the amount of}} moisture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, for nocturnal radiation is more powerful on the hills. The sunrise and 9 p.m. observations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> give a mean depression of the dew-point below the air of 12.3 degrees, and those at the upper level of 21.2 degrees, with no dew on the hills and a copious deposit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> <b>The</b> corresponding {{state of the}} atmosphere as to saturation is 0.480 on the hills and 0.626 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|R

5|$|Traditionally, animal {{husbandry}} {{was part of}} the subsistence farmer's way of life, producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal was still alive. In the traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture was up in the mountains, the winter pasture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys.</b>|$|E
5|$|Andriamanelo is {{typically}} {{portrayed as a}} civilizing king {{in contrast to the}} primitive Vazimba against whom he waged war. As such, oral history credits him with discovering such diverse arts as silversmithing and astrology (sikidy) in addition to iron working. He reputedly introduced knowledge about the construction and use of pirogues, and was the first in the highlands to transform lowland swamps into irrigated rice paddies through the construction of dikes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> around Alasora. The Merina rite of circumcision, described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy {{through the end of the}} 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Common {{over much}} of the Northern Hemisphere, S.coccinea occurs in the Midwest, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> between the Pacific coast, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. Its North American {{distribution}} extends north to various locations in Canada and south to the Mexican state Jalisco. The fungus has also been collected from Chile in South America. It is also found in the Old World—Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and India. Specimens collected from the Macaronesian islands that once thought to be S.coccinea were later determined to be the distinct species S.macaronesica. A 1995 study of the occurrence of British Sarcoscypha (including S.coccinea and S.austriaca) concluded that S.coccinea was becoming very rare in Great Britain. All species of Sarcoscypha, including S.coccinea, are Red-Listed in Europe. In Turkey, it is considered critically endangered.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century Bani Zeid {{was one of}} 21 sheikdoms in {{the central}} {{highlands}} of Palestine. While its exact borders varied from time to time, it was generally marked by the Wadi al-Dilb stream to the south, which separated it from the Bani Harith al-Shamali sheikdom, and the Wadi Nattif stream to the north that separated it from Bilad Jamma'in. The Bani Zeid sheikdom contained the highest slopes and the largest concentration of mountain faults of all the highland sheikdoms. About two-thirds of its villages were situated on relatively wide hilltops while the remainder were built along slopes. None were located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> or the foothills. In 1838 English biblical scholars Edward Robinson and Eli Smith noted that the Bani Zeid Nahiya consisted of 18 inhabited localities and four khirbas (abandoned or ruined villages). They classified Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima as inhabited by Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The K'iche' king Q'uq'umatz died {{in battle}} against {{a group of}} the {{northern}} Mam. His son K'iq'ab continued where his father had left off and completed the conquest of the people. K'iq'ab was ruler when Zaculeu was conquered by the K'iche.' This {{appears to have been}} a second K'iche' conquest of the city, having previously fallen some time earlier. When the K'iche' conquered another kingdom, its practice was to place the newly subject kingdom under the control of one of the K'iche' noble lineages. Based on the style of Structure 4, archeologists believe that Zaculeu was likely controlled by the Nija'ib.' The Ilocab, who had conquered much of the region, are another possibility. The K'iche' tended to place their newly installed ruling elite in a mountain-top fortress securing the population <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> below. However, substantial portions of the original Mam population remained in place in the plateau area.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} 56 {{recorded}} mammal species. Grizzly and black bear inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, Canada lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf {{are the primary}} predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose {{tend to be more}} elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.|$|E

5|$|The park's {{predominant}} {{environment is}} open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands {{of the park}} have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river {{in the south of}} the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} Native American groups {{inhabited}} {{the area from}} as early as 7000BC, most recently the Timbisha around 1000AD who migrated between winter camps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> and summer grounds in the mountains. A group of European-Americans that became stuck in the valley in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the gold fields of California gave the valley its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable ore to be mined was borax, which was transported out of the valley with twenty-mule teams. The valley later {{became the subject of}} books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism blossomed in the 1920s, when resorts were built around Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} major rock {{formations}} from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods {{are present in}} Quehanna Wild Area. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points on the plateau, is the Pennsylvanian Allegheny Formation, which has clay, coal, limestone, sandstone, and shale. Below this is the Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal, and which forms much of the Quehanna plateau. The next formations are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valleys</b> and gorges which the creeks have eroded over time. The first {{of these is the}} Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is buff colored with shale, coal, and conglomerate inclusions; parts of this formation are also known as the Burgoon Sandstone. Below this is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation.|$|E
