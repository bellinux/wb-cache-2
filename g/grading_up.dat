5|$|A less pure form of Limousin is bred up (also {{known as}} graded up) from a base animal over a defined number of generations. A parent of each generation's progeny must be {{registered}} as a Limousin in the respective country's herd book. In the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a graded up Limousin, after three generations for females and four generations for males, is known (confusingly {{with the legal}} European definition) as purebred, which is then eligible for recording in the respective countries' herd books alongside Fullblood and French Pure Limousins. Unlike the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which allow both purebred and Full French bulls and dams {{to be used for}} <b>grading</b> <b>up,</b> in Britain <b>grading</b> <b>up</b> can only occur using Full French bulls. British graded up females when they reach fourth generation from a non-Limousin base cow can then be registered as Limousins in the British Limousin Pedigree Register. The British Limousin Pedigree Register is separate from the British Limousin Herd Book, which is reserved for animals that have complete Full French ancestry.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L genes in some tested cattle {{might be a}} result of a sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, or more likely that the myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef cattle. In the latter case, loss of the F94L variant will arise when <b>grading</b> <b>up</b> to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E
5|$|Base animals {{selected}} for the two-stage <b>grading</b> <b>up</b> process to any EU herd book purebred class require a minimum of 3/4 Limousin content. Graded up females using the two-stage process then become eligible for entry into the main section of all EU herd book purebred classes as initial registration (or T.I.) Limousins when they reach 15/16 Limousin content. They are then legally identified as Limousin (i.e. 100% Limousin) – the breed code 34 often substitutes for the word Limousin in French discussions and reports on cattle breeding.|$|E

5|$|Breed {{differences}} {{are expected to}} have reduced since the USMARC studies in the 1980s and 1990s because of the wide-scale introduction and use of performance recording and genetic improvement programmes. The reduction in yield reported for Limousins is possibly a result of the loss of French Limousin content and of F94L myostatin mutations from the US purebred population, which would be an expected result of the purebred <b>grading</b> <b>up</b> process practiced there. Earlier USMARC studies are reported to have evaluated high content pure French Limousins.|$|E
5|$|Most Limousin cattle have a {{coloration}} that {{varies from}} light wheat to darker golden-red. Other coloration, mainly black, {{has been developed}} through cross-breeding and <b>grading</b> <b>up</b> from other breeds of cattle. In addition to altering natural coloration, other traits, such as polled (a genetic lack of horns), have been introduced through cross breeding. Angus cattle have been the dominant source of black and polled genes now present in graded-up high content Limousins found throughout the world.|$|E

500|$|The USA, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand breed {{associations}} do {{not define}} a breed standard in their regulations, {{and application of}} any standard is voluntary. The only requirement for registration as a Fullblood in both North American herd book registers is that ancestors should have [...] "full French ancestry", or trace directly to the [...] "Herd Book Limousin in France". In Australia and New Zealand the French Pure herd book classification requires that animals carry [...] "100% Pure French genetics". USA, Australian and New Zealand breed association regulations also allow graded up animals to be registered in their herd books as purebreds without a requirement {{to comply with a}} minimum French Limousin content. <b>Grading</b> <b>up</b> using these purebreds over base or lower grade animals has resulted in the gradual reduction in the French Limousin content of some purebreds, and an observable divergence from the French breed standard.

50|$|A stud {{animal is}} a {{registered}} animal retained for breeding. The terms for the male of a given animal species (stallion, bull, rooster, etc.) usually imply that the animal is intact—that is, not castrated—and therefore capable of siring offspring.
