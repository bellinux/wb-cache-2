25|$|Because {{very young}} {{children}} (generally under 12 months, but often as old as 24 months,) {{do not have a}} well-developed immune system, it is possible for them to receive organs from otherwise incompatible donors.

25|$|Clean coal {{technology}} usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal.

25|$|ABO-incompatible (ABOi) {{transplantation}} is {{a method}} of allocation in organ transplantation that permits more efficient use of available organs regardless of ABO blood type, which would otherwise be unavailable due to hyperacute rejection. Primarily in use in infants and young toddlers, research is ongoing to allow for increased use of this capability in adult transplants. Normal ABO-compatibility rules may be observed for all recipients. This means that anyone may receive a transplant of a type-O organ, and consequently, type-O recipients {{are one of the}} biggest beneficiaries of ABO-incompatible transplants. While <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> infant heart transplants, the principles generally apply to other forms of solid organ transplantation.|$|E

When it reopened months later, permits for selling were strictly limited and police began to crackdown vendors in the park. However, some vendors continue to operate illegally and exchange information on the police's steps with radio communication equipment.

Beginning with Zendikar the world-centric storytelling was complemented by an overlying story layer. Planeswalker cards had been introduced in Lorwyn and these Planeswalker characters were used to give the overarching storyline a sense of continuity, despite the constant change of setting. The block following Zendikar, Scars of Mirrodin, revisited the plane of Mirrodin, where the Mirran natives battled against an invading Phyrexian corruption unwittilingly left by Karn (again interconnecting various storylines). To further integrate the storyline into the gameplay, certain events for the second set, Mirrodin Besieged, encouraged players to affiliate themselves with either the Mirran or Phyrexian faction.

They had suffered light casualties of nine killed and 29 wounded, but among the more seriously injured was Hood, whose arm had been amputated during the battle. French losses were much heavier but are unknown: Hood did not include them in his official report but promised to provide them soon afterwards in a follow up letter, which, if it was written, has never been located. All four of the captured frigates were large new vessels that were immediately purchased for service in the Royal Navy, Gloire and Armide retaining their names while Infatigable became HMS Immortalite and Minerve became HMS Alceste. Although Hood and his men were commended at the time, subsequent historical <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the bravery of the inexperienced French crews in resisting an attack by an overwhelming force for so long.
