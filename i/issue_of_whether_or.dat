5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the Gator Bowl, media and fan {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's possible disappointment at not being selected for a BCS game, the coaching situations at the two schools, and the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not Tech quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year of collegiate football. After the Virginia Tech-Clemson matchup was announced for the Gator Bowl, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 6.5 points. The betting line remained there throughout the month of December and until the game began. There were almost no off-field incidents involving players from either team: The only notable event involved two backup players from Clemson who were indicted for money counterfeiting and were suspended for the Gator Bowl. In exchange for appearing in the game, the teams were guaranteed to split a payout of $3,313,610.|$|E
5|$|There was {{uncertainty}} {{as to how}} {{to treat}} the wider battlefields surrounding these monuments. At the end of the war, visitors and tourists could easily see the damage caused by the war and the detritus of the fighting, but post-war reconstruction meant that by the 1930s most of this damage along the Western front had been restored. In several cases, veterans felt that the battlefields should be maintained in their immediate post-war condition as memorials; the reconstruction of the town of Ypres was opposed by some who favoured keeping the ruins as a memorial. It was proposed to leave the fortifications of Douaumont in ruins as a memorial to the dead of Verdun, and the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not to replant the region with trees in the 1930s proved controversial with veterans. Some parts of the trench systems were preserved intact as memorials, however, including the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and the trench system at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. In other theatres, such as Iraq and Palestine, reconstruction took much longer and bodies remained unburied at least until 1929.|$|E

Dershowitz said that he believed that Ito, along with others related to the case (Clark, Fuhrman, Kaelin), was influenced to some degree by the media presence, and the related publicity. The trial was covered in 2,237 news segments from 1994 through 1997.|$|E
25|$|Briggs' {{love for}} {{baseball}} triggered {{another piece of}} research. During World War II the government had mandated that rubber in baseballs be replaced by cork. Complaints about the new balls lead Briggs to test them, and in 1945 he demonstrated that the new baseballs were inferior. This was done by addressing the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not a pitched baseball could curve {{out of the plane}} of the pitch. With the help of two pitchers from the Washington Senators baseball club and his 1917 wind tunnel he studied the effect of spin and speed on the trajectory and established the relationship between the amount of spin and the curvature of the ball (see curveball). To measure the spin, he attached a lightweight tape to the ball and counted the number of twists in the tape. This was a popular topic in newspapers and is probably the most widely known of his research.|$|E

500|$|A {{major issue}} during Dixon's tenure in the Senate was the {{admission}} of the Nebraska Territory to the Union. Specifically, the question hinged upon the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not slavery would be allowed in the state. Under the Missouri Compromise, slavery was prohibited in the territory. Because of this, the southern states opposed its admission. In an attempt to allay southern fears, Stephen Douglas introduced a bill in January 1854 that included a provision that [...] "all questions pertaining to slavery in the territories, and in the new states to be formed therefrom are {{to be left to}} the people residing therein, through their appropriate representatives." [...] Douglas hoped to placate southerners with this language, which allowed for the possibility of legalized slavery in the potential state without specifically addressing the issue of the Missouri Compromise.|$|E

She added, [...] "Israel, India {{and the rest of the}} free world are positioned in the forefront of the battle against terrorism and extremists.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the researcher’s own {{experience}} {{as a graduate student}} embarking on fieldwork in a remote and somewhat risky field site located at the foot of Mount Everest in Nepal and the complications that arose when she decided to bring her family along with her. Following other feminist geographers who challenge the conventional and masculinist modes of carrying out research, this author argues that these modes are no longer tenable, if they ever were. Using her own fieldwork stories, she tells how the ideal model of the lone, male, detached researcher broke down for her, and how her family’s presence complicated her research yet ultimately deepened her understanding of the spatiality and social contours of the landscape she was studying. The paper grapples with the related <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not family members who accompany researchers to research sites ought to remain hidden in the ensuing analyses and written reports, and how “accompanied research ” can invoke theoretical insights. Throughout the paper the author addresses the broader question of how her status as a graduate student influenced her research choices and the considerable boundary crossings she made...|$|R

At trial, Hogan had ruled that since the case had been filed under the statute allowing for federal-question jurisdiction, it was properly a 1983 case as well and was not subject to any limitations of that statute. In a string of cases brought against local governments dating to 1961's Monroe v. Pape, it had held {{that they were not}} [...] "persons" [...] and could not be sued under 1983. Three years earlier, in a case similar to Doyle's, a district court in Colorado had held that school districts were not persons under those precedents, and it was this case the district relied on.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{difference of opinion}} amongst commentators regarding the complicated personality of Noriko.

Even the common belief of film scholars that she is an upholder of conservative values, because of her opposition to her father’s (feigned) remarriage plans, has been challenged.

2500|$|Justice Brennan {{wrote for}} the majority.

[...] The McCarran Amendment permitted adjudication of the Native American tribes' rights in state court, and Brennan held there was no strong policy argument to eliminate the state courts' jurisdiction in this area. [...] Moreover, the circumstances necessitating abstention were not present here, largely because this case did not present complex issues of state law or policy to be resolved, {{as was the case in}} past abstention cases such as Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co. (1941), Burford v. Sun Oil Co. (1943), or Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux (1959). [...] Nor was this an attempt to enjoin state criminal proceedings, as in Younger v.

At the time the committee did not yet elaborate on what kind of vehicles should be used on the metro: trams, heavier rail vehicles, buses or trolleybuses were all alternatives.

In 1950, he became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense, overseeing the Nike Project. He was appointed Chief of Research and Development when it was reorganized in 1952. Nichols retired from the Army on 31 October 1953.
