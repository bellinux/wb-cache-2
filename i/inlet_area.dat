Macroalgae have been sampled monthly during one-year period (February 2007 –January 2008) both in the lagoon inlets and along the marine coast.

40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} {{driven by}} a solar chimney attached to a single-room building was studied experimentally using a small-scale model. The experiments were performed using a recently developed fine-bubble technique in which fine hydrogen bubbles are produced electrolytically in salt solution to simulate the buoyancy effect in the chimney caused by temperature differences. During the experiments, one sidewall of the solar chimney was uniformly "heated", corresponding to a uniformly distributed solar radiation incidence. Velocities at the room inlet were measured by a particle tracking method; in turn, the average flow rate through the solar chimney system was determined. Parameters studied in the experiments were the cavity width of the solar chimney, the solar radiation intensity, the ventilation <b>inlet</b> <b>areas,</b> and the solar chimney height. Results showed that for a given building geometry and <b>inlet</b> <b>areas,</b> there is an optimum cavity width at which maximum ventilation flow rate can be achieved. This optimum cavity width, which is independent of the solar radiation intensity, {{was found to be}} dependent {{on the size of the}} ventilation <b>inlet</b> <b>areas</b> and the solar chimney height. Observations were made on the flow patterns within both the solar chimney and the room. Two simple theoretical models were developed, based on common tools found in literature used for solar chimney ventilation prediction. Comparison between the measured ventilation flow rates and the theoretical predictions indicated that theoretical models, based on simplified temperature assumptions within the chimney, may over-predict the solar chimney ventilation performance and should be used with care...|$|R

2500|$|Caleb Parker, {{the first}} European {{permanent}} settler in the area, arrived to the Barnegat <b>Inlet</b> <b>area</b> in 1795. [...] By the 19th century, the northern stretches of Long Beach Island were known among early settlers for the wildlife and subsequent hunting, {{as well as}} a tourist destination for vacationing farmers and campers. [...] In 1814, portions of the lowlands and beaches were purchased by settlers Bart and Ruth Slaight, who built a small house and later, in 1825, a larger home to accommodate boarders. [...] The boardinghouse was later sold to Jacob Herring, which prompted the structure to become known as the Herring House. [...] The building lodged many of the visiting hunters, who primarily came from New York City and Philadelphia. [...] Nearly a decade later, in 1834, Slaight sold [...] of land to the United States Federal Government under the stipulation that no stores or taverns may be built, nor could the lands be used for cattle.|$|E

[...] On the southern shores of Vancouver along the Fraser River, Xwméthkwyiem live with their main community.

[...] Further down the Burrard Inlet, [...] Tsleil-Waututh have their main community. [...] Xwméthkwyiem and Tsleil-Waututh historically spoke a language dialect of Halkomelem language, whereas Squamish language was separate but related. [...] Their language was more closely connected to their Shishalh neighbors at Sechelt.

40|$|Using {{the motor}} drived {{crankcase}} compression type two stroke cycle engine {{that has a}} piston valve type inlet port, the influence of inlet timing on the delivery ratio were studied. Conseqently, {{it became clear that}} : (1) Concerning the various <b>inlet</b> port <b>area,</b> the longer the inlet port opening hour is, the smaller the delivery ratio is. When the inlet port opening hour is short, the more increase the <b>inlet</b> port <b>area</b> ratio F_I 0 /F_I 42 ･ is, the larger the delivery ratio is. (2) When the <b>inlet</b> port <b>area</b> and the engine speed are constant. delivery ratio of the various inlet port opening time goes down linearly with the increase of time ratio t_ 0 /t_ 52 ･ about the inlet port timing. (3) When the <b>inlet</b> port opening <b>area</b> and hour are constant, it is considered that delivery ratio is nearly constant.

40|$|An inlet {{concept for}} {{separate}} turbojet and ramjet engines was defined and {{compared with an}} equivalent inlet for a wraparound turboramjet engine. The comparison was made for a typical high altitude hypersonic cruise vehicle where the turbojet <b>inlet</b> capture <b>area</b> was required to be half {{as large as the}} ramjet <b>inlet</b> capture <b>area</b> at cruise. The use of a shorter nacelle having substantially lower cooling requirements at cruise for the inlet concept for separate turbojet and ramjet engines is suggested. The separate engine concept better isolates the turbojet from the ramjet, requires no special close off mechanisms within the turbojet, and avoids the circumferential heat load imposed by a wraparound ramjet. A more variable geometry is required...|$|R

In 1859, after his engineer Francis Brockton found a vein of coal, he named Brockton Point and the area of Coal Harbour. In 1860, he named Mount Garibaldi after Giuseppe Garibaldi.
