40|$|The high {{prevalence}} of voice disorders among teachers is known (Roy et al, 2004). Authors (Morton et al, 2001, Rogerson et al, 2005) {{have shown the}} impact of a hoarse voice in teachers on student performance. Our aim is to analyze how 68 students (mean age: 8 years 5 months) processes dysphonic speech on a language comprehension task (MCQ on a short story) and on a minimal pair discrimination task (alike/not alike). Our hypothesis is that student performance will change depending on the modality of the tasks: dysphonic versus normophonic voice. Our results: For both the comprehension and the discrimination tasks, the scores of the students were significantly lower in the dysphonic voice modality (F (1, 67) = 11. 83, p < 0. 05) regardless of gender, the order of voice presentation and type of school. Moreover, we observe a greater effect of the dysphonic voice modality in the discrimination task (F (1, 67) = 9. 52, p < 0. 05). Thus the dysphonic voice disturbs the students the most in the process of discriminating between two <b>isolated</b> <b>words.</b> <b>recognition</b> of isolated words. Finally, when children judge the dysphonic voices, their comments are mostly slighting (98. 33 %).

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} multiple hybrid systems for the recognition of isolated words from a large multi-dialect Arabic vocabulary. Such as the Hidden Markov models (HMM), Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) lack a discriminatory ability especially on speech recognition even if their progress is huge. Multi-Layer perceptrons (MLP) was applied in literature as an estimator of emission probabilities in HMM and proves it effectiveness. In order to ameliorate the results of recognition systems, we apply Support Vectors Machine (SVM) as an estimator of posterior probabilities since they are characterized by a high predictive power and discrimination. Moreover, they are based on a structural risk minimization (SRM) where the aim is to set up a classifier that minimizes a bound on the expected risk, rather than the empirical risk. In this work we have done a comparative study between three hybrid systems MLP/HMM, SVM/HMM and SVM/DBN and the standards models of HMM and DBN. In this paper, we describe the use of the hybrid model SVM/DBN for multi-dialect Arabic <b>isolated</b> <b>words</b> <b>recognition.</b> So, by using 67, 132 speech files of Arabic isolated words, this work arises a comparative study of our acknowledgment system of it as the following: the use of especially the HMM standards leads to a recognition rate of 74. 18 %. as the average rate of 8 domains for everyone of the 4 dialects. Also, with the hybrid systems MLP/HMM and SVM/HMM we succeed in achieving the value of 77. 74 %. and 7806 % respectively. Moreover, our proposed system SVM/DBN realizes the best performances, whereby, we achieve 87. 67 % as a recognition rate more than 83. 01 % obtained by GMM/DBN...|$|E

An alternative explanation is that of lexical constraint: perceptual acuity may be symmetric, but that the distributional statistics of the lexicon are such that the letters near the beginning of a word are on average of greater value in discriminating word identity than the letters near the end.
