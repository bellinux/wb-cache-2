It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent."

60|$|I bought all {{the comic}} papers that I could find, even the {{illustrated}} ones.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I engage in discussions {{concerning}} the ontology of impairment and the ontology of disability. I argue that impairment {{is a phenomenon}} of the brute world and that disability is a phenomenon of the social world. More specifically, I defend a neo-Aristotelian realist account of the ontology of impairment – pace social constructivists who reject the notion of impairment and pace the Searlean realist account of the ontology of impairment – and I defend a constrained social constructivist account of the ontology of disability – pace disability as solidarity and pace other unlimited social constructivist accounts. <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> to Tom Shakespeare, because, although we emphasize different aspects of it, I am convinced that {{we are working on}} the same project. My aim is to show that an ontological investigation into impairment and disability which respects the distinction between brute and social reality does not only bring us ontological and conceptual clearness, but also has significance for us, social beings, in our struggles for recognition and justice. My claim is that (atypical) bodily characteristics and related bodily abilities can have multiple and varying significances – some brute, some personal and some social – which should not be conflated...|$|R
