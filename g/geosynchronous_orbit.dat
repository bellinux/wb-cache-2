5|$|O'Neill founded Geostar Corporation {{to develop}} a {{satellite}} position determination system {{for which he was}} granted a patent in 1982. The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS). In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into <b>geosynchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> in 1986. Its transmitter package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites. With his health failing, O'Neill became less involved with the company {{at the same time it}} started to run into trouble. In February 1991 Geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to Motorola for the Iridium satellite constellation project. Although the system was eventually replaced by GPS, O'Neill made significant advances in the field of position determination.|$|E

25|$|Prowler was {{designed}} to manoeuvre to within a few metres of satellites in <b>geosynchronous</b> <b>orbit.</b> Its purpose was either to monitor them and return data about them, or to perform a signals intelligence mission such as intercepting communications between those satellites and the ground.|$|E
25|$|In July 1998, amateur {{observers}} in Texas observed an unidentified object flashing in <b>geosynchronous</b> <b>orbit.</b> The object was subsequently lost, however it was rediscovered in June 2000 when its flashes became brighter; some even visible {{with the naked}} eye. Following the 2000 observations amateur observers were still unable to identify the satellite, so began referring to it by the pseudo International Designator 2000-653A and pseudo Satellite Catalog Number 90007.|$|E
25|$|Communications {{satellites}} are satellites {{stationed in}} {{space for the}} purpose of telecommunications. Modern communications satellites typically use <b>geosynchronous</b> <b>orbits,</b> Molniya orbits or Low Earth orbits.|$|R
50|$|Three {{satellites}} <b>orbited</b> in <b>geosynchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> at 87.5, 110.5, and 98 degrees east. A fourth satellite {{failed to}} achieve a stable orbit due to {{a problem with the}} third stage.|$|R
50|$|The US-K satellites, were {{launched}} by Molniya-M carrier rockets with Blok 2BL upper stages from Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The US-KS and US-KMO operate in <b>geosynchronous</b> <b>orbits</b> and {{were launched}} by Proton rockets with DM-2 upper stages from Baikonur.|$|R
25|$|The Communications & Imaging Satellites {{developed}} by Orbital are {{smaller and more}} affordable. The <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> (GEO) communications satellites provide commercial satellite services such as direct-to-home digital television, business data transmission, cable program distribution and wireless communications. In addition, Orbital also provides constellations of Low Earth orbitcommunications satellites such as the 35-satellite ORBCOMM data communications network, and the 81 spacecrafts (integration and test) for the IridiumNEXT constellation. Earth imagery and high resolution digital imaging satellites such as the OrbView series are also developed and manufactured by Orbital.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of CDMA signals, the constellation will be expanded to 30 active satellites by 2025; this may require eventual deprecation of FDMA signals. The new satellites will be deployed into three additional planes, bringing the total to six planes from the current three—aided by System for Differential Correction and Monitoring (SDCM), which is a GNSS augmentation system based on a network of ground-based control stations and communication satellites Luch 5A and Luch 5B. Additional satellites may use Molniya orbit, Tundra orbit, <b>geosynchronous</b> <b>orbit,</b> or inclined orbit to offer increased regional availability, similar to Japanese QZSS system.|$|E
25|$|South Korea is a newer {{player in}} the Asian space race. In August 2006 South Korea {{launched}} its first military communications satellite, the Mugunghwa-5. The satellite was placed in <b>geosynchronous</b> <b>orbit</b> and collects surveillance information about North Korea. The South Korean government is spending {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in space technology and was due to launch its first space launcher, the Korea Space Launch Vehicle, in 2008. South Korea's government justifies the cost for reasons of long-term commercial benefits and national pride. South Korea has long seen North Korea's significantly longer missile range as a serious threat to its national security. With the nation's first astronaut launched into space, Lee So-yeon, South Korea gained confidence in entering the Asian space race. They are completing the construction of Naro Space Center. Once it is operational, South Korea will be able to build satellites and missiles with local technology. South Korea is pursuing a space program that could defend the peninsula while lessening their dependency on the United States.|$|E
