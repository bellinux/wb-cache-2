40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} {{is to examine the}} energy demand of heavy metal drummers during rehearsal {{in order to understand the}} physiological responses. This information may lead to a better understanding of energy expenditure and add to the compendium of physical activity. The investigation consisted of eight apparently healthy 20 to 37 -year-old males were recruited for this investigation. Information gathered during the drum test was average VO 2, VO 2 peak, HR in beats per minute (bpm), metabolic equivalents (METs), and energy expenditure (EE) expressed in calories (kcals) per minute and per <b>hour.</b> <b>Rating</b> of perceived exertion (RPE) was used in addition to VO 2 and HR values to assess physical demand. The Bruce Protocol maximal treadmill test was administered to compare the participants VO 2 max to their VO 2 peak while drumming. The EE during the 40 -minute drum test was 387. 05 + 83 kcals with an estimated hourly EE of 567. 33 + 111. 7 kcals. VO 2, VO 2 peak, VE, and HR was 21. 4 + 4. 1 ml/kg/min, 33. 9 + 8. 1 ml/kg/min, 63. 5 + 19 L/min, and 150. 4 + 13. 6 bpm respectively. The average MET level reached was six. RPE was 13. 8 + 1. 2 and is expressed as “somewhat hard” in difficulty according to the ACSM. Those categorized as having an average level of fitness reached 50 - 59 % of their VO 2 max while the two individuals categorized as having an excellent level of fitness reached 42 - 45 % of their VO 2 max. In conclusion, heavy metal drumming is a form of physical activity that is of moderate intensity and can be compared to other forms of recreational and work related physical activity...|$|E
40|$|This program {{covered the}} {{development}} of a market optimized condensing gas water heater for residential applications. The intent of the program was to develop a condensing design that minimized the large initial cost premium associated with traditional condensing water heater designs. Equally important was that the considered approach utilizes design and construction methods that deliver the desired efficiency without compromising product reliability. Standard condensing water heater approaches in the marketplace utilize high cost materials such as stainless steel tanks and heat exchangers as well as expensive burner systems to achieve the higher efficiencies. The key in this program was to develop a water heater design that uses low-cost, available components and technologies to achieve higher efficiency at a modest cost premium. By doing this, the design can reduce the payback to a more reasonable length, increasing the appeal of the product to the marketplace. Condensing water heaters have been in existence for years, but {{have not been able to}} significantly penetrate the market. The issue has typically been cost. The high purchase price associated with existing condensing water heaters, sometimes as much as $ 2000, has been a very difficult hurdle to overcome in the marketplace. The design developed under this program has the potential to reduce the purchase price of this condensing design by as much as $ 1000 as compared to traditional condensing units. The condensing water heater design developed over the course of this program led to an approach that delivered the following performance attributes: 90 %+ thermal efficiency; 76, 000 Btu/hr input rate in a 50 gallon tank; First <b>hour</b> <b>rating</b> greater than 180 gph; Rapid recovery time; and Overall operating condition well matched to combination heat and hot water applications. Over the final three years of the program, TIAX worked very closely with A. O. Smith Water Products Company as our commercial partner to optimize the design for manufacturing. This work included the initiation of a large field testing program (over 125 units) and an in-depth reliability program intended to minimize the risks associated with a new product introduction. At the time of this report, A. O. Smith plans to introduce this product to the marketplace in the early 2006 time period...|$|E

From that point downstream to its mouth, the non-tidal portions of the creek's main stem are a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species were observed in the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per <b>hour</b> <b>rate</b> for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10.

Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels were observed in the creek was well.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis is {{an analysis of}} the flight hour cost program at the Pacific Missile Test Center (PMTC). The method by which PMTC computes aircraft flight <b>hour</b> <b>rates</b> is compared to the techniques used by the Naval Air Test Center and the Naval Weapons Center. A new approach to computing aircraft rates is proposed in this report. Using historical cost data, regression analysis is used to derive a <b>rate</b> per <b>hour</b> flown for fuel consumption. Based upon these data, no correlation exists between aircraft flight hours and aircraft parts costs. A decision support system (DSS) is also proposed herein to assist in the calculation of the flight <b>hour</b> <b>rates.</b> This DSS can also be used as a budget and as a vehicle to track program cost and schedule variances. It is recommended that a follow-on analysis be conducted to ascertain whether or not a true correlation exists between flight hours and aircraft parts costs. Under the current budget system, funds for parts are requested per hour in the Navy and Marine Corp flying hour program. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Currently 884 {{million people}} {{worldwide}} are living {{without access to}} an improved source of drinking water (WHO/UNICEF, 2011). Piped-water on premises is {{the ultimate goal of}} World Health Organization (WHO) due to the ability to treat all of the water and distribute it safely in pressurized pipes. However, Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS) is an option for improving the quality of drinking water where that infrastructure is not yet developed, especially where there is a risk of recontamination between point of collection and point of use (Clasen, 2006). This study analyzed one such HWTS, the ceramic pot water filter. The study compared the hydraulic properties of the FilterPure (FP) and Potters for Peace (PFP) ceramic pot filters through a thirteen-month field study in the Dominican Republic and laboratory studies at the University of South Florida. In the field study 55 filters were tested for first <b>hour</b> flow <b>rate</b> and hydraulic conductivity. Eight first <b>hour</b> flow <b>rate</b> tests were conducted in the field on one month intervals during months 7 - 13. FP filters had an average first <b>hour</b> flow <b>rate</b> of 553 ml/hr and PFP Filters had a first <b>hour</b> flow <b>rate</b> of 395 ml/hr. No significant change in first <b>hour</b> flow <b>rate</b> was observed over time in FP filters. PFP experienced an average increase of 31 ml/hr per month during the seven-month testing period. Falling head tests were conducted on four filters in the laboratory and the flow rate was modeled to determine hydraulic conductivity. Hydraulic conductivity values for FP filters ranged from k = 0. 0495 - 0. 0831 cm/hr and for PFP filters ranged from k = 0. 0136 - 0. 0389 cm/hr. Eight out of 29 (26 %) Potters for Peace filters in the field had first <b>hour</b> flow <b>rates</b> of less than 250 ml/hr by month nine of the study and had to be replaced and removed from the study.
