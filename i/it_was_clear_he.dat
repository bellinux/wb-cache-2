As {{a graduate student at}} Berkeley he assisted {{in the construction of the}} California Digital Computer project CALDIC. His graduate work led to eight patents. After completing his PhD, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an assistant professor to teach for a year, and left when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> could not pursue his vision there. Engelbart then formed a startup company, Digital Techniques, Inc., to commercialize some of his doctorate research on storage devices, but after a year decided instead to pursue the research he had been dreaming of since 1951.|$|E

This {{would be the end of}} his tenure with the band (he eventually was able to get back into the United States and in 1983 would join the Misfits as their drummer). The loss of Robo put an end to extensive touring for a while. Emil Johnson of Twisted Roots filled in for one tour, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> was only temporary.|$|E

They traded Dale Murphy to the Philadelphia Phillies after <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach Leo Mazzone began developing young pitchers Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, and John Smoltz into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB draft to select Chipper Jones, who became one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, John Schuerholz was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.|$|E

25|$|Beside the {{economic}} plans, Stephen A. Hurlbut, (Christiancy's successor) had negotiated with García Calderón the cession to the USA of a naval base in Chimbote and the railroads to the coal mines upcountry. When {{it became known}} that Blaine's representative in Peru, Hurlbut, would personally profit from the settlement, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> was complicating the peace process These American attempts reinforced Garcia Calderon's refusal {{to discuss the matter}} of territorial cession. Blaine then dispatched William H. Trescot in a mission to Chile to establish that problems would be resolved through arbitration and acts of war would not justify territorial seizures. After the assassination of Garfield (2 July 1881) and the accession of Chester A. Arthur to the presidency, Blaine was replaced by Frederik T. Frelinghuysen as secretary of state. Frelinghuysen thought that the USA was in no position to back Blaine's policy and recalled the Trescot mission.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1950s, McKeag's {{political}} {{label on}} Newcastle City Council {{was described as}} Progressive rather than Liberal and he was some time president of the Progressive Party in Newcastle. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> had moved towards the Conservatives however, perhaps retaining links from {{his days as a}} Liberal National because in 1957 McKeag was nominated by the old disaffiliated Newcastle North Conservative Association as a candidate in the by-election caused by the elevation to the peerage of Gwilym Lloyd-George in opposition to the official Conservative. The old association was disaffiliated in 1951 when the new one was formed to accommodate Lloyd-George's becoming the local MP. Mc Keag agreed to accept the nomination. The official Conservatives adopted a young Morpeth farmer, William 'Bill' Elliott and Labour chose T L MacDonald a Carlisle printer. In the event the unofficial Conservatives chose not to contest the election which Elliott won comfortably with a majority of more than 6,000 votes.|$|E
25|$|Márquez {{moved up}} to the {{lightweight}} division in order to fight The Ring Lightweight Champion Joel Casamayor on the weekend leading up to Mexican Independence Day at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas, Nevada. On September 13, 2008, he defeated Casamayor in the 11th round after two knockdowns and captured his sixth world title in three different weight classes. In the first four rounds of the bout, Márquez continually walked into counter punches from Casamayor. It took Márquez until the fifth round {{to be able to}} find the range with his right hand. By the fifth round, a cut over Casamayor's right eye was opened from a clash of heads. Rounds five, six, seven and eight were rounds where Márquez landed straight punches from the outside, but he was also struck by Casamayor whenever he lunged forward. Two minutes into the eleventh round, Casamayor was knocked down by a right punch as he pulled away from an intense exchange. Casamayor was able to get on his feet, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> was still shakey from the knockdown. As soon as the action was allowed to resume, Márquez went in for the kill as he let his punches go in furious combination. Casamayor punched back, but he was knocked down again with about 7 seconds left in the round. Referee Tony Weeks stepped in the bout and stopped the fight as he deemed Casamayor unable to continue. The official judges had the fight scored 95–95, 95–95 and 97–93 for Márquez before the 11th-round knockout. After the win, The Ring magazine ranked Márquez second on its pound for pound list and rated him the number one boxer in the lightweight division.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{acknowledges}} {{having said}} intemperate things in years past, though {{he also says}} that many stories have been exaggerated. One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents have become less frequent over the years. Lieberman has made this observation: [...] "It {{is not the kind of}} anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person." [...] Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: [...] "He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me." [...] Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> would win the nomination.|$|E
2500|$|During May, June and July 1896, {{when the}} weather was {{consistently}} dry, Townsend proved extremely ineffective. Though when the rain came he took 38 wickets {{in the last four}} matches, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> was an easy bowler to play on firm pitches. The following year, Townsend's bowling was expensive even on the few rain-affected pitches because he was sacrificing accuracy to gain spin, but his batting developed so much that he attained the status of an all-rounder, scoring a maiden century against Yorkshire and winning a critical match against Nottinghamshire.|$|E
2500|$|The Imperial {{victory in}} Italy marked the {{beginning}} of Austrian rule in Lombardy, and earned Eugene the Governorship of Milan. But the following year was to prove a disappointment for the Prince and the Grand Alliance as a whole. The Emperor and Eugene (whose main goal after Turin was to take Naples and Sicily from Philip duc d'Anjou's supporters), reluctantly agreed to Marlborough's plan for an attack on Toulon—the seat of French naval power in the Mediterranean. However, disunion between the Allied commanders—Victor Amadeus, Eugene, and the English Admiral Shovell—doomed the Toulon enterprise to failure. Although Eugene favoured some sort of attack on France's south-eastern border <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> felt the expedition impractical, and had shown none of the [...] "alacrity which he had displayed on other occasions." [...] Substantial French reinforcements finally brought an end to the venture, and on 22 August 1707 the Imperial army began its retirement. The subsequent capture of Susa could not compensate for the total collapse of the Toulon expedition and with it any hope of an Allied war-winning blow that year.|$|E

2500|$|Referring to {{the period}} between 1969, when Sutcliffe {{first came to the}} {{attention}} of police, and 1975, the year of the murder of Wilma McCann, the report states: [...] "There is a curious and unexplained lull in Sutcliffe's criminal activities" [...] and [...] "it is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas but also in other parts of the country". In 1969 Sutcliffe, described in the Byford Report as an [...] "otherwise unremarkable young man", came to the notice of police on two occasions over incidents with prostitutes. Later that year, in September, he was also arrested in Bradford's red light district for being in possession of a hammer, an offensive weapon, but he was charged with [...] "going equipped for stealing" [...] as it was assumed he was a potential burglar. The report said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> had on at least one occasion attacked a Bradford prostitute with a cosh.|$|E
