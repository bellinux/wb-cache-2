500|$|An unused {{scene was}} drafted showing Chris, {{directly}} after hearing Lois' prison term, flashbacking {{back to him}} watching Six Feet Under, seeing a same-sex couple kissing, and exclaiming [...] "Oh, come on!" [...] The song based around Glen Quagmire was sung and recorded by professional studio singers who sing at {{events such as the}} Academy Awards. The scene following Peter saying to Lois: [...] "I had to do, well you know, that thing that you usually <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> every Thursday night" [...] showing Peter attempting to give himself fellatio, hitting his head on the wall and falling down the stairs was repeatedly fought by broadcasting standards, but they eventually allowed the scene. In the original episode draft, Peter was to be seen falling down the stairs, and Stewie's foot was to be lodged inside Peter's anus, where he was to lose his shoe. Peter breaks the fourth wall and begins to speak with viewers during his interview with the sumo wrestling employee; Executive Producer David A. Goodman comments in the episode DVD commentary that this is [...] "one of the few times, maybe the only time, when [...] can step out of format and point out the format." [...] The [...] "CBS Asiantown" [...] logo shown on the Griffins' television was prohibited from broadcast on the televised version of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, Presley had {{to defend}} himself from claims of being a racist: he was alleged to have said: [...] "The only thing Negro people can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> is to buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] The singer always denied saying, or ever wanting to say, such a racist remark. Jet magazine, run by and for African-Americans, {{subsequently}} investigated the story and found no basis to the claim. However, the Jet journalist did find plenty of testimony that Presley judged people [...] "regardless of race, color or creed." ...|$|E

Khan released two albums in 1981, the Rufus release, Camouflage and the solo album What Cha' Gonna <b>Do</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me.</b> The latter album went gold. The same year, Khan appeared on three tracks on Rick Wakeman's concept album 1984. In 1982, Khan issued two more solo albums, the jazz-oriented Echoes of an Era and a more funk/pop-oriented self-titled album Chaka Khan. The latter album's track, the jazz-inflected [...] "Be Bop Medley", won Khan a Grammy and earned praise from jazz singer Betty Carter who loved Khan's vocal scatting in the song.|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely {{due to the fact that}} I am a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E
