40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} for the dynamic analysis of turbocharged diesel engines for use in computer simulations of ship propulsion plants. The <b>engine</b> <b>description</b> {{is based on a}} two-zone combustion model which allows a detailed calculation of the thermodynamic processes inside the cylinders and an evaluation of exhaust gas emissions. The thermodynamic study of the in-cylinder phenomena is combined with an analysis of the dynamic behaviour of the turbocharger and of the intake and exhaust systems (intercooler, manifolds, etc.). The procedure has been validated by comparisons with both experimental data obtained by the engine Manufacturer and theoretical results supplied by a phenomenological combustion code. Despite the good accuracy of the results obtained, the computational time is kept reasonably short. This is an important feature, because the engine simulator is part of a broader code, already developed by the authors, simulating the whole propulsion system of a ship...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the Power-Oriented Graphs (POG) {{technique}} {{is used for}} modelling an internal combustion engine. The POG technique is focused on a new modular, physically based and lumped parameter approach, leading to a complete and coherent engine model structure. The aim of the authors, starting from an analogy with electrical systems, is to simplify the approach eliminating the space dynamics (multi-zone combustion and wave effects), while preserving the time dynamics. In this way, {{it is possible to}} obtain an <b>engine</b> <b>description</b> similar to an electrical circuit, with all the useful consequences in term of existence and numerical availability of the solution. The advantages are in the specific correspondence that is found between the engine components and variables (as throttle valve, cylinder, inertial flows) with electrical counterparts (current, voltage, resistance). The main benefit achievable with this methodology is the simplicity to compose the whole engine model and customize it including the differential equations of the engine in state space form, using the POG technique. The POG technique is a graphical modelling technique which uses only two basic blocks (the ldquoelaborationrdquo and ldquoconnectionrdquo blocks) for modelling physical systems. The state space mathematical model of a system can be ldquodirectlyrdquo obtained from the corresponding POG representation. The POG model of the considered combustion engine shows its internal structure from a ldquopowerrdquo point of view...|$|E

40|$|The piping in {{a liquid}} rocket can assume complex {{configurations}} due to multiple tanks, multiple engines, and structures that piping must go around. The capability to handle {{some of these}} complex configurations have been incorporated into the Low Frequency Code (ADMIT), the Nyquist Code (NYQUIST), and the Intermediate Frequency code (SSFREQ). The capability to modify the input on line has been implemented. The configurations allowed include multiple tanks, multiple engines, and the splitting of a pipe into unequal segments going to different (or the same) engines. Straight pipes, bends, inline accumulators, tuned stubs, Helmholtz resonators, parallel resonators, and pumps are the types of piping that may be used. The three codes require the computation of admittance looking toward the tank. Therefore, they all {{have a number of}} similar routines for reading in the tank, piping, and <b>engine</b> <b>descriptions.</b> They also have similar routines for computing the admittance looking toward the tank. ADMIT uses only one type of feedline, either a LOX or FUEL line. NYQUIST can use no feedlines, one feedline (either LOX or FUEL), or two feedlines (both LOX and FUEL). SSFREQ requires both feedlines to be present (LOX and FUEL). The common features of the three codes are discussed first, with two sample runs described. Then each of the three codes are discussed along with the sample runs. Several on-line variations are suggested for the second sample run.
