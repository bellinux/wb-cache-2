5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy <b>grating</b> begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a <b>grating</b> call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E

He {{maintained}} a deferential {{attitude towards the}} older, seniority-laden Southern members when he first entered the Senate, avoiding publicity and focusing on committee work and local issues. Compared to his brothers in office, he lacked John's sophistication and Robert's intense, sometimes <b>grating</b> drive, but was more affable than either of them.|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow's {{chirping}} chup call is softer, less strident, {{and higher}} pitched {{than that of}} the house sparrow, and is easily distinguished. The song of breeding males includes chirrups interspersed with <b>grating</b> t-r-r-rt notes and short warbles or whistles.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{demonstrated}} that a homologous series of banana-shaped liquid crystals, 1, 3 -phenylene bis(4 -alkyloxybenzylideneamine), could assemble themselves into {{various kinds of}} groove-free diffraction <b>gratings</b> when their isotropic melts were slowly cooled into mesophases between two pieces of glass substrates. The groove-free diffraction <b>gratings</b> included one-dimensional parallel <b>gratings,</b> two-dimensional crossed <b>gratings,</b> two-dimensional fan-shaped <b>gratings</b> and two-dimensional circular <b>gratings.</b> Characterization by means of polarized optical microscopy showed that a pattern of periodic modulation of the refractive index {{was developed in the}} thin films formed by the banana-shaped compound. Our laser light diffraction experiments confirmed that these groove-free <b>gratings</b> could effectively diffract the incident red light from a helium-neon laser. On the basis of the diffraction equations derived for the self-assembled groove-free optical <b>gratings,</b> the diffraction patterns were simulated for the parallel <b>gratings,</b> orthogonally crossed <b>gratings,</b> fan-shaped <b>gratings</b> and circular <b>gratings,</b> respectively, and good agreement was achieved. The mechanisms on the self-assembly of the banana-shaped molecules were discussed in terms of intermolecular interactions. Our work provides an alternative method for manufacturing diffraction <b>gratings</b> by harnessing the self-assembly of banana-shaped molecules...|$|R

Thermal characterization for Type I and Type II POF <b>gratings</b> is carried out in this paper.

5|$|A {{diffraction}} <b>grating</b> {{constructed of}} layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a diffraction <b>grating</b> is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E
5|$|The brolga {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the sarus crane, but the latter's red head-colouring extends partly down the neck, while the brolga's is confined to the head. The brolga is more silvery-grey in colour than the sarus, the legs are blackish rather than pink, and the trumpeting and <b>grating</b> calls it makes are at a lower pitch. Additionally, in Australia the range of the sarus is limited to a few scattered localities in northern Australia, compared to the more widespread distribution of the brolga.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many of its}} fellow mimids, {{the black}} catbird is not known to imitate any other species. Its song {{consists}} of repeated phrases of notes ranging from harsh and scratchy to warbled and flute-like, often interspersed with metallic clicking buzzes. It often sings from exposed perches. It {{has a variety of}} calls, including some which are quite {{similar to those of the}} gray catbird; these are variously described as a harsh rriah, a nasal chrrh and a <b>grating</b> tcheeu.|$|E

We study different kinds of binary <b>gratings</b> able to present reflected efficiencies higher than 98 % in the – 1 st order. These are metallic <b>gratings,</b> dielectric <b>gratings</b> deposited on a metallic substrate, total internal reflection <b>gratings</b> and <b>gratings</b> lying on a dielectric multilayer. We study each configuration with respect to manufacturing constraints and optical performances to conclude by providing the most suitable design. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{class of}} second-order {{curvilinear}} <b>gratings</b> consists {{of all the}} curvilinear <b>gratings</b> that are obtained by second-order spatial transformations of periodic <b>gratings.</b> It includes, for example, circular, elliptic, and hyperbolic <b>gratings</b> as well as circular, elliptic, and hyperbolic zone plates. Such structures occur quite frequently in optics, and their Fourier transforms may arise, for instance, {{in connection with the}} Fraunhofer diffraction patterns generated by these structures. I present the two-dimensional Fourier spectra of the most important second-order curvilinear <b>gratings</b> for <b>gratings</b> having any desired intensity profile (cosinusoidal, sawtooth wave, square wave, etc.). These analytic results are also illustrated by figures showing the various <b>gratings</b> and their spectra as they are obtained on a computer by two-dimensional fast Fourier transform...|$|R
5|$|Common ravens have a {{wide range}} of vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, <b>grating</b> kraa, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.|$|E
5|$|Like other rails, the Crex {{species have}} {{a wide range of}} vocalisations. The males of both crakes have a loud {{territorial}} and advertising call consisting of a series of <b>grating</b> notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, with its head and neck almost vertical and bill wide open. Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season, mainly at night for the corn crake, but in the day for its African cousin. The corn crake's call may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between midnight and 3am.|$|E
5|$|This species' call is a distinctive, plaintive cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo, {{uttered by}} males to attract females, {{and may be}} mistaken for the call of an owl at first. (Close up, a <b>grating</b> or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft ork) by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short roo-oo) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound {{that is hard to}} hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|E
40|$|The neural {{basis of}} pattern {{recognition}} {{is a central}} problem in visual neuroscience. Responses of single cells were recorded in area V 4 of macaque monkey to three classes of periodic stimuli {{that are based on}} spatial derivative operators: polar (concentric and radial), hyperbolic, and conventional sinusoidal (Cartesian) <b>gratings.</b> Of 118 cells tested, 16 percent responded significantly more to polar or hyperbolic (non-Cartesian) <b>gratings</b> than to Cartesian <b>gratings</b> and only 8 percent showed a significant preference for Cartesian <b>gratings.</b> Among cells selective for non-Cartesian <b>gratings,</b> those that preferred concentric <b>gratings</b> were most common.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{measurements}} of the perceived coherence of superimposed drifting <b>gratings,</b> Krauskopf and Farell (1990) proposed that motion is analysed independently in different chromatic channels. They found that two <b>gratings</b> appeared to slip if each modula ed {{one of the two}} ‘cardinal’ color mechanisms S/(L+M) and L/(L+M). If the <b>gratings</b> were defined along intermediate color directions, observers reported a plaid, moving coherently. We hypothesised that slippage might occur in chromatic <b>gratings</b> if the motion signal from the S/(L+M) channel is weak and equivalent to a lower speed. We asked observers to judge coherence in two conditions. In one, S/(L+M) and L/(L+M) <b>gratings</b> were physically the same speed. In the other, the two <b>gratings</b> had perceptually matched speeds. We found that the relative incoherence of cardinal <b>gratings</b> is the same whether <b>gratings</b> are physically or perceptually matched in speed. Thus our hypothesis was firmly contradicted. In a control condition, observers were asked to judge the coherence of stationary <b>gratings.</b> Interestingly, the difference in judged coherence between cardinal and intermediate <b>gratings</b> remained as strong as it was when the <b>gratings</b> moved. Our results suggest a possible alternative interpretation of Krauskopf and Farell's result: the processes of object segregation may precede the analysis of the motion of chromatic <b>gratings,</b> and the same grouping signals may prompt object segregation in the stationary and moving cases...|$|R

25|$|Figure 1 {{shows the}} {{simplest}} <b>grating</b> configuration, where long-wavelength components travel a larger distance than the short-wavelength components (negative dispersion).

25|$|Originally, {{high-resolution}} <b>gratings</b> were ruled using high-quality ruling engines whose {{construction was}} a large undertaking. Henry Joseph Grayson designed a machine to make diffraction <b>gratings,</b> succeeding with one of 120,000 lines to the inch (approx. 4,724 lines per mm) in 1899. Later, photolithographic techniques allowed <b>gratings</b> to be created from a holographic interference pattern. Holographic <b>gratings</b> have sinusoidal grooves {{and may not be}} as efficient as ruled <b>gratings,</b> but are often preferred in monochromators because they lead to much less stray light. A copying technique allows high quality replicas to be made from master <b>gratings</b> of either type, thereby lowering fabrication costs.|$|R

25|$|Grating-based imaging (GBI) {{includes}} Shearing interferometry or X-ray Talbot interferometry (XTI), and polychromatic far-field interferometry (PFI). Since {{the first}} X-ray <b>grating</b> interferometer—consisting of two phase gratings and an analyzer crystal—was built, various slightly different setups for this method have been developed; {{in the following}} the focus lies on the nowadays standard method consisting of a phase <b>grating</b> and an analyzer <b>grating.</b> (See figure to the right).|$|E
25|$|The {{analyzer}} <b>grating</b> does {{normally have}} the same period as the interference fringes and thus transforms local fringe position into signal intensity variation on the detector, which is placed immediately behind the <b>grating.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>grating</b> {{fabrication}} {{challenge was}} eased {{by the discovery}} of a phase moiré effect which provides an all-phase-grating interferometer that works with compact sources, called the polychromatic far-field interferometer (see figure on the right). Phase gratings are easier to make when compared with the source and analyzer gratings mentioned above, since the <b>grating</b> depth required to cause phase shift is much less than what is needed to absorb x-rays. Phase gratings of 200 - 400 nanometer periods have been used to improve phase sensitivity in table-top PFI imagers. In PFI a phase <b>grating</b> is used to convert the fine interference fringes into a broad intensity pattern at a distal plane, based on the phase moiré effect. Besides higher sensitivity, another incentive for smaller <b>grating</b> periods is that the lateral coherence of the source needs to be at least one <b>grating</b> period.|$|E
50|$|Archambault et al. {{showed that}} it was {{possible}} to inscribe <b>gratings</b> of ~100% (>99.8%) reflectance with a single UV pulse in fibers on the draw tower. The resulting <b>gratings</b> were shown to be stable at temperatures as high as 800 °C (up to 1,000 °C in some cases, and higher with femtosecond laser inscription). The <b>gratings</b> were inscribed using a single 40 mJ pulse from an excimer laser at 248 nm. It was further shown that a sharp threshold was evident at ~30 mJ; above this level the index modulation increased by more than two orders of magnitude, whereas below 30 mJ the index modulation grew linearly with pulse energy. For ease of identification, and in recognition of the distinct differences in thermal stability, they labeled <b>gratings</b> fabricated below the threshold as type I <b>gratings</b> and above the threshold as type II <b>gratings.</b> Microscopic examination of these <b>gratings</b> showed a periodic damage track at the <b>grating’s</b> site within the fiber 10; hence type II <b>gratings</b> are also known as damage <b>gratings.</b> However, these cracks can be very localized so as to not play a major role in scattering loss if properly prepared.|$|R

25|$|The {{incoming}} beam {{is shaped}} by slits of a few tens of micrometers such that the transverse coherence length {{is greater than the}} <b>grating</b> period. The interferometer consists of three parallel and equally spaced phase gratings, and an x-ray camera. The incident beam is diffracted by a first <b>grating</b> of period 2P into two beams. These are further diffracted by a second <b>grating</b> of period P into four beams. Two of the four merge at a third <b>grating</b> of period 2P. Each is further diffracted by the third <b>grating.</b> The multiple diffracted beams are allowed to propagate for sufficient distance such that the different diffraction orders are separated at the camera. There exists a pair of diffracted beams that co-propagate from the third <b>grating</b> to the camera. They interfere with each other to produce intensity fringes if the gratings are slightly misaligned with each other. The central pair of diffraction paths are always equal in length regardless of the x-ray energy or the angle of the incident beam. The interference patterns from different photon energes and incident angles are locked in phase.|$|E
25|$|In optics, a {{diffraction}} <b>grating</b> is {{an optical}} component with a periodic structure, which splits and diffracts light into several beams travelling in different directions.

Because of this, gratings are commonly used in monochromators and spectrometers.|$|E
25|$|In GBI {{a sample}} is placed before or behind the phase <b>grating</b> (lines of the <b>grating</b> show {{negligible}} absorption but substantial phase shift) {{and thus the}} interference pattern of the Talbot effect is modified by absorption, refraction and scattering in the sample.|$|E
