40|$|Pseudorandom {{testing has}} been widely used in {{built-in}} self-testing of VLSI circuits. Although the <b>defect</b> <b>level</b> estimation for pseudorandom testing has been performed using sequential statical analysis, no closed form can be accomplished as complex combinatorial enumerations are involved. In this work, a Markov model is employed to describe the pseudorandom test behaviors. For the first time, a closed form of the <b>defect</b> <b>level</b> equation is derived by solving the differential equation extracted from the Markov model. The <b>defect</b> <b>level</b> equation clearly describes the relationships among <b>defect</b> <b>level,</b> fabrication yield, the number of all input combinations, circuit detectability (in terms of the worst single stuck-at fault), and pseudorandom test length. The Markov model is then extended to consider all single stuck-at faults, instead of only the worst single stuck-at fault. Results demonstrate that the <b>defect</b> <b>level</b> analysis for pseudorandom testing by only dealing with the worst single stuck-at fault is not adequate (In fact, the worst single stuck-at fault analysis is just a special case).

40|$|Abstract—An {{accepted}} industry {{practice for}} testing of analog and RF circuits {{is to use}} specification-based tests. These tests are capable of providing a very low <b>defect</b> <b>level</b> but tend to be long and costly. In this work, we focus on minimizing the specificationbased tests without exceeding any given <b>defect</b> <b>level.</b> We use Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probabilities with which a test covers specifications it was not originally intended to cover. These probabilities and the given <b>defect</b> <b>level</b> then define an integer linear programming (ILP) model for eliminating unnecessary tests. This paper gives sufficient evidence of successful implementation of the proposed methodology. A hypothetical example of ten specifications illustrates that depending upon the <b>defect</b> <b>level</b> requirement {{up to half of}} the tests may be eliminated. Monte Carlo simulation using spice for probabilistic characterization of tests versus specifications of a commercially available operational amplifier circuit is presented as evidence for the applicability of the technique...|$|E

40|$|The band-anticrossing (BAC) {{model has}} been widely applied to analyse the {{electronic}} structure of dilute nitride III-V-N alloys such as GaN xAs 1 -x. The BAC model describes the strong band gap bowing observed at low N composition in GaNxAs 1 - x {{in terms of an}} interaction between the GaAs host matrix conduction band edge and a higher lying band of localized N resonant states. In practice, replacing As by N introduces a range of N-related <b>defect</b> <b>levels,</b> associated with isolated N atoms, N-N pairs and larger clusters of N atoms. We show that the effect of such <b>defect</b> <b>levels</b> on the alloy conduction band structure is strongly dependent on the relative energy of the <b>defect</b> <b>levels</b> and the host conduction band edge. We first consider GaNxAs 1 -x, where we show that the unexpectedly large electron effective mass and gyromagnetic ratio, and their non-monotonic variation with x, are due to hybridization between the conduction band edge and specific nitrogen states close to the band edge. The N-related <b>defect</b> <b>levels</b> lie below the conduction band edge in GaN xP 1 -x. We must therefore explicitly treat the interaction between the higher lying GaP host Γ conduction band minimum and defect states associated with a random distribution of N atoms in order to obtain a good description of the lowest conduction states in disordered GaPN alloys. Turning to other alloys, N-related <b>defect</b> <b>levels</b> should generally lie well above the conduction band minimum in InNSb, with the band dispersion of InNSb then well described by a two-level BAC model. Both InP and InAs are intermediate between InSb and GaAs. By contrast, we calculate that N-related <b>defect</b> <b>levels</b> lie close to the conduction band minimum in GaNSb, and will therefore strongly perturb the lowest conduction states in this alloy. Overall, we conclude that the BAC model provides a good qualitative explanation of the electronic properties of dilute nitride alloys, but that it is in many cases necessary to include the details of the distribution of N-related <b>defect</b> <b>levels</b> to obtain a quantitative understanding of the conduction band structure in dilute nitride alloys. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

This suggests that the key driving force for this optical phenomenon is the pair of electrons hopping between different charged defects with negative-Ueff.

40|$|Non-radiative {{recombination}} {{plays an}} important role in the performance of optoelectronic semiconductor devices such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Most textbook examples assume that the recombination process occurs through a single <b>defect</b> <b>level,</b> where one electron and one hole are captured and recombined. Based on this simple picture, conventional wisdom is that only defect levels near the center of the bandgap can be effective recombination centers. Here, we present a new two-level recombination mechanism: first, one type of carrier is captured through a <b>defect</b> <b>level</b> forming a metastable state; then the local defect configuration rapidly changes to a stable state, where the other type of carrier is captured and recombined through another <b>defect</b> <b>level.</b> This novel mechanism is applied to the recombination center in CdTe.
