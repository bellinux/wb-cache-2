The <b>taper</b> <b>pin</b> ratio used are varied at 6 : 6, 6 : 5, 6 : 4, 6 : 3, 6 : 2 and 6 : 1.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effect of <b>pin</b> <b>taper</b> tool ratio on {{friction}} stir welding of magnesium alloy AZ 31. Two pieces of AZ 31 alloy with thickness of 6 mm were friction stir welded by using conventional milling machine. The shoulder diameter used in this experiment is fixed at 18 mm. The <b>taper</b> <b>pin</b> ratio used are varied at 6 : 6, 6 : 5, 6 : 4, 6 : 3, 6 : 2 and 6 : 1. The rotational speeds that were used in this study were 500 rpm, 1000 rpm and 1500 rpm, respectively. The welding speeds used are 150 mm/min, 200 mm/min and 250 mm/min. Microstructure observation of welded area was studied by using optical microscope. Equiaxed grains were observed at the TMAZ and stir zone indicating fully plastic deformation. Tool pin diameter ratio 6 / 1 causes low heat input to the material because of small contact surface between tool surface and stirred materials compared to other tool pin diameter ratio. The grain size of stir zone increased with increasing of ratio of rotational speed to transverse speed due to higher heat input. It is observed that, worm hole is produced when excessive heat input is applied. To evaluate the mechanical properties of this specimen, tensile test was used in this study. Welded specimens using <b>taper</b> <b>pin</b> ratio 6 : 1 shows higher tensile strength compared to other <b>taper</b> <b>pin</b> ratio up to 204 MPa.

HA coating, owing to the increase in purchase at the pin-bone interface, may make extracting these pins more difficult or painful if without anesthesia.
