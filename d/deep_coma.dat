5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a <b>deep</b> <b>coma.</b> He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E

Siddiqi suffered a severe stroke of paralysis on 24 July 2001, {{while he was at}} his son's house in Rawalpindi. He was taken to Central Military Hospital (CMH) in Rawalpindi, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg. After staying in paralysis for nearly three years, he slipped into a <b>deep</b> <b>coma</b> on the morning of 27 July 2004 and died in the evening on the same day, with his son Ahmad Riza at his bedside. He was 87 years old. Siddiqi's funeral took place on 28 July 2004. Siddiqi was also remembered by his students and colleagues, many of whom continued to dedicate their international research and publications to his memory.|$|E
25|$|The VX victim, whom Shoko Asahara had {{suspected}} was a spy, was attacked at 7a.m. on 12 December 1994, {{on the street}} in Osaka by Tomomitsu Niimi and another Aum member, who sprinkled the nerve agent on his neck. He chased them for about 100 yards (90 metres) before collapsing, dying 10 days later without coming out of a <b>deep</b> <b>coma.</b> Doctors in the hospital suspected at the time he had been poisoned with an organophosphate pesticide. But {{the cause of death was}} pinned down only after cult members arrested for the subway attack in Tokyo in March 1995 confessed to the killing. Ethyl methylphosphonate, methylphosphonic acid, and diisopropyl-2-(methylthio) ethylamine were later found in the body of the victim. Unlike the cases for sarin (Matsumoto incident and Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway), VX was not used for mass murder.|$|E

50|$|The next day, chief surgeon Christian Estripeau of Percy {{reported}} that Arafat's condition had worsened, {{and that he}} had fallen into a <b>deeper</b> <b>coma.</b> Sheikh Taissir Tamimi, the head of the Islamic court of the Palestinian territories, who held a vigil at Arafat's bedside, visited Arafat, and declared that it {{was out of the question}} to disconnect him from life support, since, according to him, such an action is prohibited in Islam.|$|R
25|$|Cases {{of severe}} {{overdose}} {{have been reported}} and symptoms displayed may include prolonged <b>deep</b> <b>coma</b> or deep cyclic coma, apnea, respiratory depression, hypoxemia, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary aspiration, {{with the possibility of}} death. Severe consequences are rare following overdose of benzodiazepines alone but the severity of overdose is increased significantly if benzodiazepines are taken in overdose in combination with other medications. Significant toxicity may result following recreation drug misuse in conjunction with other CNS depressants such as opioids or ethanol. The duration of symptoms following overdose is usually between 12 and 36 hours in the majority of cases. The majority of drug-related deaths involve misuse of heroin or other opioids in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant drugs. In most cases of fatal overdose it is likely that lack of opioid tolerance combined with the depressant effects of benzodiazepines is the cause of death.|$|E

2500|$|In ALF, hepatic {{encephalopathy}} leads to cerebral edema, coma, brain herniation, and eventually death. [...] Detection of encephalopathy {{is central to}} the diagnosis of ALF. [...] It may vary from subtle deficit in higher brain function (e.g. mood, concentration in grade I) to <b>deep</b> <b>coma</b> (grade IV). [...] Patients presenting as acute and hyperacute liver failure are at greater risk of developing cerebral oedema and grade IV encephalopathy. The pathogenesis remains unclear, but {{is likely to be a}} consequence of several phenomena. [...] There is a buildup of toxic substances like ammonia, mercaptan, benzodiazepines, serotonin and tryptophan in the brain. [...] This affects neurotransmitter level and neuroreceptor activation. [...] Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired, and is associated with anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative stress. [...] Neuronal cell astrocytes are susceptible to these changes, and they swell up, resulting in increased intracranial pressure. [...] Inflammatory mediators also play important role.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He set alight the two fires {{with the}} {{prepared}} materials, and began, at {{first in a}} low voice, but rising by degrees, the invocations of the Ritual. The flames invested every object with a wavering light. Presently they went out. He set more twigs and perfumes on the brazier, and when the flame started up once more, he saw distinctly before the altar a human figure larger than life, which dissolved and disappeared. He began the invocations again and placed himself in a circle, which he had already traced between the altar and the tripod. Then {{the depth of the}} mirror which was in front of him grew brighter by degrees, and a pale form arose, and it seemed gradually to approach. He closed his eyes, and called three times upon Apollonius. When he opened them, a man stood before him, wholly enveloped in a winding sheet, which seemed more grey than black. His form was lean, melancholy, and beardless. Eliphas felt an intense cold, and when he sought to ask his questions found it impossible to speak. Thereupon, he placed his hand on the Pentagram, and directed the point of his sword toward the figure, adjuring it mentally by that sign not to terrify, but to obey him. The form suddenly grew indistinct and soon it strangely vanished. He commanded it to return, and then felt, as it were, an air pass by him; and, something having touched the hand which held the sword, his arm was immediately benumbed as far as the shoulder. He supposed that the weapon displeased the spirit, and set it down within the circle. The human figure at once reappeared, but Eliphas experienced such a sudden exhaustion in all his limbs that he was obliged to sit down. He fell into a <b>deep</b> <b>coma,</b> and dreamed strange dreams. But of these, when he recovered, only a vague memory remained to him. His arm continued for several days to be numb and painful.

Each sleeping patient was allocated a nurse or student nurse who would monitor their sleep every 15 minutes and wake them every six hours to feed and wash them and take them to the toilet. Some of the nurses disliked working in the narcosis ward, but a former ward sister defended the treatment, recalling patients as 'being pleased to be helped'. There were, however, several deaths.|$|R

40|$|The {{result of}} {{ambulatory}} EEG (AEEG) examination on 168 comatose patients showed that AEEG grading was {{negatively correlated with}} Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (r = - 0. 995, P = 0. 005). More serious the patients' condition was and the <b>deeper</b> <b>coma</b> they were in, the lower GCS score and the higher EEG grade they would got. Among all patients, there were 84 cases with AEEG grade Ⅱ, in whom 74 cases (88. 10 %) had favorable prognosis; 26 cases (49. 06 %) of 53 cases with grade Ⅲ and 4 cases (12. 90 %) of 31 cases with grade Ⅳ - Ⅴ had favorable prognosis.

40|$|Serum {{levels of}} {{reactive}} nitrogen intermediates (RNI; nitrate plus nitrite) were measured in 92 patients with cerebral malaria in the Madang Province of Papua New Guinea.

Median levels were higher among children with <b>deeper</b> <b>coma</b> than among those with lighter coma (35. 6 microM vs. 16. 7 microM; P = 0. 008) and also among children with longer duration of coma (72 h; 59. 3 microM vs. 19. 3 microM; P = 0. 004). RNI levels also correlated with clinical outcome, fatal cases having significantly higher RNI levels than survivors (41. 2 microM vs. 18. 5 microM; P = 0. 014).

Clinical features included consciousness impairment (Glasgow coma score: 8 [4; 14]) and seizure onset (14 %), requiring mechanical ventilation (56 %). Nineteen patients (37 %) presented cardiovascular complications and three patients (6 %) died in the ICU.

No statistical relationships were found between cardiovascular toxicity and plasma venlafaxine concentration and norvenlafaxine-to-venlafaxine ratio on admission and at their respective peaks.
