40|$|We {{investigated}} the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation system in liver and cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy known to accumulate very long chain fatty acids. In {{order to examine}} whether the deficient peroxisomal oxidation of very long chain fatty acids in these patients results from a deficiency {{in one of the}} peroxisomal beta-oxidation <b>enzyme</b> <b>proteins</b> (acyl-CoA oxidase, bifunctional protein with enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities and 3 -oxoacyl-CoA thiolase) we carried out immunoblotting experiments using antibodies directed against the peroxisomal beta-oxidation <b>enzyme</b> <b>proteins</b> from rat liver. Furthermore, we studied the oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA and lignoceroyl-CoA in homogenates of fibroblasts from the patients. The results indicate that the peroxisomal beta-oxidation <b>enzyme</b> <b>proteins</b> are not only present immunologically but also functionally active which suggests that the defect in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is, indeed, as recently suggested by Hashmi and coworkers (FEBS Lett 1986; 196 : 247 - 250) at the level of a deficient peroxisomal activation of very long chain fatty acid...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- We {{developed}} {{a method of}} reverse engineering to compare the behaviour the <b>enzyme</b> <b>proteins</b> with the existing standard concepts. Our work {{is based on the}} strong assumption from the evolutionary theory, about the rates of nucleotide substitutions; we use this in the reverse engineering approach to verify how far it can be justified. We applied here the simple models of nucleotide substitutions Nei and Gojobori in a more generalized form and used comparative genomic study with human, mouse and rat individually with related <b>enzyme</b> <b>proteins.</b> We then used Jukes and Cantor’s model to find out the corrected substitution rates. This paper describes the findings and the methodology in details...|$|R
