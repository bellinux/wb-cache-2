50|$|The {{attempts}} {{to replace the}} <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> matrices by semiconductor cross point switches were not immediately successful, particularly in large exchanges. As a result, many space division <b>switching</b> systems used <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> networks with SPC. Nonetheless, private automatic branch exchanges (PABX) and smaller exchanges do use electronic switching devices. The two types of space division electronic switching systems are using <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> network and the other using electronic switching network. The second type is fully electronic.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{switches}} typically used in <b>switch</b> matrices: Coaxial <b>Electromechanical</b> <b>Switches</b> and Solid State Switches, also known as electronic <b>switches.</b> Coaxial <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switches</b> can be further divided into two categories based on their architecture, latching relay and non-latching relay.|$|R
