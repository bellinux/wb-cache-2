40|$|<b>Trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> has {{potential}} to support conservation financing and contribute towards rural development. We conducted a systematic {{review of the}} Zimbabwean <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> perspective spanning from pre- 1890 to 2015, by examining the following: (1) evolution of legal instruments, administration, and governance of <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting,</b> (2) significance of <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> in conservation financing and rural development, and (3) key challenges, emerging issues in <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> industry, and future interventions. Our review shows that (i) {{there has been a}} constant evolution in the policies related to <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> and conservation in Zimbabwe as driven by local and international needs; (ii) <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> providing incentives for wildlife conservation (e. g., law enforcement and habitat protection) and rural communities’ development. Emerging issues that may affect <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> include illegal hunting, inadequate monitoring systems, and hunting bans. We conclude that <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> is still relevant in wildlife conservation and rural communities’ development especially in developing economies where conservation financing is inadequate due to fiscal constraints. We recommend the promotion of net conservation benefits for positive conservation efforts and use of wildlife conservation credits for the opportunity costs associated with reducing <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> off-take levels and promoting nonconsumptive wildlife use options...|$|R
