5|$|The Red panda, Clouded leopard, Siberian weasel, Asiatic black bear, barking deer, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr,</b> goral, gaur and {{pangolin}} {{are some}} of the fauna found near Kalimpong. Avifauna of the region include the pheasants, cuckoos, minivets, flycatchers, bulbuls, orioles, owls, partridges, sunbirds, warblers, swallows, swifts and woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough breeds {{from three}} years of age, and {{normally}} raises only one brood a year, although the age at first breeding is greater in large populations. A pair exhibits strong mate and site fidelity once a bond is established. The bulky nest is composed of roots and stems of heather, furze or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair; in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr.</b> The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or cliff face. In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep. Old buildings may be used, and in Tibet working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in Mongolian towns, including Ulaanbaatar. The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where they are available.|$|E
25|$|Snow leopards are {{carnivores}} {{and actively}} hunt their prey. Like many cats, {{they are also}} opportunistic feeders, eating whatever meat they can find, including carrion and domestic livestock. They can kill animals two to four times their own weight, such as the bharal, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr,</b> markhor, argali, horse, and camel, but will readily take much smaller prey, such as hares and birds. They are capable of killing most animals in their range with the probable exception of the adult male yak. Unusually among cats, snow leopards also eat {{a significant amount of}} vegetation, including grass and twigs. Snow leopards will also hunt in pairs successfully, especially mating pairs.|$|E

50|$|During the rut, male <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahrs</b> often {{compete with}} other males for access to females. Factors that {{contribute}} to reproductive success include large body size, large horn size, and high aggression. Coat color is a factor that determines rank among <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahrs,</b> and males with light coats mate more often. In addition, the horns of the male are often used in the ritual process to court female tahrs (either for display purposes or, less often, for direct combat), although these horns can {{also serve as a}} defense mechanisms against potential predators.|$|R
50|$|Tahrs are polygynous, {{and males}} {{are subject to}} stiff {{competition}} for access to females. Young reproductive males roam and mate opportunistically (when larger males are not present), while more mature males (more than four years old) will engage in ritualistic behavior and fighting to secure mates. During mating season, reproductive males lose much of their fat reserves, while females and nonreproductive males do not, indicating a substantial cost to these behaviors. Factors that contribute to which males dominate include size, weight, and testosterone levels. Interestingly, coat color can have an effect; <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahrs</b> with lighter coats {{are more likely to}} gain access to estrous females <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahrs</b> have precocious young which can stand soon after birth. Females have a gestation period of 180-242 days, usually with a litter size of only one kid. This indicates sexual selection can be extremely important to the fitness of males.|$|R
25|$|The diet of {{the snow}} leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on prey availability. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on bharals (Himalayan blue sheep), but in other {{mountain}} ranges, such as the Karakoram, Tian Shan, Altai and Tost Mountains of Mongolia, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex and argali, a type of wild sheep, although the latter has become rarer in some parts {{of the snow}} leopard's range. Other large animals eaten when available can include various types of wild goats and sheep (such as markhors and urials), other goat-like ruminants such as <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> and gorals, plus deer, red panda, wild boars, and langur monkeys. Smaller prey consists of marmots, woolly hares, pikas, various rodents, and birds such as the snow cock and chukar.|$|E

2500|$|Bardia National Park is {{the largest}} and most {{undisturbed}} protected area in the Terai region of the Nepal Himalayas, covering [...] on the southern slopes of the Sivalik Hills. It is bordered in the south by the Babai River, and to the west by the Girwa River, a tributary of the Karnali. At Chisapani Gorge, the swift-flowing Karnali River emerges from the Shiwalik Range onto the broad plain and flows purposefully through the semi-tropical jungle. The park is famous for two herds of wild Asian elephants, a great number of deer species, gaur, nilgai, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr,</b> serow and goral. The Karnali supports the endangered mugger crocodile, the fish-eating gharial, a few remaining specimen of Gangetic dolphin and the golden mahseer; the latter weigh up to [...]|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, a few <b>Himalayan</b> <b>Tahrs</b> {{escaped from}} a zoo {{on the slopes}} of Devil's Peak and bred until their {{population}} on the Table Mountain range was over 700. A culling programme has eliminated most of them, although a few still remain. Some of the original local species of small antelope are being re-introduced to replace the tahrs. Around Rhodes Memorial there were also some feral deer of European origin, which can still be found on the lower slopes.|$|R
40|$|During an {{expedition}} in Sagarmatha National Park (Khumbu-Nepal), from 6 to 20 April 2002, we observed 10 - 12 Red-billed Chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) perching {{on the backs}} of five <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahrs</b> (Hemitragus jemlahicus). The choughs were removing hair from the grazing tahrs and flying away with it in their bills. We presumed that because Red-billed Choughs feed on parasites from tahr backs all year round, they may have learned to pick hair for an easy source of nest material during the spring. Moreover, tahrs showed no signs of irritation at this behavior, perhaps because they were shelding...|$|R
5000|$|The herbivorous diets of the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahrs</b> {{leave them}} {{spending}} {{most of their time}} grazing on grasses and browsing on leaves and some fruits. Their short legs allow them to balance while reaching for the leaves of shrubs and small trees. The tahr consumes more woody plants than herb species with as much as 75% of the tahr diet consisting of natural grasses. The tahr, like most members of the [...] bovid family, are ruminants and have complex digestive systems [...] A multichambered stomach allows the tahr to repeatedly regurgitate its food, chew it, and obtain nutrients from otherwise indigestible plant tissues.|$|R
2500|$|Yaks {{are often}} used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs. They can haul 100kg (220 pounds), have thick fur and big lungs. One common piece of advice {{for those in the}} Everest region is to be on higher ground when around yaks and other animals, as they can knock people off the {{mountain}} if standing on the downhill edge of a trail. Other animals in the region include the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> which is sometimes eaten by the snow leopard. The Himalayan black bear can be found up to about [...] and the red panda is also present in the region. One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a pika and ten new species of ants.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} macroscopic anatomical {{parameters of}} the digestive tract of 12 female <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahrs.</b> According to morphological criteria used sensu Hofmann for the classification of ruminants into feeding types - in particular the reticuloruminal capacity measured as wet content weights, the ruminal pillar thickness, the reticular honeycomb structure, {{the size of the}} omasum {{and the size of the}} parotid glands - tahrs can be classified as predominantly grazing ruminants. As reported in other ruminant species, the length of the large intestine was a more constant parameter over a range of body weights than that of the small intestine. The weight of the parotid glands scaled to metabolic body weight...|$|R
25|$|<b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahrs,</b> {{fugitive}} {{descendants of}} tahrs that escaped from Groote Schuur Zoo near the University of Cape Town, in 1936, {{used to be}} common on the less accessible upper parts of the mountain. As an exotic species, they were almost eradicated through a culling programme initiated by the South African National Parks {{to make way for}} the reintroduction of indigenous klipspringers. Until recently there were also small numbers of fallow deer of European origin and sambar deer from southeast Asia. These were mainly in the Rhodes Memorial area but during the 1960s they could be found as far afield as Signal Hill. These animals may still be seen occasionally despite efforts to eliminate or relocate them.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifespan}} of a <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> typically ranges around 14 or 15 years, with females {{living longer}} than males. The oldest known <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> lived to 22 {{years old in}} captivity.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> {{is present}} in New Mexico which would {{probably}} indicate {{it can also be}} found in other southwestern states.

50|$|The Sagarmatha National Park {{encompasses}} the upper catchments of the Dudh Kosi River system. The park covers {{an area of}} 1148 km2 and ranges in elevation from 2845 m to 8848 m at the summit of Mount Everest. Established in 1976 the park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. The landscape in the park is rugged consisting of mountain peaks, glaciers, rivers, lakes, forests, alpine scrubs and meadows. The forests comprise stands of oak, blue pine, fir, birch, juniper and rhododendron.

50|$|High {{altitude}} Himalayan fauna {{species have}} made this sanctuary their home, including the endangered <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr.</b>|$|E
50|$|Data on {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of the tahr are documented by government agencies. Over a time span of 16 years, the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> reached up to 33 tahr/km2 in New Zealand - twice the initial population (2*N0). Without regulated hunting or the presence of natural barriers, the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> can pose a large threat to the indigenous fauna and flora populations within the area.|$|E

50|$|Another key {{characteristic}} that allows <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> {{to be successful}} as an invasive species is their digestive tract. Their digestive system allows them to consume {{a wide variety of}} vegetation ranging from easy-to-digest leaves/grasses to woody shrubs and other “tough” vegetation not as easily digested by other species. This flexibility in diet not only allows <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> to have a competitive advantage for resource use in their environment among other species, but it also allows them to be less hindered by abiotic disruptions and other natural disasters. In other words, their ability to digest a large range of vegetation allows the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> to have a bigger fundamental niche, and as a result, increases their success as an invasive species.|$|E
50|$|Himalayan Tahr: The {{sanctuary}} {{is said to}} be one of {{the last}} homes of <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr,</b> which is a large ungulate related to the wild goat. These herbivorous animals have small heads with large eyes and small pointed ears, and are 3 to 4.5 feet long and weigh around 36-90 kg. They are 26 to 40 inches tall. The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> is considered vulnerable by the IUCN (1996) in its home range of the Himalayas.|$|E
50|$|Results of a phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{indicate that}} the genus Hemitragus is monospecific, and that the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> is a wild goat.|$|E
50|$|A {{statue of}} a <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> was {{unveiled}} in May 2014 at Lake Pukaki and dedicated by Henrietta, Dowager Duchess of Bedford.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> {{is adapted}} to life in a cool climate with rocky terrain, which allows them {{to be found in}} mountainous areas. In the Himalayas, they are mainly found on slopes ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 m. <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> can eat a wide variety of plants. They most often inhabit {{locations}} in where vegetation is exposed for browsing and grazing. During the winter (when snow covers vegetation at higher elevations), they are found on lower-altitude slopes.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Bactrian wapiti, Chinese grey goral, Mishmi takin, red panda, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr,</b> Carpathian lynx, Afghan urial, European elk arrived, some {{coming from}} Edinburgh Zoo.|$|E
50|$|A subspecies, the Eastern <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr</b> or shapi, was {{described}} in 1944. However, this classification is no longer regarded as valid and no subspecies are currently recognized.|$|E
50|$|It plays host to {{a number}} of rare and {{endangered}} species of Indian wildlife, including <b>Himalayan</b> <b>tahr,</b> ibex, and pheasants. Also, it is home to musk deer.|$|E
