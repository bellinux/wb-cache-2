5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> {{radiating}} {{the heat from}} its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic {{that it could be}} observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), {{but it would not}} be the speed of photons.|$|E

5|$|In his 2011 book Satellittkrigen, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation {{journalist}} Bård Wormdal {{argues that}} SvalSat {{is used for}} military intelligence and thus is violating the Svalbard Treaty. Specifically, Wormdal provides evidence that downloaded images of the earth are used for intelligence and military activities. For instance, a Landsat image taken during the Libyan Civil War was sold by the Italian company e-GEOS to the Italian Armed Forces. Similarly, a Technology Experiment Satellite image was sold to the United States Armed Forces during the War in Afghanistan and Arirang-2 images of North Korean installations have been sold to the United States. All three satellites use SvalSat {{as one of their}} ground stations. According to Governor Odd Olsen Ingerø, even if a military should indirectly use information downloaded from SvalSat, this would not be a breach of the treaty. A dissertation by Professor Geir Ulfstein concludes that even if a ground station was directly used for downloading military intelligence from military satellites, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> permitted by the treaty.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E

25|$|One Stone {{was placed}} at Minas Ithil in the {{mountains}} {{that came to be}} known as the Ephel Dúath. When Minas Ithil fell to the Nazgûl in , the Ithil-Stone came into Sauron's hands, and leading up to the War of the Ring was kept by him in Barad-dûr.

25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives {{the example of a}} person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E

25|$|CBC's sports {{coverage}} has also attained high viewership in border markets, including {{its coverage of}} the NHL's Stanley Cup Playoffs, which was {{generally considered to be}} more complete and consistent than coverage by other networks such as NBC. Its coverage of the Olympic Games also found a significant audience in border regions, primarily {{due to the fact that}} CBC aired more events live than NBC's coverage, which had been criticized in recent years for tape delaying events to air in primetime, even if the event is being held in a market in the Pacific Time Zone during primetime hours on the East (where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> delayed for West coast primetime).|$|E
25|$|Study and Core Area {{boundaries}} {{delineate the}} historical extents of a battlefield. POTNR boundaries delineate areas within the Study and Core Area(s) that still retain integrity and {{remain to be}} preserved. The Study and Core Area boundaries define the historic landscape of the battlefield while areas that retain integrity define the modern landscape. For example, if a particular farm field was important during the battle but now is covered by a housing development, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> included in a Core or Study Area boundary because the farm field informs {{the history of the}} battle. That same farm field, however, would not be considered for inclusion in an POTNR boundary because it no longer has integrity (i.e. conveys a sense of the historic scene) and there is nothing left of the original farm field to preserve.|$|E

Another historian notes that Grant's troops [...] "had performed prodigies of valor and endurance during the campaign" [...] and had learned from it that [...] "hard fighting would bring success."

For example, if Mamoru Hosoda took the director's position, the completed Dreaming Machine {{would still be a}} good piece of work. However, that would make it Hosoda's movie, not Kon's.
