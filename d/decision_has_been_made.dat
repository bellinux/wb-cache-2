5|$|The {{book has}} been widely commended for its honesty, with Trescothick's {{difficulties}} drawing comparison with Harold Gimblett's similar mental health problems. Despite attempts by Pietersen to entice Trescothick back into the England set-up, Trescothick confirmed that his <b>decision</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> {{and that he is}} putting his health and family first. In November 2008 Coming Back to Me was named the 2008 William Hill Sports Book of the Year. In April 2009, Trescothick turned down another request from new England captain Andrew Strauss to consider making himself available for England's World Twenty20 Championship campaign.|$|E
25|$|Advocates of the trams have {{suggested}} expanding the tramway from its present terminus at St. Olav's Gate {{through the city}} core to Trondheim Central Station or Nedre Elvehavn onwards to Brattøra and Trondheim Port. This has been supported by the city council, but no definite <b>decision</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made.</b> Estimates of costs lay between NOK 50 and 80 million, with completion in 2009 {{at the same time}} as Nordre Avlastningsvei.|$|E

25|$|Since a clear {{archetype}} {{for determining}} guilt does not exist, {{the criminal justice}} system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a <b>decision</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made,</b> {{it is virtually impossible to}} know whether a jury has been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena (2009) suggests that the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) signal in Libet's experiments doesn't represent a decision to move, but that it's merely {{a sign that the}} brain is paying attention. In this experiment the classical Libet experiment was modified by playing an audio tone indicating to volunteers to decide whether to tap a key or not. The researchers found that there was the same RP signal in both cases, {{regardless of whether or not}} volunteers actually elected to tap, which suggests that the RP signal doesn't indicate that a <b>decision</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made.</b>|$|E
25|$|Al-Qaeda, for example, uses a {{different}} form of swarming than those of advanced militaries, in which the general objectives of operational cells are agreed in a manner coordinated, but not continuously controlled by the core organization. Once the <b>decision</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> on the general targets, the operational cells cut positive control links from the core, although they may still receive financial and other support. A signature of al-Qaeda operations has been multiple, near-simultaneous attacks, such as the several hijacked airliners in the 9/11 attacks, the closely spaced bombings aimed at US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and attacks on buses and trains in London. The attacks on trains in Spain had an additional dimension: not all the swarms were associated with al-Qaeda.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the central {{ownership}} of the teams, all players are paid by the league. This is to ensure that no team receives an unfair advantage over any other with regards to financial success. The payscale has set a number of tiers which group players of similar experience levels, with all players in the same tier receiving the same pay. The ABL has considered the possibility of having one or two marquee players paid above the standard scale, though no final <b>decision</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> with regard to this. One concern about high rates of pay expressed by the ABF was that it was a contributing factor, if not the main factor, in the failure of the previous Australian Baseball League. ABF management has also expressed the concern that if this league were to fail, there may never be another opportunity for professional baseball in Australia.|$|E
500|$|The borough {{underwent}} a boundary review in 2002. The review altered the areas covered by some wards to ensure councillors represented roughly equal numbers. Between 12 October 2006 – 8 January 2007, a dispersal order was enforced in the Dukinfield and Newton Hyde {{areas of the}} borough. The move was designed to reduce anti-social behaviour. A representative of Stalybridge police post said [...] "Due to the serious nature of recent incidents in Dukinfield and Newton Hyde involving a number of confrontations between large groups of youths, the <b>decision</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> to introduce a Dispersal Order".|$|E

The <b>decision</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> to put the ISPF on a permanent full-time footing and a new commander, Nathan Spring, has been appointed to accomplish this. Many of the series episodes deal with Spring's efforts to establish the Star Cops—he sets up a base of operations on the Moonbase, recruits new staff, roots out and dismisses corrupt officers and works to extend the Star Cops' reach first into the American space stations and then, {{at the end of the}} series, the far-flung reaches of the Mars colonies, all the while investigating whatever crimes occur along the way.|$|E

It was suggested that the band might split up in August, which was dismissed as [...] "rubbish" [...] by Catatonia.
