60|$|It took me {{the best}} part of a week to get that house in order, but I did it thoroughly. I am noted for doing things thoroughly. At the end of the time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clean</b> <b>from</b> garret to cellar. Alexander Abraham made no {{comments}} on my operations, though he groaned loud and often, and said caustic things to poor Mr. Riley, who hadn't the spirit to answer back after his drubbing by William Adolphus. I made allowances for Alexander Abraham because his vaccination had taken and his arm was real sore; and I cooked elegant meals, not having much else to do, once I had got things scoured up. The house was full of provisions--Alexander Abraham wasn't mean about such things, I will say that for him. Altogether, I was more comfortable than I had expected to be. When Alexander Abraham wouldn't talk I let him alone; and when he would I just said as sarcastic things as he did, only I said them smiling and pleasant. I could see he had a wholesome awe for me. But now and then he seemed to forget his disposition and talked like a human being. We had one or two real interesting conversations. Alexander Abraham was an intelligent man, though he had got terribly warped. I told him once I thought he must have been nice when he was a boy.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of the Bank of Italy-CEPR project to {{construct}} a monthly coincident indicator of the business cycle of the euro area. The index is estimated on the basis of a harmonized data set of monthly statistics of the euro area (951 series) which we constructed from a variety of sources. We use the information of this large panel to obtain an indicator which has three characteristics: (i) it provides real time information on monthly coincident activity since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> updated as new information become available in a non-synchronous way; (ii) <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>from</b> noise originated from measurement error and idiosyncratic national and sectoral dynamics; (iii) <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>from</b> seasonal and shortrun dynamics through a …lter that requires very little revision at the end of the sample. Unlike other methods used in the literature, the procedure takes into consideration the cross-country as well as the within-country correlation structure and exploits all information on dynamic cross-correlations. As a byproduct of our analysis, we provide a characterization of the commonality and dynamic relations of the series in the data set with respect to the coincident indicator and a dating of the euro area cycle...|$|R

As the brass material of the plates is subject to superficial corrosion, it will become dull over time if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not <b>cleaned</b> <b>from</b> time to time. Demnig recommends regular cleaning of the plates. Many regional initiatives have set up schedules for cleaning and acts of remembrance, when stolpersteine are adorned with flowers or candles. Often remembrance days are chosen for these activities: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> a <b>clean</b> mile <b>from</b> {{the pit of}} the Sunlanders, {{and death}} had spanned it. A great cry of rage went up, and in <b>it</b> there <b>was</b> much of blood-vengeance, much of the unreasoned ferocity of the brute. Tyee and Aab-Waak tried to hold the Mandell Folk back, were thrust aside, and could only turn and watch the mad charge. But no shots came from the Sunlanders, and ere half the {{distance}} was covered, many, affrighted by the mysterious silence of the pit, halted and waited. The wilder spirits bore on, and when they had cut the remaining distance in half, the pit still {{showed no sign of}} life. At two hundred yards they slowed down and bunched; at one hundred, they stopped, a score of them, suspicious, and conferred together.|$|R
50|$|A {{dramatic}} {{start to}} the first race saw Dick Johnson beating Glenn Seton off the start and a tangle between Brock and Longhurst, which subsequently led to their retirements from the race. With Longhurst blocking the circuit, the race was restarted. On the restart, Seton beat Johnson off the start, only to be passed by Johnson several laps later. As Seton started to struggle with tyres, a train of Bowe, Jones, and Perkins caught up with him. After trying to pass Seton down {{the bottom of the}} hill into the last corner, Bowe tagged the back of Seton, sending him into a spin. Bowe subsequently incurred damage, leading to a flat tyre. As he limped around the circuit, he was hit by Tomas Mezera on turn four. This catapulted Mezera into the guardrail, taking him out of the race and causing extensive damage to both cars. Up the front, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a <b>clean</b> performance <b>from</b> Dick Johnson as he took his first race win of the season, with Perkins second and Jim Richards in third.|$|R
