5|$|On September20, 1907, {{the state}} of New York let a {{contract}} for a project to improve Church Road, the section of Redman Road north of Church Road, and the portion of Lake Road West Fork between Church Road and Lake Road to state <b>highway</b> <b>standards.</b> The project was completed by mid-1909, and the highways, collectively inventoried as State Highway286 (SH286), {{were added to the}} state highway system on July20, 1909. On June8, 1915, the state awarded another contract to bring Morton Road up to state <b>highway</b> <b>standards.</b> Work on the road, internally designated as SH1282, was completed that year, allowing for the highway {{to be added to the}} state highway system on December8, 1915. The first set of posted state routes in New York were assigned in 1924; however, no designations were assigned to either of the aforementioned highways at this time.|$|E
5|$|With the {{creation}} of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, the approach to the Lincoln Tunnel was planned to become an Interstate Highway along with present-day Route 3, which itself {{was not included in the}} Interstate Highway System because New Jersey thought it would be too expensive to bring it up to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards.</b> However, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was included in the Interstate Highway System and in 1959, it was renumbered from Route 3 to I-495 despite the fact it does not meet Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards.</b> Shortly after the road became I-495, the western portion of the road was brought up to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards</b> with the improvements of the interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3. I-495 was intended to connect with New York's I-495 by way of the Mid-Manhattan Expressway; however, this proposed freeway through Manhattan was canceled in 1971 due to strong opposition to the road running through the heart of Midtown Manhattan. Because of the fact that New Jersey's I-495 would not be connected to New York's, NJDOT started referring to the route as Route 495 in 1979. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the decommissioning of I-495 between I-95 and Pleasant Avenue/Park Avenue in Union City in 1980. In 1986, AASHTO approved the decommissioning of the rest of the I-495 designation in New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Past the Garden State Parkway, Route 3 {{eventually}} {{turns into}} a six-lane freeway that is not designed to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards.</b> It interchanges with County Route 622 (Bloomfield Avenue), then intersects County Route 603 (Passaic Avenue), which heads south into Nutley to become Route 7. The next interchange is for County Route 601 (Main Avenue). Past that interchange, Route 3 comes to an interchange with Route 21, then passes over the route.|$|E

50|$|Majura Road was {{upgraded}} {{during the}} 1990s from a basic rural {{road to a}} single carriageway <b>highway</b> <b>standard</b> road with a speed limit of 90 km/h. The current interchange with the Federal Highway was completed in December 2002 and redesigned in 2004 to connect with Horse Park Drive as {{a continuation of the}} route towards Gungahlin.|$|R
5|$|Route 3 {{underwent}} a major reconstruction to modern <b>highway</b> <b>standards</b> with noise walls installed and bridge replacements, {{including the new}} Passaic River bridge that is now functional, between Main Avenue in Clifton and Route 17 in Rutherford. All work was completed by 2016. In a separate project, the roadway was resurfaced in 2013 from {{just west of the}} Route 17 north interchange to U.S. Route 1/9 in North Bergen.|$|E
5|$|At Durango Street, in {{the segment}} of freeway {{known as the}} Durango Curve, the highway turns eastward, {{becoming}} the western leg of the Maricopa Freeway, and provides a southerly bypass of downtown before meeting I-10 again near Sky Harbor and terminating (the Maricopa Freeway, though, continues eastward with the I-10 designation). Interstate 17 was the Valley's first freeway, with maps showing a road built to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards</b> (of the era) by 1961, in some segments.|$|E
5|$|NY28's {{southern}} terminus is with NY32 (Albany Avenue) in {{the city}} of Kingston. The route heads north, then northwest on Colonel Chandler Drive, a four-lane limited-access highway. The roadway is also designated and signed as I-587, which begins at NY32 as well. Although Colonel Chandler Drive is built to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards,</b> it has no intermediary interchanges. After crossing over the Esopus Creek into Ulster, I-587 terminates at a roundabout that links I-587 and NY28 to the New York State Thruway (I-87) at exit19.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed {{at least since the}} 1940s. Serious {{discussion}} began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of negotiations with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E
5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards.</b> A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes in from the east and terminates.|$|E
5|$|Construction on I-97 {{began in}} the late 1980s with new {{construction}} from US 50 and US 301 to Crownsville. The Crownsville–Millersville segment of MD 32 was expanded and incorporated into the Interstate and the MD 3–MD 32 junction was upgraded. The portion of the MD 3 corridor from Millersville to south of Glen Burnie was upgraded on the spot to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards</b> in the early 1990s, after which MD 3 was truncated at Millersville. I-97's interchange with I-695 was rebuilt in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Glen Burnie Bypass was upgraded and expanded to six lanes in the mid-1990s. The complex process included reconstruction of several interchanges; the last interchange to be reconstructed was upgraded in the mid-2000s.|$|E

5000|$|The new bridge {{used the}} {{original}} soil-infilled approach causeways {{on both sides}} of the river that had been used for the railway bridge. Thus, though the span is straight, the overall crossing takes a distinctive curving alignment. The causeways were widened to the Trans-Canada <b>Highway</b> <b>standard</b> width of 3 lanes (2 travel lanes and emergency shoulders) and lengthened to narrow the span to roughly half that of the railway bridge.|$|R
5000|$|Henty Highway is a 360 {{kilometre}} {{highway in}} western Victoria, Australia. It's primarily a north-south route, {{and consists of}} a mix of 2 laned country <b>highway</b> <b>standard</b> and 4 lane arterial road within {{some of the larger}} towns along the route. The highway formerly ran all the way to meet the Calder Highway at its junction south of Ouyen, but when the Sunraysia Highway was given highway status, the Henty name was truncated back to Lascelles.|$|R
5|$|Despite the support, {{the state}} caved {{to some of}} the {{complaints}} of the opposition, resulting in a delay of the project. By November1963, the state told Caroline officials that the design of bridges along NY330 required changing to new state <b>highway</b> <b>standards.</b> The state began working also on assessing property values of the land required for the new position. They stated that unless the state budget could not afford it, the project would begin the process in 1964. Patience ran thin by February1964 with the Caroline town officials, who demanded progress from the state, who stated that the project could not move forward until there was funding. By November1964, the state admitted nothing would happen until at least 1965, two years behind schedule. This time, the construction would be delayed due to delays in acquiring land and personnel.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 3 was realigned {{to follow the}} entire length of the Route S3 freeway. In addition, Route 3 in Secaucus was shifted off the Paterson Plank Road to the newly built Secaucus Bypass. The {{original}} alignment of Route 3 became Route 153. Only the section west of Paterson Plank Road was state-maintained after the renumbering, and the entire route was eliminated by the 1990s. In the mid-1950s, Route 3 was planned as one of the original routes of the Interstate Highway System; however, the New Jersey State Highway Department had deemed it too expensive to bring it up to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards</b> and Interstate 280 was favored instead. In 1959, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as Interstate 495 and Route 3 was truncated back to U.S. Route 1/9 in North Bergen.|$|E
5|$|The east–west highway {{connecting}} {{the village of}} Groton {{to the city of}} Cortland was originally improved to state <b>highway</b> <b>standards</b> as part of three separate projects in the early 20th century. On July10, 1906, the first project was let to rebuild the section between the Cortland city line and Highland Road, a north–south road west of what is now Cortland CountyChase Field Airport. The road was added to the state highway system on October11, 1907 as unsigned State Highway446 (SH446). A contract to improve the part of the Groton–Cortland road leading west from Highland Road to the Tompkins County line was awarded on April29, 1912, which was accepted into the state highway system on January8, 1913, as SH996.|$|E

5|$|The {{state of}} New York assumed {{maintenance}} of two highways linking the hamlets of Harford and Harford Mills—one directly connecting {{the two and}} a second, more circuitous route to the east—in the early 20th century. The direct route {{and most of the}} loop road were improved to state <b>highway</b> <b>standards</b> as part of a project contracted out on October16, 1914, and were added to the state highway system on December10, 1915, as State Highway1075 (SH1075). Each end of SH1075 connected to the segment of the loop route between modern NY38 and Owego Hill Road, which was rebuilt as part of an earlier project awarded on September19, 1906, and included in the state highway system on July5, 1908, as SH379. Both designations are unsigned and used only for inventory purposes.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the freeway}} was {{extended}} eastward {{a few blocks}} through a junction with the newly opened Chrysler Freeway (I-75) to its present-day eastern terminus near Conant Street. The state requested additional Interstate Highway System mileage that year as well, and in the proposals submitted was a request to extend the Davison to I-96 and I-94. These plans to transfer the freeway to state control and extend it were dropped in the 1970s after opposition to another freeway in Detroit. The plans would have extended it west to the Jeffries and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53). Upon its transfer to state control in 1993, it had previously been a county-maintained freeway, the Davison Freeway was designated as M-8. Three years later, the Davison was closed {{for a year and}} a half to reconstruct it to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards</b> with an additional through travel lane and a wider left shoulder for improved safety and traffic handling as well as a new interchange with Woodward Avenue. The reconstructed freeway was reopened on October 8, 1997 by Governor John Engler.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, a Flint-area {{politician}} {{wanted to}} dedicate a highway after the United Auto Workers (UAW). As a result, the David Dunbar Buick Freeway name was moved off I-475 {{and applied to}} I-69 in Flint. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved {{the extension of the}} I-69 designation eastward in 1983 so that it would terminate at the international boundary at Port Huron; this approval was contingent on construction of the roadway to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards</b> and other appropriate approvals at the federal government level. The remaining segment of freeway connecting Lapeer with Wadhams opened in 1984 as I-69 and several additional changes were made to the highway system at the same time. M-21 was shortened to Flint and replaced M-56 through the city. The former route of M-21 in Port Huron became BLI-69, and the remainder of that highway was turned back to local control. The I-69 designation was officially extended once more under Congressional legislation on February 10, 1987; this last extension designated I-69 all the way to I-94 in Port Huron to reflect the 1984 openings.|$|E

5|$|Reconstruction of the MD 3 {{divided highway}} and the Glen Burnie Bypass was a complex {{operation}} that involved many temporary openings, lane shifts, {{construction of new}} roadways, and reconstruction of existing roadways over several phases over several years. The first improvement was {{the reconstruction of the}} I-695 interchange between 1987 and 1991. The modern ramps from I-97 to westbound I-695 and from eastbound I-695 to I-97 were built, eastbound I-695's ramp over these two ramps was constructed, and the loop ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695 was removed. I-97 from its interchange with MD 648 to the new Beltway ramps was reconstructed to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards</b> and expanded to six lanes between May 1993 and August 1995. Part of the functionality of the loop ramp to westbound I-695 was restored in October 1995 when another ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway approach to westbound I-695 was added to allow access from I-97 to MD 648.|$|E
5|$|Though the National Freeway was {{designated}} as US48, as {{the completion of}} the freeway neared, the possibility of the freeway being designated as an Interstate Highway came up. In the 1980s, the project to improve US50 between Washington, D.C., and Annapolis to Interstate <b>Highway</b> <b>standards</b> had been assigned the designation of I-68. MDSHA, however, later concluded that adding additional route shields to the US50 freeway would not be helpful to drivers, since about half the freeway already had two route designations (US50 and US301) and drivers on the freeway were already familiar with the US50 designation. This made the designation to be applied to that freeway more flexible, and so in 1989, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the organization composed of the various state departments of transportation that decides route numbering in the United States, approved MDSHA's request to renumber the US50 freeway from I-68 to I-595. That same year, AASHTO approved changing US48's designation to I-68. This change took effect upon {{the completion of the}} last section of the National Freeway, on August 2, 1991.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Slurry Seal is an {{impermeable}} non-structural {{thin layer}} {{that is used}} for pavement maintenance consisting of a cold laid mixture of asphalt emulsion with continuous graded fine aggregate, mineral filler, water and other added ingredients. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) as the main filler {{in the application of}} slurry seal. Due to the relatively high cement prices and the pollution control for the environment; it is required to maintain the quality of the slurry by using a combination of OPC and LCFA (Low Calcium Fly Ash). This research was conducted to determine the value of consistency, setting time and indirect tensile strength (ITS) of slurry seal containing LCFA. A consistency testing used to obtain optimum moisture content to produce the sample {{for the rest of the}} test. The results show that with the addition of 5 % water for pre-wetting and subsequently 10 % of water content, the mixture provide appropriate consistency as required by <b>highways</b> <b>standard.</b> The time settings also meet the requirements of <b>highways</b> <b>standard</b> between 15 to 720 minutes for all types of mixtures. The mixture with composition of 50 % OPC and 50 % LCFA is considered as an ideal mixture at the optimum density value of 1. 769 g/cm 3, porosity of 9. 55 % and the indirect tensile strength of 30. 99 kPa. It could be concluded that fly ash can be used as OPC partial replacement and enhance the properties on slurry seal application...|$|R
