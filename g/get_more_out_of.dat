5|$|Finucane's {{start at}} No. 452 was unimpressive. On 3 May 1941 {{while on a}} {{recognition}} flight with his new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Roy Dutton, Finucane got too close and his propeller sliced through Dutton's tailplane. Finucane radioed Dutton immediately. Dutton attempted to abandon the aircraft but was too low and crash-landed, cracking several ribs but surviving. Finucane excused himself from error asserting that his Spitfire {{was the only one}} with a metal propeller—the others being elder Mark I's with wooden mounts—which gave him extra speed. In tight formation, this had caused the collision. Despite the incident, he was gazetted on 13 May and given temporary command of the squadron while Dutton was injured. While at 452 Finucane became a popular commander and encouraged a more relaxed atmosphere, which he believed would help him <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Australian pilots. He was now in command of 23 pilots, 16 fighters and 130 ground crew.|$|E
25|$|The tension {{was high}} {{between the two}} Mercedes {{teammates}} going into the weekend when Hamilton {{was found to have}} altered his car settings during the latter stages of the Spanish Grand Prix, using a higher-powered engine setting than the team had previously allowed in order to stay ahead of teammate Rosberg. Rosberg was then discovered to have done the same while chasing down Hamilton {{at the end of the}} Bahrain Grand Prix, though he failed to get past. Despite losing the Drivers' Championship lead to teammate Hamilton in Spain, Rosberg stated he would not be changing his approach and was not heavily focused on the championship but expected the battle to remain tight. Hamilton reckoned his increased comfort with the F1 W05 Hybrid would put Rosberg under pressure in Monaco, saying it was a track where he performed well but the 2013 race was where he was unable to extract the most amount of performance from his car although he hoped to <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his Mercedes and wanted to have the Ferrari and Red Bull cars battling him for the victory.|$|E
500|$|Engineers' [...] "Blue Light" [...] {{was dubbed}} the 'Anti-Gravity' mix and {{resulted}} in an ambient track which Nick Southall of Stylus considered as good as Bloc Party's version. Erol Alkan's reworking of debut single [...] "She's Hearing Voices" [...] is a dub version over twice {{the length of the}} blueprint. The song accentuates the punk funk elements in Bloc Party's work. Alkan has noted that his priority was to <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the track's groove and melody since [...] "the original is so fast it kind of flies by without you being able to recognise [...] beauty". Dave Pianka and Adam Sparkle's work on [...] "This Modern Love" [...] resulted in a musical construction akin to 1980s new wave bands Blondie and The Cure. M83 used several studio effects to create an ambient version of single [...] "Pioneers" [...] by adding strings and synthesisers to the original composition. Automato's remix of [...] "Price of Gas" [...] infuses Bloc Party's blueprint with electronica elements.|$|E

50|$|It’s thrilling to read {{an entire}} book of poems written with such {{pleasure}} and gusto.

500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Bagwell's power hike piqued {{the curiosity}} of many {{baseball}} observers. [...] In two minor league seasons from 1989–90, {{he had managed}} six home runs in 932 at bats–a ratio of 155 at bats per home run (AB/HR). [...] With 15 HR {{in his first year}} in Houston, that average shrunk to 36.9. [...] He also exhibited extraordinary plate discipline for a rookie: while ranking tenth in the league in walks with 75, his OBP placed fifth at [...]387. [...] Of the power surge, commented Bagwell to hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo, [...] "That's awesome", to which he reacted, [...] "Awesome? [...] We can <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you than that." [...] By altering an approach to contact the pitch with topspin as he did when he arriving to Houston, Jaramillo taught Bagwell to hit with backspin, resulting in a soaring trajectory rather than nose diving. [...] He also habituated Bagwell to manipulate the count, waiting for a pitch to drive instead of indiscriminately swinging at any pitch that appeared to be a strike. [...] Accounted Bagwell of the newfound advantage, [...] "I didn’t hit many home runs in the minor leagues, but when I hit one, when I got backspin on it, it went a long way." ...|$|E
500|$|Shero's introverted, enigmatic {{personality}} had {{an effect}} on the way in which he coached players. Shero often communicated with his players by way of notes left in their lockers. When he did talk to them, he was known for never yelling. He believed that when coaches yell they do it for their own sake. He always defended his player whether it was in the press or even against management. He always tried to make sure his players were focused during the game. He often asked them how much time was left in the period to force them to pay attention. He had a unique take on practice as well. If the team was winning then he worked the team hard. If they were losing then there would be a low key practice. He believed that he could <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> players when they were winning. He often had drills designed to let the players have fun, stating that [...] "Hockey is a child's game played by men. Since it's a child's game it ought to be fun". To have fun the Flyers occasionally had 12-on-12 games with the winning team earning a small monetary reward. He sometimes had the players perform drills that lacked purpose which the team performed until a player questioned the validity of the drill. At that point Shero stopped the drill and praised the player for being alert. Shero was notoriously bad with names. On one occasion it led to him trading for the wrong player. While GM of the Rangers Shero traded for Cam Connor believing it was Colin Campbell. Upon his arrival Conner had to explain that he was a winger and not a defenceman.|$|E
