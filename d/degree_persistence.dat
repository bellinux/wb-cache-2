Math confidence {{seems to be}} particularly important for women, who often report lower math self-concept than their male peers despite having equivalent or higher achievement (Leslie et al., 1998). While general academic self-concept has also been associated with desirable STEMM outcomes, findings {{suggest that it is}} a less powerful and less robust indicator than math self-concept (Astin and Astin 1992; Mau 2003). While personal measures of math ability and interest are powerful predictors of success in STEMM education and careers, so too are course-taking choices and performance. As a first step, students who pass algebra by eigth grade are more likely to select and succeed in high-level math courses in high school (Adelman 1999, 2006).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> in five {{inflation}} indicators for Angola, and to identify the implications for decision-making. Understanding inflation persistence in Angola is crucial because the National Bank of Angola is preparing to change its monetary policy focus to a more inflation-targeting regime. Our results suggest that when structural breaks are accounted for, all five inflation indicators are stationary, so that a shock will give temporary effects. Secondly, our findings suggest that persistence is not too high. Moreover, the <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> is similar among the five inflation indicators and throughout the sample period. Finally, our results also show that extracting the most volatile components of the headline inflation indicator does not generate a new inflation indicator that is less volatile and more persistent than the original. These results have important implications for the design, implementation and effectiveness of monetary policy in Angola, especially when following an inflation-targeting regime. First, a not too high <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> means monetary policy aiming for price stability must be implemented with a permanent policy stance. Secondly, a low <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> also means that inflation can be stabilized in a short period of time following a shock.

The authors studied relationships between presence of chronic pain versus preoperative descending pain control (diffuse noxious inhibitory controls; DNICs) and postoperative persistence and spread {{of skin and}} deep tissue hyperalgesia (change in electric/pressure pain tolerance thresholds; ePTT/pPTT) up to 6 months postoperatively. In 20 patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery under standardized anesthesia, we determined ePTT/pPTT (close to [abdomen] and distant from [leg] incision), eDNIC/pDNIC (change in ePTT/pPTT with cold pressor pain task; only preoperatively), and a 100 mm long pain visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 mm = no pain, 100 mm = worst pain imaginable), both at rest and on movement preoperatively, and 1 day and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Patients reporting chronic pain 6 months postoperatively had more abdominal and leg skin hyperalgesia over the postoperative period. More inhibitory preoperative eDNIC was associated with less late postoperative pain, without affecting skin hyperalgesia. More inhibitory pDNIC was linked to less postoperative leg deep tissue hyperalgesia, without affecting pain VAS.

Of the students who completed the developmental courses, 58. 7 percent needed three or four semesters to do so. There was no difference in reading grade level at time of matriculation between students who completed the developmental courses and those who did not. First semester grade point average seemed to be an indicator of success in completing the developmental courses and was positively related to the persistence of the students.

40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{degree of}} intrinsic inflation persistence in Pakistan using aggregate price index, group level price indices, and individual commodity prices. We find {{no evidence of}} a unit root in (MoM) inflation at any level, except for house rent. Using monthly data from 1959 to 2011 we find that the estimate of (overall) inflation persistence is 0. 16, which is low but significant. During 2001 - 2011 (overall) inflation persistence is insignificant. Food inflation does not exhibit any persistence during the last decade. However, the <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> is very high (0. 80) and significant for core inflation (NFNE), which weakens slightly (to 0. 69) when we account for commodities price shock of 2008. At micro level, the estimated <b>degree</b> of inflation <b>persistence</b> for various groups is found to be relatively higher, in almost 60 percent of the cases, compared to corresponding <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> at aggregate level.

The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: i) Only three performance measures (Sharpe ratio, Reward-to-Semivariability, and Graham-Harvey measure) show some <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> for almost all horizons and information sets. This means that the researcher should take into account that there is a bias in these measures to evaluate the true performance of the manager. ii) Performance measures seem to show approximately the same <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> in a short term than in a long term. iii) With some performance measures, there is a high probability of reversals in performances...|$|R
40|$|Time-series {{analyses}} of {{output and productivity}} data suggest that shocks are fairly persistent. This has implications for the intergenerational risk-sharing effects of pay-as-you-go (paygo) social security programs.

A low or medium <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> ensures that properly scaled paygo programs provide intergenerational diversification of income risk.

In order to assess the robustness of our estimates both a parametric and a non-parametric measure of inflation persistence is used. Overall, our results suggest a relatively low <b>degree</b> of inflation <b>persistence</b> in Luxembourg. For a large number of sub-indices we are not only able to reject the unit root hypothesis, but also we find a low <b>degree</b> of inflation <b>persistence</b> relative to other EU 15 countries and relative to the EU 15 and euro area aggregates. For Luxembourg as well as the other EU 15 countries, our results suggest substantial heterogeneity in the <b>degree</b> of inflation <b>persistence</b> across sub-indices. We find some support for the presence of aggregation effects, both across indices and countries. Structural break tests for all EU 15 countries suggest the presence of structural changes in the inflation process owing to the inception of the single monetary policy and/or to the modified treatment of sales. ...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{inflation}} {{persistence in}} Angola is crucial because National Bank of Angola has approved in 2012 a new monetary policy operational framework which upgrades and expands {{the set of}} instruments to achieve its monetary goals. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to measure the <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> of the headline, food, energy, underlying and 10 % trimmed core inflations for Angola and to identify its implications for decision-making. Using both a traditional univariate method and non-parametric approach, our results suggest the presence of a statistically significant level of persistence in five inflation indicators for Angola. Moreover, the <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> is similar both across the five inflation indicators and also across the sample period. Finally, our results also confirm that extracting the most volatile components of the headline inflation indicator does not generate a new inflation indicator that is less volatile and more persistent than the original.

In general, the results show a high <b>degree</b> of <b>persistence</b> in the series along with a component of non-linear behaviour. In general, if we assume uncorrelated errors, non-linearities are observed in both nominal and real prices, but this hypothesis is rejected in favour of linear models for the logtransformation of the data. However, if autocorrelated errors are permitted, non-linearities are observed in all cases, and mean reversion is found in the case of logged prices, though given the wide confidence intervals, the unit root null hypothesis cannot be rejected in these cases.

40|$|This paper {{graphically}} {{demonstrates the}} significant {{impact of the}} observed financial market persistence, i. e., long term memory or dependence, on European option valuation. Many empirical researchers have observed non-Fickian <b>degrees</b> of <b>persistence</b> or long memory {{in the financial markets}} different from the Fickian neutral independence (i. i. d.) of the returns innovations assumption of Black-Scholes' geometric Brownian motion assumption. Moreover, Elliott and van der Hoek (2003) have now also provided a theoretical framework for incorporating these findings in the Black-Scholes risk-neutral valuation framework. This paper provides the first graphical demonstration why and how such long term memory phenomena change European option values and provides thereby a basis for informed long term memory arbitrage. Risk-neutral valuation is equivalent to valuation by real world probabilities. By using a mono-fractional Brownian motion, it is easy to incorporate the various <b>degrees</b> of <b>persistence</b> into the binomial and Black-Scholes pricing formulas. Long memory options are of considerable importance in Corporate remuneration packages, since warrants are written on a company's own shares for long expiration periods. Therefore, we recommend that for a proper valuation of such warrants, the <b>degrees</b> of <b>persistence</b> of the companies' share markets are measured and properly incorporated in the warrant valuation.
