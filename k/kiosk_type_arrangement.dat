40|$|The last {{decades the}} concern of the public, {{regarding}} the possible affects from the exposure to magnetic and electric fields, has grown considerably.

This paper attempts to illustrate the values of the resultant magnetic field in the low frequency range, near a compact <b>kiosk</b> <b>type</b> substation 630 KVA, 20 - 0. 4 kV.

40|$|Background: Most of the, 2, 600 serovars of Salmonella enterica {{have a broad}} {{host range}} {{as well as a}} conserved gene order. In contrast, some Salmonella serovars are host-specific and {{frequently}} exhibit large chromosomal rearrangements from recombination between rrn operons. One hypothesis explaining these rearrangements suggests that replichore imbalance introduced from horizontal transfer of pathogenicity islands and prophages drives chromosomal rearrangements in an attempt to improve balance. Methodology/Principal Findings: This hypothesis was directly tested by comparing the naturally-occurring chromosomal <b>arrangement</b> <b>types</b> to the theoretically possible <b>arrangement</b> <b>types,</b> and estimating their replichore balance using a calculator. In addition to previously characterized strains belonging to host-specific serovars, the <b>arrangement</b> <b>types</b> of 22 serovar Gallinarum strains was also determined. Only 48 out of 1, 440 possible <b>arrangement</b> <b>types</b> were identified in 212 host-specific strains. While the replichores of most naturally-occurring <b>arrangement</b> <b>types</b> were well-balanced, most theoretical <b>arrangement</b> <b>types</b> had imbalanced replichores. Furthermore, the most common types of rearrangements did not change replichore balance. Conclusions/Significance: The results did not support the hypothesis that replichore imbalance causes thes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} age on the fibre <b>type</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{in the human}} muscle m. vastus lateralis were studied. There were 10, 6 and 8 healthy men in the three age-groups with means 24, 52 and 77 years, respectively. For each {{fascicle}} considered, the numbers of type 1 (ST) and type 2 (FT) fibres on the boundary and internally, and the numbers of enclosed fibres of either type, were counted. The randomness of the fibre <b>type</b> <b>arrangement</b> was considered {{in terms of the}} numbers of enclosed fibres and assessed by a Monte Carlo significance test. Fibre type grouping was shown to increase with increasing age. The proportion of type 2 fibres on the boundary of a fascicle was consistently greater than internally, but the difference was less pronounced in the old group. It is argued that the process of denervation and reinnervation of individual fibres has started before the age of 50, is a major factor in a progressive reduction of fibres with increasing age and is probably caused by a continuous loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord...|$|R
