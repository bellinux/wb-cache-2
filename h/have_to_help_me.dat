2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Power 106, Gomez spoke in-depth about the inspiration behind [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", saying: [...] "Everybody has had a say in my life [...] meaning the world, the perception, the media. It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need to say what I want to say, and you guys <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|E

6000|$|... "You will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{carry her}} off, Jim, {{and the day}} that she signs her name Bertha Carthew I {{will give you a}} couple of {{thousand}} pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave him}} a curious smile. [...] "Oh, well; here's the letter. Jim Nixon <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> across the water when I went last night, and I don't suppose you're afraid of wetting your feet. You are used to it at Ashness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were just}} going through some papers," [...] said Mary. [...] "Mr. Basnett <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> because I don't know much about my work yet. It's the new society," [...] she explained. [...] "I'm the secretary. I'm no longer at Russell Square." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked in}} the glass. It was true, for there hung the ends down my shirt front. Then I {{struggled}} with the wretched thing until at last she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> which she did laughing softly. Somehow her touch gave me confidence again and enabled me to say quite boldly that I only wanted my dinner.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have proved}} {{that to me}} to-day. I am afraid I shall have to trouble you further if I get bad news. You will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to find some work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Both, lad, both--some of everything. Well, as I was saying--and you've a {{right to}} know what's running in my head, seeing that you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> carry out the plans--I'll give you a rough notion of 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Julien," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "you know, {{you never}} did {{understand}} me! I repeat {{that she is a}} milliner and that she is a dear friend of mine, and I am going just as I am to tell her that I have come to spend the night. She will have to find me rooms, she will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> find employment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There wouldn't be {{much use}} in that, {{although}} I deserve it," [...] Gerald replied. [...] "It's {{too late for}} excuses. The situation's dangerous. You <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> out." ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{down the}} rickety wharf {{and into the}} salmon boat. Likewise they {{stretched}} my boom and sprit until the sail set like a board. Some feared to set the sprit; but I insisted, and Charley had no doubts. He knew me of old, and knew that I could sail as long as I could see. They cast off my painter. I put the tiller up, filled away before it, and with dizzy eyes checked and steadied the boat on her course and waved farewell.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think my}} husband is going to leave me or do {{something}} dreadful--I don't know what--Clym, will you go and see? I <b>have</b> nobody <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> but you! Eustacia has not yet come home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And what do {{you think}} of it, Maud and Ethel?' their mamma asked the two little girls, who were looking very surprised, but rather {{doubtful}} as to the pleasure of the fights with Indians which their brothers had spoken so delightedly about. 'You will have to be two very useful little women, and will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> just as the boys will have to help your papa. Very likely we may not be able to get a servant there, and then we shall have to do everything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jestin'; no I ain't, maister. Do 'ee see {{the boat}} out over?" [...] he said, {{pointing}} to a small craft full of men which was being rowed swiftly round a point not {{more than half a}} mile distant; [...] "the villains are after me. They might as well have tried to kitch a cunger by the tail as nab Jim Cuttance in one of his dens, if he hadn't bin forced by the softness of his 'art to pull a young fool out o' the say. You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to fight, lad, as I've saved your life. Come, follow me to the cave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> out," [...] Grief {{warned the}} others, as he began. [...] "Old Parlay is a character. From what I've seen of him I believe he's partly and mildly insane. Anyway, here's the story: Parlay's a full-blooded Frenchman. He {{told me once}} that he came from Paris. His accent is the true Parisian. He arrived down here in the old days. Went to trading and all the rest. That's how he got in on Hikihoho. Came in trading when trading was the real thing. About a hundred miserable Paumotans lived on the island. He married the queen--native fashion. When she died, {{everything}} was his. Measles came through, and there weren't more than a dozen survivors. He fed them, and worked them, and was king. Now before the queen died she gave birth to a girl. That's Armande. When she was three he sent her to the convent at Papeete. When she was seven or eight he sent her to France. You begin to glimpse the situation. The best and most aristocratic convent in France was none too good for the only daughter of a Paumotan island king and capitalist, and you know the old country French draw no colour line. She was educated like a princess, and she accepted herself in much the same way. Also, she thought she was all-white, and never dreamed of a bar sinister.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> Uncle <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> and I {{think my}} ideal {{grew out of}} my {{knowledge}} of him. How can I fail to believe in goodness, when he shows me what it can be and do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, God bless you?' he moaned, 'God bless you! If {{only you}} knew what I have gone through; {{and to think that}} you should <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> and at the risk of your own life! Well, you were always a true friend--yes, yes, a true friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Willy dried her eyes, {{and then}} she said, [...] "There's another {{practical}} thing I'm thinking of,--there isn't any breakfast, and the cook's gone! But I believe we can arrange that. I could cook the breakfast myself if I <b>had</b> anybody <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> I'll go speak to Mrs. Cliff." ...|$|R
5000|$|Evidence {{emerged that}} Dwyer and O'Hara had {{embarked}} on a sexual relationship that involved bondage, violence and knives. The relationship was very intense throughout 2008. Violent homemade sex videos and fragments of emails were retrieved from their laptops. Their relationship dwindled for some time, but was rekindled in March 2011 when Dwyer contacted O'Hara through a prepaid mobile phone. Dwyer had a mobile phone number which began with 083, and both he and Elaine had mobile phones with numbers that began 086. Recovered texts sent by Dwyer during this period included: [...] I want to stick my knife in flesh while I am sexually aroused… I would like to stab a girl to death some time. Graham Dwyer [...] My urge to rape, stab or kill is huge. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> control or satisfy it. Graham Dwyer ...|$|E

5000|$|Rusty, [...] "When did {{you know}} that the damage was worse than you thought {{immediately}} after the collision?" [...] Tuff, “When I saw the reaction on people’s faces. As I was walking out of the arena I told my buddy, ‘I must have broken my jaw, because when I bite down my teeth don’t touch.’ I could see people looking at me, and covering their faces. I thought, ‘Oh I must not look very good.’ I remember being back stage waiting for the EMT and watching the replay on the monitors, and I could feel my face starting to swell. This was back when I was still wearing hard contact lenses, and I told my friend, ‘You’re gonna to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> dig these contacts out.’ My eyes were swelling shut. It wasn’t painful initially, but once I was lying down in the ambulance and the adrenaline wore off and the swelling and throbbing began to set in, it hurt like hell. My head swelled up and it was the grossest thing you’ve ever seen. There was no way to recognize who I was, or really what I was.” ...|$|E
60|$|At night sometimes, as I lay awake, I {{would tell}} myself that if only I {{could see her}} or even hear from her the {{struggle}} would be easier. It was her total disappearance from my life that made it so hard for <b>me.</b> I <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> fight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yours is a {{good rule}} and force is useful now and then," [...] Bernard observed. [...] "However, we came {{to take you to}} Dryholm. I was feeling dull, and the others <b>have</b> promised <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> through the evening. If you can come, we will go on to Langrigg for Mrs. Winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am not in}} {{the habit}} of playing with hot coals to please anybody. She has been sent from heaven, as I may <b>have</b> remarked before, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> with my Melancolia.' ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to my husband, Brandon, my children, Landon and Lylli, and my parents, Paul and Bobbie Nichols. This is as much your degree as it is mine. You have sacrificed more for me than I thought humanly possible and I know God holds {{a special place in}} his heart for each of you. ii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS As I {{come to the end of}} this journey, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the individuals who have helped make my dream a reality. In particular, I would like to thank my husband. Without your support, both financially and emotionally, I would have never attempted, much less accomplished, such a feat. You demanded that I pursue my life’s ambition and would not take no for an answer. Thank you for enduring all that you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> succeed. It is your turn now! Appreciation also goes to all my academic and life teachers. These individuals include, but are not limited to Paul and Bobbie Nichols, A. M. and Betty Choate, Barbara Gilbert, Lind...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the essay is {{to see if the}} pupils of Ross Tensta Gymnasium feel it is {{necessary}} to have an existing cooperation between the police and Ross Tensta Gymnasium. I would like to know how the cooperation works between Ross Tensta Gymnasium and the police and also if the cooperation is visible for the pupils. Furthermore I {{would like to know if}} it is necessary to have cooperation between schools and the police even though there are not any obligations to have any. The methodology I have been using is a qualitative analysis. The entire essay is based on interviews which I have recorded and later transcript it into writing. The theories which I have been using are Wacquant’s use of territorial stigma and also the concept of us and the others in which Stuart Hall explains. The questions I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> find the answers to my purpose of investigation are: In which way is the cooperation visible for the pupils of Ross Tensta Gymnasium? How does the relationship work between the pupils of Ross Tensta Gymnasium and the police? What part has the school in the relationship between the police and the pupils...|$|E

"And so did I," [...] eagerly {{replied the}} lady of the cerulean buskin; [...] "he spoke ten languages--how mortifying to poor me, Mr. Cargill, who could only boast of five!--but I have studied a little since that time--I must <b>have</b> you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> in my studies, Mr. Cargill--it will be charitable--but perhaps you are afraid of a female pupil?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one else. It is no {{case for}} exultation, Cora, for {{the chances are}} that I shall fail. The Duke <b>has</b> promised <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> on {{condition}} that one or two he has named are included, and that one or two whom he has also named are not. In each case I should myself have done exactly as he proposes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Once a friend, {{always a}} friend, Miguel,” she {{continued}} brightly. “Even to-day you <b>have</b> been trying <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> and I am grateful. Some time {{we will have}} a good talk together about the old days.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very good, Captain Maryon," [...] says Pordage, in a {{tremendous}} passion. [...] "Very good, sir. Be the consequences {{on your own}} head! Mr. Kitten, as it <b>has</b> come <b>to</b> this, <b>help</b> <b>me</b> on with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful, isn't it? Everything {{is in the}} Stars. In the Old Days, before I <b>had</b> the Stars <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> I used <b>to</b> lose thousands. Now"--she paused an instant--"well, look at {{that four}} hundred on the Grand National. That's the Stars." ...|$|R
