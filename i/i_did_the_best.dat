25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>The</b> <b>best</b> explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huckstepp {{also went}} {{to the media and}} gave {{extensive}} interviews, claiming that Rogerson had murdered Lanfranchi and stolen $10,000 Lanfranchi was carrying to bribe Rogerson. She also claimed that Neddy Smith had lied to the inquest and was involved in a conspiracy with Rogerson. Rogerson maintained his innocence. In Neddy: The Life and Crimes of Arthur Stanley Smith, Smith wrote that Lanfranchi was [...] "attempting to bribe Rogerson. I was the person that took Warren to this fatal meeting. There was an inquest and both sides threw plenty of shit at one another. I was {{right in the middle of}} it all. I could do nothing to bring Warren back to life, so <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> thing I could. I know Warren’s family suffered deeply, but I cannot do anything about it." [...] He goes on to claim that as a result of his testimony at the inquest, Rogerson and other corrupt police officers gave him a [...] "green light" [...] to commit crime without fear of prosecution.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is most misconvenient at least," [...] said I; [...] "and I {{think my}} father (honest man!) {{must have been}} wool-gathering to learn me Latin {{in the place of}} it. But you see <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can, and just stand up like Lot's wife and let them hammer at me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If {{someone asks}} me {{what kind of}} music <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> way <b>I</b> could put it is cinematic," [...] Bagsby says. [...] "At worst, people will think of Kenny Loggins and '80s movies, but I'm {{thinking}} more of Fantastic Voyage and Planet of the Apes, scores that can stand on their own two balls, even away from the films." ...|$|R
2500|$|The 1935 Senior {{race was}} {{postponed}} {{until the next}} day due to poor weather. The race produced a dramatic competition. Guthrie led away at number 1 while Stanley Woods starting at number 30 had a 15-minute wait. By the last lap, Guthrie had built up a lead of 26 seconds. As the Moto Guzzi pit-attendants made preparations for Stanley Woods to refuel on the last lap, the Norton pit-crew signalled to Guthrie to go easy the pace on the last lap. Stanley Woods riding for Moto Guzzi went straight through the TT Grandstand area without stopping on the last lap and set a new overall lap record of 26minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 86.53mph. Despite the Norton team telephoning the signal-station at Ramsey on the last lap to indicate to Guthrie to speed up the pace, Stanley Woods won the race by 4 seconds from Guthrie in 3hours, 7minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 84.68mph. After the race Guthrie said [...] "I went as quick as I could but Stanley went quicker. I am sorry but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pilots and airline {{personnel}} throughout the industry petitioned the NTSB to revise its report. First Officer Claude Ouimet sent the NTSB a detailed defence of the crew's actions, including {{the decision to}} land in Cincinnati instead of Standiford Field Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, the airport closest to where the crew first notified Air Traffic Control in Indianapolis, Indiana, {{that they needed to}} make an emergency landing. Ouimet stated that Louisville was too close to be able to descend from cruising altitude to an emergency landing safely, and even landing in Cincinnati was a questionable proposition given Cameron's difficulties in controlling the plane. After reviewing Ouimet's missive and re-evaluating the available data, the NTSB issued a revised version of the report which included Ouimet's explanation of the landing decision, though the report was still critical of Cameron's decision not to inquire about the fire itself. [...] "All I know was that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could," [...] Cameron later said. [...] "I'm very sorry the people that didn't get off, didn't get off, because {{we spent a lot of}} time and effort getting them there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just the}} trouble," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could under the circumstances. I didn't want the Indians to scalp him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pratt at once said: [...] "I don't blame ye fer pullin' out, Mose. <b>I</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> could, considerin'. Co'se I can't begin fer to pay ye {{the wages}} Delmar can, but be keerful; trouble is comin', shore pop, and I'd hate to have ye killed, on the wimmen's account. They 'pear {{to think more}} o' you than they do o' me." ...|$|R
60|$|I never {{pretended to}} {{understand}} Private Ortheris; and so <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> next <b>best</b> thing <b>I</b> left him alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> It's <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{thing for}} me--and for you, too. I shouldn't {{want to be}} idle, even if I was a millionaire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a {{difficult}} part to play, George," [...] responded his friend. [...] "We ought to have rehearsed it a bit. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The nurse from Sulphur {{refused to}} come when she found that her patient was in a {{mountain}} cabin. I'm sorry, old man; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could." ...|$|E
60|$|NEWTE [with fine frankness]. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I {{could for}} you, old girl, {{and he was}} very nice about it. Said it was better than he'd expected, and that I'd made him very happy--very happy indeed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'More serious! Well, <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can. I {{am sorry}} {{to see that you}} are less {{interested}} in astronomy than you used to be, Viviette.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I knowed, but I don't. I HAD it, because I {{stole it}} from them; and I stole it {{to give to}} you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm afraid it ain't there no more. I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm just as sorry as I can be; but <b>I</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> could; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> honest. <b>I</b> come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run--and it warn't a good place." ...|$|R
5000|$|Filming {{began in}} late 1982 under the {{direction}} of Po-Chih Leong, director of the generally well-received Hong Kong 1941. According to Ringo Lam around one-third of the film had been shot when Leong resigned after arguing with producer Karl Maka. In need of a quick and inexpensive replacement Maka gave the previously unknown Ringo Lam his big break. Later in an interview Lam explained, [...] "I have no choice, I need food, so <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can ..." [...] Lam received sole directing credit for the film.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was not to}} blame--not in the least. I won't admit it. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I {{could for}} her. She {{accepted}} him, and they are betrothed. The Cure down there says it's nearly as good as being married.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{that you are}} displeased, my dear Fenella, but I assure you that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could. It {{is true that the}} young man is in my office, but I am {{convinced}} that you will find him presentable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would never}} have played it here for any one else," [...] said Harry presently. [...] "These things {{are not to be}} {{undertaken}} casually, but she--well, I felt they had to listen, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> that was in me. I think it was her clean-hearted simplicity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I can {{reconcile}} {{myself to}} that, surely you can <b>do</b> so. <b>The</b> matter is settled now, and I think <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{in my power}} for myself and my children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you speak}} to me again in that way I will write to your uncle at Gloucester. <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> could for you both, and I will not bear such treatment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think of}} that," [...] Ralph laughed. [...] "Yes, the {{prospect}} is a cheering one. I promise you, O'Connor, that <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can for you. Well, {{here we are}} alongside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm dreadful sorry," [...] said Mrs. Spencer. [...] "It's too bad; but it {{certainly}} wasn't my fault, you see, Miss Cuthbert. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could and I thought I was following your instructions. Nancy is a terrible flighty thing. I've often had to scold her well for her heedlessness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole," [...] he said calmly, [...] "very good. A little stouter, I perceive, and {{the eyebrows}} a trifle too regular. Of course, {{when you make}} faces at me like that, {{it is hard to}} judge of the expression. I can only say that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose, as she {{is grown}} up, it must have the fine name, but it wasn't a bit like poor Dolly's choking. I am sure she did it to make her sister come! Well, of course, Miss Hacket went away, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could, but what could one do with all these screeches and bellowings {{breaking}} out?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, child, it is VERY bad, {{and you may}} thank your {{stars that}} I try {{to keep you from}} it by feeding you on plain food. At my age, and {{suffering}} as <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of everything is needed to keep up my strength," [...] said Miss Henny, tartly. But the largest plate of pudding, with [...] "heaps of sauce," [...] went to the child this day, and when the fruit was served, an unusually small portion was put away for the invalid, who was obliged to sustain nature with frequent lunches through the day and evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have begun to {{consider}} such things many years ago. You have always been too--busy {{to think of the}} children. You have left them to me. <b>I</b> am <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can with them." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ARCHDEACON. <b>I</b> had to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> for you, my child. Roosenhonkers-Pipstein was a millionaire.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, squire, {{you know}} all about it. I have been wrong to keep her so long from you, I grant; but I {{can only say that}} I have done my duty, as far as I could, and that, though I have made many mistakes, my {{conscience}} is clear, that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> as far as it seemed to me at the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, though <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could. I {{told her}} what a jolly place it was, and that the {{children}} would be a perfect holiday to her.

6000|$|... "I've {{been well}} rewarded, Mother," [...] said Ernest quietly, [...] "but, even if {{nothing of the}} sort had happened, I would be glad that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I could for Frank and Danny. I'm ashamed to think that I was unwilling to do it at first. If it hadn't been for what you said, I wouldn't have. So it is your unselfishness we have to thank for it all, Mother dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear friend, <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can {{in every}} way; I will, indeed. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{believe that your}} companions in town have been too ready to lead you astray. Drop them, and you may yet do well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not," [...] {{said the}} mate, who was {{somewhat}} {{tired of this}} tactless question; [...] "I had to stand by the ship, and besides, he was a much better swimmer than <b>I</b> am—I <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> could." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have always}} felt that <b>I</b> ought to <b>do</b> {{something}} for you, and so I organized a Redding (Connecticut) branch of the Post-Graduate School. I am only a country farmer up there, but <b>I</b> am <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> can.|$|R
