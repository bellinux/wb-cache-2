5000|$|Népouite {{is a rare}} nickel {{silicate}} mineral {{which has}} the apple green colour typical of such compounds.

The ideal formula is Ni(SiO)(OH), but most specimens contain some magnesium, and (Ni,Mg)(SiO)(OH) is more realistic. There is a similar mineral called lizardite in which all the nickel is replaced by magnesium, formula Mg(SiO)(OH).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{composition}} glass fiber non dental on water solubility of fiber reinforced composites. <b>E</b> <b>glass</b> fiber dental {{is one of}} the most used dental fibers in several applications in the dental  field. However, the available of <b>E</b> <b>glass</b> fiber dental in Indonesia is very limited. A variety of types of non-dental glass fiber material is easily found as the materials engineering. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of composition non dental glass fiber on the component solubility of FRC. The materials used in the research was <b>E</b> <b>glass</b> fiber dental (Fiber splint, Polydentia SA, Switzerland), composition A non-dental glass fiber (LT, China), composition B (CMAX, China), composition C (HJ, China), flowable composite (Charmfill Flow, Denkist, Korea) and silane coupling agent (Monobond S, Ivoclair Vivadent, Liechtenstein). The subject was divided into 4 groups. Component solubility test was based on the ISO 4049. The result was then analyzed with one way ANOVA (α= 0, 05). The result of the research showed that on the average percentage of the solubility (%), the lowest was on the group of <b>E</b> <b>glass</b> fiber dental (0. 476 ± 0. 03) and the highest was on the non dental glass fiber C (0. 600 ± 0. 01). The result of the one way ANOVA test showed a significant difference between the compositiom fiber on the component solubility. The conclusion the research was that low content of Na 2 O K 2 O, CaO and MgO decreased the component solubility of FRC...|$|E

40|$|Eels colonize either marine, estuarine or {{freshwater}} habitats, with {{marine and}} estuarine eels tending to grow faster than freshwater eels. The reasons for these divergent migratory tactics and growth trajectories remain poorly understood. In order {{to investigate the}} role of salinity preferences of glass eels in the control of habitat selection and growth plasticity, we sorted different contingents of glass eels Anguilla anguilla through 2 consecutive salinity preference tests. This allowed us to study the link between salinity preference and locomotor activity (i. e. positive rheotaxis), and to distinguish contingents of glass eels that were either plastic or fixed in their preference for freshwater (FW) or saltwater (SW). Subsequently, we monitored somatic growth of the different contingents in controlled SW and FW rearing conditions. Preference for FW was linked to high locomotor activity, a behavioral pattern likely to promote colonization of FW habitats in the wild. Accordingly, FWC (FW contingent, i. <b>e.</b> <b>glass</b> eels that preferred FW twice) exhibited poor growth, similar to those observed in wild FW eel populations. In contrast, preference for SW was linked to low locomotor activity, and the SWC (SW contingent, i. <b>e.</b> <b>glass</b> eels that preferred SW twice) had high growth rates in SW, as observed in wild marine and estuarine populations. The PCC (plastic contingent, i. <b>e.</b> <b>glass</b> eels that swappped their salinity preference) had an intermediary growth status that {{could be related to}} the ‘nomad' life style of eels migrating between different habitat types during their life. Growth was significantly higher in SW compared to FW in all contingents, indicating that habitat salinity may directly affect growth, irrespective of food availability. Our results demonstrated that glass eel salinity preference was linked to their locomotor activity and growth performance, and provided a comprehensive ecological mechanism for the control of habitat distribution and growth patterns observed in wild eel populations...|$|E
