5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus {{had died}} in AD 19, in {{somewhat}} suspicious circumstances in Syria. Following his death, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with their six children and became increasingly involved {{with a group of}} senators who opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught, as she made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> believed that he was {{responsible for the death of}} Germanicus. The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius' mother Livia Drusilla (the widow of Augustus) felt for her, since Agrippina's ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome's first woman, was an open secret. To Sejanus, Agrippina's sons Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula were a threat to his power.|$|E
5|$|The {{letter to}} Æthelburg makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was already {{married at the}} time the news of Eadbald's {{conversion}} reached Rome. This is quite inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald's acceptance of Christianity, and it has been suggested in Bede's defence that Æthelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome, and that the letter was written while she was in Kent. However, it would appear from Boniface's letter that Boniface thought of Æthelburg as being at her husband's side. It also appears that the letter to Justus was written after the letters to Edwin and Æthelburg, rather than before, as Bede has it; Boniface's letter to Edwin and Æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers, but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{conditions}} of parole is that Max finds a job. At the employment agency, he meets Jenny Mercer (Theresa Russell), who helps him land scale-wage work at a can factory. Jenny accepts his invitation to dinner, where <b>it's</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is smitten by this worldly and seemingly gentle ex-con.|$|R

5|$|With both of {{the leading}} {{candidates}} now discounted, Princess Victoria suggested Prince Louis of Hesse, a minor German royal, the nephew of the Grand Duke of Hesse. Princess Victoria {{had gone to the}} court of Hesse to inspect Louis's sister, Princess Anna, as a potential bride for her brother, the Prince of Wales. Although not favorably impressed with Princess Anna, she was impressed with Louis and his brother Prince Henry. Both were invited to Windsor Castle in 1860, ostensibly so they could watch the Ascot Races in the company of the royal family, but in reality, the visit was a chance for the Queen to inspect her potential son-in-law. The Queen admired both Louis and Henry, but noted how well Louis and Alice got along together. When the Hessian family departed, Louis requested Alice's photograph, and Alice made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was attracted to him.|$|E
5|$|Toyah argues with Leanne's half-sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley), for not {{passing on}} a message about {{starting}} a {{shift at the}} pub, but they agree to call a truce. Peter leaves cigarettes at Leanne's flat and Toyah tries to take the blame but Simon is forced to cover for her. Simon later tells Eva who blackmails Toyah: stop Peter from shutting down Aidan Connor's (Shayne Ward) factory or Eva will tell Leanne about Peter and Toyah. Peter agrees to Eva's demands and they continue their affair. Toby returns in January 2017 and demands Toyah sign a paper to destroy their frozen embryos. Toyah is reluctant and after a heart to heart, they kiss. However, Toyah makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> doesn't love Toby and is staying with Peter, causing Toby to lash out and leave. Peter learns what has happened and decides to drop off Chloe Tipton (Jo-Anne Knowles), making Toyah jealous. They later make up and Leanne catches Peter and Toyah kissing. During a heated argument, Leanne disowns Toyah and refuses {{to talk to her}} again, despite her efforts. Leanne forgives Toyah after she helps deliver baby Oliver in a lift after it breaks down.|$|E
5|$|Paul meets an old friend, Kim Taylor (Jenny Young), and learns he is {{the father}} of her sons David (Takaya Honda) and Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Paul and Kim manage to stop Amy and Leo from consummating their relationship. David bonds with Paul soon after, {{although}} Leo stays away from him due to their business rivalry, but eventually comes to accept Paul as his father. Paul tries to pursue a relationship with Terese, but she rejects him and later gets engaged to Gary. After receiving compensation from the Quill group, Paul buys and moves back into the Lassiter's Penthouse, with Amy and Jimmy. Terese confides in Paul that she has breast cancer, and he does his best to support her. However, once it is obvious that her chemotherapy is not working, Terese visits her brother Nick in prison, who is later granted bail with the help of Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine), much to Paul's chagrin. Paul soon learns that Amy and Nick are dating. In addition, Paul and Leo are bought out of Robinsons after Amy encourages Steph to help Nick set up a wellness centre in the premises. Paul and Terese have sex, but she chooses to stay with Gary. After attempting to give Nick money to leave town, Paul frames him by having someone plant stolen medication in Nick's hotel room, resulting in his parole being revoked. Amy is furious to discover that Paul has set Nick up, and when Paul does not confess his crime to the police, she and Jimmy move back into No. 26. After Terese makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and Paul will never be in a relationship, and Amy refuses to move back into the penthouse, Paul decides to leave Erinsborough for a few weeks supposedly to visit his family in New York City, but David reveals that Paul never arrived. Paul returns a few weeks later and reveals he is engaged to Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). He also buys Mr Udagawa's (Lawrence Mah) share of Lassiters making him Terese's boss.|$|E

50|$|Later that evening, Jean returns. Agnès' mother {{warns that}} the girl's heart is weak and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could die. Jean walks into the room, stone-faced.

Agnès sighs, and appears to stop breathing. Jean is filled with love for her and begs her {{to be strong and}} to hang on to life.

25|$|Parnok's {{last great}} love was the Georgian physicist, Nina Vedeneyeva. The two may have met {{as early as}} 1927, through Tsuberbiller, a {{colleague}} of Vedeneyeva. Vedeneyeva's son, Yevgeny, was living in exile {{at that time and}} Tsuberbiller, who had written a textbook used for decades in the high schools of Russia, helped her obtain books for him to maintain his studies. In January, 1932, the relationship turned to romance, despite the facts that Parnok was still living with Tsuberbiller and Yevgeny disapproved of the relationship. As had happened before, her lover became her muse, inspiring her to write two cycles of poems, Ursa Major and Useless Goods. The frantic pace of her writing foretold the exhaustion she would suffer, which hastened her death, but Parnok was aware of the consequences. The references between these last two cycles and Parnok's adolescent poetry, make <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had always known what she wanted to say, but until she reached her maturity, she {{did not know how to}} express her words. Their emotional bond, which accelerated after a trip to Vedeneyeva's summer cottage in Kashin in April, was destined to remain hidden from most of Vedeneyeva's family and friends. To keep up appearance of a mere friendship, they spent their summers apart.|$|E

25|$|Carol Ferris {{is first}} {{introduced}} in S.O.S. Green Lantern!, which ran in Showcase vol. 1, issue #22 (October 1959). In her original appearance, Hal Jordan becomes employed at Ferris Aircraft and (after {{asking her to}} dinner) she makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> does not date employees. However, she {{would go on to}} play an on and off romantic role in his life. She first appears as the second Star Sapphire in Green Lantern vol. 2, #16 (October 1962). As Star Sapphire, she battles Green Lantern for many years, because the Zamarons want to prove men are inferior. When she is first defeated by him they take away her memory of the event, but the persona keeps resurfacing. When Jordan becomes the Spectre, he removes the Star Sapphire persona from Ferris. While seeking to inhabit the body that Jordan most desires, the Star Sapphire gem again possesses her for a brief period during the Mystery of the Star Sapphire story line. Her reunion with the Star Sapphire entity is short, however, as it soon learns that Jordan most desires Jillian Pearlman and as a result abandons Ferris. Though she no longer holds the singular position of Star Sapphire, in Green Lantern vol. 4 issue #38 (March 2009), she receives a violet power ring sent to her by the Zamarons. It attaches itself to her, and she leaves for Zamaron to be inducted {{as a member of the}} Star Sapphire Corps.
