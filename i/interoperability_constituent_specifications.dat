40|$|Proceedings of the 3 rd ACM/IEEE International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems at ICSE 2015, Florence, ItalyCurrently, software-intensive {{systems have}} become larger and complex, {{resulting}} from the interoperability of several sometimes distributed, independent systems so that emergent, broader missions can be performed. So referred as Systems-of-Systems (SoS), this new class of systems has emerged in special in critical application domains. In another perspective, reference architecture is a special type of software architecture that has provided a considerable support to the development, evolution, and also standardization of systems of given application domains. Considering their usefulness, reference architectures are even more important to SoS {{than they have been}} today, by making it possible to mainly promote <b>interoperability</b> among <b>constituent</b> systems of SoS. Adequate interoperability in SoS has been still a great challenge to the community. In this scenario, this foreword arises challenges in this new research topic of reference architectures for SoS. As a result, we intend to open a discussion around SoS and reference architectures and research lines as well...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSystems-of-Systems (SoS) {{are formed}} by {{independent}} systems termed as constituents. SoS exhibit dynamic properties called emergent behaviors, {{which are a}} global functionality that appears {{as a result of}} the <b>interoperability</b> among <b>constituents.</b> However,software architecture descriptions of SoS are often static. In turn, dynamic models such as simulation models (also adopted to specify SoS) do not use to preserve software architecture details, which can hamper the software quality. In this paper, we propose a modeltransformation approach to harmonize software architecture descriptions of SoS and simulation models to support validation ofemergent behaviors. We model a software architecture of SoS by the adoption of SosADL, a novel architectural description language(ADL) for SoS, and transform it to DEVS, a formalism for simulation of SoS. Our approach offers a dynamic view to architectural descriptions of SoS, preserving the architectural integrity of the SoS, and supporting the visualization and validation of emergent behaviors. We evaluate our proposal through a case study conducted within the context of a real SoS in operation for flood monitoring in an urban area. Preliminary results show that the transformation is feasible, generating functional simulation models that support the validation of emergent behaviors...|$|R
40|$|A System of Systems (SoS) is a {{group of}} {{independent}} constituent systems that by their interactions together deliver an emerging capability on which reliance is placed. In the UK Ministry of Defence Land domain, the appetite for uncertainty caused by SoS dependencies is particularly low. Dependability and assurance are therefore vital, both in the integration and <b>interoperability</b> of individual <b>constituent</b> systems, and {{at the level of the}} SoS as a whole. This paper presents the findings from a study, asking whether model-based engineering technologies could potentially deliver a pragmatic method for Land Open Systems Architecture (LOSA) SoS verification and assurance. We conclude that existing model-based SoS and Cyber-Physical Systems engineering techniques could potentially deliver a basis for LOSA SoS requirement engineering, design, verification and assurance. However, the techniques studied are at varying levels of maturity and therefore we identify areas of future work that could inform the ongoing research and experimentation programmes for LOSA and others across defence...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} aspect and differentiator of a System of Systems (SoS) {{versus a}} single monolithic system is <b>interoperability</b> among the <b>constituent</b> disparate systems. A major application of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to SoS Engineering is to facilitate system integration {{in a manner}} that helps to cope with such interoperability problems. A case in point is the integration infrastructure offered by the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) and its Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). In this paper, we discuss a process called DEVS Unified Process (DUNIP) that uses the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism as a basis for integrated system engineering and testing called the Bifurcated Model-Continuity lifecycle development methodology. DUNIP uses an XMLbased DEVS Modeling Language (DEVSML) framework that provides the capability to compose models that may be expressed in a variety of DEVS implementation languages. The models are deployable for remote and distributed real-time executing agents over the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) middleware. We also compare DUNIP with the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm and provide overview of various projects that led to the formulation of DUNIP. 1...|$|R
40|$|Currently, Systems-of-Systems (SoS) have {{performed}} {{an important role}} in diverse application domains, with representative examples in airport, military, and smart-cities, including crisis/emergency management. SoS refer to complex software-intensive systems, resulted from <b>interoperability</b> of independent <b>constituent</b> systems, performing new missions that could not be performed by any constituents working separately. For these critical systems, their quality is undoubtedly essential. However, in general, {{there is a lack of}} studies that discuss how quality has been addressed in such systems. The main contribution of this paper is to present an experience of establishing a quality model (i. e., a set of quality characteristics/attributes, subcharacteristics, and metrics) for SoS, in particular, for the crisis/emergent management domain. This quality model is based on ISO/IEC 25010 and it has also proved to be an important support to evaluate a system of this domain, however their construction must be performed with caution. Experience such as presented in this work could be repeated in other domains, contributing to improve the quality of a diversity of critical, complex SoS that are currently being built...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Following the {{emergency}} of multi-level, complex and distributed information systems, the traditional RBAC model {{becomes more and}} more weak and incompetent. Currently, the research of RBAC model mainly focused on building a suitable role hierarchy, although played a certain effect it still have many problems. Through the research aiming at organizations and their characters, we believe that the reasons that cause the present problems are due to the conflict in working patterns between the RBAC model and the physical world. Thus, we propose a new access control method-Organization Based Access Control Method and the specific model-OB 4 LAC model. This article analyzes the <b>constituent</b> members, formal <b>specification,</b> sub-models UPA, PORA, PERA and RRA of OB 4 LAC, and also gives the specific process in access operations and business collaboration among multi-organizations. Through the test in many complex E-government systems, OB 4 LAC model achieves good results...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates means used {{to extract}} {{embedded}} specifications of printing layout in a document when handled {{as an image}} rather than to recognize its characters and word <b>constituents.</b> These <b>specifications</b> are manifested by the most significant attributes frequently found in page printouts like advertisements, conference proceedings and magazines. The commonly used tools for printing document are word processors, provided by different software packages along with operating systems for PCS, like MS Windows and Mackintosh. Most of the supported packages in addition to Win Word specify the significant attributes of document formats to fall into font and paragraph design. Font design includes type, size and style characteristics. Moreover, line spacing and inter-character gaps provide another important attributes of paragraph specifications. These attributes were extracted, analyzed and exploited in this study {{with the aim of}} constructing the proposed publisher identification system. A three stage software scheme is proposed that consists of paragraph layout and font layout detection algorithms based on statistical measures followed by feed forward neural network identifier. This technique is implemented as a tool for the overall analysis and investigations. Several experiments have been conducted to validate the procedure of the designed system. The system achieved 95 % successful publisher identification. This identification inaccuracy {{can be attributed to the}} poor quality of printing in addition to the effect of noise. Hence, it can be considered as acceptable performance measure for detection and identification purposes once bad quality printed samples are excluded...|$|R
40|$|Smart systems, such {{as smart}} cities, smart buildings, and {{autonomous}} cars, have recently gained increasing popularity. Each such system {{is essentially a}} System-of-Systems (SoS). SoS are dynamically established as alliances among independent and heterogeneous software systems to offer complex functionalities {{as a result of}} <b>constituents</b> <b>interoperability.</b> An SoS often supports critical application domains, and, as such, must be reliable. Many SoS have been specified and evaluated for their correct operation using static models. However, speciï¬ cation languages have not supported to capture their inherent dynamic nature nor enabled to monitor their operation. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} present ASAS, an approach to Automatically generate Simulation models for smArt Systems (ASAS) in order to support evaluation of their operation. In particular, our approach makes it possible to transform formal models of the SoS architecture (expressed in SoSADL) into simulation models (expressed in DEVS). We evaluated our approach by conducting two case studies using a ï¬‚ood monitoring system that is intended to be part of a smart city. Results indicate that ASAS can successfully generate functional simulations for the SoS operation, which in turn can enable to reason and monitor an SoS operation, taking into account its dynamic nature...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1992 Although {{there are}} too many {{applicants}} for the number of posts available in radiography courses, the standard of the applicants has not improved and the rates of attrition have not decreased. The problem was investigated against the background of South Africa and the 21 st century, with particular reference to manpower needs, demography, population trends, education, health and the economy. An attempt was, therefore, made to provide recommendations to improve the situation in radiography. Before the research was conducted, the background of radiography, pertaining to South Africa was sketched. Reference was made to the various international organisations which had contributed {{to the development of the}} profession of radiography in this country. The position of the technikons, as tertiary education institutions was highlighted and their relation to radiography training mentioned. To understand the close liaison between the technikons and the employers of student radiographers, the present position of radiography as a vocation and as a profession, and of radiographers as professionals, was discussed. This included the concept of co-operative education and experiential training. The significance of technology versus human beings, and of its relevance to education, radiography and science was explored to illustrate the background for which procurement and selection must be made. Principles of procurement relevant to radiography were then discussed. Particular mention Was made of the need for a job analysis and its <b>constituent</b> description and <b>specifications</b> regarding selection of students...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to develop a novel package plant using available process technologies that would be competitive in the domestic waste water treatment market. A market analysis identified the business opportunity for Balmoral Tanks to develop a package plant with higher treatment capability than its current product. A customer survey and a review of Regulatory standards provided valuable input into the design considerations for the package plant. A review of available process technologies and materials of construction resulted in the selection of a Moving Bed Biolm Reactor (MBBR) process and High Density Polyethylene material as the optimum design basis for the package plant. A detailed design exercise scoped out and specified all the components of the MBBR package plant. A four month duration programme for testing the prototype at Cranfield University facilities was devised which satisfactorily simulated typical domestic wastewater treatment operating conditions. Test rig problems associated with very low ambient temperatures were experienced {{in the early stages of}} testing and were identified and resolved. The prototype package plant unit subsequently operated satisfactorily and the performance was demonstrated to meet all the wastewater <b>constituent</b> removal design <b>specifications.</b> The MBBR process performance was shown to be consistent with published findings of other researchers. Novel fabrication methods developed by Balmoral Tanks resulted in the cost of the new MBBR package plant being only 3 % higher than that of Balmoral Tanks current lower specification product. The new MBBR package plant is shown to be a potentially very marketable domestic wastewater treatment product...|$|R
30|$|Listing 1 {{shows an}} excerpt of a code in SoSADL that depicts part of the {{specification}} of one constituent: in this case, a sensor Additional file  1. Some parts are hidden {{because they do not}} influence in the derivation of stimuli generation. It is possible to see, for example, that the gate energy offers two environment connections (lines 12 and 13): one to receive a threshold (a limit of energy that is considered enough to keep the sensor in operation), and power, which is used to receive the level of battery available. A connection in SoSADL has a name and a data type that can be transferred through that communication channel. Then, when a connection is specified with the environment modifier, it actually models what is expected to be received from the environment and the data type expected. Each type of constituent requires a different stimuli generator. Then, such architectural model is used as an input for a model transformation that collects the set of environment connections, extracting the data type, and creating one respective output state transition for each one of them. These state transitions are assembled in sequence to form an entire state diagram that will drive the stimuli generator operation. Then, each state transition will deliver one of the expected data to the correspondent <b>constituent</b> whose architectural <b>specification</b> model was used to create that stimuli generator. Each stimuli generator is associated to a data flow that receives data from a textual file. That file holds the data that feeds the constituent. Then, these data are read from the text file and sent to the constituent, triggering the simulation to run. This happens in a periodic and constant rhythm so as to keep the simulation running.|$|R
