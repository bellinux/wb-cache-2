The evidence suggests that country-specific laws and regulations affect the composition of boards of banks mainly through requirements for director independence. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} mainly {{compares the}} operational risk <b>in</b> <b>banks</b> of the United Kingdom (UK hereafter) and China {{by measuring the}} operational risk and estimating the firm-specific and macroeconomic determinants of operational risk in both the UK and China separately. Four main findings are concluded from the comparison of operational risk <b>in</b> <b>banks</b> of the UK and China. It suggests that larger banks with better profitability, less solvency risk, less growth opportunity, better efficiency and greater numbers of employees would prepare more capital to operational risk <b>in</b> <b>banks</b> of the UK. By contrast, in China, a larger sized bank with a better liquidity position and more staff settings would require more capital for operational risk in China. It also implies that <b>banks</b> <b>in</b> the UK {{are more likely to}} be affected by the status of internal control management. In addition, operational risk <b>in</b> Chinese <b>banks</b> is more significantly affected by the number of employees when compared with UK banks. Additionally, the more significant relationship between regulatory capital of operational risk and the liquidity <b>in</b> Chinese <b>banks</b> suggests that the operational risk management might be able to be improved by enhancing the liquidity management <b>in</b> Chinese <b>banks.</b> With regard to the macroeconomic factors, as well as the final findings, this indicates that operational risk <b>in</b> Chinese <b>banks</b> is more likely to be impacted by macroeconomic factors than <b>in</b> UK <b>banks.</b> These findings highlight the differences between operational risk <b>in</b> UK <b>banks</b> and Chinese banks, as well as the role of each determinant played in improving operational risk <b>in</b> <b>banks</b> of each country...|$|R
5|$|The best {{hockey players}} on {{their high school}} team, Ross and the Patrick {{brothers}} were invited to play occasional games for local league teams in Montreal. Ross first played in an organized league in 1905, joining Montreal Westmount of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL), the top amateur league in Canada. He scored ten goals in eight games during the season. His opponents regarded {{him as one of}} the best rushing defencemen. Most defenders at the time either shot the puck down the ice or passed to a forward; in contrast, Ross skated up the ice, taking the puck into the offensive zone. Later that year, wishing to pursue a career <b>in</b> <b>banking,</b> he moved to Brandon, Manitoba, where he joined the Brandon Elks of the Manitoba Hockey League, the senior league in the province. In 1906, his first season, he scored six goals in seven games while he recorded six goals in ten games in 1907. Around this time, the Kenora Thistles, the Manitoba League champions, wanted to strengthen their team for the Stanley Cup challenge against the Montreal Wanderers in Montreal during January 1907. They paid Ross $1,000 to play both matches, a common practice at the time, and the Thistles won the Cup. While failing to score, Ross started many plays and proved an important part of the team. Although he played for the opposing team, he received a good reception from the Montreal crowd. Ross did not play for the Thistles when the two teams played for the Cup again in March, which the Wanderers won to take back the Cup.|$|E
5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency <b>in</b> <b>banking</b> regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E
