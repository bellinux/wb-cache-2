5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E

He happily leaves and returns home before his curfew. However, upon reviewing the photos, he discovers they are unfortunately unusable. Meanwhile, Dr. Curt Connors injects himself with an experimental serum, in an attempt to regrow his missing arm, before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> Later, he awakens to discover his arm has indeed regrown. His wife, Martha, is furious that he experimented on himself without her knowledge, but softens upon seeing their son's reaction.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{was known}} for his busy working hours, often only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at 3 or 4 a.m. He {{preferred}} to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand in negotiations. He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love of guns, and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E

5|$|Late one night, Ashley (Ashley Ryder)– a {{young man}} with a childlike mentality– arrives at the caravan home of his Uncle David (David Hoyle) on the Isle of Sheppey. Ashley confides in his uncle that his mother has been {{physically}} abusing him by stubbing cigarettes out on his hand. David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> together. The next morning, they awake and have breakfast in bed before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy nuclear family. Going to a local café and then a park bench, David continues to explain his anti-establishment opinions about society. Ashley reveals that he wants to die, and the two express their love for one another.|$|E
5|$|Queen Adelaide {{attended}} the dying William devotedly, not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> herself {{for more than}} ten days. William IV died {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle, where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria of Kent, the only child of Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, George III's fourth son. Under Salic Law, a woman could not rule Hanover, and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III's fifth son, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. William's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan. Although William IV is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family with Mrs. Jordan, including former Prime Minister David Cameron, TV presenter Adam Hart-Davis, author and statesman Duff Cooper, and the first Duke of Fife, who married Queen Victoria's granddaughter Louise.|$|E

This figure represents a slight increase from 16. 6 % in 2006. More boys (22. 4 %) report that they go <b>to</b> school or <b>bed</b> hungry than girls (19. 3 %). More children in the 10 - 11 year old age group report <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school or <b>bed</b> hungry at 26. 8 %, which is an increase from 18. 3 % in 2006. Children who report <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school or <b>bed</b> hungry are less likely to report excellent health and feeling very happy about their lives.

25|$|A {{formerly}} popular treatment, {{phase delay}} chronotherapy, {{is intended to}} reset the circadian clock by manipulating bedtimes. It consists of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> two or more hours later each day for several days until the desired bedtime is reached, and it often must be repeated every few weeks or months to maintain results. Its safety is uncertain, notably because {{it has led to}} the development of non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder, a much more severe disorder.|$|E
25|$|Today, many humans {{wake up with}} {{an alarm}} clock. (Some people, however, can {{reliably}} wake themselves up at a specific time with no need for an alarm.) Many sleep quite differently on workdays versus days off, a pattern {{which can lead to}} chronic circadian desynchronization. Many people regularly look at television and other screens before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> a factor which may exacerbate this mass circadian disruption. Scientific studies on sleep have shown that sleep stage at awakening {{is an important factor in}} amplifying sleep inertia.|$|E
25|$|In central Serbia, {{once the}} {{household}} members {{have gone to}} bed, an elderly woman of the family sticks a knife into the house door from the inside. Alternatively, she puts a hawthorn stake by the door, hanging a wreath of garlic on it. This is done as a protection against curses, witches, and demons. For the same reason, children are rubbed with garlic on the palms, armpits, and soles before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> In some regions, the men keep watch in shifts by the fireplace during the night, to keep the fire burning.|$|E

25|$|Impermanence is {{a strong}} theme in {{traditional}} Japanese dwellings. The size of rooms can be altered by interior sliding walls or screens, the already mentioned shōji. Cupboards built smoothly into the wall hide futon, mattresses pulled out before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> allowing more space to be available during the day. The versatility of these dwellings becomes more apparent with changes of seasons. In summer, for example, exterior walls can be opened to bring the garden and cooling breezes in. The minimal decoration also alters seasonally, with a different scroll hanging or new flower arrangement.|$|E
