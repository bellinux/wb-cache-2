40|$|As a {{first step}} towards the {{development}} of a high field Nb{sub 3 }Sn superconducting dipole for a Very Large Hadron Collider (VLHC), a short mechanical model was built and tested at Fermilab. The aim of this work was to develop simpler fabrication techniques and test new structural materials to use in the dipole model. The coil design was based on a two-layer cos({theta}) approach. The end parts were designed using ROXIE magnet optimization program and manufactured using a 6 -axis EDM machine. The two layers of each <b>half-coil</b> were wound using one piece of cable without any interlayer splices. After winding, a ceramic matrix was applied to the each <b>half-coil</b> and the coil was cured under compression at 150 C. The two half-coils were then assembled together in a reaction fixture for heat treatment at 450 C for 8 hours. After reaction, the coils were placed in a curing fixture for epoxy impregnation. Finally some mechanical and electrical tests were performed after which the coils were sectioned to check the cable positioning and impregnation quality. This paper summarizes the results and experience obtained from the mechanical model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{analysis}} and comparation of the <b>half-coiled</b> short-pitch windings with different phase belt {{are presented in}} the paper. The <b>half-coiled</b> short-pitch windings can supply the odd and even harmonics simultaneously, which can be applied in multiphase bearingless motor (MBLM). The space harmonic distribution of the <b>half-coiled</b> short-pitch windings with two kinds of phase belt is studied wi th respect to different coil pitch, and the suitable coil pitch can be selected from the analysis results to reduce the additional radial force and torque pulse. The two kinds of <b>half-coiled</b> short-pitch windings are applied to the five- and six-phase bearingless motor, and the comparation from the Finite Element Method (FEM) results shows that the winding with 2 π/m phase belt is fit for the five phase bearingless motor and the winding with π/m phase belt is suitable for the six phase bearingless motor. Finally, a five phase surface-mounted permanent magnet (PM) bearingless motor is built and the experimental results are presented to verify the validity and feasibility of the analysis. The results {{presented in this paper}} will give useful guidelines for design optimization of the MBLM...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the design and}} magnetic field models of the MBG main bending dipole for the &# 8220;CERN Neutrino to Gran Sasso&# 8221; transfer line TT 41. The MBG are resistive iron-dominated H-type magnets of 37 mm gap height and 6. 3 m core length. A coil composed of two <b>half-coils</b> of 6 1 / 2 turns each will allow for two-way series connection of the entire dipole line without external return bus-bars. The core consists of 1 mm thick low carbon steel laminations with organic insulation coating, precision punched and stacked between massive end and angular plates...|$|R
40|$|All MBI bending magnets {{in each of}} the two LHC {{injection}} {{transfer lines}} will be powered in series. The limited output voltage of existing power converters lead to an unusual coil design avoiding external return bus-bars by combining two overlapping <b>half-coils,</b> electrically separated, with 3 1 / 2 turns each in a monolithic structure. The voltage between turns in one coil can reach up-to 3. 6 kV. The coil has been designed with particular care for obtaining high interturn and ground insulation. Flux-free soldering of connections with plug-in cone sleeves is applied, allowing to execute water cooled current connections as prolongation of the coil conductor. Epoxy compound polymerization in the impregnation mould is obtained by passing overheated water in regulated cycles through the water circuit of the coil conductor. We describe the design basics as well as various test results of pre-series and series produced coils. (4 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new way}} of generalizing Hilbert’s two-dimensional space-filling curve to arbitrary dimensions. The new curves, called harmonious Hilbert curves, have the unique property that for any d ′ < d, the d-dimensional curve is compatible with the d′-dimensional curve with respect to the order in which the curves visit the points of any d′-dimensional axis-parallel space that contains the origin. Similar generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are described for several variants of Peano’s curve (the original Peano curve, the coil curve, the <b>half-coil</b> curve, and the Meurthe curve). The d-dimensional harmonious Hilbert curves and the Meurthe curves have neutral orientation: as compared to the curve as a whole, arbitrary pieces of the curve have each of d! possible rotations with equal probability. Thus one could say these curves are ‘statistically invariant ’ under rotation—unlike the Peano curves, the coil curves, the <b>half-coil</b> curves, and the familiar generalization of Hilbert curves by Butz and Moore. In addition, prompted by an application in the construction of R-trees, this paper shows how to construct a 2 d-dimensional generalized Hilbert or Peano curve that traverses the points of a certain d-dimensional diagonally placed subspace in the order of a given d-dimensional generalized Hilbert or Peano curve. Pseudocode is provided for comparison operators based on the curves presented in this paper. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Fermilab High Field Magnet (HFM) R and D {{project is}} to explore various designs and {{production}} technology of a high-field, low-cost Nb{sub 3 }Sn accelerator magnet suitable for a future Very Large Hadron Collider (VLHC). The model under fabrication consists of two-layer shell-type coil with 43. 5 mm aperture and cold iron yoke. Fermilab concept of magnet design and fabrication technology involves some specific features such as curing of <b>half-coil</b> with ceramic binder/matrix before reaction, and then simultaneous reaction and impregnation of both half-coils to get a coil pipe structure. The coil pipe is mechanically supported by the vertically-split iron yoke locked by two aluminum clamps and a thick stainless steel skin. 2 D finite element analysis has been performed to study and optimize the prestress in the coil and in the structural elements at room temperature and at 4. 2 K.

40|$|Unexpected {{ramp rate}} {{limitations}} (RRL) found in superconducting magnets {{during the development}} of magnet systems {{can be attributed to}} a current imbalance amongst the cabled strands which leads to a lower than expected quench current. In superconducting magnets the current distribution in the cable during ramping depends mainly on the electromagnetic properties of the system. A detailed analysis of principle causes for RRL phenomena was performed with a model for one half of the POLO coil considering the complete inductance matrix of the cable and the fact that all turns are mutually coupled. The main results of these calculations are that unequal contact resistances can not be responsible for RRL phenomena in coils with parameters comparable to those of the POLO coil and that already minor geometrical disturbances in the cable structure can lead to major and lasting imbalances in the current distribution of cables with insulated and non-insulated strands. During the POLO experiment the <b>half-coil</b> model was employed to get {{a better understanding of the}} measured compensated subcable voltages during quench. The good agreement of the calculated and measured results demonstrates the validity of the model for RRL analyses. (orig.) 27 refs.

40|$|The RFX {{toroidal}} {{field winding}} consists of 48 coils, {{which can be}} connected in many series/parallel configurations according to the toroidal field programming required for plasma operation. For ease of maintenance each coil consists of two identical <b>half-coils</b> connected at the equatorial plane of the machine. To be in alignment, the half coils are placed into grooves machined in an aluminum shell, which also has the function of withstanding the overturning moment caused by to {{the interaction between the}} current and the poloidal field. Stainless-steel clamping belts are provided around the coils to withstand their electromagnetic expansion forces and to keep them in the grooves. Thermal expansion of the half coils takes place freely along the grooves, due to thin layers of low-friction material placed on the coil surfaces. The demountable joints which connect the conductors of the half coils are designed to allow thermal expansion. Two basic alternative solutions considered for the electric contacts are discussed: the first based on a multicontact plug-in system, the second on bolted joints...|$|R
40|$|A new microsporidian species, Euplotespora binucleata n. gen., n. sp., {{from the}} brackish-water ciliate Euplotes woodruffi is {{described}} and defined {{on the basis}} of life history characteristics, light and electron microscopic features, and small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing. The life cycle of E. binucleata n. sp. probably has rather short merogonic and relatively long sporogonic phases. Some uninuclear meronts and sporonts, along with diplokaryotic sporoblasts and spores, were found in experimentally infected host cells. Such a peculiar life cycle has been induced experimentally in Euplotes eurystomus and constitutively microsporidianfree stocks of E. woodruffi. Spores of E. binucleata n. sp. are monomorphic, ovoid–cylindrical in shape, 3. 44 0. 17 1. 65 0. 22 mm in size, and characterized by a diplokaryotic condition and a large posterior vacuole. The polar tube is isofilar, 4. 5 – 5. 5 mm in length when ejected, and lacking a distinctive coiled region (<b>half-coiled).</b> The polaroplast is divided into two regions: the anterior part has a few lamellae close to the anchoring disc; and the posterior part is a rounded body (sack), about one-quarter of the spore length. Spores do not appear to cluster together as a group. Each spore is surrounded by a sporophorous membrane closely adjacent to the exospore layer. A phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA sequences by different methods placed E. binucleata n. sp. in a clade with representatives of the microsporidian genera Cystosporogenes and Vittaforma. Observations of microsporidia in several other ciliates are discussed in view of the microsporidian infection frequency in the phylum Ciliophora...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} sixteen {{different ways to}} traverse d-dimensional space recursively {{in a way that}} is well-defined for any number of dimensions. Each of these traversals has distinct properties that may be beneficial for certain applications. Some of the traversals are novel, some have been known in principle but had not been described adequately for any number of dimensions, some of the traversals have been known. This article is the first to present them all in a consistent notation system. Furthermore, with this article, tools are provided to enumerate points in a regular grid in the order in which they are visited by each traversal. In particular, we cover: five discontinuous traversals based on subdividing cubes into 2 ^d subcubes: Z-traversal (Morton indexing), U-traversal, Gray-code traversal, Double-Gray-code traversal, and Inside-out traversal; two discontinuous traversals based on subdividing simplices into 2 ^d subsimplices: the Hill-Z traversal and the Maehara-reflected traversal; five continuous traversals based on subdividing cubes into 2 ^d subcubes: the Base-camp Hilbert curve, the Harmonious Hilbert curve, the Alfa Hilbert curve, the Beta Hilbert curve, and the Butz-Hilbert curve; four continuous traversals based on subdividing cubes into 3 ^d subcubes: the Peano curve, the Coil curve, the <b>Half-coil</b> curve, and the Meurthe curve. All of these traversals are self-similar in the sense that the traversal in each of the subcubes or subsimplices of a cube or simplex, on any level of recursive subdivision, can be obtained by scaling, translating, rotating, reflecting and/or reversing the traversal of the complete unit cube or simplex.
