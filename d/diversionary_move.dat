50|$|The next attack {{would be}} the {{following}} day, 11 November. The plan called for three attacks. Combat Group Bravo would keep 21 and 59 Brigades engaged while Combat Group Alpha would engage 16 Brigade positions from the north-east, drawing the tanks away in a <b>diversionary</b> <b>move.</b> It would then become the SADF reserve and Charlie would lead the main attack from the south.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>diversionary</b> <b>move</b> of his own, Steele ordered Thayer's Frontier Division {{to make a}} feint toward Washington, thereby {{drawing the}} enemy into a fight south of the prairie, while {{the main part of}} the Union force rapidly {{diverted}} eastward on the Camden Road. Thayer's action was quickly discovered, however, enticing the Confederates into a rear guard action at the hamlet of Moscow, on the southeast edge of the prairie. Steele's main force, meanwhile, proceeded into Camden and seized the city with minimal opposition, only to find meager supplies and confirmation of Banks' defeat on the Red River.|$|E

5000|$|As the German {{offensive}} {{came to a}} halt {{around the}} Marne in early July, more fighting took place around Villers-Bretonneux, as part of <b>diversionary</b> <b>moves</b> by Australian forces, acting in support of the Battle of Hamel. Corporal Walter Brown, of the 20th Australian Battalion, received the Victoria Cross for his actions. Later in the month, the area around Villers-Bretonneux saw more fighting when the 25th Battalion and 26th Battalion of the 7th Australian Brigade attacked around Monument Wood; for his actions during the assault and German counter-attack, Lieutenant Albert Borella of the 26th Battalion later received the Victoria Cross. After the Anzac Day counter-attack, British and French commanders lavished praise upon the Australian soldiers who took part. Brigadier-General George Grogan, a witness, later wrote that it was [...] "perhaps the greatest individual feat of the war" [...] for troops to attack at night, across unfamiliar ground at short notice and with no artillery preparation.|$|R

50|$|Having been {{promoted}} to lieutenant general, Aylmer {{was put in charge}} of the first effort to end the siege of Kut. General Aylmer was in command of the Tigris Corps, consisting of the 7th (Meerut) Division, the 12th Indian Division, {{and a number of other}} smaller military units. All told he had more than 20,000 men. They left Basra in late December 1915 and arrived at Sheikh Sa'ad on 3 January 1916. While the 12th Indian Division (under command of General George Gorringe) made a <b>diversionary</b> <b>move</b> near Nasiriyeh, the 7th (under the command of General Younghusband) staged a direct assault on the Ottoman positions on 6 January (the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad). After two days of fighting, the Ottoman army withdrew. The British sustained approximately 4,000 casualties - much more than the medical units could cope with. The Ottoman troops, under the generalship of Baron von der Goltz only withdrew some six miles up river and occupied another defensive position near the edge of the Suwaikiya Marshes. A British assault on this position on 13 January was partially successful, the position was carried but again with significant losses (some 1,600 casualties) (the Battle of Wadi).|$|E

50|$|When tunnels {{are closed}} due to maintenance, an {{accident}} or some other obstruction, the trolleys can be diverted onto auxiliary surface tracks west of the 40th Street Portal connecting all five lines. Southbound tracks start along 40th Street {{at the intersection of}} Lancaster Avenue, which is occupied by the SEPTA Route 10 line. At Market Street, the line connects to the 40th Street MFL Subway Station. They continue southbound along reaching Spruce Street, where it splits either eastbound or westbound. Westbound tracks run to 42nd Street where they turn south to either Baltimore Avenue (SEPTA Route 34), Chester Avenue (SEPTA Route 13), or Woodland Avenue (SEPTA Routes 11 and 36).
