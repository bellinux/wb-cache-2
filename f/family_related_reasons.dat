On 21 March 2009 Vijay Mallya announced that Kevin Pietersen was replacing Rahul Dravid as the team captain for the 2009 season. [...] The reason given was Dravid's absence in the league due to <b>family</b> <b>related</b> <b>reasons.</b> However many suspect that the change in captaincy {{is the result of}} the poor performance of the team in the first season of the Indian Premier League. On 30 April 2009, Anil Kumble was named the captain of the team for the remaining games of the IPL Season 2, due to Kevin Pietersen's absence to play for England against the West Indies. Since then performance of Royal Challengers Bangalore has been instrumental and the turnaround has been superb. The challengers found great success under Kumble's leadership.|$|E

40|$|Abstact We present {{empirical}} evidence on gender disparities in wage returns to job tenure and experience. We {{find that the}} overall wage return on an extra year of labor market experience is lower for women than men. A decomposition analysis shows that the wage return to job tenure is substantially lower for women than men, and that the wage return to experience is higher for women than men. These gender differences are robust to various estimation procedures and are especially pronounced for more educated workers. We hypothesize that these observed gender disparities in wage returns are driven {{by the fact that}} women are less attached to their jobs than men. We present some supportive evidence for our hypothesis, namely, that {{women are more likely to}} quit their jobs, receive substantially fewer hours of company provided training, and a much higher fraction of women expect to not work at age 35 due to <b>family</b> <b>related</b> <b>reasons.</b> Gender Wage Gap Returns to Tenure Returns to Experience...|$|E

40|$|Students' {{absenteeism}} {{is high in}} Afghanistan. There {{are various}} reasons associated with boy and girl students' absenteeism. This research is conducted to collect the views of parents and teachers about reasons of boy and girl students' absenteeism in higher secondary classes of Kabul city schools; it also explores the various strategies used by parents and teachers to improve students' attendance. Data was collected through a questionnaire in 10 schools. 83 % teachers and 95 % parents replied to the questions, the collected data was then categorized and presented for schools, parents, teachers, girls and boys. Absenteeism more likely affects academic achievements of students, causes disintegration from school life and drop out from school in severe cases.   Findings of the study show that there are various financial, environmental, cultural and family related factors that hinder students' attendance, but girl students' attendance is particularly affected by cultural and <b>family</b> <b>related</b> <b>reasons</b> while boy students' attendance is affected by lack of motivation, bullying and weak school regulations. Despite higher absenteeism, it is good indication that parents and teachers have taken up some strategies to reduce students' absenteeism. Educated parents are more tolerant and supportive of their girls' education and likewise qualified teacher deal more professionally on tackling students' absenteeism. Government has established parents' shuras (councils) in schools but a robust coordination and support system needs to be established among Government, parents and teachers to improve both girl and boy students' attendance in schools.

40|$|This is {{the first}} report of the {{efficacy}} of anti-TNFalpha treatment in a patient with lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension associated with advanced systemic sclerosis, refractory to conventional therapies. The patient was treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg) and methotrexate (10 mg/week) for 1 year. After 6 months of therapy, the echocardiogram showed a reduction in pulmonary pressure, confirmed after 1 year. During treatment, the patient's quality of life improved significantly and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, lung function tests and blood gas analysis remained stable. After 1 year, the patient decided to stop infliximab therapy (for <b>family</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>related</b> to the distance to our hospital). Lung function tests, pulmonary arterial pressures and blood gas analysis progressively worsened and the patient died 11 months later. Few open-label {{studies have been conducted}} on the efficacy of anti-TNFalpha therapy in patients with systemic sclerosis. Here we report our experience in a case of systemic sclerosis complicated by pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension. Infliximab treatment seemed effective, suggesting that controlled randomized trials to evaluate infliximab efficacy in these patients and to compare infliximab with other anti-TNFalpha treatments would be worthwhile...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to create a more complex and {{holistic}} understanding of the value system of the political consumer. A case study was undertaken were the unit of analysis constituted 12 high users of organic food products. The empirical data was analysed by utilizing Reynolds and Gutman’s laddering technique. The results revealed that the purposive selected informants activate different cognitive structures when buycotting organic food. In other words, the informants activate different values for similar attributes and consequences. This means that consumption of organic food is related to different value sets. That is, value sets where the political aspects are represented to different degrees. This means that some informants primarily buycott organic food for personal or <b>family</b> <b>related</b> <b>reasons.</b> For this group of informants, the focus is mainly on health related issues. Preservation of nature or environmental concern is important in the sense that it in the end relates to promoting personal security and health. This means that the environmental aspect cannot automatically be assumed to be a political motive when buycotting organic food, because it can be linked to personal motives. Understanding environmental issues solely as political motives thus reflects a rather mundane understanding. Further and more problematic it also leads to wrong results when trying to investigate the extent of political consumption from a positivistic paradigmatic posture. More specifically, survey studies will have a tendency to conclude that the phenomenon i. e. political consumption is much more prevalent than it actually is. The novel findings yield theoretical as well as practical implications. For practitioners a more comprehensive understanding of consumer values related to “politicized” products or services will enable companies to better understand consumers need and expectations. The latter being a necessity if confirmation of expectations, satisfaction, retention of customers and customer loyalty are goals of importance for the selling company.
