40|$|Developmental {{regulation}} of the neuroinflammatory responses to LPS and/or hypoxia-ischemia between preterm and term neonates: An experimental study Marie-Elsa Brochu †, Sylvie Girard †, Karine Lavoie and Guillaume Sébire * Background: Preterm and term newborns {{are at high risk}} of brain damage as well as subsequent cerebral palsy and learning disabilities. Indeed, hypoxia-ischemia (HI), pathogen exposures, and associated intracerebral increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines have all been linked to perinatal brain damage. However, the developmental <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> potential variations of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios remain unknown. Methods: Using rat models of perinatal brain damage induced by exposures to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or HI at distinct levels of maturity, we compared cytokine expression at stages of cerebral development equivalent to either preterm (postnatal day 1, P 1) or term (P 12) newborns. Results: At P 1, expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine within the brain was either not modulated (IL- 6, IL- 10) or down-regulated (IL- 1 ra, TGF-b 1) by HI, LPS or LPS+HI. In contrast, there was at P 12 an up-regulation <b>of</b> all <b>antiinflammator...</b>|$|R

40|$|Suppose that a {{sequence}} of treatments are assigned to influence an outcome of interest that occurs after the last treatment. Between treatments there exist time-dependent covariates that may be posttreatment variables of the earlier treatments and confounders of the subsequent treatments. In this article, we develop a parametric approach to inference <b>of</b> the causal <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the treatment sequence on the outcome called the sequential causal effect. We construct a point parametrization for the conditional distribution of an outcome given all treatments and time-dependent covariates, in which the point parameters of interest are the point <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments considered as single-point treatments. We (1) identify net <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments by point <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments, (2) express patterns <b>of</b> net <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments by constraints on point <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments, and (3) show that all sequential causal effects are determined by net <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments.
