50|$|Labetalol has two chiral carbons and {{consequently}} exists as four stereoisomers. Two of these isomers, the (S,S)- and (R,S)- forms are inactive. The third, the (S,R)-isomer, {{is a powerful}} α1 blocker. The fourth isomer, the (R,R)-isomer which {{is also known as}} <b>dilevalol,</b> is a mixed nonselective β blocker and selective α1 blocker. Labetalol is typically given as a racemic mixture to achieve both alpha and beta receptor blocking activity.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a nonselective beta-adrenergic {{blocking}} drug with beta- 2 agonist activity (<b>dilevalol</b> 200 mg) on proteinuria and renal hemodynamics were evaluated in a double-blind crossover study versus an ACE inhibitor (enalapril 5 mg) in eight patients with glomerulonephritis, moderate renal function impairment and proteinuria greater than 1 g/ 24 hr. Patients were studied after a one week placebo phase while off all other medications, except steroids in a few cases, and after three weeks of treatment. A 10 -day placebo washout perod was included between the various drug treatments. During each period renal hemodynamics were measured by clearance techniques, and urinary protein excretion as well as fractional clearance of albumin and IgG were determined. Both drugs reduced mean arterial pressure and proteinuria to a similar extent [mean arterial pressure: placebo 108 +/- 13 mm Hg; <b>dilevalol</b> 103 +/- 11 mm Hg (P less than 0. 05); enalapril 103 +/- 12 mm Hg (P less than 0. 05); protein excretion: placebo 5. 1 +/- 4. 2 g/day; <b>dilevalol</b> 3. 3 +/- 3. 0 g/day (P less than 0. 05); enalapril 2. 8 +/- 2. 8 g/day (P less than 0. 05) ]. The antiproteinuric effect was greater with enalapril than <b>dilevalol.</b> <b>Dilevalol</b> reduced GFR [baseline inulin clearance: 73. 3 +/- 38 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2; after dilevalol: 63. 3 +/- 28 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (P less than 0. 05) ] and the decrease of proteinuria correlated positively with the reduction of GFR. Enalapril did not significantly lower the GFR (inulin clearance during enalapril 66. 8 +/- 23 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2) and the reduction of proteinuria did not correlate with the lowering of the GFR.

40|$|<b>Dilevalol</b> (SCH 19927) is an {{antihypertensive}} {{agent with}} direct vasodilating properties due to / 32 -adrenergic receptor agonist ac-tivity and nonselective j 8 -receptor blocking activity. In acute (single dose) oral and parenteral studies a low order of toxicity was observed. Clinical signs observed {{at the higher}} doses included salivation, prostration, tremors, and convulsions. In multidose oral studies <b>dilevalol</b> produced an increase in mean absolute and/ or relative heart weights observed as early as 1 month in the high-dose (300 mg/kg) rats and at all dose levels (35, 90, 220 mg/kg) in rats treated for 1 year. There were no microscopic changes that could {{be associated with the}} change in heart weight. Intraalveolar macrophages were observed in the lung tissue of rats treated for 3 months or 1 year with an increase in relative lung weights noted in the high-dose (220 mg/kg) group treated for 1 year.

40|$|The {{effects on}} sleep of six beta-adrenergic {{blockers}} (propranolol, <b>dilevalol,</b> pindolol, metoprolol, celiprolol and atenolol) which {{differ in their}} pharmacological characteristics were studied in sponta-neously hypertensive rats. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded for 6 hr after p. o. administration of drugs or vehide, and the stages of wakefulness, rapid eye movements (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (non-REM) were classified thereafter. In separate experiments antihypertensive activity of each drug was assessed by the tail-cuff technique. The most common effect of the beta-blockers examined was a decrease of the duration of REM. The effect was marked for propranolol (10 - 1 00 mg/kg), celiprolol (1 0 - 1 00 mg/kg) and pindolol (1 - 1 0 mg/ kg), whereas it occurred at low doses, but not at high doses for metoprolol (1 0 mg/kg) and atenolol (3 and 1 0 mg/kg).

40|$|Compounds {{with two}} or more {{different}} pharmacodynamic activities in a single molecule are designated as hybrid drugs. If several stereoisomers with different pharmacodynamic activities exist in one molecule, the term pseudo-hybrid drug is applied. In the treatment of hypertension, the use of hybrid drugs enables a considerable {{reduction in the number}} of tablets to be taken per day. Conversely, the dose of each individual component cannot be tritrated. Most hybrid drugs used in antihypertensive treatment are beta-blockers with an additional vasodilator component, caused by different mechanisms such as alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonism, ACE inhibition or direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Examples include labetalol (in fact, a mixture of four stereoisomers), carvedilol, celiprolol, <b>dilevalol,</b> tertatolol and BWA- 575 C. A combination of beta-receptor blockade and vasodilation may be beneficial from a hemodynamic point of view. More recently it has been recognized that urapidil and ketanserin are hybrid drugs, each containing at least two pharmacodynamic activities in their molecule...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, several {{antihypertensive}} drugs with multiple actions have been introduced. Most of these hybrid drugs are beta-adrenoceptor blockers with an additional vasodilator component, such as labetalol, <b>dilevalol,</b> carvedilol and celiprolol. A second category of antihypertensive drugs with multiple actions consists of agents which interact simultaneously with serotoninergic receptors and alpha-adrenoceptors. Urapidil, ketanserin, and a few experimental compounds related to these drugs are examples {{of this type of}} antihypertensive. They may be characterised pharmacologically as follows: (1) Ketanserin is a selective antagonist of serotonin 2 receptors with an additional much weaker alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonistic activity. Its well documented antihypertensive activity cannot be explained by either serotonin 2 -receptor blockade or alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism alone. An unknown type of interaction between serotonin 2 -receptor and alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blockade appears to be necessary, either in the periphery or in the CNS. (2) Urapidil is a selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist and, as such, a peripheral vasodilator. In addition, it displays central hypotensive activity, probably caused by the stimulation of serotonin 1 A receptors in the CNS. This component is probably additive to the peripheral effect, and is also the background to the lack of reflex tachycardia seen with urapidil. The modes of action of both types of drugs are discussed in connection with the role of serotonin and its receptors in the cardiovascular system, both at the peripheral and the CNS level...|$|E
40|$|A {{negative}} calcium balance {{has previously}} been described in human hypertension {{with low levels of}} plasma ionized calcium (Ca 2 +) and an increased urinary excretion of calcium. The cause of this disturbance in mineral metabolism is not known, nor is it known if this derangement could be abolished if blood pressure is reduced by antihypertensive treatment. In the present investigation, the effects of antihypertensive monotherapy on serum and fasting urinary electrolytes were studied. For 3 to 6 months, 319 hypertensive patients entered 17 study groups, each group using one of the following antihypertensive drugs: <b>dilevalol,</b> metoprolol, antenolol, pindolol, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, bendrofluomethiazide, furosemide, spironolactone, doxazocine, prazocine, diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, isradipine, captopril, or lisinopril. Treatment with different beta-blockers, as well as diuretics, reduced the fasting urinary calcium excretion (P <. 001). However, while the beta-blockers increased the proportion of the ionized form of calcium in blood (Ca 2 +) (P <. 001), Ca 2 + was further decreased by diuretic treatment (P <. 05). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors caused no major changes in mineral metabolism while of the calcium antagonists studied only verapamil raised the levels of Ca 2 + (P <. 01). No significant relationship between the changes in mineral metabolism and the reduction in blood pressure was observed in any of the treatment groups. Of the antihypertensive drugs used in the present study, beta-blockers appeared to reverse the basic abnormality with regard to calcium balance, suggesting that the activity of the sympathetic nerve system is involved in the disturbed calcium metabolism seen in hypertensive patients...|$|E
