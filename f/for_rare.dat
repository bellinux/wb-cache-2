5|$|The Snowdon Massif {{includes}} {{a number of}} cliffs, and holds an important place {{in the history of}} rock climbing in the United Kingdom. Clogwyn Du'r Arddu is often colloquially known as 'Cloggy' among climbers, and was the site of the first recorded climb in Britain, in 1798. It was carried out by Peter Bailey Williams and William Bingley, while searching <b>for</b> <b>rare</b> plants. It is now considered {{to be one of the}} best cliffs in Britain for rock climbing.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of W2O's clients are biotech and medical device companies, such as Medtronic and Acclarent. Much {{of its new}} business in 2015 was related to treatments <b>for</b> <b>rare</b> diseases and cardiovascular problems. One of W2O's software services is MDigitalLife, which stores data on the online activity of doctors and patients. It is used by pharmaceutical companies to understand sentiment in the healthcare field.|$|E

50|$|Other sea animal ivories {{were also}} used as {{alternatives}} <b>for</b> <b>rarer</b> whale teeth. Walrus tusks, for example, may have been acquired in trade from indigenous walrus hunters.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{enormous}} quantities {{of the common}} ores mined at Poldice, the area was also known <b>for</b> <b>rarer</b> and more valuable minerals including chalcophyllite, olivenite, mimetite and liroconite.|$|R
5|$|Today, Michigan State {{continues}} its research with facilities {{such as the}} U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory and a particle accelerator called the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science named Michigan State University as {{the site for the}} Facility <b>for</b> <b>Rare</b> Isotope Beams (FRIB). The $730 million facility will attract top researchers {{from around the world to}} conduct experiments in basic nuclear science, astrophysics, and applications of isotopes to other fields.|$|E
5|$|Regionally {{developed}} ecotypes can {{be threatened}} with extinction when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This {{is sometimes called}} genetic mixing. Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material {{can lead to the}} replacement of local genotypes if the hybrids are more fit and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental <b>for</b> <b>rare</b> species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population {{to such a degree that}} none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.|$|E
5|$|Since Microsoft was {{not part}} of the {{handheld}} video-game console market, Rare continued to develop games for Nintendo handheld consoles after the acquisition. In August 2003 Rare and Microsoft entered an agreement with THQ <b>for</b> <b>Rare</b> to publish games for the Game Boy Advance, including Sabre Wulf, a game based on an Ultimate character; , initially intended as a Game Boy Color game and It's Mr. Pants!, a puzzle game originally developed as Donkey Kong: Coconut Crackers. January 2005 saw the completion of this deal with the release of Banjo-Pilot, known as Diddy Kong Pilot before the Microsoft acquisition.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{the runs}} scored as {{penalties}} for no balls and wides, since the changes to the laws in 2000, 25–30 penalty runs may be awarded <b>for</b> <b>rarer</b> breaches of the laws.|$|R
50|$|North Brother {{island in}} this small chain is a {{sanctuary}} <b>for</b> the <b>rare</b> reptile species, the Brothers Island tuatara and {{is the site of}} the Brothers Island Lighthouse. It is the type locality <b>for</b> a <b>rare</b> beetle, the Amychus granulatus, although it is possibly extinct there now.|$|R
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments <b>for</b> <b>rare</b> high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.|$|E
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created a haven for {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German {{side of the border}} were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become a refuge <b>for</b> <b>rare</b> species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E
5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system. After 1870, most years saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down to coin more five-cent pieces. The issue is not widely collected, and prices <b>for</b> <b>rare</b> dates remain low {{by the standards of}} American collectible coinage.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, {{the scoring}} system {{used in the}} Shanghai variant is high, due to the diverse number of scoring {{criteria}} and inflated values <b>for</b> <b>rarer</b> hands such as the thirteen terminals. Because of the inflated point values, there is generally a minimum point value in the Shanghai variant.|$|R

5|$|Following an {{increase}} in coin collecting among {{the public in the}} mid-nineteenth century, there arose considerable demand for older American coins. Mint Director James Ross Snowden began selling restrikes of Gobrecht dollars and trading them <b>for</b> <b>rare</b> medals (especially those depicting or relating to former President George Washington), which were then added to the Mint's coin collection, then known as a coin cabinet. The money generated from selling the restrikes went toward purchasing new items for the coin cabinet. The restrikes created under Snowden's tenure were likely struck in 1859 and 1860, but the practice was largely halted after the eruption of a public scandal; other Mint employees were creating and selling restrikes of early American coins for their own profit. All Gobrecht dollar restrikes, when tilted on their axis, depict the reverse eagle flying level, rather than upward as it is depicted on the coins struck during the official production run. It is unknown precisely why the orientation of the eagle was altered, though it is believed by many numismatists that Snowden did this intentionally to make restrikes distinguishable from originals. Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggests that Snowden simply used the alignment because that was the same used on the Flying Eagle cent, which began production in 1856. Mint Engraver James B. Longacre, its designer, had borrowed Gobrecht and Peale's eagle reverse for the one-cent coin's obverse.|$|E
5|$|MSU {{pioneered the}} studies of packaging, {{hospitality}} business, supply chain management, and communication sciences. Michigan State frequently ranks among the top 30 public universities in the United States and the top 100 research universities in the world. U.S. News & World Report ranks many of its graduate programs {{among the best in}} the nation, including African history, criminology, industrial and organizational psychology, educational psychology, elementary and secondary education, osteopathic medicine, human medicine, nuclear physics, rehabilitation counseling, supply chain/logistics, and veterinary medicine. MSU is a member of the Association of American Universities, an organization of 62 leading research universities in North America. The university's campus houses the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, the W. J. Beal Botanical Garden, the Abrams Planetarium, the Wharton Center for Performing Arts, the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, the Facility <b>for</b> <b>Rare</b> Isotope Beams, and the country's largest residence hall system.|$|E
5|$|Most coin {{collectors}} {{became aware}} of the 1804 dollar in 1842, when Jacob R. Eckfeldt (son of Adam Eckfeldt) and William E. Du Bois published a book entitled A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations, Struck Within the Past Century. In the volume, several coins from the Mint's coin cabinet, including an 1804 dollar, were reproduced by tracing a pantograph stylus over an electrotype of the coins. In May 1843, numismatist Matthew A. Stickney was able to obtain an 1804 dollar from the Mint's coin cabinet by trading a rare pre-federal United States gold coin. Due to an increase in the demand <b>for</b> <b>rare</b> coins, Mint officials, including Director Snowden, began minting an increasing number of coin restrikes in the 1850s. Several 1804 dollars were struck, and some were sold for personal profit on the part of Mint officials. When he discovered this, Snowden bought back several of the coins. One such coin, which Snowden later added to the Mint cabinet, was struck over an 1857 shooting thaler and became known as Class II, the only such piece of that type known to exist today. Six pieces with edge lettering applied after striking became known as Class III dollars.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{important}} {{locations are}} {{located within the}} world: these include Terminals that give access to a fast travel system; the Junk Shop, which acts as a vendor for buying and selling items; Rag's Jewelry, where gems collected during gameplay can be traded <b>for</b> <b>rare</b> items and unique demons; and the Fountain of Life, where the Protagonist and other party members can receive treatment for ailments, heal them of damage, or revive characters knocked out in battle. An optional location separate from the Vortex World is the Amala Labyrinth, accessed after the Protagonist has reached {{a certain point in}} the story. The Labyrinth is a dungeon divided into multiple floors or Kalpa, each housing both demon enemies and brokers which sell demons to the Protagonist. Each Kalpa is connected by a Warp Zone, in which the Protagonist can collect currency and items while avoiding or destroying obstacles. Proceeding through the levels of the Labyrinth requires the protagonist to find and fight Fiends carrying Candelabra, which unlock barriers. The Candelabra also act as a means of locating and either engaging or avoiding Fiends.|$|E
