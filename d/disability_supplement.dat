40|$|Objectives: This article {{examines}} the use of assistive devices {{as a part of}} the long-term care arrangements of community-dwelling older Americans. It examines the potential for assistive devices to substitute for and supplement personal care assis-tance. Methods: Data from the Phase 2 <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplements</b> to the 1994 - 1995 National Health Interview Surveys are used to compare the use of personal care and equipment among persons reporting difficulty with a given activity of daily living. Results: The capacity of equipment to substitute for or supplement personal care is highly task-specific and depends on the characteristics of the devices and the personal care providers. In general, those using simple devices are less likely to use informal care, whereas those using complex devices are more likely to use formal care services. Discussion: Technology has the potential to confer quality of life enhancements for older persons and their caregivers and cost savings for payers. Although the overall prevalence of disability among the older popula-tion has declined since 1980, the absolute size of the disabled older population is projected to continue to increase (Manton, Corder, &...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To examine {{differences}} in reports of residual disability and unmet need {{by type of}} care arrangement (assistive technology and/or personal care) amongst disabled adults. Method. This study compares three specific dimensions of residual difficulty (pain, fatigue, and time intensity) and unmet need for hands-on care across combinations of assistive technology and personal care. Analyses are conducted on samples of between 3, 493 to 7, 051 persons with limitations in bathing, transferring, walking, and getting outside from the U. S. 1994 - 95 National Health Interview Survey Phase 2 <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplements.</b> Results. Even accounting for {{differences in}} underlying disability, equipment use confers no additional benefit in the three dimensions of residual difficulty analysed here. Equipment users equally or more often report that tasks are tiring or time consuming, or painful even when they use assistance. Though this would appear to indicate unmet needs for care, fewer equipment users report a desire for hands on personal care. Conclusions. We find that disability alleviation by technology is no better on specific dimensions of difficulty, but technology users report less unmet need for personal care. Designing appropriate and cost-effective home care for disabled adults depends upon {{an understanding of the}} ways in which technology users may differ from others and the circumstances in which technology can be most effective. ...|$|R

40|$|In Scotland, public {{interest}} in children with disabilities followed an uneven path. The proponents for such interest included workers in medicine, education and training, public administration, law and order, religion and moral rectitude, philanthropy and charity. Their foci of attention were similarly divers. Initial attention towards children with ‘disabilities’ was directed towards those with sensory impairments. This was followed by provision for children with mental disabilities. Until the introduction of compulsory education in 1872, philanthropists and charities were largely unaware of children with physical impairments. The Scottish experience was distinctive {{from the rest of}} the United Kingdom because of its own legal system, and was set against a background of heavy industrialization accompanied by poverty and bad housing. Legislation in such areas as poor law reform and education was not introduced simultaneously to that for England and Wales. The Church of Scotland maintained a strong influence in local government, through the network of clearly defined parishes, despite the secularization that was intent in such legislation as the Poor Law (Scotland) Act of 1843. The influence of Presbyterian clergymen and church elders committed to strongly held ideals of religious belief, respectability and self-help is often apparent in the institutions established for children with disabilities. The following research makes use of archival sources on institutions receiving, accommodating and caring for children with <b>disabilities,</b> <b>supplemented</b> by some contemporary narrative and oral testimony. While the archival sources show that the attention paid to children with disabilities did not develop simultaneously for categories of impairment broadly grouped as sensory, mental and physical, they also indicate that the responses to different forms of disablement followed diverse approaches and object...|$|R

40|$|Using the 1994 - 95 National Health Interview Supplement <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplement,</b> {{the authors}} study levels of disabilities and {{accommodations}} among US adults with arthritis disability, compared {{to people with}} disability due to other conditions. Arthritis-disabled people are defined in two ways. One definition covers {{a broad range of}} arthritis and rheumatic conditions, and the other concentrates solely on arthritis. The authors find that arthritis-disabled people have more total disabilities than other-disabled peop e. However, their disabilities are less severe, have shorter durations, and accumulate more gradually over time. Despite more disabilities, people with arthritis disability use fewer assistive and service accommodations than other-disabled people. They do use more mobility aids. Because arthritis is the leading chronic condition for middle-aged and older adults, th s profile of extensive but mild-to-moderate disability is experienced by many millions of adults.

40|$|THE {{validity}} of contracts is not governed in Germany by a unitary rule. With respect to capacity and formalities the Introductory Law to the Civil Code lays down general provisions which are applicable to contracts.

The national law applies likewise to disabilities resulting from judicial action, such as the appointment of a guardian for a spendthrift; for, contrary to Anglo-American law, the effect of such an appointment is ubiquitous in its operation in continental countries. This assumes, of course, that the appointment of the guardian was validly made in accordance with the German principles of the conflict of laws...|$|R
40|$|One of the government’s main {{functions}} is {{to protect}} the population against a number of social risks. Hence, replacement incomes are provided in the event of unemployment, old age or occupational <b>disability.</b> Income <b>supplements</b> are granted to compensate in part for the financial burden associated with illness or with bringing up children. These social benefits are an important facet of the redistribution of income effected by the government. In Belgium, social protection is provided mainly by the social security sub-sector, which is the largest component of the general government sector. The level of government expenditure on social protection in Belgium is, expressed as a percentage of GDP, above the European Union average. This is due mainly to relatively higher expenditure on pensions and unemployment. The Belgian social security sector expanded strongly in the 1970 s. In the ensuing period, total social security receipts and expenditure remained relatively stable on average; expressed as percentages of GDP, they stood in 2000 at roughly the same level as in 1980. During this period, however, there was a “stop and go” policy on expenditure and receipts : expansion periods were followed by periods in which a more restrictive policy was pursued. In recent years, social security has again been expanding, although only to a more limited extent. Over the years, the structure of social security spending has changed significantly : due to the strong rise in health care expenditure, this spending item has now become the most important component, just ahead of pensions. Since receipts and expenditure have hitherto moved very much in parallel, the financial balance of social security has always hovered around equilibrium. At present, the social security sector is not only free of any financial liabilities, it actually has substantial financial assets. Population ageing will clearly exert strong upward pressure on future expenditure on pensions and health care. This increase can be only partly offset by the predicted decline in unemployment expenditure and family allowances. Therefore, social security will have to face a major financial challenge in the (near) future. Belgian public finance, social security, social protection expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{document}} {{the association between}} social support and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: A prospective survey including the SF- 36 and the Social Support questionnaire (SSQ) was administered to 108 hip and knee OA patients attending an outpatient physical rehabilitation and rheumatology clinic. Multiple regression analysis were performed to study the relation between social support and each dimension of the SF- 36, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, number of comorbid conditions, socioeconomic status, site of survey completion and severity of OA which was gauged with the pain dimension of the WOMAC, an OA-specific health status instrument. Results: Greater social companionship transactions were associated with higher physical functioning (standardized regression coefficients: beta = 0. 26, p < 0. 01), general health (β = 0. 32, p < 0. 001), mental health (beta = 0. 25, p < 0. 01), social functioning (β = 0. 20, p < 0. 05) and vitality (b = 0. 25, p < 0. 05). Satisfaction with problem-oriented emotional support was related to better physical functioning (β = 0. 22, p < 0. 01), mental health (beta = 0. 38, p < 0. 001), role-emotional (B = 0. 23, p < 0. 01), social functioning (beta = 0. 19, p < 0. 05) and vitality (b = 0. 26, p < 0. 01).

We study links among severity, duration, and structure for community-dwelling adults in the US. Methods: The data source is the National Health Interview Sur-vey <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplement.</b> Disabilities in personal care (ADL), household management (IADL), and physical functions (PLIM) are analyzed. Results: Many combinations of disabilities are possible, but just a few are frequent; the top- 10 patterns cover 70 % of ADL, 89 % of IADL, and 47 % of PLIM disabled adults. Hierarchical patterns are common for ADLs and IADLs. People with many disabilities also have more-severe ones, and their disabilities of-ten started at the same time. Conclusions: Disability structure reflects severity and timing of specific disabilities, sometimes strongly, and other times weakly due to exit processes from the community.

In this closing editorial, {{we want to give}} an overview of the rationale and major modes of operation of the African Network for Evidence-to-Action on Disability (AfriNEAD) with special focus on recommendations made at the 2011 AfriNEAD Symposium. AfriNEAD is guided and informed by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) for its research themes. The issues that emerged from AfriNEAD 2011 ranged from children and youth with disabilities; education across the lifespan; economic empowerment; the development process in Africa; health, HIV and AIDS and community-based rehabilitation; holistic wellness; to research evidence and utilisation. Disability-related stigma, the value of emancipatory research and the need to recognise a broader scope of valid methodologies were also highlighted.

In this article, we examine tradeoffs between the use of AT and reliance on personal care, with attention to factors that may influence those relationships. Methods. We jointly modeled hours of formal and informal care with use of AT in order to address the inter-dependence of these outcomes in ways not taken into account in previous studies. We analyzed a national sample of older persons with difficulty in activities of daily living drawn from Phase 2 of the 1994 – 1995 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplement.</b> Results. Our findings show that the use of AT was associated with reductions in informal care hours, especially for those who were unmarried, better educated, or had better cognitive abilities, but appeared to supplement formal care services for these groups.

These models raise the possibility that reductions of informal care hours may be accomplished with a combination of formal care and assistive devices, rather than from either alternative alone.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a novel {{instrument}} for assessing headache-related disability focusing solely on important activities of daily living. MethodsPart 1 : A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar, supplemented by hand searches in bibliographies to retrieve the original article for any instrument for the assessment of headache-related disability. Each instrument was evaluated for item categories, specific item content, measurement scale format for each item, and instructions to users. Together, these features constituted the construct validity of these instruments. Qualitative evaluations of these results were summarized with respect to the adequacy of each component. Psychometric features such as reliability and validity were not assessed. Part 2 : An existing instrument for assessing self-rated disability, the Neck Disability Index, was modified for content and format and subjected to 2 rounds of clinician and patient review. Item contents and formats received final consensus, resulting in a 9 -item instrument: the Headache Activities of Daily Living Index (HADLI). This instrument was tested in a sample of headache patients. Cronbach α and individual item correlations were obtained. Principal Components Analysis was performed. ResultsPart 1 : The search identified 6 reports on 5 preexisting instruments for self-rating of headache-related disability. Problems in content were found in all instruments, especially relating to the lack of items for specific activities of daily living. Problems were noted in most of the instruments for scaling and instructions with respect to the effect of headache on activities of daily living. Part 2 : The authors first identified suitable items from an existing instrument for self-rating of <b>disability.</b> These were <b>supplemented</b> by items drawn from the literature. A panel of 3 clinicians and 2 laypersons evaluated these items. Two more focus groups of 7 headache sufferers each reviewed the new instrument. After this, a 9 -item instrument for assessing activities of daily living in headache sufferers, the HADLI, was finalized. After this, 53 participants were recruited to study the face validity of the instrument. The sample consisted of 41 women and 12 men with a mean age of 37. 3 (12) years; mean duration of headaches was 7. 4 (8. 3) years; mean frequency of headaches per week was 3. 4 (2. 4); and the intensity was 6 (2. 4). The mean HADLI score was 26. 2 (13. 4), or 52 %. There were no floor or ceiling effects for total score. The total Index Cronbach α was 0. 96. The Principal Components Analysis identified one component which accounted for 75 % of the variance. ConclusionsThe HADLI was created using theory and empirical-based methods. Face validity was assessed by focus group input and by first-level psychometrics. The HADLI has good face validity and is suitable for further reliability and validity testing...|$|R
40|$|Bachelor thesis "The {{availability}} of assistive devices {{for people with}} visual impairments after social reform in 2012 " discusses specific changes in Act no. 100 / 1988 Coll., about social security, in particular changes relating to contributions to special tool. The aim {{of the work is}} to highlight resulting differences in national regulations and determine whether the interviewed individuals with visual disabilities have changed the approach in selection of assistive devices that they need for their life. Thesis is divided into three parts: theoretical, research, and appendix. The theoretical part focuses on problem of visual impairment and possibility of compensation, because the eye is considered as very important part of every person's life. If a person cannot fully exploit this sense, it is necessary to use various assistive devices to help him cope with everyday situations. However, the individual may use a particular tool, he must meet certain criteria, both in terms of health and finances. Conditions that he must currently meet, so he could be granted a special allowance for aid are set out in Act no. 329 / 2011 Coll., about provision of benefits for persons with <b>disabilities,</b> which is <b>supplemented</b> by Decree no. 388 / 2011 Coll., implementing certain provisions of the Act for provision of benefits to persons with disabilities. The above two laws refer to third part of theoretical part, where are precisely defined differences arising just from reform. The research part first sets the goal of work and specific research question, followed by a work methodology that was used in form of qualitative research. Using semi-structured interviews with individual clients of TyfloCentrum in Pilsen I was looking for an answer to research question which is: "Should social reform impact on changing the approach in the selection of mobility aids for persons with visual disabilities?" From respondents' answers {{the answer to this question}} revealed, that social reform did not affect the change of approach in selection of compensatory aids in investigation file. These individuals with visual disabilities do not have to re-evaluate their requirements and aids can also choose the same manner as before the reform. Theoretical part of this work may serve as a resource, or as a brief overview of what has by the influence of social reform changed and for what have currently users of assistive devices claim, without tediously search this information on the internet or ask competent authority. Practical part of the work gives the opportunity to use it for services for individual TyfloCenters, where qualitative information can be used to adjust survey offers to its clients, namely withdrawal of tenders of unproven products and vice versa will encourage companies that have good references...|$|R
40|$|Objective Arthritis is {{the most}} common chronic {{condition}} and {{the most common cause of}} disability among older US adults. We studied social participation, disabilities in many life domains, accommodations used (buffers), and accommodations needed (barriers) for US adults with arthritis disability compared with adults with disability from other conditions. Methods The data source is the National Health Interview Survey <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplement</b> Phase Two. Arthritis-disabled individuals named arthritis as the main cause of ≥ 1 disabilities. Other-disabled individuals named only other conditions as causes of their disabilities. We compared outcomes for the groups, taking sample weights and complex variances into account. Results Arthritis-disabled individuals get out and about less often than other-disabled individuals, but they manage to maintain active social ties. They have more disabilities of all types (personal care, household management, physical tasks, transportation, home, work), and the disabilities often cause fatigue, long task time, and pain. Despite this, arthritis-disabled individuals use less personal assistance than other-disabled individuals; they do use more equipment assistance. Arthritis-disabled individuals report more barriers in getting around outside their home and at their workplace. Conclusion The distinctive profile of arthritis disability includes extensive and uncomfortable disabilities, yet there are active management strategies to handle these disabilities.

This article compares disability impacts of these 2 preeminent health problems. Methods Using data from the National Health Interview Survey <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplement,</b> we studied specific limitations and disabilities, accommodations used (buffers), and accommodations needed (barriers) for US population groups of adults with arthritis disability, heart disease disability, both arthritis and heart disease disability, and disability due to other conditions. Weights and complex SE adjusted for sample design. We hypothesized that arthritis disability is more extensive and troublesome than heart disease disability. Results People with arthritis disability had more numerous, longer, and more bothersome disabilities than people with heart disease disability. People with arthritis disability used more equipment and rehabilitation, whereas people with heart disease disability emphasized personal assistance, medications, and medical services. People with arthritis disability experienced more barriers and needs in activities and services. People with disabilities from both arthritis and heart disease were especially disadvantaged, with high levels of limitations and accommodations. People with disability from other conditions had the highest social participation, fewest disabilities, and most tailored accommodations of all groups. Conclusion Arthritis had higher and more extensive disability impact than heart disease. Both groups had more difficulty, buffers, and barriers in their lives than people disabled by other conditions.

Methods Data was generated from wave one of the intellectual <b>disability</b> <b>supplement</b> to the Irish longitudinal study on aging (IDS-TILDA) which included 753 persons with an ID aged 40 years and over. Information on the presence of 12 chronic conditions was collected using a standardized protocol administered in face to face interviews with persons with ID and/or their caregivers. Prevalence of multimorbidity was established and patterns were examined using logistic regression models. The patterns of multimorbidity for people with ID that emerged were then compared with those reported for other older adults. Results Multimorbidity was established for 71 % of the IDS-TILDA sample with women at highest risk and rates of multimorbidity was high (63 %) even among those aged 40 ? 49 years. Eye disease and mental health problems were most often associated with a second condition and the most prevalent multimorbidity pattern was mental health/neurological disease. Discussion Further investigation, attention to mental health issues and the development of treatment guidelines that recognize chronic condition disease load are critical to mitigating the negative impact of multiple chronic conditions and preventing additional disability in adults with ID as they age. Highlights ? 12 Chronic conditions and pairings of morbidity examined in national random sample. ? People with ID have higher levels of multimorbidity than general population reports. ? Mental health concerns are more significant for people with ID...|$|E
40|$|Attention {{to disease}} and risk factor {{management}} is increasingly {{a feature of}} people with intellec- tual disability (ID) as an augmented life expec- tancy also exposes {{a growing number of}} age- related diseases. An additional concern is little attention to date to physical activity, nutrition, access to social support and other personal health choices and to environmental issues such as the impact of access to social support and the implications of individual?s living ar- rangements. Method: Using a sample of 753 persons with ID from the intellectual <b>disability</b> <b>supplement</b> to the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (IDS-TILDA), forty three variables were grouped into environmental, predisposing, ena- bling, need and personal health choices clusters and hierarchical ordinary least squares regres- sion examined the contribution of environmental, enabling, predisposing, need and all combina- tions of the sets of variables to personal health choices. Findings: Almost 32 % of variance was explained primarily by need variables. Most sig- nificant relationships were with meeting up with family and friends (environmental), age, rating of health and worries about getting older (predis- posing), having public health insurance and nursing who come into the home (enabling) and presence of stroke, chronic constipation, func- tional limitations, high assistance needs with activities of daily living (need). Discussion: Taken together, the groupings of variables from the Anderson Model explained a modest amount of variance in the pursuit of positive personal health choices by people with ID. More work is clearly needed in developing evidence-based in- terventions and strategies, and in understand- ing the relationship between positive personal health choices of people with ID and health out- comes...|$|E
40|$|Children {{with chronic}} or {{disabling}} conditions use health, {{education and social}} services {{at a higher rate}} than their healthy peers. Estimates of the number of children in need of these specialized services are widely varied and often depend on categorical definitions that do not account for either the diversity or commonality of their experiences. Developing methods for identifying the population in need of services, particularly children likely to use long-term ancillary (audiology, occupational, physical or speech therapy, or social work) and/or enabling services (special equipment, personal care assistance, respite care, transportation, or environmental modifications), is essential for effective policy and program implementation. This study examines several recent attempts to operationalize definitions of children with chronic conditions using a noncategorical classification approach. Particular emphasis is placed on the subgroup of children identified as having functional limitations. Proposed operational definitions of children with functional limitations are compared using data from the 1994 - 1995 <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplement</b> to the US National Health Interview Survey. Estimates of the number of children reported to be using ancillary and enabling services are generated and compared across operational definitions of functional limitation {{as well as by the}} number, severity, and type (i. e. mobility, self-care, communication/sensory, social cognition/learning ability) of limitation. Depending on the operational definition selected, 9 - 14 % of US community-dwelling children are estimated to have functional limitations. Among children with limitations, 26 - 30 % regularly use ancillary services and 11 - 14 % use enabling services. The strengths, limitations, and potential applications for each operational definition are discussed. Children Disability Functional limitations Needs assessment Service use USA...|$|E
40|$|The study aims to {{understand}} if and how older {{people with an}} intellectual disability {{are involved in the}} decision to change place of residence, the relationship between this choice opportunity and choice in other areas of life and how both choice and moving impact on health service utilisation. National policy promotes the closure of congregated living for people with ID. For people who live with family, longer life expectancy presents different challenges in preparing for later life living arrangements. This context provides strong rationale for current study. The research design consists of three main elements; (i) a content analysis of relevant health and housing policies; (ii) a systematic review of healthcare utilisation models; and (iii) quantitative analysis of the Intellectual <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplement</b> to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA) The data analysis showed three types of moves made by IDS-TILDA participants – more restrictive, more community based and lateral moves (which represented the majority). The main drivers for change differed by type of move but the predominant stakeholder in these decisions was the ID service provider. In conclusion, the duality of home and health for people with ID was evidenced across the various elements of the analysis with the quantitative analysis demonstrating that people with ID continue to be excluded from decisions on major life events and transition points such as moving home, and that regardless of type of living arrangement and type of moves made by movers, that many older people with ID continue to have choice for everyday and key life decisions made by someone else. This has implications for future health and housing policy and the need for complementarity in policy development and implementation...|$|E
40|$|People with early-onset {{disabilities are}} said to "age with {{disability}}, " while those with mid- or late-life onsets {{are said to}} have "disability with aging. " This is stereotypic since disability and aging are processes that interleave across the whole life course. We show this empirically by studying duration of disabil-ities by age in the U. S. community-dwelling adult population. To see how persons with childhood-onset disabilities and persons with adulthood-onset differ, we compare their sociodemographic, health, disability, and social participation characteristics. The data source is the National Health Interview Survey <b>Disability</b> <b>Supplement.</b> Results showed that most persons with a disability are older and have. had recent onsets, but some persons with childhood onsets have entered middle and older ages. The greatest diversity of disability experience is at the middle ages. People with childhood-onset disabili-ties have more disabilities than those with adulthood-onset disabilities, but their social role partici-pation is similar or even higher. For both groups, poor overall health is the main factor that reduces social participation. Service providers must expect to find many commonalities among persons with disabilities of all ages while being attentive to psychosocial differences that may spring from child-hood-onset versus adulthood-onset disabilities. People who incur disability at birth or in childhood are said to &dquo;age with disability,&dquo; and those free of disability until mid-or late-life are said to experience &dquo;disability with aging. &dquo; This article disassembles the stereotypes, showing how age and dis-ability intersect in the U. S. community-dwelling adult popu-lation. We analyze the duration of disability (years since first onset) across age groups and the proportion of life with dis-ability across age groups. The domains of personal care, household management, and basic physical activities are stud-ied. We look closely at individuals with childhood-onset dis-abilities and those with adulthood-onset disabilities, evaluating their similarities and differences. Implications for service provision and policies for persons with disabilities are stated...|$|E
