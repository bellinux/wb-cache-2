50|$|An {{additional}} test of {{posterior cruciate ligament}} injury is the posterior sag test, where, {{in contrast to the}} <b>drawer</b> <b>test,</b> no active force is applied. Rather, the person lies supine with the leg held by another person so that the hip is flexed to 90 degrees and the knee 90 degrees. The main parameter in this test is step-off, which is the shortest distance from the femur to a hypothetical line that tangents the surface of the tibia from the tibial tuberosity and upwards. Normally, the step-off is approximately 1 cm, but is decreased (Grade I) or even absent (Grade II) or inverse (Grade III) in injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament. The posterior <b>drawer</b> <b>test</b> is one of the tests used by doctors and physiotherapists to detect injury to the PCL. Patients who are suspected to have a posterior cruciate ligament injury should always be evaluated for other knee injuries that often occur in combination with an PCL injuries. These include cartilage/meniscus injuries, bone bruises, ACL tears, fractures, posterolateral injuries and collateral ligament injuries.|$|E
30|$|A {{retrospective}} {{observational study}} of 80 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using flexor tendons via the medial transportal or transtibial technique was performed.

Patients were evaluated 2  years after surgery by performing a physical examination (Lachman, pivot shift and anterior <b>drawer</b> <b>tests),</b> using a KT 1000 arthrometer, calculating objective and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee scores, conducting the Lysholm score, and recording re-ruptures.|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{constitutive}} law {{based on}} a nearly incompressible transversely isotropic hyperelastic potential is proposed to describe the mechanical behaviour of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The constitutive formulation is valid for arbitrary kinematics (finite elasticity) and is thermodynamically admissible. Based on anatomic measurements performed on a human cadaveric knee specimen, a three-dimensional continuum finite element model of the ACL was developed. The numerical model was used to simulate clinical procedures such as the Lachman and <b>drawer</b> <b>tests,</b> which are performed to assess the existence and severity of an ACL injury. Finite element analyses showed that the two procedures have distinct effects on the behaviour of the ACL and provided {{new insights into the}} stress distributions.

50|$|The {{anterior}} talofibular ligament is a {{ligament in}} the ankle. It passes from the anterior {{margin of the}} fibular malleolus, anteriorly and medially, to the talus bone, in front of its lateral articular facet. It {{is one of the}} lateral ligaments of the ankle and prevents the foot from sliding forward in relation to the shin. It is the most commonly injured ligament in a sprained ankle - from an inversion injury - and will allow a positive anterior <b>drawer</b> <b>test</b> of the ankle if completely torn.|$|E

50|$|Dial Test (anteromedial {{rotation}} test)- This test {{should be}} executed {{with the patient}} lying both supine and prone. When the patient is supine, the knees must be flexed 30° off the table. The thigh is then stabilized and the foot externally rotated. The examiner watches for the tibial tubercle of the affected knee to rotate as the foot rotates, comparing it to the contralateral knee. A positive test will show rotation of greater than 10-15° of rotation compared to the opposite knee. This is most easily assessed with a hand placed over the tibia while testing. When the patient is prone, the knee is flexed to 90° and both feet are externally rotated and compared, noting the difference from the non-injured joint. Similar to the anteromedial <b>drawer</b> <b>test,</b> a false positive test can result from a posterolateral corner injury. Testing at both 30° and 90° helps to distinguish between these injuries: one should monitor where the tibial rotation occurs (anteromedial or posterolateral) in the supine position and also assess for medial or lateral joint line gapping to differentiate between these two injuries.|$|E
30|$|When all 71 {{patients}} were evaluated regarding {{the outcomes of}} physical examinations (Lachman, pivot shift, and anterior <b>drawer</b> <b>tests),</b> KT 1000 assessments, objective and subjective IKDC score calculations, the Lysholm scores, and the incidence of re-ruptures, {{no significant differences were}} found between the groups. The transportal technique creates a different position and obliquity of the femoral tunnel compared to the transtibial technique, and it can affect the clinical outcome [5]. Because two different techniques were used in these patients (transtibial and transportal), possibly resulting in confounding differences between these subgroups, the transportal subgroup was also evaluated alone. However, no variations according to the graft length remaining were observed in this subgroup. The transportal subgroup contained only 37 patients, and this is an important study limitation because it represents a small sample size. This limitation generated the possibility of a type 2 statistical error (failure to detect a difference between groups when a difference exists).|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{surveyed}} a consecutive series of 500 {{patients who had}} undergone an open procedure for chronic anteromedial and/or anterolateral instabilities.

A knee sheet, based on the kind used at the Hughston Orthopaedic Clinic in Columbus, Georgia, was used to record all clinical findings. Chondromalacia of the articular surface of the femur was detected at surgery in 161 patients (32 %). A statistical analysis showed that the variables directly influencing degenerative changes of the cartilage are: a previous surgery that did not sufficiently restore joint kinematics (chi square = 20. 238, P < 0. 001) and a time lapse of more than 30 months between first trauma and surgery (chi square = 21. 736; P = 0. 001).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempted}} to characterize laxity in cruciate deficient knees using the Genucom System comparing the neutral to the resting {{position of the}} tibia. A quadriceps active technique was compared to a passive protocol at four knee flexion angles: 60, 70, 80 and 90 degrees. Eight ACL and eight PCL injured subjects performed active and passive anterior-posterior knee <b>drawer</b> <b>tests.</b> These tests were performed during two sessions to verify their reliability. Posterior and anterior laxity were recorded for the PCL and the ACL injured subjects, respectively. Laxity was measured at forces of 60, 90 and 130 Newtons. A feedback unit (Biostim 6010) was used to monitor muscular contraction during application of protocols. Results revealed a significant anterior tibial shift (p $<$. 05) in the PCL injured patients when comparing active to passive tests. No significant anterior tibial shift occurred in the ACL injured patients when performing the same comparison. The Genucom produced reliable results across two sessions for both PCL and ACL groups. Posterior laxity of PCL injured subjects was similar for knee flexion angles between 60 and 90 degrees. ACL injured subjects had statistically similar anterior laxity at knee flexion angles between 60 and 90 degrees...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>drawer</b> <b>test</b> {{is used in}} {{the initial}} {{clinical}} assessment of suspected rupture of the cruciate ligaments in the knee. The patient should be supine with the hips flexed to 45 degrees, the knees flexed to 90 degrees and the feet flat on table. The examiner positions himself by sitting on the examination table in front of the involved knee and grasping the tibia just below the joint line of the knee. The thumbs are placed along the joint line {{on either side of the}} patellar tendon. The tibia is then drawn forward anteriorly. An increased amount of anterior tibial translation compared with the opposite limb or lack of a firm end-point may indicate either a sprain of the anteromedial bundle or complete tear of the ACL. [...] If the tibia pulls forward or backward more than normal, the test is considered positive. Excessive displacement of the tibia anteriorly suggests that the ACL is injured, whereas excessive posterior displacement of the tibia may indicate injury of the posterior cruciate ligament.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{measurement of}} the mechanical component {{and its role in}} chronic ankle instability is still a matter of scientific debate. We analyzed known group and diagnostic validity of our ankle arthrometer. Additionally, functional aspects of chronic ankle instability were evaluated in relation to anterior talar drawer. Methods: By manual stress testing, 41 functionally unstable ankles were divided as mechanically stable (n[*]=[*] 15) or mechanically unstable (n[*]=[*] 26). Ankle laxity was quantified using an ankle arthrometer. Stiffness values from the load displacement curves were calculated between 40 and 60 N. Known group validity and eta 2 were established by comparing manual and arthrometer testing results. Diagnostic validity for the ankle arthrometer was determined by a 2 [*]×[*] 2 contingency table. The functional ankle instability severity was quantified by the German version of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM-G). Stiffness (40 – 60 N) and FAAM-G values were correlated.

30|$|Clinical {{assessment}} of the knee by Lachman’s and anterior <b>drawer</b> <b>tests</b> and KT- 1000 anterior translation measurements did not predict {{the appearance of the}} ACL at the time of surgery. The side-to-side difference in KT- 1000 arthrometer measurements (instrumented Lachman’s) was found to be difficult to interpret in patients with two abnormal knees (77 % in the study) and is not recommended for use in future studies. Instead, the index knee was compared to a nominal normal of 2  mm of translation on the contralateral side, producing a worst-case-scenario side-to-side difference. This measurement categorised 24.2 % of the index knees as abnormal and, in those patients with an absent ACL at the time of surgery, 25 % (3 / 12)were graded as “abnormal” by this assessment (Table  2). In many patients, the KT- 1000 predicted ACL deficiency that was not found (of 25 abnormal or severely abnormal laxity measurements, 14 ACLs had normal appearance), or failed to predict ACL deficiency when it was present (of 42 patients with abnormal or absent ACL, 31 had normal or nearly normal laxity measurements). While it might be expected that joint stiffness, and development of osteophytes, might lead to less knee laxity in the presence of ACL deficiency, this is not always the case and in many cases, knees with marked laxity had macroscopically normal ACLs.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{validate}} use {{of stress}} MRI {{for evaluation of}} stifle joints of dogs with an intact or deficient cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL). SAMPLE 10 cadaveric stifle joints from 10 dogs. PROCEDURES A custom-made limb-holding device and a pulley system linked to a paw plate were used to apply axial compression across the stifle joint and induce cranial tibial translation with the joint in various degrees of flexion. By use of sagittal proton density-weighted MRI, CrCL-intact and deficient stifle joints were evaluated under conditions of loading stress simulating the tibial compression test or the cranial <b>drawer</b> <b>test.</b> Medial and lateral femorotibial subluxation following CrCL transection measured under a simulated tibial compression test and a cranial <b>drawer</b> <b>test</b> were compared. RESULTS By use of tibial compression test MRI, the mean ± SD cranial tibial translations in the medial and lateral compartments were 9. 6 ± 3. 7 mm and 10 ± 4. 1 mm, respectively. By use of cranial <b>drawer</b> <b>test</b> MRI, the mean ± SD cranial tibial translations in the medial and lateral compartments were 8. 3 ± 3. 3 mm and 9. 5 ± 3. 5 mm, respectively. No significant difference in femorotibial subluxation was found between stress MRI techniques. Femorotibial subluxation elicited by use of the cranial <b>drawer</b> <b>test</b> was greater in the lateral than in the medial compartment.

40|$|Background: Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) avulsion fracture is {{commonly associated with}} knee injuries and its management is controversial ranging from conservative treatment to arthroscopic fixation. The aim of our study {{was to assess the}} clinical and radiological results of arthroscopic staple fixation in the management of ACL avulsion fractures. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two patients (17 males and 5 females) who underwent arthroscopic staple fixation for displaced ACL avulsion fractures were analysed. The mean age was 32. 2 years (15 - 55 years) with a mean followup of 21 months (6 - 36 months). All patients were assessed clinically by calculating their Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores and the radiological union was assessed in the followup radiographs. Results: The mean Lysholm score was 95. 4 (83 - 100) and the mean IKDC score was 91. 1 (77 - 100) at the final followup. In 20 patients anterior <b>drawer′s</b> <b>test</b> was negative at the end of final followup while two patients had grade I laxity. Associated knee injuries were found in seven cases. The final outcome was not greatly influenced by the presence of associated injuries when treated simultaneously. At final followup all the patients were able to return to their pre-injury occupation Conclusion: Arthroscopic staple fixation is a safe and reliable method for producing clinical and radiological outcome in displaced ACL avulsion fractures...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: {{to present}} the results with {{posterior}} cruciate ligament-retaining total knee arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Background: Total knee replacement in RA patients has many particularities. One {{of them is the}} difficulty of obtaining a proper ligamentous balance. Methods: 24 RA patients were followed for a 5 -year period after posterior cruciate ligament-retaining total knee arthroplasty. Clinical assessments analyzed general health status by using Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Evaluation Form (HSSKEF) and mediolateral and anteroposterior ligament stability by using varus-valgus and posterior <b>drawer</b> <b>tests.</b> Radiological assessments evaluated axial alignment, size and position of components, radiolucent lines in anteroposterior and lateral standard views, integrity of the posterior cruciate ligament on lateral view X-ray at 45 degrees of flexion. Results: the mean HSSKEF score increased from 32 to 84 points at the end of follow-up. Preoperative mean range of motion was 60 degrees; postoperative mean range of motion was of 105 degrees, with significant statistical difference (p< 0. 05). The mean femoral component axial deviation was 6 degrees. The tibial component had a mean axial deviation of 1 degree of varus. There were no radioluscency lines of more than 1 mm. 21 patients had excellent results. None of the knees was unstable. Conclusion: posterior cruciate ligament-retaining total knee arthroplasty can be used in RA patients without excessive valgus deformity (over 15 degrees), providing thus sufficient stabilization. The outcomes re similar to those patients who followed a posterior stabilized endoprosthesis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Posterolateral rotatory {{instability}} of the knee, usually accompanied by other instabilities, is easily missed, misdiagnosed, and mistreated. The correct di agnosis requires a complete {{examination of the}} knee, including both the external rotation-recurvatum and posterolateral <b>drawer</b> <b>tests.</b> The most effective operative approach when the lesion is interstitial or {{at the site of}} the femoral attachment consists ofadvancing the arcuate ligament complex and its osseous attachment anteriorly and distally on the femur to support the arcuate ligament repair. When the lesion is distal and the arcuate ligament attachment to the tibia and fibula is loose, this area must be stabilized. In a consecutive series of 140 patients, 141 knees were reconstructed with this procedure. Ninety-five pa tients (ninety-six knees), with a follow-up of two to thir teen years, form the basis for this report. Seventy-one of the patients had undergone a combined total of 112 prior operations on the knee without functional recov ery. After surgery directed at the arcuate ligament com plex, eighty-twoknees(85 per cent) wereobjectively rated as good; thirteen (14 per cent), as fair; and one, as poor. Subjectively, seventy-five (78 per cent) of the patients considered the result to be good; twenty-one (22 per cent), fair; and none, poor.

Sectioning of the PCL was confirmed visually and via posterior drawer examination. Only specimens with a Grade III Posterior <b>Drawer</b> <b>Test</b> were included. Afterwards, the PLC was cut via the lateral arthrotomy and testing was repeated. Care was taken to preserve the skin and muscle bulk of each specimen so that the brace fit each specimen appropriately.|$|E
30|$|We {{conducted}} a study on 56 professional and amateur athletes, where we performed ACL augmentation on partial tears from June 2009 to August 2012. We checked anterior <b>drawer</b> <b>test,</b> pivot shift test, Lachman test and KT- 1000 arthrometer measurement before and after surgery 1  year post-op. Also we checked subjective results after surgery at that moment. All patients regained their knee range of motion post-operatively, and reported good or excellent results. The mean Lysholm subjective score improved significantly after surgery (P value < 0.00001), and anterior <b>drawer</b> <b>test,</b> pivot shift test and Lachman tests showed normal results after surgery. Average anterior tibial translation from neutral, measured with a KT- 1000 arthrometer, decreased significantly from baseline (P value < 0.00001). Based on these results, we recommend ACL augmentation for all symptomatic athletic patients.|$|E
30|$|All {{patients}} were reassessed immediately after surgery and at each follow-up at 2  weeks, 6  weeks, 12  weeks, 6  months and 1  year after surgery.

50|$|Anteromedial <b>drawer</b> test- This <b>test</b> is {{performed}} with the patient supine with the knee flexed to 80-90°. The foot is externally rotated 10-15° and the examiner supplies an anterior and external rotational force. The joint can then be evaluated for tibial anteromedial rotation, taking care to recognize the possibility of posterolateral corner instability giving similar rotational test results. As always, compare the test in the opposite knee.|$|R
30|$|Likewise, {{significant}} {{correlations between the}} dial test and injury to structures of the PLC were found during surgical exploration (Kim et al., 2010; Laprade & Terry, 1997) and in selective ligament cutting studies performing external rotation of the tibia (Bae et al., 2008; Grood et al., 1988; Strauss et al., 2007; Veltri et al., 1995; Wroble et al., 1993). Nonetheless a cadaveric study of Bae et al. (Bae et al., 2008) suggests that in patients with ACL injury, injury to less than three posterolateral structures (excluding the PCL) might not be clinically detected by the dial test. Also Veltri et al. (Veltri et al., 1995) state that the standard external rotation test performed at 30 ° of knee flexion may not be routinely reliable for detecting combined anterior cruciate and posterolateral ligament injury. They suggest that increased total rotation may be indicative for injury to the posterolateral structures in the ACL-deficient knee. Furthermore, a study of Griffith et al. (Griffith et al., 2009) shows that significant increases in external rotation at 30 ° of knee flexion were found with all medial knee structures sectioned, which indicates that a positive dial test may be found not only for posterolateral knee injuries but also for medial knee injuries. Therefore, careful correlation {{with the results of}} valgus stress testing and assessment of the location of tibial subluxation during the dial test, performed in prone and supine position, is necessary to distinct between possible posterolateral or medial knee injury (Griffith et al., 2009; Wijdicks et al., 2010). Also comparing the lateral tibial condyle with the medial tibial condyle during posterolateral and anteromedial <b>drawer</b> <b>tests</b> can aid in this distinction (Hughston & Norwood, 1980; Wijdicks et al., 2010).|$|R
40|$|Female {{athletes are}} at a higher risk to sustain an ACL injury {{compared}} to their male counterparts. The primary mechanism of injury is through non-contact movements, however the cause remains unclear. Several authors have identified knee joint laxity and muscular strength as a possible risk factor influencing ACL injury. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare knee joint laxity and muscular strength between male and female athletes and male and female non-athletes to determine if any differences or correlations existed among these variables. Fifty-four (27 male, 27 female) apparently healthy athletes from the University of Texas at El Paso and fifty-three (25 male, 28 female) non-athletes from the general student body volunteered to participate. The KT- 1000 knee arthrometer was used to quantify knee joint laxity during five tests: 3 passive <b>drawer</b> <b>tests</b> (66 N, 89 N, 133 N); 1 active drawer test; and 1 Lachman, a maximum manual test. The Biodex Medical Systems was used to measure for muscular strength during five maximal repetitions at 60 °/sec. Non-athletes had significantly greater laxity compared to athletes at 89 N, 133 N, and the active displacement test. No significant differences were found between males and females in laxity. Males produced significantly greater peak torque of the quadriceps and hamstrings compared to females, and athletes had significantly greater peak torque of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles as well as a greater H:Q ratio compared to non-athletes. Passive displacement at 66 N was negatively correlated with the H:Q ratio while the Lachman was negatively correlated with quadriceps and hamstring peak torque. These findings suggest that laxity may be related more to athletic participation than gender therefore, knee joint laxity may not explain the higher incidence of ACL injury in females. The H:Q ratio of athletes is lower than normal, and training should be focused on increasing hamstring strength. ...|$|R
