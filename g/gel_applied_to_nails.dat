40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} topical lidocaine gel and intrauterine lidocaine infusion administered prior to saline contrast sonohysterography (SCSH) in reducing pain level during the procedure. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. We recruited 120 women scheduled to undergo SCSH and randomized them into one of three groups according to administration of gel and intrauterine infusion immediately prior to the procedure: (1) the 'lidocaine gel' group received 3 mL 2 % lidocaine <b>gel</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the cervix and intrauterine infusion, using an infant feeding tube without balloon, of 5 mL normal saline; (2) the 'lidocaine infusion' group received 3 mL <b>gel</b> lubricant <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the cervix and intrauterine infusion of 5 mL 2 % lidocaine; (3) the placebo group received 3 mL <b>gel</b> lubricant <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the cervix and intrauterine infusion of 5 mL normal saline. The tube was left {{in place for the}} SCSH procedure. The primary outcome measure was the overall pain level (on a scale of 0 - 100) reported by the women during the SCSH procedure. Women also rated their pain levels at various other time points and an observer assessed visible signs of the women's discomfort during the procedure, producing a distress score. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the three groups in baseline characteristics, volume of saline solution infused, tenaculum use and duration and difficulty level of the SCSH procedure. The median (range) pain scores during normal saline infusion for the SCSH procedure were 0 (0 - 65) in the placebo group, 2. 5 (0 - 80) in the lidocaine gel group, and 0 (0 - 70) in the lidocaine infusion group. The pain scores at other time points, the overall pain score and the distress score were also comparable for the three groups. No significant adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: SCSH performed with an infant feeding tube without balloon is associated with very low pain levels. Topical lidocaine gel application and intrauterine lidocaine infusion do not further reduce pain levels during SCSH. Copyright (c) 2015 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
25|$|Hormones can be {{administered}} {{in a variety}} of ways, including percutaneous skin and vaginal creams, oral pills, topical gels, vaginal rings and tablets, and transdermal patches. Though all preparations of a given type of estrogen (e.g. estradiol) may be molecularly identical before their introduction into the human body, estrogens administered orally are modified by the liver before entering the bloodstream and in this process, most is converted to estrone. However, estrogen bypassing the digestive tract and liver and entering through the skin is not converted to a new form before entering the bloodstream. Creams and <b>gels</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the skin also enter the blood directly and without modification but absorption of the gels, creams, and patches can vary from application to application, depending on the temperature and condition of the skin.

40|$|Although {{surgical}} treatment of nail conditions {{can be traced}} back centuries to the writings of Paul Aegineta (625 – 690 AC), {{little is known about the}} physical laws governing nail growth.

In this context, a theory of nail plate adhesion, including a physical description of nail growth can be used to determine the transverse and longitudinal curvatures of the nail plate that are so important in the physical diagnosis of some nail conditions. As a result physics sheds light on: (a) why/how nails/hooves adhere strongly, yet grow smoothly; (b) why hoof/claw/nail growth rates are similar across species; (c) potential nail damage incurred by poor trimming; (d) the connection between three previously unrelated nail conditions, i. e. spoon-shaped, pincer and ingrown nails and; last but not least, (e) why ingrown nails occur preferentially in the big toes...|$|R

Franco) before planting, can modify indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) levels in roots, root growth responses, and tree survival. We treated two different 1 + 0 stock types (PSB 313 B and PSB 323) of Douglas-fir with indole-butyric acid (IBA), ethephon (Ethrel®), alginate, {{or a combination of}} IBA and alginate. New root growth and IAA levels in roots were measured 2 weeks after planting, and aboveground growth and tree survival were monitored over 10 growing seasons after planting. Treatment with IBA or the combination of IBA and alginate increased IAA conjugate and free IAA levels in roots, root growth, and tree survival. Alginate treatment alone in-creased new root growth and tree survival, but did not increase free IAA levels in roots. Ethrel ® treatment increased free IAA levels and root growth, but had no effect on IAA conjugates or tree survival. A cost analysis suggests that use of certain PGRs or alginate decreases the cost required to attain target stocking and increased tree size. Our results suggest that application of PGRs or other root-promoting materials to the roots of Douglas-fir before planting has th...|$|R

Background: This clinical study assessed the effects of topically applied tea tree oil (TTO) -containing gel on dental plaque and chronic gingivitis. Methods: This was a double-blind, longitudinal, non-crossover study in 49 medically fit non-smokers (24 males and 25 females) aged 18 – 60 years with severe chronic gingivitis. Subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups and given either TTO-gel (2. 5 per cent), chlorhexidine (CHX) gel (0. 2 per cent), or a placebo <b>gel</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> with a toothbrush twice daily. Treatment effects were assessed using the Gingival Index (GI), Papillary Bleeding Index (PBI) and plaque staining score (PSS) at four and eight weeks. Results: No adverse reactions to any of the gels were reported. The data were separated into subsets by tooth (anterior and posterior) and tooth surface (buccal and lingual). The TTO group had significant reduction in PBI and GI scores. However, TTO did not reduce plaque scores, which tended to increase over the latter weeks of the study period.
