Unsupervised anomaly <b>detection</b> <b>techniques</b> detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set {{under the assumption}} {{that the majority of the}} instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly <b>detection</b> <b>techniques</b> require a data set that has been labeled as [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "abnormal" [...] and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherent unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly <b>detection</b> <b>techniques</b> construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set, and then testing the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the learnt model.|$|R

Sensor data that significantly deviate from normal pattern of sensed data are often called outliers. Outlier detection in wireless sensor networks aims at identifying such readings, which represent either measurement errors or interesting events. Due to numerous shortcomings, commonly used outlier <b>detection</b> <b>techniques</b> for general data seem not to be directly applicable to outlier detection in wireless sensor networks. In this chapter, the authors report on the current state-of-the-art on outlier <b>detection</b> <b>techniques</b> for general data, provide a comprehensive technique-based taxonomy for these techniques, and highlight their characteristics in a comparative view.

40|$|Raw sensor {{observations}} {{often have}} low data quality and reliability due to {{both internal and}} external factors including low quality of cheap sensors, dynamicity of network conditions, and harshness of the deployment environment. Use of low quality sensor data in any data analysis and decision making process will not only negatively impact analysis results and decisions made but also waste huge amount of valuable and limited network resources such as energy, as many incorrect values are transmitted. Low quality sensor data also prevents WSNs to fulfill their promises in terms of reliable real-time situation-awareness, as the low quality sensor data may generate large number of false alarms. Motivated by the need to improve quality of data analysis and decision making, enhance efficiency of using WSNs resources by preventing unnecessary transmission of erroneous sensor observations, and increase effectiveness of monitoring and situation-awareness capabilities of the WSNs, in this thesis we focus on online identification of outliers whenever and wherever they occur. Outliers in WSNs are those observations that represent erroneous values (errors) or indicate particular phenomenal changes (events). Our outlier <b>detection</b> <b>techniques,</b> which are based on distributed in-network data processing, identify sensor observations that do not conform to normal behavior of sensor data without using a pre-defined threshold or triggering conditions. Our main research objective is to design and implement effective and efficient outlier <b>detection</b> <b>techniques</b> for WSNs to identify outliers in an online and distributed manner and distinguish between errors and events with high accuracy and low false alarm, while maintaining the communication, computation and memory complexity low. Main contributions of this thesis can be summarized as: 1. 	Providing a technique-based taxonomy and a guideline for outlier <b>detection</b> <b>techniques</b> for WSNs. 2.
