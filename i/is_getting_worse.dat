5|$|The doctor tells Scully that Emily <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>worse.</b> A {{woman from}} the {{adoption}} agency arrives and wants to stop Scully from making decisions for Emily. Mulder connects {{the names of the}} women in the nursing home to recent births and finds that Dr. Calderon was treating them. Emily reacts badly to being placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Mulder finds medical records with Scully's name on them at the nursing home, along with a live fetus in a refrigerated chamber. Mulder finds Calderon entering soon after, and Detective Kresge arrives as well. Mulder and Kresge confront Calderon, who attacks Kresge. Despite Mulder's warning Kresge shoots Calderon, whose wounds cause him to spew green blood which incapacitates Kresge. Mulder quickly leaves the building to avoid being affected by the blood. Calderon morphs into Kresge, and deceives Mulder and escapes. Mulder returns to the hospital, where Emily has gone into a coma. Days later Emily has died. Mulder visits Scully at the funeral chapel, telling her that Kresge is recovering and all evidence at the nursing home and Prangen is gone. The only evidence left is Emily's body, but the agents instead find sand bags in her coffin along with Scully's cross necklace, which she had previously given to Emily.|$|E
25|$|California's {{state budget}} woes are {{expected}} to put more pressure on cities such as Burbank. State lawmakers have proposed eliminating the individual redevelopment agencies, {{a move that would}} force cities such as Burbank to eliminate much needed infrastructure projects. Local redevelopment agencies also may be forced to reimburse the state. For example, Burbank Redevelopment Agency might have pay the state nearly $20 million. But the city is fighting the return of at least $15 million in redevelopment funds, including money that was slated for the Lundigan Community Center and improvements to Johnny Carson Park. Whether Burbank will ultimately prevail is unclear, as the state's budget hole <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>worse</b> due to the slow economy and lower than expected state revenues.|$|E

2500|$|Air {{pollution}} {{costs the}} world economy $5 trillion per year {{as a result of}} productivity losses and degraded quality of life, according to a joint study by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington These productivity losses are caused by deaths due to diseases caused by air pollution. One out of ten deaths in 2013 was caused by diseases associated with air pollution and the problem <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>worse.</b> The problem is even more acute in the developing world. [...] "Children under age 5 in lower-income countries are more than 60 times as likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high-income countries." [...] The report states that additional economic losses caused by air pollution, including health costs and the adverse effect on agricultural and other productivity were not calculated in the report, and thus the actual costs to {{the world economy}} are far higher than $5 trillion.|$|E
2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What {{do you want me to}} do? [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - to point out that the condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>worse,</b> if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else can it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances. [...] That is the explanation for the great March offensive, and now [...] Operation Georgette, not progressing further.|$|E

2500|$|Violence against Palestinian Women and Girls, notes that, [...] "a {{significant}} number of women and girls in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) are victims of violence perpetrated by family members and intimate partners. While there is increasing recognition {{of the problem and}} some Palestinian Authority (PA) officials have indicated their support for a more forceful response, little action has been taken to seriously address these abuses. Indeed, there is some evidence the level of violence <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>worse</b> while the remedies available to victims are being further eroded." [...] The report discusses spousal and child abuse, rape, incest, and [...] "honor" [...] crimes. [...] The report suggests that reasons for the PA's failure to respond to the violence include, [...] "discriminatory laws that condone and perpetuate such violence and the virtual absence of institutionalized policies to prevent violence, assist victims, and hold perpetrators accountable". [...] The report outlines Jordanian laws in force in the West Bank and Egyptian laws in Gaza, [...] "include provisions that provide a reduction in penalty to men who kill or attack female relatives committing adultery; relieve rapists who agree to marry their victims from any criminal prosecution; and allow only male relatives to file incest charges on behalf of minors". [...] In addition, HRW interviewed Palestinian police officers, including chiefs of police who, [...] "downplayed the severity of violence against women in the OPT and questioned the need for their involvement in the dissemination of potentially life-saving information to victims." [...] The report also noted that, [...] "police officers and clan leaders regularly [...] "mediate" [...] and [...] "resolve" [...] these cases, typically by returning the abused women to the [...] "care and protection" [...] of her attacker, without ever referring the case to the courts or the woman to social or other services she might need". While Human Rights Watch acknowledged, [...] "the severe constraints that the Israeli occupation imposes upon the PA," [...] they concluded that, [...] "notwithstanding these limitations, the PA holds ultimate responsibility for protecting victims and holding perpetrators accountable...and that PA is failing to act diligently to prevent, investigate, and punish violence against women, putting women's health and lives in jeopardy. Ultimately, the PA is denying victims their rights under international human rights law to non-discrimination and an effective judicial remedy for abuse".|$|E
