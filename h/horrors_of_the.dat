5|$|In 1926, Newt Scamander {{arrives in}} New York City with his magically {{expanded}} briefcase which houses {{a number of}} dangerous creatures and their habitats. When some creatures escape from his briefcase, Newt must battle to correct the mistake, and the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resultant increase in violence, fear, and tension felt between magical and non-magical peoples (No-Maj).|$|E
5|$|The Zong killings {{offered a}} {{powerful}} {{example of the}} <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave trade, stimulating {{the development of the}} abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s. In 1787, the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} trial, freed slave Olaudah Equiano brought {{news of the}} {{massacre}} {{to the attention of}} the anti-slavery campaigner Granville Sharp, who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew prosecuted for murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the Zong events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Passage of slaves to the New World.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> existential <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> V-2 {{attack on}} London is <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow.|$|R
25|$|As if {{in answer}} to Jimmy's complaint, the city is {{threatened}} by a typhoon. Everyone sings in <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destruction awaiting them.|$|R

5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns {{made to look like}} bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E

50|$|Cowan Pottery {{works were}} {{generally}} table-top-sized sculptures done in limited editions. Gregory's most famous sculptures {{from this period}} are Nautch Dancer and Burlesque, as well as Salome and Margarita. Salome combines <b>the</b> essential <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> John <b>the</b> Baptist, his beheading, as well as Salome’s veil dance. However, <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event is muted, becoming secondary to an expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, movement and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drapery and human movement. Salome won first prize at <b>the</b> Cleveland Museum <b>of</b> Art May Show of 1929. Gregory's work for Cowan is characterized by smooth, linear, flowing forms.|$|R
5|$|The script {{calls for}} one actor to play both male {{characters}}Jason and the pimp. Jason and Number 18 are haunted by four voices. As poetic and prophetic voices, these characters serve {{much the same}} purpose as a chorus in Greek tragedies, according to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate. Variously considered angels or ghosts, the voices are written in the script to be played by the female actors who portray Number 18, Marta, Ali, and Mama. While these voices sometimes emphasize the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sex industry, at other times, they offer comfort to Number 18. It is only revealed at the play's conclusion that the chorus {{is made up of}} dead child prostitutes.|$|E

25|$|Many {{contemporary}} artists {{continue to be}} haunted by the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second World War and the specter of the Holocaust. Christian Boltanski's harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.|$|E
50|$|Films {{in the era}} {{used the}} supernatural premise to express <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demonic. The Innocents (1961) based on the Henry James novel <b>The</b> Turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Screw. Meanwhile, ghosts were a {{dominant}} theme in Japanese horror, in such films as Kwaidan, Onibaba (both 1964) and Kuroneko (1968).|$|R
25|$|Even <b>the</b> unique <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{guillotine}} {{has been}} dwarfed by <b>the</b> gas chambers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust, <b>the</b> organized brutality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gulag, <b>the</b> mass intimidation <b>of</b> Mao's cultural revolution, or <b>the</b> killing fields <b>of</b> Cambodia.|$|R

25|$|Levi wrote If This Is a Man to {{bear witness}} to the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazis' attempt to exterminate the Jewish people and others.

25|$|In {{early summer}} 2009, Harry {{recorded}} some spoken word parts for UK heavy metal band Imperial Vengeance, {{to be included}} on the title track to the album At the Going Down of the Sun.

50|$|He {{was known}} for {{carrying}} sticks of explosive in his pockets, even producing them while giving testimony in trials, to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court. Most high explosives are harmless unless used with a detonator, {{but this is not}} generally understood.|$|R
25|$|Muckrakers were {{journalists who}} {{encouraged}} readers to demand more regulation of business. Upton Sinclair's The Jungle (1906) showed America the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Union Stock Yards, a giant complex of meat processing that {{developed in the}} 1870s. The federal government responded to Sinclair's book with the new regulatory Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{at the end}} of {{the century}} was profoundly marked by the civil wars: pessimism, dourness and a call for retreat from the world predominate (as in Jean de Sponde). However, the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war were also to inspire one Protestant poet, Agrippa d'Aubigné, to write a {{brilliant}} poem on the conflict:Les Tragiques.|$|E
25|$|In August 1943, Krebs {{was drafted}} as an infantryman and {{deployed}} in February 1944 to the Philippines in fighting the Japanese in the Pacific War. In 1946, his book Children of Yesterday, an anecdotal {{history of the}} 24th Infantry Division was published, describing in graphic detail the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting and everyday life of the division’s troops.|$|E
50|$|Ebirah (lead=yes) is a kaiju film monster {{which first}} {{appeared}} in Toho's 1966 film Ebirah, <b>Horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deep.

50|$|After the mid-1980s, {{his poetry}} {{displays}} {{a freedom of}} spirit that can withdraw and objectively examine <b>the</b> futility <b>of</b> life. He coolly examines the changes within reality and <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, with a calm composure that boldly accepts these observations.|$|R
50|$|Goodson herself evidently had {{a playful}} side. En route to Boston for her American debut {{she and her}} husband dined with some elderly society ladies, who enquired after their profession. For some days, to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bostonians, the two musicians kept up the pretence that they were circus {{performers}} and had a camel called Gertrude in the ship's hold.|$|R
25|$|As {{to other}} works of art, Pablo Picasso painted Guernica in 1937, taking {{inspiration}} from the bombing of Guernica, and in Leonardo da Vinci's The Battle of Anghiari. Guernica, like many important Republican masterpieces, was featured at the 1937 International Exhibition in Paris. The work's size (11ft by 25.6ft) grabbed much attention and cast the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mounting Spanish civil unrest into a global spotlight. The painting has since been heralded as an anti-war work and a symbol of peace in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|World War I: {{during the}} first three years of World War I, he worked as press {{correspondent}} of El Liberal, and thanks to his detailed chronicles, which came from his courage of getting close to enemy lines, the Spanish readers got to know the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front. A summary of his articles is found in his books: Crónica de la Guerra (War Chronicles, 1915), Reflejos de la Tragedia (Reflections of the Tragedy, 1915), En las Trincheras (Inside the trenches, 1916), and En el Corazón de la Tragedia (At the heart of the tragedy, 1916), among others.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Purge {{focuses on}} two main females, {{both of whom}} reviewers have commented on as complex and are {{integral}} to understanding the themes of the book. The novel begins with Aliide Truu, an elderly woman who has survived many of the <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet occupation of Estonia. The Aliide who the reader first meets has alienated herself from the local people, though strongly self-reliant. Though cloaked in a rough exterior, she represents {{a woman who has}} weathered considerable hardship. She has hardly anything in the way of motherly instinct, especially in regards to the other main character, Zara.|$|E
50|$|Hooked on {{sniffing}} gas, glue, lighter fluid, airplane cement, Jesco {{was constantly}} finding himself {{in trouble with}} the law.

40|$|With <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{expanding}} <b>the</b> historiographic {{studies that}} limit {{the attention to}} the killings and <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blood, the article does an emphasis in the mechanisms thoughtto advance negotiations, agreements and transactions among hostiles {{during the first three}} post independence wars. For that it uses extensive references to <b>the</b> agents <b>of</b> peace, <b>the</b> expontions and <b>the</b> granting <b>of</b> pardons and amnesties...|$|R
