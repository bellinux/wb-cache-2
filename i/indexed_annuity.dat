50|$|The {{taxation}} of {{the gains}} in an <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> {{is identical to}} that of fixed annuities. Taxes are deferred until monies are received and then interest is withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income. If the index was owned outright, gains would not be tax deferred, but may qualify for the more favorable capital gains tax rate.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} {{traditional}} fixed annuities, {{money can be}} withdrawn from an <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> at any time (but such withdrawal {{may be subject to}} a surrender charge if the policy is still within the surrender charge period and the penalty-free withdrawal has already been exhausted). Owners may also choose to receive a payment based on the value of the policy for their lifetime (called annuitization).|$|E

5000|$|Equity-indexed annuities {{may also}} be {{referred}} to as fixed <b>indexed</b> <b>annuities</b> or simple <b>indexed</b> <b>annuities.</b> The mechanics of equity-indexed annuities are often complex and the returns can vary greatly depending on the month and year the annuity is purchased. Like many other types of annuities, equity-indexed annuities usually carry a surrender charge for early withdrawal. These [...] "surrender periods" [...] range between 3 and 16 years; typically, about ten.|$|R
50|$|Like {{traditional}} <b>annuities,</b> <b>indexed</b> <b>annuities</b> have surrender charges. These charges {{vary from}} 20% down to 1% and policies can have surrender charge periods ranging from 1 - 16 years. 10-13 {{years is the}} most common length of a surrender charge period on <b>indexed</b> <b>annuities.</b> Some policies measure the surrender charge period from the date the policy is issued, others apply the surrender charge period to each premium paid to the policy.|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, many indexed annuities can {{be issued}} with a rider {{designed}} to supply a lifetime income payment to the policyholder {{that does not}} require annuitization, thus leaving the policyholder {{in control of the}} balance of the account. These [...] "income riders" [...] are calculated separately than the <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> itself, however, they use the same initial premium figures for each calculation. An [...] "income rider" [...] generally will provide a specified accumulation rate which is guaranteed for a certain period of years. The [...] "income rider" [...] calculations create an [...] "income pool" [...] which is strictly an accounting figure that cannot be accessed as a single lump sum by the policyholder or beneficiary. The [...] "income pool" [...] continues to grow annually at the specified accumulation rate until such time the guarantee period expires or the policyholder opts to begin taking [...] "lifetime income payments" [...] from the account. Once [...] "lifetime income payments" [...] begin, the [...] "income pool" [...] stops accumulating, and the value of the income pool is used to determine the amount of income that will be paid out annually (it can usually be paid monthly, quarterly or semi-annually as well). The amount of income produced by the [...] "income rider" [...] will depend on several factors, primarily the age of the policyholder at the time they opt for income, the specified accumulation rate and the length of time the [...] "income pool" [...] has been given to accumulate. Each time an income payment is paid to the policyholder, the <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> account value is decreased by that same amount. [...] "Income riders" [...] that provide lifetime income are generally used as a means of allowing a policyholder to supplement their income, especially in retirement, without the possibility of outliving their money because even if the indexed annuity's account value falls to zero, the income payment from the [...] "income rider" [...] will continue until the death of the policyholder. If the policyholder dies and funds remain in the <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> account value, those funds would be paid to the beneficiary(-ies). Some of these income riders are offered with no fees, while others carry an annual fee (generally 1% or less) which is deducted directly from the <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> account value.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{category}} of deferred annuity, called the fixed <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> (FIA) emerged in 1995 (originally called an Equity-Indexed Annuity). Fixed indexed annuities may have features of both fixed and variable deferred annuities. The insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return for EIA. An investor can still lose money {{if he or}} she cancels (or surrenders) the policy early, before a [...] "break even" [...] period. An oversimplified expression of a typical EIA's rate of return might be that it is equal to a stated [...] "participation rate" [...] multiplied by a target stock market index's performance excluding dividends. Interest rate caps or an administrative fee may be applicable.|$|E
50|$|The <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> is {{virtually}} identical to a fixed annuity {{except in the}} way interest is calculated. As an example, consider a $100,000 fixed annuity that credits a 4% annual effective interest rate. The owner receives an interest credit of $4,000. However, in an equity-indexed annuity, the interest credit {{is linked to the}} equity markets. For example: Assume the index is the S&P 500, a one-year point-to-point method is used, and the annuity has an 8% cap. The $100,000 annuity could credit anything between 0% and 8% based on the change in the S&P 500. The cap, 8% in this example, is determined by how much is afforded by budget which is usually at or near the 4% fixed rate. If fixed rates increase, it would be expected that the cap would increase as well.|$|E
50|$|On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A {{claiming}} <b>indexed</b> <b>annuities</b> {{should be}} regulated as securities and {{should only be}} sold by registered representatives. A lawsuit was filed {{on the same day}} challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed <b>indexed</b> <b>annuities.</b> Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”) which exempted fixed <b>index</b> <b>annuities</b> from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 2016, {{the company}} offered several annuities: fixed {{immediate}} annuities, traditional fixed deferred <b>annuities,</b> and fixed <b>index</b> <b>annuities.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{contracts}} may {{be suitable}} {{for a portion of}} the asset portfolio {{for those who want to}} avoid risk and are in retirement or nearing retirement age. The objective of purchasing an equity <b>index</b> <b>annuity</b> is to realize greater gains than those provided by CDs, money markets or bonds, while still protecting principal. The long term ability of Equity <b>Index</b> <b>Annuities</b> to beat the returns of other fixed instruments is a matter of debate.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> (the word equity {{previously}} tied to indexed annuities {{has been}} removed to help prevent the assumption of stock market investing being present in these products) in the United States {{is a type of}} tax-deferred annuity whose credited interest is linked to an equity index [...] - [...] typically the S&P 500 or international index. It guarantees a minimum interest rate (typically between 1% and 3%) if held {{to the end of the}} surrender term and protects against a loss of principal. An equity index annuity is a contract with an insurance or annuity company. The returns may be higher than fixed instruments such as CDs, money market accounts, and bonds but not as high as market returns. Equity Index Annuities are insured by each State's Guarantee Fund; coverage is not as strong as the insurance provided by the FDIC. For example, in California the fund will cover [...] "80% not to exceed $250,000." [...] The guarantees in the contract are backed by the relative strength of the insurer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{policy year}} is {{measured}} {{from the day}} the premium is invested and not on a calendar year basis. Interest is credited to the policy only once a year on indexed interest crediting methods. Once interest is credited {{it can not be}} taken away in a subsequent year when the measuring index is a negative value. This feature of an index annuity {{is often referred to as}} an [...] "annual reset". The [...] "annual reset" [...] provides a second benefit aside from safeguarding the principal and subsequent interest gains, it also prevents the policy from having to recover from any sort of loss to the outside stock index in the previous policy year. For instance, if the S&P 500 index were to drop 40% during a policy year, the annuity would be credited with no interest for that policy year. However, if the S&P 500 had a calculated return of 10% the following year using an annual point-to-point calculation with a 6% cap, the annuity would earn 6% on top of where it had left off the policy year prior. An example of this benefit can be seen in this simple example that ignores dividends: A direct investment in an index with an initial investment $100,000, a 40% loss after one year takes the value to $60,000, a 10% gain the following year would increase the value to $66,000. The same investment being tracked in the index annuity with an initial investment of $100,000, a 40% loss after one year is replaced with a 0 and the account balance is still $100,000, the subsequent 10% gain the following year is reduced to 6% due to the cap, which would be a $6,000 gain, so the $100,000 investment would be worth $106,000. This particular example illustrates why these annuities tend to be marketed more heavily towards seniors/retirees, as an <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> provides a true safeguard against market losses but still offers a level of exposure to market-based returns.|$|E

40|$|The Equity <b>Indexed</b> <b>Annuity</b> (EIA) {{contract}} {{offers a}} proportional {{participation in the}} return on a specified equity index, {{in addition to a}} guaranteed return on the single premium.

We compare the accuracy of the lattice method with Monte Carlo simulation for the simple ratchet EIA and find that the lattice approach achieves a very high degree of accuracy much more efficiently than the Monte Carlo approach. The underlying life of contract guarantee value is estimated using Monte Carlo simulation; the value is shown to be very small compared with the ratchet part of the benefit...|$|E
40|$|The main {{problems}} facing annuity providers relate to adverse selection and mortality risk, the {{risk associated with}} mortality improvements, and to interest rate, reinvestment and in¯ation risk. Annuity providers hedge these risks, wherever possible, by holding suitable matching assets against their annuity liabilities: for example, riskless (government) ®xedincome bonds are used to provide the payments on level annuities, and index-linked bonds are needed if index-linked annuities are to be serviced effectively. However, {{in the absence of}} suitable matching assets, providers are unable to hedge the risks associated with mortality effectively and compensate for this by imposing substantial cost loadings. They also face reinvestment risk if available assets are of insuf®cient duration. Annuitants face interest rate risk prior to purchase and, since most of them prefer the higher initial income from a level annuity compared with an <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity,</b> in¯ation risk after purchase. Some solutions to these problems are considered, including a planned programme of phased annuity purchases to hedge interest rate risk, limited price index bonds to partially hedge in¯ation risk, and survivor (or indexed life) bonds, with coupons declining in direct proportion to the realized mortality of a selected group of annuitants, to hedge mortality risk. Finally, we examine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different institutional forms for the annuity market, ranging from monopoly provision through limited licensed provision to a fully competitive provision. 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{economic}} {{issues associated with}} the payout phase where a defined contribution (DC) retirement arrangement is adopted. In particular, the role of annuities in providing a retirement income is examined as well as insurance they provide against retirement risks such as inflation, longevity and rate of return volatility. A comprehensive money&# 146;s worth calculation based on a Australian population cohort mortality table shows that overall, Australian nominal and inflation indexed life annuities provide relatively good value for money. Although relative to annuities sold in the US and the UK they do suffer from relatively high adverse selection costs, which could in turn reduce demand. In addition, {{the presence of a}} government provided safety net pension could also result in low demand for annuities. These two issues suggest that government intervention may be warranted to ensure retirees have access to affordable private insurance to protect their retirement benefit. This could take the form of mandating an annuity purchase at retirement. However, which annuity should be mandated is not well understood. This is an important question as there are many alternative annuity designs, each providing different degrees of retirement risk protection to an individual. This thesis uses numerical simulations to empirically analyse {{the costs and benefits of}} mandating alternative annuities from both an individual and government&# 146;s perspectives to determine optimal annuity design. A model is used to estimate the value of payouts over time from various types of annuities across a range of retirement benefits. A means tested safety net pension is assumed to exist. Two stochastic variables &# 151; inflation and the risky rate of return, are simultaneously used to show how the annuity payouts react to theses changes, highlighting the insurance features of various annuities. Consumer preferences for the various annuities are estimated based on tolerance to risk. The variable annuity dominates the utility rankings under two conditions: [...] when the relative risk aversion is low and a safety net payment isn&# 146;t available, and when the relative risk aversion is high and a safety net payment is made. Otherwise the CPI <b>indexed</b> <b>annuity</b> has the highest ranking. Sensitivity analysis shows that the results presented here are robust to a number of alternative assumptions about the key variables...|$|E
