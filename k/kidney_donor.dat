40|$|Background/Aims: We have {{reported}} that the eGFR overestimates renal function when glycemic control is poor. It {{has been reported that}} eGFR calculated by serum creatinine underestimates GFR in living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors.</b> We compared the utility of the eGFR in diabetic patients, non-diabetic patients and living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors.</b> Forty diabetic patients, 40 non-diabetic patients, and 40 living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> were enrolled. Methods: GFR was measured by inulin clearance (Cin). eGFR was calculated based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr) or serum cystatin C (eGFRcys). We compared the agreements between each of the eGFR and Cin in each group. Results: There were significant and positive correlations between each eGFR and Cin in diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients. However, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between each eGFR and Cin in diabetic patients (ICC: eGFRcr 0. 699, eGFRcys 0. 604) were weaker than those in non-diabetic patients (ICC: eGFRcr 0. 865, eGFRcys 0. 803). The correlation coefficients between each eGFR and Cin (eGFRcr; r = 0. 422, p = 0. 0067 and eGFRcys; r = 0. 358, p = 0. 0522) in living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> were significantly weaker than those in non-diabetic patients. The ICCs between each eGFR and Cin (ICC: eGFRcr 0. 340, eGFRcys 0. 345) in living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> were significantly weaker than those in non-diabetic patients. Conclusions: Based on Cin, eGFR was accurate in non-diabetic patients. However, eGFR was inaccurate in living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> and relatively inaccurate in diabetic patients...|$|R

In discussion {{of the development of}} [...] "Kidney Now!", Richmond said that Carlock and Fey [...] "were trying {{to figure out a way}} to highlight Jack's dad in getting a kidney and how they're going to deal with that", and that the two came to the decision to [...] "take advantage of the singing", as they have done so in the past with different 30 Rock episodes, in which the show's characters have sung songs. Carlock and Fey agreed to the idea that a song be included in the season finale, but that it be an anthem like the 1985 charity song, [...] "We Are the World", [...] as the cause is that the Milton Greene character is in need of a <b>kidney</b> <b>donor.</b> [...] "Basically, the parameters were if 'We Are the World' but they want to get a kidney. I think we had angles that everyone has two kidneys and you'll only need one kidney, and we thought 'Alright, we'll get some distance on that'", said Richmond. While working on the track, Fey suggested to Richmond that he incorporate Milton Greene's name in one part of the song, which he did, as this was sung by singers Cyndi Lauper and Robert Randolph.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study in which <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> with 1 year or more after donation were included. 69 <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> with a mean duration of 5. 86 years after kidney donation were studied. Serum phosphate level, fractional excretion of phosphorus [FE Pi] and serum levels of parathyroid hormone were measured.

40|$|Since living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> have {{repeatedly}} {{been shown to}} be mentally more healthy compared to the general population, they might also exhibit more adaptive personality characteristics. We investigated the personality traits of 315 living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> (202 female and 113 male donors) on average 7. 1 [*]years after donation using the NEO-Five Factor Inventory, a frequently used personality inventory measuring the “big five” dimensions of personality (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness). In addition, levels of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-Depression Scale, GAD- 7, and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory. <b>Kidney</b> <b>donors</b> showed more adaptive personality traits with higher agreeableness and lower neuroticism scores compared to the German general population. This was even more pronounced in living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> with a high motivation to donate again (non-regreters). Scores for depression, anxiety, and fatigue did not differ from general population values and were significantly correlated with most personality dimensions. The more adaptive personality characteristics of living <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> might either be a selection effect or the consequence of the experience of donation and improved health of the close relative. Regardless of the causal relationship, adaptive personality traits might positively influence both physical and psychosocial well-being of the donor. Longitudinal studies should investigate if living donation might lead to persistent adaptive changes in personality traits...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{dramatic}} {{shortage of}} <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> has triggered interest in {{other sources of}} organs, such as donors without a heartbeat. Accumulating {{evidence suggests that the}} short-term survival of cadaveric <b>kidneys</b> from such <b>donors</b> {{is similar to that of}} cadaveric <b>kidneys</b> from <b>donors</b> with a heartbeat. However, no data from large, matched studies with long-term follow-up are available. We conducted a matched, single-center study of kidney transplants obtained from donors without a heartbeat and those from donors with a heartbeat, with a 15 -year follow-up period. METHODS: Between 1985 and 2000, 122 <b>kidney</b> transplantations involving <b>donors</b> without a heartbeat were performed at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. Outcomes of these procedures were compared with those of 122 transplantations of <b>kidneys</b> from <b>donors</b> with a heartbeat. The recipients were matched according to age, sex, number of transplantations, and calendar period of transplantation. RESULTS: The characteristics of the recipients did not differ significantly between the two groups. We observed a significantly higher incidence of delayed graft function among the patients who received <b>kidneys</b> from <b>donors</b> without a heartbeat (48. 4 percent) than among the patients who received <b>kidneys</b> from <b>donors</b> with a heartbeat (23. 8 percent) (P< 0. 001).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, quality of life and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> undergoing nephrectomy. METHOD: This prospective cohort enrolled 110 consecutive <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> undergoing nephrectomy. Subjects underwent pulmonary function (using spirometry) and respiratory muscular strength (using manovacuometry) assessments on the day prior to surgery and 1, 2, 3 and 5 days postoperatively.

40|$|Background Hyperuricaemia is a {{well known}} side-effect of {{cyclosporin}} A (CsA) treatment. The pathogenic mechanisms, however, remain controversial. There is no convincing evidence that hyperuricaemia is due to CsA-induced, impaired tubular handling of uric acid. The impact of diminished GFR in this particular context has never been investigated. Methods We prospectively studied plasma uric acid, inulin clearances, and fractional clearances of uric acid in two groups of CsA-treated patients (bone-marrow transplant patients, n= 50; renal transplant patients, n= 32), and one healthy control group without CsA (living related <b>kidney</b> <b>donors,</b> n= 28). Bone-marrow transplant patients were examined before transplantation and 6, 12, 18, 24 months after transplantation, renal transplant patients 1 year after transplantation, and living related <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> before and 1 year after unilateral nephrectomy. Results After 1 year of CsA treatment, hyperuricaemia was found in 36 % of bone-marrow transplant patients and in 53 % of renal transplant patients. Thirty per cent of living related <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> were borderline hyperuricaemic 1 year after unilateral nephrectomy. The fractional clearance of uric acid, measured serially in bone-marrow transplant patients did not change significantly over time; it was, however, slightly higher during CsA treatment than after CsA withdrawal. Moreover, the bone-marrow transplant patients' fractional clearance of uric acid was not statistically different from the renal transplant patients' and the living related kidney donors' (values 1 year after transplantation/unilateral nephrectomy: bone-marrow transplant patients, 15. 3 ± 2. 3 %; renal transplant patients, 11. 9 ± 0. 9 %; living related <b>kidney</b> <b>donors,</b> 11. 1 ± 0. 8 %). The GFR at 1 year, measured by inulin clearance, was identical in the CsA-treated groups and slightly higher in the living related <b>kidney</b> <b>donors</b> (bone-marrow transplant patients, 51 ± 6 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 renal transplant patients, 49 ± 3 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 living related <b>kidney</b> <b>donors,</b> 61 ± 2 ml/min per 1. 73 min 2).
