These <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> allow {{not only for}} removing moral hazard and adverse selection as index insurances do, but also for adding more flexibility and, hence, better risk protection. The evaluation of these <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> uses FADN farm data of Belgium from 1990 to 2007. Area indexes based on yield and yield-in-value perform well in stabilising revenues from some farm activities, but badly from some others. The variation in the estimated actuarially fair premiums across agricultural area shows the importance of designing those <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> according to homogenous agricultural area...|$|R
40|$|How do {{liquidation}} values affect <b>financial</b> <b>contract</b> renegotiation? While the "incomplete-contracting" {{theory of}} <b>financial</b> <b>contracting</b> predicts that liquidation values determine {{the allocation of}} bargaining power between creditors and debtors, there is little empirical evidence on <b>financial</b> <b>contract</b> renegotiations and the role asset values play in such bargaining. This paper attempts to fill this gap. We develop an incomplete-contracting model of <b>financial</b> <b>contract</b> renegotiation and estimate it using data on the airline industry in the United States. We find that airlines successfully renegotiate their lease obligations downward when their financial position is sufficiently poor and when the liquidation value of their fleet is low. Our results show that strategic renegotiation is common in the airline industry. Moreover, the results {{emphasize the importance of}} the incomplete contracting perspective to real-world <b>financial</b> <b>contract</b> renegotiation.

40|$|Previous {{literature}} {{presented a}} predation model based on agency problems in <b>financial</b> <b>contracting.</b> In that model, predation reduced preyâ€™s cash flow through breaking {{the relationship between}} the prey and its investors as the prey is financially constrained. This paper presents a different model in which both the predator and the prey are financially constrained and in need of external funding. The only dissimilarity between the predator and the prey is their corresponding level of bargaining power in <b>financial</b> <b>contracting</b> over their respective investors. The asymmetry of bargaining power is the unique source of predatory behavior. <b>Financial</b> <b>contract</b> between firm with less bargaining power (prey) and its investor can deter predation if the predator cannot renegotiate the contract with its own investor. If renegotiation is available for the predator, no <b>financial</b> <b>contract</b> can successfully deter predation. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere are {{conflicts}} between risk sharing and incentive provision in <b>financial</b> <b>contracting</b> under information asymmetry.

Credit risk transfer changes incentive structure of <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> and has dilution effect on incentive of risk seller. Contract design and reputation discipline may reduce moral hazard but cannot eliminate it. Furthermore, {{the complexity of}} structured products created through financial engineering along the risk transfer chain makes the markets very opaque, which magnifies the information problems to the extreme. The inherent fragility of CRT markets provides an important role for regulation to improve risk allocation...|$|R

The necessary intermediation of insurance companies in the conception of such contracts is emphasized as well as the impact of unfair premia.

40|$|Integration of {{physical}} transactions and <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> {{is central to}} successful electricity market design. Virtually every energy transaction has some impact on prices. The mere fact that a physical transaction can affect prices to some degree, and thereby influence the prices of related <b>financial</b> <b>contracts,</b> cannot be a per se definition of price manipulation. A principled policy for characterizing price manipulation in organized electricity markets includes a stand-alone profitability test. Multiple market-clearing prices arise from degenerate pricing conditions that can occur in electricity markets under economic dispatch. In some instances, small changes in bilateral schedules can produce large changes in prices. These prices affect the value of associated financial transmission rights. A stand-alone profitability test distinguishes transactions {{that are consistent with}} workably competitive markets from transactions that serve no economic purpose other than to manipulate prices and profit from other <b>financial</b> <b>contracts.</b> Generalizing this standard to the degenerate conditions that give rise to multiple market-clearing prices provides a principled solution without undermining the market-design foundations that integrate economic dispatch, locational prices and financial transmission rights...|$|R

In contrast to previous literature on costly state verification and <b>financial</b> <b>contracting,</b> we find that standard debt contracts are not optimal when tax evasion is possible. Instead, the optimal contract is debt-like only for very low and very high profit realizations, and features a constant repayment and verification of returns in an intermediate range. This occurs because the entrepreneur has {{to be given a}} positive rent even under verification in order to not abuse her limited liability protection for excessive tax evasion activities...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{connection}} between the duration of <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> and that of labour contracts. Workers with long-term contracts have incentives to invest in training. This makes them attractive to the entrepreneur. Furthermore, this behaviour will be reinforced if <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> are long-term, because it reduces the probability of an early liquidation as well as the dismissal of trained workers. As a conclusion, significant increases in the length of financing contracts should be accompanied by corresponding increases in the length of labour contracts. Support for this theoretical contention is found by testing it on a dataset composed of Spanish manufacturing firms for the period 1991 - 2000. ...|$|R
