50|$|Girls {{are usually}} married {{at an early}} age. If a woman wants to change husbands, she will {{write a letter to}} her {{prospective}} husband offering herself in marriage and informing the would-be groom how much her current husband paid for her. This is because the new husband must pay double if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her.</b> For example, if the current husband paid one cow for her, then the new husband must pay two cows to the original husband if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

He forced her into hard labour and reduced her food and drink but this did not cause her to yield.|$|E
25|$|Governor Ventura sparked media {{criticism}} when, {{nearing the}} end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, Mae Schunk, an opportunity to serve as governor. He further stated that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to be the state's first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors. Ventura quickly retreated from the comments, saying he was just floating an idea.|$|E
25|$|Young Princess Maria, who by {{request of}} King Gustaf V of Sweden twice {{stayed with the}} Queen and Munthe at Capri, found his {{influence}} damaging and his powers hypnotic. Years later she asserted that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to be his patient at age 23 and made physical advances toward her, and that the horror she then felt toward the Swedish royal family, because of their unlimited support of Munthe, was the main reason she fled them and filed for divorce from Prince Wilhelm.|$|E

25|$|For Kelly Kapowski, {{the love}} {{interest}} of both Zack and Slater, producers {{were able to}} narrow the field down to three actresses: Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, and Jennie Garth. Engel had originally met Thiessen in 1988 while casting for Good Morning, Miss Bliss and was impressed with how much her acting had improved. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> for the role, believing she had the perfect all-American girl appeal for the role, while others felt that Berkley, as the more experienced actress, {{would be a more}} reliable choice. Ultimately, Engel convinced the others after a read-through with Lopez, and Thiessen received the role.|$|E
25|$|Empress Dowager Dong (died 189), {{personal}} name unknown, formally known as Empress Xiaoren, was an empress dowager of the Eastern Han dynasty. She was never empress throughout her life {{because she was}} the wife of a marquis; she only became empress dowager because her son, Liu Hong (Emperor Ling), became the emperor by chance. During her son's reign, she developed a rivalry with her daughter-in-law, Empress He, because she wanted Emperor Ling's younger son, Liu Xie, to be crown prince while Empress <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> own son, Liu Bian to succeed his father. Emperor Ling died in 189 before he managed to designate either of his two sons as crown prince. Liu Bian eventually took the throne as Emperor Shao; Empress Dowager Dong, as the emperor's grandmother, became grand empress dowager, while her daughter-in-law became empress dowager. Empress Dowager He eventually conspired with her brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, to unseat her mother-in-law from power. Grand Empress Dowager Dong died of illness shortly after her downfall; the common people held Empress Dowager He and her family responsible for the grand empress dowager's death.|$|E

On this discovery, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to have an abortion, but she decided to keep the child.

500|$|During a 1900 Congressional deadlock, she {{departed}} for Honolulu with her Washington, D.C., Doctor Charles H. English (sometimes {{referred to as}} John H. English). Newspapers speculated that the Queen, having been diagnosed with cancer, was going home to die. Historian Helena G. Allen {{made the case that}} English intended to gain title to crown lands for himself. According to Allen, the Queen balked at his draft of a settlement letter to Senator George Frisbie Hoar that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to copy in her handwriting and sign. A month after her return, the Doctor was terminated [...] "without cause" [...] and subsequently sued her.|$|E
500|$|Another American star {{provided}} by Robert L. Lippert was Margia Dean, who played Judith Carroon. A former beauty queen, Dean was allegedly cast {{on account of}} her association with the 20th Century Fox president, Spyros Skouras. According to executive producer Michael Carreras, [...] "Skouras had a girlfriend who was an actress and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> in pictures, but he didn't want her in pictures in America, because of the tittle-tattle or whatever, so he set it up though his friend Bob Lippert". Val Guest recalled of her, [...] "She was a sweet girl, but she couldn't act". Her American accent was considered {{out of place in}} the film and so her lines were dubbed in post production.|$|E

500|$|... "Burn" [...] was {{considered}} a [...] "window to Usher's inner thoughts", along with the controversial track [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II". The song is about breakups and ending relationships. According to Matt Cibula of Popmatters, [...] "Burn" [...] is constructed from [...] "two-step concept". In the lyrics [...] "You know that it's over / You {{know that it was}} through / Let it burn / Got to let it burn", Usher breaks up with his woman but found her sad about feeling bad about what happened to their relationship. However, Usher says that she must deal with it before she can accept the truth. For the lines [...] "It's been fifty-eleven days / Umpteen hours / I'm gonna be burnin' / Till you return", the direction changes after Usher realized that breaking up with her was a huge mistake and that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> back.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Neil Cross. Before he started writing Cross did not know Connie was the mole from the {{previous}} episode, so he included it {{to help with the}} storyline. The character was originally intended to be killed {{by the end of the}} last episode, but Cross kept her alive until the end of the finale. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> killed off at this episode, as he was the one who created Connie in the sixth series, and felt it gratifying to kill off a character he created. In writing the plot, Cross was inspired by the Rupert Walters script for [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] from the third series, which revealed a series of weapons caches throughout the United Kingdom set up by the Russians during the Cold War; Cross wanted to use that as a way to introduce the nuclear suitcase bomb. The bombs design from the episode was based from actual designs, but invented its failsafes.|$|E
500|$|Noreen was put {{in solitary}} {{confinement}} in an [...] cell without windows at the Lahore prison. Before his assassination, Taseer visited her at the jail several times with his wife, Aamna, and daughter, Shehrbano, though Pakistani court officials later ruled {{that she could be}} visited only by her husband and lawyer. Khalid Sheikh, the prison superintendent, said that while <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to be treated [...] "like any other prisoner", she had to be kept away from other inmates for her own well-being, as other individuals accused of blasphemy had been killed while in prison. Out of concern that she could be poisoned, prison officials began giving Noreen raw materials to cook her own food. The Masihi Foundation, a human rights group, described her physical condition as [...] "very frail", and her health was reported to be in decline due to poor living conditions at the jail. She has also been threatened by other inmates and subjected to physical abuse from prison guards.|$|E

500|$|Bauer started courting her in 1903, {{but since}} they were apart most of the time, this was done by mail. Their {{relationship}} developed as they shared their dreams, aspirations, doubts and insecurities in their correspondence. For Bauer, Ellqvist became his inspiration, muse, and [...] "fairy princess"; it was as such he painted {{her for the first}} time in Sagoprinsessan (The Fairy Princess). He made sketches for the painting in 1904, and finalized them in an oil painting in 1905. Ellqvist is portrayed as a strong, enlightened and unobtainable Valkyrie. The painting was shown at Bauer's first exhibition at the Valand Academy in Gothenburg in 1905 (where he was one of eleven debutants) and in Norrköping in 1906, where it was sold to a private collector. It is now in the Jönköpings läns museum. Bauer tried to mold Ellqvist into his vision of a creature of the woods and as the perfect artist's wife; <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to make a home for them in a romantic cottage in the woods, while he wandered about the forest seeking inspiration.|$|E
500|$|As for her name, Kubo stated that, because Kuchiki [...] "looks like a shinigami", <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> name {{to sound}} like {{something}} a shinigami would have as a name.

Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which her name is derived means [...] "light" [...] and Kubo sees her as [...] "a ray of light for Ichigo." [...] Shonen Jump asked in an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it. After designing Rukia's zanpakutō, Kubo noted he liked it a lot and made it to be the most beautiful one from the series.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Whitney was {{guaranteed}} {{to appear in}} seven of the first 13 episodes, and contracted for four days work on each. However, she was used for nine additional days, leading D'Agosta to suggest to Roddenberry that if guest stars instead played the similar role but with different characters then they [...] "would cost less and hold as much value". He added that they should instead look to using Whitney on a free-lance basis instead of under permanent contract. By September 8, 1966, Whitney's agent had been informed that her contract had been terminated, which was around a week prior to the shoot of her final episode, [...] "The Conscience of the King". Roddenberry told Whitney that he didn't want to lose Rand as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> relationship with Kirk to continue. In a memo to Gene Coon on October 27, 1966, Roddenberry suggested bringing Whitney back as Rand, albeit with a different hairstyle {{similar to the way}} she wore it in Police Story as this [...] "made her look much younger and softer", but she was never invited back to the series.|$|E
