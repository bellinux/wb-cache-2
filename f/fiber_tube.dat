The Defense Department agreed to evaluate the shorter and lighter M4 version over the next two years; testing and qualifications were planned to be completed in spring 2017, and the weapon type classified as the M3A1 in fall 2017, making the system available for procurement to all Department of Defense services.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{prefabricated}} Aramid Fiber Reinforced Polymer (AFRP) tubed concrete columns with metallic and/or nonmetallic reinforcement, the AFRP {{square tube}} performs the dual functions of stay-in-place formwork and transverse reinforcement. Nine column specimens including a hybrid concrete column with steel bars or AFRP rods for longitudinal reinforcement, were tested under cyclic lateral forces while simultaneously {{subjected to a}} constant axial load. Double confinement due to an aramid <b>fiber</b> <b>tube</b> and steel hoops with cross ties can provide a much greater transverse confinement effect. The ply of composite laminates can be designed such that when the shear and the bond strengths exceed the flexural strengths, adequate seismic performance of the hybrid RC columns can be ensured.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study that was conducted to investigate the effects of key parameters on the compressive behavior of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) -concrete-steel double-skin tubular columns (FSDT). Hybrid FSDT columns have been introduced as a new form of hybrid columns. They consist of an outer tube made of FRP and inner tube made of steel, with sandwiched concrete between them. This paper investigated the effect of fiber angle and the ratio of steel tube diameter to its thickness (Di/ts) on the compressive behavior of FSDT columns. Six FSDT cylinders with different (Di/ts) in addition to two concrete filled-fiber tuber (CFFT) cylinders were manufactured and tested under axial cyclic compression. The results of the experimental study indicate that the overall behavior of FSDT and CFFT is similar and the main difference is in the capacity load. The cylinders with high D/t ratio achieves lower capacity than the normal capacity due to the local buckling of the steel tubes. Using the saturated <b>fiber</b> <b>tube</b> increases the axial ductility but does not give high confinement. These results are presented together with a discussion on the influence of the studied parameters on the compressive behavior of FSDTs...|$|E

Wound-healing results showed that 5 -formylhonokiol significantly and dose-dependently inhibited migration of cultured human umbilical vein enthothelial cells. The invasiveness of HUVEC cells was also effectively suppressed at a low concentration of 5 -formylhonokiol in the transwell assay.
