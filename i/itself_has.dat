5|$|Although many false {{claims of}} its {{discovery}} were {{made over the}} years, the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in 1940. Since then, most neptunium has been and still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors. The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors. While neptunium <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> no commercial uses at present, it {{is used as a}} precursor for the formation of plutonium-238, used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft. Neptunium has also been used in detectors of high-energy neutrons.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E

The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of Proto-Indo-European society were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.|$|E

Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> been highly influential to the future-noir genre. Blade Runner has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement. It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight {{is one of}} {{the four}} most-spoken Berber languages, in {{addition}} to Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff, and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco.

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Knuckles' Chaotix, both {{contemporary and}} in retrospect, has been mixed. Critics found the partner mechanic and tethering physics to be cumbersome, although many journalists appreciated Sega's attempt to innovate the series. The level design was also cited as poor by multiple publications. The game {{has been considered}} the last classic game of the Sonic series and a declining point. Some characters and concepts introduced in Knuckles' Chaotix were later featured in other Sonic games and media.

5|$|Despite Mega Man 4 {{receiving}} positive critical reviews {{during its}} early 1990s release, {{the game is}} widely regarded today to represent a downward shift from {{the quality of the}} first three games in the series.
