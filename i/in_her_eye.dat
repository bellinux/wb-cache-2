5|$|As {{the clerics}} set up base camp, River accesses {{footage of the}} Angel from the Byzantium to verify its secure. She and the Doctor leave to study a text written about Angels, {{learning}} that even an image of an Angel can become an Angel itself. They are unaware that Amy stayed to watch the footage, and when she blinks, the Angel appears to move. The Doctor helps her stop the video feed, and believes Amy is safe, but she feels something <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E

5|$|Father Octavian orders them to set {{out through}} a cave system to reach the Byzantium, using a gravity globe to {{illuminate}} the cave. The Doctor and River comment on the various statues they pass, believing they are made by the planet's natives, until they recall the natives are two-headed beings and the statues are only single-headed. They conclude they must be weakened Weeping Angels, and that the Angel on the Byzantium purposely crashed the ship here to rescue its kind. The Angels start to pursue the group. Amy finds that she cannot move, and the Doctor realises {{that the image of}} the Angel still exists <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> and is making her believe this; he bites her wrist to prove she is still mobile, and they continue to flee.|$|E
5|$|Following the cliffhanger of the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith), his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), River Song, and Father Octavian (Iain Glen) and his militarised clerics have escaped entrapment by the Weeping Angels, creatures who only move when unobserved by others. They take refuge inside the crashed starship Byzantium, but the Angels pursue them and Amy is {{on the brink of}} dying from the imprint of an Angel <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> Both the Angels and the Doctor's team face danger from a widening crack in space and time which has the power to erase persons from history.|$|E
5|$|Zero {{was created}} by Taro Yoko, the game's {{director}} and co-writer, and designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Yoko wanted an unusual type of protagonist {{that had not been}} featured very often in games. Fujisaka crafted her to emulate the dark tones of the series, although he also added features to create a feminine vibe, such as the flower <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> Despite being criticized for her characterization and personality, she has also been praised for her interactions with the other characters and for standing out among video game protagonists. Fans of the Drakengard series in Japan have also received her positively.|$|E

5|$|In Zloda, Belarus, Amador {{uses the}} {{diamonds}} as payment for a proxcard {{to access the}} Todorov Building in Minsk. The team tracks her there, but Amador escapes. Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover {{to be coming from}} a camera <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing the name of the hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her prosthetic eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through the eye, can kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye.|$|E

Bill turns around and Heather has left. Within the puddle, a voice proclaims that {{a search for a}} pilot has begun.|$|E
25|$|On 2 January 1995, the stripe {{theme was}} modified; the pointed 'G' was larger {{on the blue}} stripe against a {{computer}} generated multicoloured background and the 'G' was created by filming a large perspex 'G' with motion control photography. This ident was used, {{from a variety of}} angles, until 7 November 1999, by which point additional idents based on surreal surroundings, such as a fish blowing a bubble with a G inside, which floated to the surface, or a camera zoom into the eye of a housewife to reveal the G <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> were introduced.|$|E

500|$|The teams {{wanted to}} [...] "maintain {{some sort of}} the Megan Fox allure" [...] but {{said that it was}} [...] "incredibly {{difficult}} because as soon as [...] warped her face in any direction, the shine kind of came off it". To combat this, they ended up focusing on anything below her nose, where they had the freedom to make things [...] "as horrific as [...] needed to" [...] and then above her nose, [...] " [...] could manipulate it somewhat with warps and color correction <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> sockets. So even at her worst, she had some of that sexiness throughout".|$|E
500|$|Alexandra {{retained}} a youthful appearance into her senior years, {{but during the}} war her age caught up with her. She took to wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup, which was described by gossips as having her face [...] "enamelled". She made no more trips abroad, and suffered increasing ill health. In 1920, a blood vessel <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> burst, leaving her with temporary partial blindness. Towards {{the end of her}} life, her memory and speech became impaired. She died on 20 November 1925 at Sandringham after suffering a heart attack, and was buried in an elaborate tomb next to her husband in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E
500|$|Zero was {{designed}} by Kimihiko Fujisaka, a designer who had worked on each entry in the Drakengard series. His original design was meant to emulate her status as a god-like being, and have a more elaborate and heroic appearance, but as the game's atmosphere was finalized, Fujisaka redesigned her with some unaesthetic elements, taking direct influence from the game atmosphere: this was the main reason behind adding her prosthetic arm. The original creation of the arm was a pure accident on Fujisaka's part. Her color palate {{was intended as a}} reverse of Caim, the protagonist of Drakengard. Other aspects of her design evoked the color and design for the Goddess of the Seal, a key character in the earlier Drakengard games. She went through two redesigns before Yoko was satisfied. Her final design, along with the flower <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> emphasized her sexuality. She originally had no flower in her design, but Fujisaka wanted to add an aspect of femininity to her appearance. The decision to place it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> was to add originality to the character: while the game's producer Takamata Shiba originally feared it {{was too much of a}} risk in conjunction with her gender, Yoko approved of the design. After Zero was finalized, Yoko decided on more female characters, and told Fujisaka to [...] "think Puella Magi Madoka Magica" [...] while designing them. Elements of her design were incorporated into the other Intoners. Her design, along with the rest of the main characters, was inspired by modern clothing styles and fashion in contrast to the [...] "medieval" [...] inspiration of previous games.|$|E

500|$|Producers {{identified}} {{the scene in}} which Elsa sings [...] "Let It Go" [...] as a pivotal point in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to [...] "let go" [...] of her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, [...] "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit! But there's a gleam <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> and a supermodel walk {{that goes with it}} and, for me, it was fun to be a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y favorite thing about it ... is the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like {{realism and}} satire, parody was welcome at the Folies-Nouvelles. [...] In 1858, Donizetti's opera Lucrezia Borgia {{was given a}} drubbing in Legrand and Bridault's In Venice, or Dagger, Gallows, and Rat Poison. [...] Among {{the members of the}} cast were Pierrotini (Legrand), [...] "of noble race but very clumsy", Caliborgna, [...] "so named because of a halberd that had been stuck <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> and forgotten", and Gros-Bêta, [...] "villain, with no manners whatsoever". 1023, MS 4224 (censor's copy, {{entitled}} Un Drame à Venise), leaf descriptive of characters (unpaginated), Archives Nationales de France, Paris; tr. Storey, Pierrots on the stage, p. 69. [...] Legrand was not above poking fun at himself—as he did in The Little Cendrillon (1857), a tale, as Storey puts it, [...] "of a white-faced Cinderfella", or in Le Grand Poucet (1858), the punning title of which alerted his audience to the ensuing self-mocking fun. [...] As his tenure at the Folies drew to a close, Legrand could even be said to have been teetering on a kind of pantomimic decadence. [...] Storey describes a piece from the last year before he left the theater:In Bridault's Les Folies-Nouvelles peintes par elles-mêmes [...] (1858), which announced the theater's reopening after summer renovations of the salle, the concierge of the establishment, one Père Pétrin, invokes the pantomimic muse of its stage. [...] It is she, he remarks, to whom the audience owes its entertainment, she who inspires its authors [...] "in the simple goal of molding the mind and the heart." [...] He cites as examples of such inspiration the maxims that conclude Pierrot millionnaire [...] and Le Petit Cendrillon: [...] "Money does not bring happiness!" [...] and [...] "Polished boots make good husbands!" [...] The muse replies: [...] "You're caustic, Père Pétrin!" [...] 1024, unnumbered MS (censor's copy), p. 2, Archives Nationales de France, Paris.|$|E
2500|$|Mel's exit storyline {{was linked}} to Steve's death, and Outhwaite claimed that viewers would be gripped by the storyline right up until her own exit {{a few months after}} Steve's. She commented, [...] "Mel is devastated by Steve's death. She thinks that Phil caused it and rushes into the Vic and goes for him. Mel acts brave, but inside she is breaking. She is given a {{necklace}} of black pearls on the day Steve dies and it breaks her heart. She knows Phil was involved in the death but can't prove it. He has been nothing but trouble for her and she won't try to build bridges now [...] Mel looks brave on the outside but inside she's cracking up." [...] In the on-screen events, Mel's anger turns to devastation when Phil informs her that Steve had been having sex with his sister Sam Mitchell. After being arrested over Steve's money laundering and discovering she was pregnant with Steve's baby, Mel confronted everyone who had wronged her before leaving Walford. At the time, Outhwaite stated that her final scenes were the hardest that she'd ever filmed. Tony Stewart, critic for The Mirror suggested that Mel's exit in April 2002 was thrilling and described it as [...] "a devastating story of betrayal and her ultimate revenge [...] one by one her friends desert her." [...] Stewart praised Mel's final scene with the following description: [...] "When she faces her last exit at Victoria Coach Station, there is a glint <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> as Mel looks at the destination board and speaks on her mobile. 'Pick a number for me,' she says. 'One to 20. Great. Thank you.' And with that she is gone... but never forgotten." ...|$|E

2500|$|Juri's {{shirt was}} modeled after a spider, {{and left the}} sides of her breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. Her pants were {{designed}} to give a [...] "silhouette that looks like a taekwondo uniform." [...] The black trim on her pants was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less [...] "frivolous." [...] A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally in her stomach, similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one of her palms, one of her legs, or one of her ankles. They eventually settled on putting it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> with design director Kamei commenting that a [...] "big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going to look very attractive." [...] He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made slimmer, though the team noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision.|$|E
