60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> whispered good-night. Then I went home, heavily.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{invented a}} little {{difficulty}} with my coffee pot.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{was passing}} {{on to my}} study. Perkins {{followed}} me.|$|E
60|$|We Woosters can {{bite the}} bullet. <b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> moodily <b>and</b> speared another slab of omelette.|$|R
60|$|He {{glared at}} me. <b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> {{slightly}} <b>and</b> murmured that doubtless {{there was much}} subtle truth in his view.|$|R
60|$|I {{would listen}} to him go on praising Mina for a day, so <b>I</b> simply <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> stood silent.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> led Marie aside {{behind some}} thorn trees that grew near.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{followed}} the man, who {{was waiting in}} the doorway, to my room.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> drank my coffee. Grooton was {{watching}} me {{with an air of}} respectful interest.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> my head, <b>and</b> she, having {{recovered}} herself, waited expectantly.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> assent, <b>and</b> {{advancing}} cautiously, we peeped {{over the}} bushes. The sight that met our eyes was so irresistibly comic {{that we could}} scarcely restrain our laughter.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} sharply {{at the doctor}} from such pensive embroidery, and found him {{as far away as}} <b>I.</b> He <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> smiled, and we shook hands on the bank in the thick mist.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> turned cold {{all over}} my body, for I could guess what was coming.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{he closed}} the door and disappeared. Fenton would have gone, too, but I stopped him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{we went to}} {{that corner}} of the plateau where Shadrach stood apart, {{watching}} and listening.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He knowed I did, so <b>I</b> only <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>nodded</b> back again. '"Anybody but me 'ud {{call you}} a fool, Sim," [...] he says. [...] "Lie down. Here comes the Pope's Blessing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Is this piled earth our Being's passless mound? [...] Tell me, cold grave! is Death with poppies crown'd? [...] Tired Sentinel! mid fitful starts <b>I</b> <b>nod,</b> [...] <b>And</b> fain would sleep, though pillowed on a clod! [...] 50 ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> my thanks, <b>and</b> strolled back to Elsie's. Dear little Elsie was in {{transports}} {{of surprise}} when I related my adventure.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> made {{a restless}} {{movement}} with my book {{as evidence that}} I desired to resume my reading.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> passed on, {{wondering}} {{to myself}} why Stephen had suddenly determined {{to stay the}} night on the Maria.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> went on. I {{went on to}} our chamber, {{for there}} I thought that I should find Otomie.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> {{with eyes}} <b>and</b> face mirthful of appreciation, and Prince Akuli, with another {{apprehensive}} {{glance at the}} old wahine and her half-made hala lei, returned to his tale of the bones of his ancestors.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> sympathetically, <b>and</b> the trooper, {{who looked}} away from {{me out of the}} window, said: [...] "Talk of the devil! All men, it is said, are equal in this country, but I fancy there's a grade between most of us and your acquaintance, Foster Lane. The fellow has passed the corral, and I can't get out without meeting him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you come}} back, Jack, may I have two words {{with you all}} to ourselves?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> in reply <b>and</b> went out. I found no {{difficulty}} about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to {{come up in the}} evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{went to the}} man, who was one {{of those}} that had defended Maraisfontein with me, a good fellow unless he got near liquor.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{left the}} cafe. Of the hall-porter I made an inquiry {{as to the}} man who had had a fit in the cafe earlier in the evening.|$|E
6000|$|I noticed Wada {{standing}} in the cabin door, evidently waiting to ask for instructions. <b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> prepared to follow him inside. Mr. Pike looked at me quickly and said: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> my head <b>and</b> {{proceeded}} {{to make a}} flank attack on the nearest harem. All went well until I aimed a blow at an outlying cowls head and fell short. She snorted and tried to scramble away. I ran in close and struck another blow, hitting the shoulder instead of the head.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> my head, <b>and</b> having {{kissed my}} hand in his silly fashion in token of much {{that he did not}} wish to say, Hans slipped out of sight, saying that he hoped to be back within an hour. Except for his great knife, he went unarmed, who feared that if he took a pistol he might be tempted to fire it and make a noise.|$|R
60|$|Oh, certainly, <b>I</b> savve'd. <b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> my head, <b>and,</b> as one man to another, {{thanked him}} for his tip; and drifted back to the group at the bar. No; I did not treat. I never dreamed that I was {{expected}} to treat. I left with Spider, and my ears burn now as I try to surmise the things they must have said about me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{looked him}} over. By day he made as {{striking}} a figure as I had noted by night, {{but the light}} was not generous to his dark face.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> did {{not pursue}} the subject. On {{my way back}} to my rooms half an hour later I stopped to speak for a few minutes with the hall-porter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} are {{fortunate}} in our doctor!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> was about to add something in praise of his acumen, when there came a low tapping at the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all {{you have}} done, but you really must now {{take care not to}} {{overwork}} yourself. You are looking pale yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit, that you do!" [...] As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long an unwonted drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me. <b>I</b> smiled <b>and</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> laid my finger on my lips. With a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.|$|R
5000|$|... "DeMille {{asked me}} to come in. His office at Paramount was {{bursting}} with books, props, rolls of linens. I told him I'd have to wear an Egyptian false nose and he pounded the table. 'No. Baxter, your Irish nose stays in this picture.' He acted out my part <b>and</b> <b>I</b> kept <b>nodding,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> walked out with the part. The soundstage sets were magnificent. It was all corny, sure, but DeMille knew it was corny - that's what he wanted, what he loved. I loved slinking around - really, this was silent film acting but with dialogue." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>nodded</b> agreement, <b>and</b> {{we spent}} most of that day in sitting down and smoking, while, as it happened, a sudden breeze blew the tent over upon us at midnight, and anybody who has crawled clear of the {{thrashing}} canvas in such circumstances can guess what followed. Leyland, as generally happens, wriggled headforemost into what might be termed the pocket of the net, and it cost me some trouble to extricate him. Next morning he awoke with a toothache and general shortness of temper, {{as a result of}} trying to sleep in the rain, and appeared much less certain about the benefits to be derived from such excursions.|$|R
