5|$|While {{the wing}} {{planform}} was evolving, {{so was the}} basic SST concept. Bristol's original Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing, but <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> larger Type 223.|$|E
5|$|Eckfeldt {{served a}} quarter century as chief coiner, during which time the Philadelphia Mint moved to new premises. As he set aside unusual coins brought in as bullion, he started the Mint's coin cabinet, which <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> National Numismatic Collection. Even after his 1839 retirement, Eckfeldt {{continued}} {{to perform the duties}} of chief coiner; his death in 1852 caused his replacement, Franklin Peale, to seek an assistant.|$|E
5|$|Electrochemistry {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, electrochemical cells have <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells.

5|$|Land warfare {{changed from}} the static front lines of World WarI to {{increased}} mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> primary weapon.

5|$|Similarly, the forelimbs of ancestral {{vertebrates}} have <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front flippers of whales, {{the wings}} of birds, the running forelegs of dogs, deer, and horses, the short forelegs of frogs and lizards, and the grasping hands of primates including humans. The same major forearm bones (humerus, radius, and ulna) are found in fossils of lobe-finned fish such as Eusthenopteron.|$|E
5|$|The {{central office}} in Washington, which <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> National Meteorological Center and Weather Prediction Center (formally {{known as the}} Hydrometeorological Prediction Center), assumed {{hurricane}} warning/advisory responsibility at that time. This responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935, {{and the concept of}} the Atlantic hurricane season was established to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year. Hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of the three bi-coloured fairywren species indicates their ancestors lived across New Guinea and northern Australia in a period when sea levels were lower and the two regions were joined by a land bridge. Populations became separated as sea levels rose, and New Guinea birds <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> white-shouldered fairywren, and Australian forms into the red-backed fairywren and the arid-adapted white-winged fairywren.|$|E
5|$|Under Himmler's leadership, the SS {{developed}} its {{own military}} branch, the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT), which later <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Waffen-SS.

It grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II, serving alongside the Heer (army), but never being formally part of it.|$|E

In 2007, AtariAge released a self-published sequel called Adventure II for the Atari 5200, which is heavily inspired by the original; its name is used with permission from Atari Interactive. Robinett himself took {{the idea of using}} items from Adventure into his next game, Rocky's Boots, but added the ability to combine them to form new items.|$|E
5|$|Although the sextet had {{declined}} after 1986, in 1990 {{they got together}} to record Zyryab, a groundbreaking Arabic flamenco/jazz album with jazz pianist Chick Corea and fellow virtuoso flamenco guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar. The album is named after Ziryab, an 8th–9th century Shiraz-born poet/musician at the Umayyad court in Córdoba, credited with introducing to Spain the Persian lute, which <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Spanish guitar—and according to some, established flamenco itself. One track on the album, a tarantas, is dedicated to Sabicas. The album was critically well-received; Jazz Times praised the passion and rhythm of the musicians featuring on the album.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E

25|$|Even after {{differentiation}} {{can be seen}} {{between the}} sexes, some stages are common, e.g. the disappearing of the membrane. On the other hand, sex-dependent development include further protrusion of the genital tubercle in the male to form the glans of the penis and in the female, the clitoral glans. <b>The</b> urogenital fold <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shaft of the penis in males and the Labia minora in females; <b>the</b> labioscrotal swelling <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scrotum in males, and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Labia majora in females.|$|R
