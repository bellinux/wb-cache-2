40|$|The term “alienation” {{is used in}} sociological {{analysis}} of production systems and, recently, in studies of compulsive consumption. There are no definitions or investigations discussing "alienation of disposal" of products and packaging. Following this line of thought, {{the aim of this}} article is to identify people's perceptions about the implications of the act of discarding a product or packaging. Interviews were conducted with citizens and experts in environmental issues in Porto Alegre, Brazil. We followed a semi-structured script addressing general issues about the environment, buying behavior, habits and attitudes related to disposal and <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and packaging. The results indicate the absence of environmental education and knowledge of the life cycle of products. The consumer, when buying a product, does not envisage that will have to discard the packaging. The disposal is associated with the act of "making disappear out of his eyes" without knowing the steps taken by the waste until its final destination. It was found detachment or alienation concerning the disposal of products and packaging. The results of this research will support initiatives to increase environmental awareness of the population, as well as to elaborate policies about product information and consumer responsibilities...|$|E
40|$|The {{trade margins}} (or {{distributive}} margins) matrix {{represents one of}} the most relevant aggregate in a input-output framework. Consequently, the distributive margin is a typical issue of National Accounts, where the trade service is quantified by the differences between the value of the sales and the value of purchases of goods for resale. In this paper we describe the principal steps of the procedure for the construction of this matrix for Italy. The proposed methodology is founded on the business statistics approach and tries to answer to the question “who sell what and to whom?”. The data collected from the enterprises, at a very detailed level of classification, provide a good representation of the “distributive channels ” (e. g. supermarkets, traditional grocery stores) but it needed an integration with information related to the economic <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> (householders, enterprises, etc.) and to the different products sold by each commercial firm. Using the trade margins matrix we can reconstruct all the transactions from the production to the consumption of a good (the trade filières). For this reason, the trade margins matrix is also a very important tool for the economic analysis...|$|E
40|$|Although it {{is known}} that {{forestry}} mitigates carbon emissions to some degree, there is still a need to investigate the extent to which changes in forest management regimes affect the carbon cycle. In a climate-change scenario, forest management schemes must be optimized to maximize product supply and minimize environmental impacts. It is difficult to predict the mitigating effects of different silvicultural regimes because of differences in the growth characteristics of each species, <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> <b>products,</b> and industrial efficiencies. The objective {{of the present study was}} to use a modeling approach to evaluate the effects of different management regimes for fast growing species in southern temperate Europe in relation to mitigating climate change. A comprehensive study was carried out considering the C sink effect in biomass, soil and wood products, the substitutive effect of bioenergy, and particular conditions of the forest industry in southern Europe. The mechanistic CO 2 Fix model was parameterized for three species used in fast growing plantations in southern Europe: Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus nitens, and Pinus radiata. Data from 120 plots covering the complete age range observed for each species were used to calculate changes in C stocks in aboveground biomass and organic and mineral soil and to validate the parameterized model for these conditions. Additional information about the efficiency of forest industry processes in the region was also considered. A strong bias in soil organic carbon estimation was observed and attributed to overestimations in the decomposition rates of soil compartments. Slight bias was also observed in the carbon biomass estimation when forest-specific yield models were used to simulate afforestation over former pastureland. As regards the model sensitivity, the Yasso model was strongly robust to turnover of leaves, roots, and branches. The chip wood production alternative yielded higher carbon stock in biomass and products, as well as in bioenergy substitution effect, than the sawn wood production alternative. Nevertheless, the sawn wood alternative was the most effective as regards the C stock in the soil. Site index had an important effect for all species, alternatives, and compartments, and mitigating effects increased with site index. Harvesting of clearcutting and thinning slash for bioenergy use led to a slight decrease in the soil carbon equilibrium but significantly increased the mitigation effect through bioenergy use...|$|E

40|$|The {{supply chain}} of {{perishable}} products, as {{fruits and vegetables}} is affected by environmental abuses from harvest to the final destination which are responsible the uncontrolled deterioration of food. In order to reduce such phenomena the supply chain members should control and monitor the conditions of goods {{in order to ensure}} their quality for consumers and to comply with all legal requirements (Garcia Ruiz, 2008). The most important factor influencing the food quality is the temperature able to prolonging the shelf life of the products. Since the temperature can inhibit or promote the maturation and deterioration process, this parameter is involved both in the growing process of fruits and vegetables and in the transport and storage stages. Given this the aim of the present thesis is to show that the monitoring of such parameter during the pre and post harvest stages allows to improve the decision making process. In the context of temperature monitoring the introduction of emerging information technologies such as the Wireless Sensors Networks and the Radio Frequency Identification can now provide real-time status knowing of product managed. The real time monitoring can be of great help in the definition of the actual maturation level of products both in the field and during the cold chain. The suitability of such an approach is evaluated by means of case studies. The first case study concerns the monitoring of grapes growth directly in the vineyard. The suitability of Wireless Sensors Networks in the monitoring of the grapes growth process is evaluated in terms of the possibility to determine the date of starting or ending of phenological phases. This information allows to make faster decisions about the vineyard operations which must be performed during the grape growth and finally allows to predict the maturation date in order to optimize the harvest operations. In the next case study the possibility to apply the Radio Frequency Identification technology to the monitoring of the fresh fruits along the cold chain has been faced {{and the quality of the}} products at any stage of the supply chain has been determined through a mathematical model. The knowing of the current quality level allows to make decisions about the <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> <b>products.</b> In this case those products having a shorter shelf life can be distributed to a local market while those with longer shelf life can be distributed to more distant location. In the next case study the information about the current deterioration state of perishable products has been translated into a warehouse management system in order to determine the operational parameters able to optimize the quality of products stored. Even in this case the goal of the study was to provide a decision making tool for the proper management of the perishable products stored. However besides the advantages achievable by the real time evaluation of environmental conditions the costs involved with the implementation of innovative technologies must be determined in order to establish the suitability of the investment in such innovative technologies. The present thesis also faces this question by determining the optimal number of devices to apply to the stock keeping unit in order to minimize the total cost associated to the transferring batch from the producer to the distributor. In this case the methodology employed is that of a mathematical model including all costs associated to the product management. Finally the study conducted through the present thesis shows that in all of the cases treated the use of the innovative technologies allows to support the decision making process in the pre and post harvest phases thus improving the perishables management...|$|E

The final <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> this sub <b>product,</b> is the incineration, in the cements company, being the incorporated the sub product to the cement, during your production. With the qualitative result using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), coupled to the dispersive energy spectroscopy (EDS), two experiments were made with objective to separate the magnetic material of the non-magnetic material, using a permanent magnet. We conclude that the magnetic material {{can be used by}} powder metallurgy process in production of pieces...|$|R

In this sense, this research was conducted with the aim of improving the export development in our country and give control to allow more clear view of what must be done in carrying out the export process so in that way, do it with greater flexibility, in addition, this Rating and Research Institute of Foreign Trade (RRIFT) Controller would Customs Agents and Exporters also present statistical data, progress and interaction studies of Exporters in the Market International talks ongoing new investment opportunities, new consumer markets for the Ecuadorian exporters can make their way to other markets. Through Market Research (Statistical Analysis, Surveys and connoisseurs of Foreign Trade Dealers Reviews) showed that exporters, importers and customs officials have wide acceptance of the ideas presented in the surveys and the project {{you want to make a}} Through them, such as: Identification of agreements and treaties that allow a trade advantage, Impact of Government measures, analyze the competition by identifying key market participants, origin or <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>products</b> they sell, prices, volumes, taxation and Moreover, among others. This means that the proposal was very well received and therefore our project would have a considerable demand...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{interest}} and concern about the presence and risk of pesticides in our daily lives from the food we consume to the chemicals used for turf maintenance. One obvious component in risk calculations is the inherent toxicity <b>of</b> the <b>product.</b> Another component <b>of</b> the risk equation is exposure. For lawn applied pesticides, the exposure is primarily dermal and there have been several interesting studies conducted to evaluate the likelihood of exposure to these products. The person most likely for exposure to lawn products is the applicator. Commercial applicators in Michigan are required to be trained on how to use personal protective equipment to minimize exposure. This discussion however, is directed toward the likelihood and degree of exposure to people using the lawn area after the products have been applied. To investigate this area, we first need to gain an understanding of the fate or <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> these <b>products</b> after they are applied. Once the solution hits the target zone, there are four general places the product can go. It can be absorbed into the plant, adsorbed onto the leaf blade, adsorbed onto the soil/thatch area, or volatilized into the air. There are many factors that influence the amount <b>of</b> pesticide <b>product</b> that can be accumulated in any of these areas. They include the product formulation (dry, liquid, EC, WP), temperature, moisture, humidity, turf density, and time after application to name a few. What we are concerned about is the dislodgeable fraction, or the amount left on the leaf blade that is able to be removed or rubbed off by a person...|$|R
