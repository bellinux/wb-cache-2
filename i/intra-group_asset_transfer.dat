40|$|Medicaid {{covers the}} costs of a long nursing home stay. This {{coverage}} may create an incentive for the elderly to <b>transfer</b> their <b>assets</b> to their children {{in order to qualify}} for Medicaid before entering a nursing home. Previous researchers had found little evidence that such behavior was widespread or that <b>asset</b> <b>transfers</b> were large. However, data from AHEAD suggest that the self-assessed probability of entering a nursing home is a signicant determinant of the likelihood of making an <b>asset</b> <b>transfer.</b> The budgetary implications of these Medicaid-induced <b>asset</b> <b>transfers</b> are probably fairly small, but not insigni cant...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe present {{evidence}} from Rwanda's Girinka (‘One Cow per Poor Family’) {{program that has}} distributed more than 130, 000 livestock <b>asset</b> <b>transfers</b> {{in the form of}} cows to the rural poor since 2006. Supply side constraints on the program resulted in some beneficiaries receiving complementary training with the cow transfer, and other households not receiving such training with their cow. We exploit these differences to estimate the additional impact of receiving complementary training with the cow transfer, on household's economic outcomes up to six years after having received the livestock <b>asset</b> <b>transfer.</b> Our results show that even in a setting such as rural Rwanda where linkages between farmers and produce markets are weak, the provision of training with <b>asset</b> <b>transfers</b> has permanent and economically significant impacts on milk production, milk yields from livestock, household earnings, and asset accumulation. The results have important implications for the design of ‘ultra-poor’ livestock <b>asset</b> <b>transfer</b> programs being trialled globally as a means to allow the rural poor to better their economic lives...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{a simple}} <b>asset</b> <b>{{transfer}}</b> {{model in which}} the transfer amount is a fixed fraction f of the giver's wealth. The model is analyzed {{in a new way}} by Laplace transforming the master equation, solving it analytically and numerically for the steady-state distribution, and exploring the solutions for various values of f &# 8712;(0, 1). The Laplace transform analysis is superior to agent-based simulations as it does not depend on the number of agents, enabling us to study entropy and inequality in regimes that are costly to address with simulations. We demonstrate that Boltzmann entropy is not a suitable (e. g. non-monotonic) measure of disorder in a multiplicative <b>asset</b> <b>transfer</b> system and suggest an asymmetric stochastic process that is equivalent to the <b>asset</b> <b>transfer</b> model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} quantitatively examine {{the impact of}} intergenerational <b>transfers</b> on <b>asset</b> {{inequality}} among Japanese households. For that purpose, we estimate an intergenerational <b>asset</b> <b>transfer</b> function with various control variables, using a unique micro dataset taken from the “Household Survey on Family Relationships, Employment, Retirement Payments, and Intergenerational <b>Transfers</b> of <b>Assets</b> and Education,” conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, Cabinet Office, Government of Japan. Employing three different models - a Tobit model, an interval regression model, and an ordered probit model - to ensure that our results are independent of the specific econometric approach used, we examine whether <b>asset</b> <b>transfers</b> received are correlated with households’ financial strength. We find that higher income households are likely to receive larger <b>asset</b> <b>transfers.</b> However, the contribution of intergenerational <b>transfers</b> to <b>asset</b> inequality appears to be quantitatively limited when measuring financial strength in terms of households’ life cycle wealth...|$|R
