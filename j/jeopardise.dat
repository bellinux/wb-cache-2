5|$|As {{frigatebirds}} rely {{on large}} marine predators such as tuna for their prey, overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and <b>jeopardise</b> whole populations. As frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas, they {{are vulnerable to}} local disasters that could wipe out the rare species or significantly impact the widespread ones.|$|E
5|$|Farming and {{forestry}} {{are other}} important industries. 2008 {{plans for a}} large salmon farm holding 800,000 or more fish in Lamlash Bay have been criticised by the Community of Arran Seabed Trust. They feared the facility could <b>jeopardise</b> Scotland's first marine No Take Zone, which was announced in September 2008.|$|E
5|$|Competition for the {{contract}} was so fierce that it involved last-minute discounts, offers of free parts and allegations of sabotage. Metro-Cammell, Kawasaki and ASEA were shortlisted for the final round. Metro-Cammell based its design on the Hong Kong MTR M-Train EMU and proposed to use the GEC propulsion system had they won {{the contract}}. Metro-Cammell also delivered a concept mock-up and was originally the favourite to win the contract. However, analysts became concerned that a measuring error involving the London Underground 1983 Stock during the evaluation period could <b>jeopardise</b> their bid.|$|E

5|$|The murders {{received}} {{a large amount}} of media attention, both nationally and internationally. The press often compared the murders to those committed by the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who murdered 13 women and attacked seven others (mostly prostitutes) between 1975 and 1981. There was some concern that the level of media coverage at the time could <b>jeopardise</b> a trial. The murders also sparked debates in the media over the laws surrounding prostitution.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might <b>jeopardise</b> its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{conscription}} ran {{contrary to}} British political tradition, but the sheer {{scale of the}} Western Front led to its institution in Britain in January 1916. The Rhodesia Herald and Bulawayo Chronicle newspapers broadcast the news in special editions. While some settlers supported {{the extension of the}} same system to white Southern Rhodesians, it was also opposed in many quarters. The British South Africa Company feared that the loss of skilled white workers might <b>jeopardise</b> its mining operations, crucial to the colonial economy, while the Rhodesian Agricultural Union contended that white farmers had to stay on the land for similar reasons. Some, mindful of John Chilembwe's anticolonial uprising in Nyasaland in early 1915, felt that it was necessary to keep a core of male settlers in the colony to guard against a repeat of the Mashona and Matabele rebellions of the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and encyclical letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to <b>jeopardise</b> his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E
5|$|Somalia {{received}} universality places (a wildcard {{for athletes}} {{who have not}} attained qualification standards) from the International Association of Athletics Federations to send one male and one female athlete to the 2012 Summer Olympics. The two athletes that were selected to represent Somalia at the London Games were Mohamed Hassan Mohamed in the men's 1500 metres and Zamzam Mohamed Farah in the women's 400 metres. Along with the two athletes, the country's delegation was led by chef de mission Omar Barajab. The athletes' training at Mogadishu Stadium and in the city's roads (which was for six days a week) was hampered {{by the death of}} the country's National Olympic Committee (NOC) president Aden Yabarow Wiish in a suicide bombing in April 2012, but their coach Ahmed Ali encouraged the runners not to let the event influence their training. Both competitors were not confirmed until July 2012 because the NOC did not wish to <b>jeopardise</b> their safety by making them targets. Long-distance runner Abdinasir Said Ibrahim had been due to compete but withdrew because of extreme stress caused by unsafe roads which lowered his mental morale. Farah was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Major {{threats to}} the {{cockatoo}} include clearance of their feeding and nesting habitat, destruction of nesting hollows (e.g. during firewood collection), competition with other species for nest sites, and poaching. Since European settlement, 56% of its habitat has been cleared, mainly for agriculture. Furthermore, 54% of its habitat on the Swan Coastal Plain—an important area outside the breeding season—has been lost. Much of this area lies within the Perth metropolitan area, and the city's population is predicted to increase 70% by 2050. The Western Australian State Government has produced a Green Growth Plan to manage this expansion; conservation groups are concerned the cockatoo (along with other species) could suffer further loss of habitat. In particular, the loss of pine plantations north of Perth could <b>jeopardise</b> the species' food supply. In February 2017, WWF-Australia and BirdLife Australia appealed to the Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg to intervene and halt the ongoing removal of pine trees. BirdLife International designated 13 sites (Important Bird Areas) as being important specifically for Carnaby's black cockatoo. These are the Northern Swan Coastal Plain, which supports between 4600 and 15000 birds outside the breeding season, the Stirling Range, and 11 other sites that support between 20 and 110 breeding pairs of Carnaby's black cockatoos.|$|E

5|$|The {{action has}} been {{described}} as inconclusive by British historian C. Northcote Parkinson as neither side could achieve a decisive result. Parkinson is also scathing of his criticism of both Clark and Waller, accusing them of failing to properly to prepare for battle or effectively manoeuvere their ship under fire. During the battle neither side had actually sought a decisive result, both unwilling to risk damage which would <b>jeopardise</b> their mission. Sercey's orders were to raid British trade routes, not to engage heavy warships and suffer the consequent damage: the battle severely curtailed his opportunities to prey on British merchant shipping in the East Indies during 1796. Lucas sought to block Sercey's passage through the Malacca Straits, but was aware that his ships, though large and powerful, were outnumbered and outgunned in the engagement, particularly given the size of the main French line, composed of ships with batteries of 18-pounder long guns and including Forte, one of the most massive frigates then at sea. William James considers that had the winds been more favourable Lucas {{might have been able to}} cut off and capture at least two French frigates, but had Sercey attempted a boarding action against the ships of the line his more numerous crews would probably have successfully seized them.|$|E
