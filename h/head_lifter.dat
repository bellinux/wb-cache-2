5000|$|LS-1: {{produced}} 1969, 10.25:1 compression, Q-jet carburetor, oval port closed chamber <b>heads,</b> hydraulic <b>lifters,</b> {{nodular iron}} crankshaft, and two-bolt main caps. It produced [...]|$|R
50|$|Coolant {{passages}} {{were located}} between the cylinders. The gerotor-type oil pump was {{located at the}} bottom rear of the engine, and provided oil to both the crankshaft main bearings and the cylinder <b>heads</b> (via the <b>lifters</b> and pushrods, {{as opposed to a}} drilled passage on LA engines). Chrysler's engineers also redesigned the oil seals on the crankshaft to improve anti-leak seal performance. The oil pan was also made from thicker steel, and was installed with a more leak-resistant silicone-rubber gasket.|$|R
50|$|This {{evolutionary}} {{redesign of}} the American 2.9 solved {{many of the}} reliability issues that plagued its predecessor. A stronger cylinder head design eliminated the 2.9's common failure of cracked <b>heads.</b> Hydraulic roller <b>lifters</b> replaced the simple hydraulic lifters used in the 2.9, which were sometimes overly sensitive to oil contamination, often requiring the lifters to be replaced prematurely. However, one major design fault was not completely eliminated: Valve rockers and upper pushrod tips still received poor oil supply, resulting in eventual wear to these areas, and consequential valvetrain noise {{as a result of}} the increased clearance. Required replacement of these parts is common in older engines.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "modern era" [...] straight-six {{engine family}} was {{introduced}} by American Motors (AMC) in 1964. These lighter in weight engines were used {{in a variety of}} AMC passenger and Jeep utility vehicles. American Motors also sold their straight-sixes to International Harvester for powering International's [...] "Light Line" [...] of trucks: Scouts, pickups, and Travelalls. These engines were also assembled and marketed internationally. Some markets (such as Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos VAM in Mexico) built their own specialized versions. This engine is considered {{to be one of the}} best ever made, and it received modifications and upgrades as engine control technology improved. This engine was produced continuously for 42 years (even after Chrysler's buyout of AMC in 1987) all the way through 2006. It featured a durable design with a cast-iron block and cylinder <b>head,</b> hydraulic <b>lifters</b> (with non-adjustable rockers), and seven main bearings. Since AMC cars were designed to take the weight of an optional V8, AMC was able to make their straight-sixes much stronger and heavier than they needed to be. As a result, the engine blocks were so sturdy that some were used in race cars in the Indianapolis 500. In the 1978 race, an AMC 199 CID L engine built by Navarro produced [...] at 8500 rpm with 80 in (24.6 lbs) of manifold pressure.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, Isuzu {{introduced}} the 4ZD1 four-cylinder [...] 2.3-liter petrol engine. Apart from higher power, {{changes to the}} previous engine included a Kevlar timing belt replacing the previous chain, and a larger two-barrel carburetor. This engine eventually proved somewhat problematic with {{a high incidence of}} burned valves due to poor coolant flow design of the overhead cam/valve <b>head</b> with mechanical <b>lifters.</b> A later <b>head</b> casting improvement by an Italian firm corrected this problem through improved coolant flow. Also available only for 1986 in the US was the [...] 2.2-liter C223T turbocharged diesel engine, using a Garrett turbocharger. It was not a popular option because of the low power generated, and furthermore is notorious for a weak bottom end, the connecting rods not originally designed for the increased thermal and mechanical stress of forced induction. Because of those problems, Isuzu changed the 4ZE1 for 1988 and used the standard 2.8-liter GM V6 for 1989 until their own new V6 engines could be manufactured.|$|R
5000|$|Technologically, the Kadett D was a departure, {{as it was}} Opel and Vauxhall's first {{front-wheel-drive}} car. It {{was also}} the first application of the Family II engine design, with a single overhead camshaft, aluminium-alloy cylinder <b>head,</b> hydraulic valve <b>lifters,</b> with capacities of 1297 cc (producing 60 PS and 75 PS) and had a transaxle design that allowed the clutch to be replaced without removing the transmission unit. A carry-over 1196 cc Opel OHV engine from previous generations of the Kadett producing 53 hp and a top speed of 87 mph was also offered on entry level models from launch, and a new 1600 cc engine was offered after Frankfurt 1981, followed by an 1800 cc version introduced for the Kadett GSE/Astra GTE model. The Kadett D was also equipped with a 1600 cc diesel engine, an option which was first presented at the Brussels Motor Show in 1982. Another frugal model, mostly sold in Italy, was the 1.0 liter model with [...]|$|R
5000|$|The Custom Cruiser was restyled in 1980 with a {{lower front}} fascia. The doors and window {{mechanisms}} were also redesigned to be lighter. The woodgrained side panels on models so equipped no longer followed the curves of the wheel wells like the 1977-1979 versions, but were positioned higher on the body sides to give a straighter, sleeker look similar to the first generation. 1980 saw the last restyling of the second generation Custom Cruisers.Minor mechanical changes were made between 1980 and 1990. The new E4ME electronic carburetor which used GM's CCC (Computer Command Control) system was introduced in 1980 for models sold in California. In 1981, all Custom Cruisers used the E4ME with the CCC system, although Canadian emission cars continued to use the mechanical M4ME carburetor until 1986. Also new in 1981 was GM's new Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R automatic transmission with overdrive. This transmission was equipped with a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Custom Cruiser could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range. 1985 saw major changes to the 5.0 L (307 CID) V8 engine's cylinder head design. Introduced were new [...] "swirl port" [...] heads, which improved driveability and low-end torque. These new heads also featured very small intake ports, which reduced the higher RPM power and performance significantly. Along with the new <b>heads,</b> roller <b>lifters</b> replaced flat lifters. The 1989 Custom Cruiser was the last edition to have front shoulder belts mounted in the B-pillars; 1990 introduced door-mounted [...] "passive" [...] shoulder belts.|$|R
5000|$|Analyzing old {{eyewitness}} reports, Jim McKeague {{explained how}} poor, itinerant conjuring troupes could have performed the trick using known magical techniques. [...] If {{a ball of}} cord is thrown upwards, one end being retained in the hand, the ball rapidly decreases in size as it rises. As it unwinds completely the illusion of the ball disappearing into the sky is striking, especially if the pale cord is similar in color to any overcast cloud. Before the cord has time to fall the climber leaps up, pretending to climb, but really being lifted by a companion. Skilled acrobats could make this quick [...] "climb" [...] look very effective until the climber's feet are at or even above the <b>lifter's</b> <b>head.</b> Then a noisy distraction from {{other members of the}} troupe is the misdirection needed which allows the climber to drop unseen to the ground and hide. This type of [...] "vanishing by misdirection" [...] is reported as having been used very effectively by a performer of the basket trick in the 1870s.|$|R
50|$|In May 1998 a NEO {{head was}} fitted, which enabled {{the engine to}} be {{classified}} as a low emission vehicle (LEV) engine due to their lower fuel consumption and emission output. The NEO <b>head</b> featured solid <b>lifters</b> rather than hydraulic, revised camshafts, with on/off solenoid Variable VCT, used a hotter 82 Â°C thermostat, model-specific coil packs and a revised inlet manifold (the runner diameter is reduced from 50mm to 45mm to increase air velocity and low end torque) in particular the RB25DE NEO which had two inlets going into the inlet manifold. The combustion chamber of the head is smaller so GT-R spec connecting rods are used to compensate as well as model-specific pistons. The turbo received the larger OP6 turbine which some came with steel compressor and turbine wheels, where others had the nylon plastic compressor wheel and ceramic turbine wheel. Some also used an N1 type oil pump and had the oil pump drive collar on the crank revised to help cope with the breakage problems associated with fast, high revs.All in all they are quite a different engine {{in their own right}} - a culmination of 20 years of Nissan RB engine building rolled into one.|$|R
