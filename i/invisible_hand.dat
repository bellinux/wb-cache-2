5|$|Smith, {{a philosopher}} who forged the new {{discipline}} of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing {{his concern for}} the practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia. Smith's economic ideas are also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, {{is a symbol of}} the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the <b>invisible</b> <b>hand.</b> The life-and-a-half size statue of Smith, is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008. It was funded by private subscriptions organised by the Adam Smith Institute.|$|E

JC is contacted by Tong, Everett, and the Helios AI simultaneously. All three factions ask for his help in defeating Page while furthering their own objectives, and JC is {{forced to choose between}} them. Tong seeks to plunge the world into a Dark Age by destroying the global communications hub and preventing anyone from taking control of the world. Everett offers Denton the chance to bring the Illuminati back to power by killing Bob Page and using the technology of Area 51 to rule the world with an <b>invisible</b> <b>hand.</b> Helios wishes to merge with Denton and rule the world as a benevolent dictator with infinite knowledge and reason.

25|$|In the US, {{transportation}} by car {{is guided}} {{more by the}} government than by an <b>invisible</b> <b>hand.</b> Roads and the interstate highway system were built by local, {{state and federal governments}} and paid for by income taxes, property taxes, fuel taxes, and tolls. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is designed to offset market imbalances. Municipal parking is frequently subsidized. Emission standards regulate pollution by cars. US fuel economy standards exist but are not high enough to have effect. There is also a gas guzzler tax of limited scope. The United States offers tax credits for certain vehicles and these frequently are hybrids or compressed natural gas cars (see Energy Policy Act of 2005).|$|E

25|$|As every individual, therefore, {{endeavours}} {{as much as}} he {{can both}} to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an <b>invisible</b> <b>hand</b> to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.|$|E
500|$|Just {{before his}} death in 1946, Keynes told Henry Clay, a {{professor}} of social economics and advisor to the Bank of England, of his hopes that Adam Smith's [...] "invisible hand" [...] could help Britain out of the economic hole it was in: [...] "I find myself more and more relying for a solution of our problems on the <b>invisible</b> <b>hand</b> which I tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Vilfredo Pareto {{analyzed}} microeconomics {{by treating}} decisions by economic actors as attempts {{to change a}} given allotment of goods to another, more preferred allotment. [...] Sets of allocations could then be treated as Pareto efficient (Pareto optimal is an equivalent term) when no exchanges could occur between actors that could make at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off. [...] Pareto's proof is commonly conflated with Walrassian equilibrium or informally ascribed to Adam Smith's <b>Invisible</b> <b>hand</b> hypothesis. • [...] Rather, Pareto's statement was the first formal assertion {{of what would be}} known as the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics.

500|$|Vampire Weekend {{concentrated}} {{their efforts}} on giving each recording [...] "warmth", feeling that modern digital recordings lacked the sound quality of older records. In {{an attempt to make}} the tracks sound less harsh, the band and their recording engineers used a spectrum analyzer, Sonnox SuprEsser and heavily automated EQs to edit out harsher, colder frequencies and soften the mix. Vampire Weekend painstakingly listened to the record several separate times using technology from standard commercial iPod earbuds to professional equipment to ensure the record sounded nice regardless of equipment the listener owned. Desiring to [...] "check the relative warmth levels", the engineers would [...] "go in and perform surgery and automate EQs" [...] {{in order to make the}} mixes listenable. The band felt the finished product was something of a third chapter and a continuation of material explored in their previous two efforts. [...] "We thought these three albums should look like they belong together on a bookshelf", said Batmanglij. [...] "We realized that there are things connecting the songs across three albums, like an <b>invisible</b> <b>hand</b> was guiding us. It does feel like we've been able to create three distinct worlds for each album, and yet have them be interconnected." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{activity}} being much reduced, {{he still}} kept himself {{informed about the}} polemics agitating Romania's cultural and political scene. He was also occasionally hosting Eminescu, witnessing his friend's struggle with mental disorder. The two failed to reconnect, and their relationship ended. After one of the meetings, he recorded that the delusional poet was carrying around a revolver with which to fend off unknown attackers—among {{the first in a}} series of episodes which ended with Eminescu's psychiatric confinement and death during June 1889. Around that time, Creangă, like other Junimists, was involved in a clash of ideas with the emerging Romanian socialist and atheistic group, rallied around Contemporanul magazine. This occurred after Contemporanul founder Ioan Nădejde publicly ridiculed Învățătoriul copiilor over its take on creationism, quoting its claim that [...] "the <b>invisible</b> <b>hand</b> of God" [...] was what made seeds grow into plants. Creangă replied with a measure of irony, stating that [...] "had God not pierced the skin over our eyes, we would be unable to see each other's mistakes". Nevertheless, Călinescu argued, Nădejde's comments had shaken his adversary's religious sentiment, leading Creangă to question the immortality of the soul in a letter he addressed to one of his relatives in the clergy. According to other assessments, he was himself an atheist, albeit intimately so.|$|E
500|$|Hebel {{lived in}} Karlsruhe until his death, but made {{occasional}} journeys to other regions. His wish {{to become a}} parish priest in Wiesental was never fulfilled, though he wrote an inaugural sermon for a rural parish in 1820. In this sermon he wrote, [...] "to live and die as a pastor in a peaceful country town, among honest people, has always been my sole wish, up to this hour; it was what I wished for in the happiest and in the darkest moments of my life". Instead, he was [...] "led higher and higher by an <b>invisible</b> <b>hand,</b> ever further away from my modest goals". In 1805 he was offered the Lutheran parish of Freiburg im Breisgau, but he declined it {{at the behest of}} Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden. He was rewarded in 1808 with his appointment as director of the Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. In 1819 he became a prelate of the Lutheran regional church, a leading position that brought with it a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament (Ständeversammlung) of Baden. As a member of parliament he devoted himself mainly to education, the church and social policy. He later gave a speech at the consecration of the statehouse in Karlsruhe. Even though the Lutheran and Reformed regional churches of Baden merged in 1821 with strong support from his side, into today's Evangelische Landeskirche in Baden, his position as the prelate of the unified Protestant church was not endangered.|$|E

500|$|Palpatine/Darth Sidious is {{a central}} {{character}} in Genndy Tartakovsky's [...] micro-series, which is set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The character's likeness in the series is based on that in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, and he is voiced by Nick Jameson. In the first chapter, Palpatine is informed by Obi-Wan Kenobi that the Jedi have discovered that the InterGalactic Banking Clan has established battle droid factories on the planet Muunilinst. Palpatine agrees to send a strike force that includes Anakin Skywalker, and suggests that Anakin be given [...] "special command" [...] of Obi-Wan's fighters. Yoda and Obi-Wan initially speak against the idea, but reluctantly concede. In the seventh chapter, a holographic image of Sidious appears shortly after Dooku trains Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress. Sidious orders Ventress to track down and kill Anakin. He remarks to Dooku that Ventress is certain to be defeated, but that the point of her mission is to test Anakin. In the final chapters, a hologram of Sidious again appears and orders General Grievous to begin {{an assault on the}} galactic capital. Later, the Separatist invasion of Coruscant begins and Palpatine watches from his apartment in the 500 Republica. Grievous breaks through the Chancellor's window and attempts to kidnap him, leading to a long chase while Palpatine is protected by Jedi Shaak Ti, Roron Corobb and Foul Moudama. After Grievous apprehends the Jedi, Palpatine is taken on board the <b>Invisible</b> <b>Hand,</b> setting the stage for Revenge of the Sith.|$|E
500|$|Coordination {{failure is}} another {{potential}} explanation for recessions and unemployment. In recessions a factory can go idle {{even though there}} are people willing to work in it, and people willing to buy its production if they had jobs. In such a scenario, economic downturns appear {{to be the result of}} coordination failure: The <b>invisible</b> <b>hand</b> fails to coordinate the usual, optimal, flow of production and consumption. Russell Cooper and Andrew John (1988) expressed a general form of coordination as models with multiple equilibria where agents could coordinate to improve (or at least not harm) each of their respective situations. Cooper and John based their work on earlier models including Peter Diamond's (1982) coconut model, which demonstrated a case of coordination failure involving search and matching theory. In Diamond's model producers are more likely to produce if they see others producing. The increase in possible trading partners increases the likelihood of a given producer finding someone to trade with. As in other cases of coordination failure, Diamond's model has multiple equilibria, and the welfare of one agent is dependent on the decisions of others. Diamond's model is an example of a [...] "thick-market externality" [...] that causes markets to function better when more people and firms participate in them. Other potential sources of coordination failure include self-fulfilling prophecies. If a firm anticipates a fall in demand, they might cut back on hiring. A lack of job vacancies might worry workers who then cut back on their consumption. This fall in demand meets the firm's expectations, but it is entirely due to the firm's own actions.|$|E

2500|$|Scientific {{management}} {{appealed to}} managers of planned economies because central economic planning {{relies on the}} idea that the expenses that go into economic production can be precisely predicted and can be optimized by design.
