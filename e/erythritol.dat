25|$|Foods {{containing}} sorbitol, {{present in}} some diet drinks and foods, and occurring naturally in some stone fruits, or xylitol, present in some berries, and other polyols (sugar alcohols), such as <b>erythritol,</b> mannitol, and other ingredients that end with -tol, commonly added as artificial sweeteners in commercial foods.|$|E
25|$|The {{change in}} {{mouthfeel}} {{is related to}} the increase in pH, but may also be due to the production of polyols, particularly the sugar alcohols <b>erythritol</b> and glycerol. Another factor that may enhance the mouthfeel of wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation is the presence of ethyl lactate which can be as high as 110mg/l after MLF.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three primary}} {{compounds}} used as sugar substitutes in the United States are saccharin (e.g., Sweet'N Low), aspartame (e.g., Equal, NutraSweet) and sucralose (e.g., Splenda, Altern). Maltitol and sorbitol are often used, frequently in toothpaste, mouth wash, and in {{foods such as}} [...] "no sugar added" [...] ice cream. <b>Erythritol</b> is gaining momentum {{as a replacement for}} these other sugar alcohols in foods as it is much less likely to produce gastrointestinal distress when consumed in large amounts. In many other countries, xylitol, cyclamate, and the herbal sweetener stevia are used extensively.|$|E
2500|$|Other common {{preventative}} measures {{center on}} reducing sugar intake. One way {{this is done}} is with sugar replacements such as Xylitol or <b>Erythritol</b> which cannot be metabolized into sugars which normally enhance S. mutans growth. Various other natural remedies have been suggested or studied to a degree, including [...] deglycyrrhizinated licorice root extract, Tea tree oil, Macelignan (found in nutmeg), Curcuminoids (the main components of turmeric), and eugenol (found in bay leaves, cinnamon leaves and cloves). Additionally various teas have been tested for activity against S. mutans and other dental benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Heterofermenting {{species from}} the Lactobacillus genus, {{as well as}} some wild strains of O. oeni, have the {{potential}} to metabolize fructose (one of the main sugars in wine) into the sugar alcohols mannitol and (less commonly) <b>erythritol.</b> These are sweet-tasting compounds can add sweetness to a wine where it is not desired (such as Cabernet Sauvignon). Mannitol taint, described as mannite by Pasteur, in wines is often accompanied by other wine faults, including the presence of excessive levels of acetic acid, diacetyl, lactic acid, and 2-butanol, which can contribute to a [...] "vinegary-estery" [...] aroma. The wine may also have a slimy sheen on the surface.|$|E
2500|$|Stevia {{has been}} widely used as a natural {{sweetener}} in South America for centuries and in Japan since 1970. [...] Due to its unique characteristics of zero glycemic index and zero calories, it is fast becoming popular in many other countries. In 1987, the FDA issued a ban on stevia because {{it had not been}} approved as a food additive, although it continued to be available as a dietary supplement. After being provided with a significant amount of scientific data proving that there was no side-effect of using stevia as a sweetener from companies such as Cargill and Coca-Cola, the FDA gave a [...] "no objection" [...] approval for GRAS status in December 2008 to Truvia, a blend of rebiana and <b>erythritol</b> (developed by Cargill and The Coca-Cola Company), as well as PureVia (developed by PepsiCo and the Whole Earth Sweetener Company, a subsidiary of Merisant), ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Erythritol</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring substance {{found in many}} fruits; however, since it is present in such small amounts (less than [...]005% by weight) it is impractical to produce <b>erythritol</b> commercially simply by obtaining it through natural sources. Cargill manufactures Truvia’s <b>erythritol</b> by processing corn into a food grade starch which it then ferments with yeast to create glucose and then processes further to create <b>erythritol.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Erythritol</b> is {{commonly}} used as a medium in which to deliver high-intensity sweeteners, especially stevia derivatives, serving the dual function of providing both bulk and a flavor {{similar to that of}} table sugar. Diet beverages are made with this blend, thus contain <b>erythritol</b> in addition to the main sweetener. Beyond high-intensity sweeteners, <b>erythritol</b> is often paired with other bulky ingredients that exhibit sugar-like characteristics to better mimic the texture and mouthfeel of sucrose. The cooling effect of <b>erythritol</b> is rarely desired, hence other ingredients are chosen to dilute or negate that effect. <b>Erythritol</b> also has a propensity to crystallize and is not as soluble as sucrose, so ingredients may also be chosen to help negate this disadvantage. Furthermore, <b>erythritol</b> is not hygroscopic, meaning it does not attract moisture, which can lead to the drying out of products, in particular baked goods, if another hygroscopic ingredient is not used in the formulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Erythritol</b> is {{preferentially}} {{utilized by}} the Brucella bacteria spp. The presence of <b>erythritol</b> in the placentas of goats, cows, and pigs {{has been proposed}} as {{an explanation for the}} accumulation of Brucella bacteria found at these sites.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Erythritol</b> is {{produced}} industrially beginning with enzymatic hydrolysis of the starch from corn to generate glucose. [...] Glucose is then fermented with yeast or another fungus to produce <b>erythritol.</b> [...] Other {{methods such as}} electrochemical synthesis are in development.|$|E
5000|$|Truvia's {{ingredients}} are <b>erythritol</b> (a sugar alcohol found naturally {{in small amounts}} in various fruits such as grapes and melons), stevia leaf extract and natural flavorings. As a main ingredient, <b>erythritol</b> is a non-caloric bulking agent that was created through a fermentation process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Erythritol</b> has {{a strong}} cooling effect (endothermic, or {{positive}} heat of solution) when it dissolves in water, which is often combined with the cooling effect of mint flavors. The cooling effect is present only when <b>erythritol</b> is not already dissolved in water, a situation that might be experienced in an erythritol-sweetened frosting, chocolate bar, chewing gum, or hard candy. The cooling effect of <b>erythritol</b> {{is very similar to}} that of xylitol and among the strongest cooling effects of all sugar alcohols.|$|E
50|$|In late 2013, {{the firm}} {{replaced}} their previous all stevia and <b>erythritol</b> sweetener {{with a mix}} of stevia extract, monk fruit extract, and <b>erythritol,</b> a blend that they call SweetSmart. , the company produces fifteen different flavors including, Cola, Cherry Cola, Dr. Zevia, Ginger Ale, Lemon-Lime Twist, Grape, Black Cherry, Cream Soda, Orange, Strawberry and Mountain Zevia.|$|E
50|$|Most of Truvia's {{side effects}} {{are related to}} <b>erythritol</b> which is a sugar alcohol. Sugar {{alcohols}} are valuable as sweeteners since they cause little to no rise in blood glucose levels as sugar does. However, the downside to most sugar alcohols is their propensity to cause gastrointestinal side effects. <b>Erythritol</b> is unique in that among these compounds it {{has one of the}} most favorable nutritional profiles. <b>Erythritol</b> is almost as sweet as sucrose, is virtually non-caloric, and cannot be fermented by gut bacteria present in the small intestine. According to Truvia's website, up to 90% of <b>erythritol</b> is absorbed by the small intestine and excreted unchanged in the urine. Only a small amount of it will reach the large intestine where GI symptoms, like bloating, flatulence, and cramping usually originate. Truvia's website claims: Studies with <b>erythritol</b> show almost no side effects reported unless very high doses are consumed at a single sitting in liquid form on an empty stomach(Bornet FR 1996). It took at least 4 times the amount of <b>erythritol</b> to generate looser stools, compared with the level of sorbitol, a very commonly used and well tolerated sugar alcohol (Oku T 1996). One study gave the test subjects 1 gram per kilogram (1 kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds) for five days (Tetzloff W 1996). So a 220 pound person would be taking 100 grams of <b>erythritol</b> every day, or 33 packets of Truvia® natural sweetener. These doses are far beyond the expected daily use and were delivered in a way that is very unlike our normal eating pattern. However...a few study subjects reported cramping, noisy stomach churning or, more commonly, loose stool after consuming it. This pattern has been seen with many types of sugars and carbohydrates. There are just some people who may have a limit to how much they can consume without having mild, brief symptoms.|$|E

50|$|In the body, most <b>erythritol</b> {{is absorbed}} into the {{bloodstream}} in the small intestine, and then {{for the most part}} excreted unchanged in the urine. About 10% enters the colon. Because 90% of <b>erythritol</b> is absorbed before it enters the large intestine, it does not normally cause laxative effects, as are often experienced after consumption of other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol and maltitol), although extremely large doses can cause nausea and borborygmi (stomach rumbling).|$|E

50|$|Like other {{nitrated}} polyols, ETN {{is made by}} nitrating <b>erythritol</b> {{through the}} mixing of concentrated sulfuric acid and a nitrate salt. Ammonium nitrate is commonly used {{for this type of}} reaction. The <b>erythritol</b> is added to the mixture to begin its nitration. Much better yields can be obtained by using concentrated nitric acid in place of the nitrate salt, in which case the sulfuric acid is used simply to absorb water and act as a catalyst from the resulting esterification, driving the reaction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Erythritol</b> tetranitrate (ETN) is an {{explosive}} compound chemically similar to PETN. It is however {{thought to be}} 1/3 more sensitive to friction and impact. ETN is not well known, {{but in recent years}} has been used by amateur experimenters to replace PETN in improvised detonation cord or in boosters to initiate larger, less sensitive explosive charges. Due to the availability of <b>erythritol</b> as a natural sweetener and its relative ease of production in relation to PETN, ETN is a favoured homemade explosive compound to the amateur experimenter.|$|E
50|$|Inulin {{is often}} {{combined}} with <b>erythritol</b> because of inulin's offering a complementary negative {{heat of solution}} (exothermic, or warming effect when dissolved, which helps cancel erythritol's cooling effect) and noncrystallizing properties. However, inulin has a propensity to cause gas and bloating in those having consumed it in moderate to large quantities, in particular in individuals unaccustomed to it. Other sugar alcohols are sometimes used with <b>erythritol,</b> in particular isomalt, because of its minimally positive heat of solution, and glycerin, which has a negative heat of solution, moderate hygroscopicity, and noncrystallizing liquid form.|$|E
