5|$|Predator {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) <b>flew</b> <b>over</b> Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa on 8 and 9 July, capturing {{images of}} the deployment of people inside.

The UAVs <b>flew</b> <b>over</b> Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa {{for more than an}} hour, from 2:40 to 4:00am. Senior government officials and the Security Forces personnel examined the pictures and relayed the information directly to the command post on the ground.

Pakistan deployed several security units to execute the attack on the mosque. These include the Army's 78th Paratrooper Brigade and 111th Infantry Brigade; its elite strike force, the Special Service Group (SSG) Division; the Ninth Wing Company of the Pakistan Army, the Rangers paramilitary force; and the Elite Police squad of the Punjab Police.|$|E

By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he <b>flew</b> <b>over</b> Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.|$|E

5|$|Shiban was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on an incident that involved his wife's father potentially seeing other beings in a room when he was dying.

The series sought out a bowling alley for the opening scenes, but many establishments in Vancouver, Canada were reluctant to yield over two-thirds of their space as well as close down for three days. Eventually, the Thunderbird Bowling Centre was chosen.|$|E

Evidence of the Chinese activity was hidden to MacArthur: the Chinese Army traveled at night and dug in during the day. For his reconnaissance efforts, MacArthur was nonetheless awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and honorary combat pilot's wings.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Air Patrol also {{provides}} non-emergency {{assistance to the}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Drug Enforcement Administration, and United States Forest Service in the War on Drugs.

The system is able to evaluate spectral signatures given off by certain objects, allowing the system to identify, for example, a possible marijuana crop.|$|E

The Gran Colombian flag in turn was inspired by {{the flag of the}} First Republic of Venezuela, the first independent government of that nation. The flag of the Venezuelan Republic was modeled on the one created earlier by General Francisco de Miranda during his attempts to gain Venezuelan independence and which first <b>flew</b> <b>over</b> the port of La Vela in Santa Ana de Coro, Venezuela, in 1806.|$|E
