40|$|TURKEY growers have {{frequently}} ex-pressed {{the opinion that}} eggs from breeding flocks having free range exhibit superior <b>hatching</b> <b>power</b> in comparison to eggs laid by breeders confined to small pens. This difference {{has been attributed to}} (1) increased activity of range breed-ers with less tendency to increase in body weight, and/or (2) the acquisition of nu-trients not provided in the usual ration that are compatible with good hatchability. Satisfactory hatching results have been re-ported from farm flocks, which for the most part have been poorly cared for and scantily fed from fall to onset of sexual maturity. In contrast, attention has been focused on the poor hatching performance of confined breeders receiving high levels of supposedly adequate diets. Data regard-ing the weight changes of breeders scantily fed from fall to the following March when sexual maturity is reached at this latitude and from March to the conclusion of the hatching egg season, during which period full feeding is usually resumed, are not available. The progressive increase in weight from fall to March and the decre-ment of approximately IS percent from March until June has been reported by Scott (1937) for confined breeders on full feed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the potential in meat production traits of some of the many types of indigenous chickens in Ethiopia. From the various strains of birds locally found, 5 distinct types -Tikur, Melata, Kei, Gebsima and Netch -as they are locally known, were collected and their meat production characters tested at the Awassa Junior College of Agriculture, Awassa, Sidamo. As a control group Single Comb White Leghorn chickens were used in the study. The experiment was run between October 1982 and 1984 both on parental stock as well as on progenies produced from the parental populations. Economically important parameters like feed consumption, body weight, egg number, egg weight and hatchability of the parental population and growth rates, organ weights and dressing percentage of the progenies were measured. Biometerological variables like temperature, relative humidity, radiation intensity and wind velocity as influencing factors of the animals' productive characters, were also measured. The data thus collected on both parental and progeny populations were subjected to an analysis of variance. The differences between means whenever significant were tested by the use of the DUNCAN Multiple Range Test. Regression analyses were carried out to test the relation- ship between the various independent and dependent variables. Correlation and regression relationships between biometerological factors and the different economic traits were also calculated. The main points resulting from the study could be enumerated as follows: 1. The mean mature body weight of the local ecotypes was 1. 38 kg and equalled 85 percent of the Leghorns' weight. Individual strain mature body weights were Gebsima: 1. 30 kg, Tikur: 1. 35 kg, Kei: 1. 36 kg, Netch: 1. 42 kg, Melata: 1. 48 kg and Leghorn: 1. 62 kg. Effects of climatically changes on mature body weights were not significant. 2. The local chickens' rates of egg production were approximately 18 percent and those for the Leghorns were 26 percent. Genetic environmental interaction became apparent. The local ecotypes maintained egg production rates until the end of their second year of age, while the Leghorns were almost out of production at the same time. Increasing environmental temperature depressed egg production more in the Leghorn chickens than it did in the local animals. 3. Egg weight was positively correlated with mature body weight (r = 0. 67, P< 0. 01). The egg weights were 46 and 64 g both in the local ecotypes and the Leghorns, respectively. 4. Mean monthly temperatures ranging between 22 and 26 ° C did not influence egg weight significantly. Genetic differences were more influential than those caused by biometerological changes. 5. The total egg-mass was influenced more by the number of eggs than by the weight of the individual egg. 6. Indigenous chickens' eggs contained relatively more yolk than those of the Leghorns, the difference being 8 percent. 7. The fertility of eggs in the local groups was better than in the Leghorns. The average fertility in the local chickens was 56. 4 and 46 percent in the Leghorns. 8. Fertility was inversely related with sunshine length, dry-bulb temperature and radiation intensity with correlation coefficients, of - 0. 40 (P< 0. 0 l), - 0. 32 (P< 0. 01) and - 0. 26 (P< 0. 05), respectively. 9. Hatchability of both total and fertile eggs was inversely (r = - 0. 56 'and - 0. 48, P< 0. 0 l, respectively) related with egg weight. And the larger sized Leghorn eggs' hatchability was at a disadvantage compared to that of the local ecotypes' eggs. Hatchabilities of both total and fertile eggs in the local strains therefore were superior by as much as 40 and 30 percent respectively. 10. Hatchability was highly correlated (r = 0. 79, P< 0. 01) with egg fertility and it is believed that factors affecting fertility could equally influence the <b>hatching</b> <b>power</b> of chicks. 11. Feed intake was influenced by environmental factors. Birds consumed more feed during rainy season as opposed to the drier one. The difference between these 2 seasons in feed intake was 0. 67 kg (16 percent) per bird per month. In general. seasons associated with lower dry-bulb temperatures showed increased rates in feed consumption. 12. The daily growth rates of the progeny up to 6 months of age were Kei: 5. 04 g. Gebsima: 5. 11 g. Tikur: 5. 16 g, Melata: 5. 36 g. Netch: 6. 38 g and Leghorn: 8. 98 g. The combined growth rate of 5. 41 g for the local ecotypes was significantly lower (P< 0. 01) than the Leghorn rate. The Netch and Melata strains among the local groups were fast growing. 13. Body weights of the various genotypes in the progeny were Tikur: 450 and 960 g. Melata: 550 and 1000 g, Kei: 500 and 940 g. Gebsima: 510 and 950 g, Netch: 500 and 1180 g and Leghorn 800 and 1660 g. at 3 and 6 months of ages respectively. Thus the local ecotypes averaged 63 percent of the Leghorns body weight at 3 months and 61 percent at 6 months of age. 14. At 6 months of age. mean carcass weights were Gebsima: 510 g. Tikur: 550 g, Kei: 556 g, Melata: 568 g. Netch: 611 g and Leghorn 875 g. The pooled carcass mean weight of 559 g for the local chickens at this age was significantly smaller than the Leghorn weight (P< 0. 01). 15. The dressing percentages for the various genotypes at 6 months of age were Netch: 51. 5. Leghorn: 52. 0. Gebsima: 53. 8. Melata: 56. 0. Tikur: 56. 4 and Kei: 57. 8. The local ecotypes (pooled) had a 6 percent higher dressing percentage relative to their body sizes. than the Leghorns. 16. The hatching season July -September was shown to be favorable for body weights at 6 months of age. Birds hatched during this season had the largest mean body weights between 3 and 6 months of age. The mean body weights for the 4 hatching seasons were: 1. April June 703 g., 2. July September 975 g., 3. October -December 898 g and, 4. January -March 747 g. 17. The local ecotypes generally manifested poor performance in body weight egg weight and in rate of egg production when compared to the Leghorn levels. Under improved nutritional as well as management conditions they could not successfully compete with the improved exotic stocks at least with their present genetic constitution...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Selective laser {{sintering}} (SLS) is a rapid prototyping technique {{which is used}} to manufacture plastic and metal models. The porosity of the final product obtained by SLS can be controlled by changing the energy density level used during the manufacturing process. The energy density level is itself dependent upon manufacturing parameters such as laser <b>power,</b> <b>hatching</b> distance and scanning speed. Through mechanical characterization techniques, it is possible to quantitatively relate the energy density levels to particular strength values. The present study is directed towards manufacturing functionally graded polyamide products by changing the energy density level in a predetermined manner. The mechanical properties of the functionally graded components are characterized by means of tensile testing. Both homogeneous and functionally graded specimens are produced and tested in order to examine the influence of the energy density level on the mechanical response and on the ultimate tensile and rupture strengths.

The current research evaluates the merits of additive manufacturing based on the mechanical, microstructural, and fracture properties of additive manufactured AlSi 10 Mg test specimens. The additive manufactured build plates consisted of tensile and fatigue test specimens. They were printed in the 0 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 90 ° orientations relative to the build platform. Tensile and dynamic fatigue tests were conducted followed by microstructural characterization and fracture analysis. A wrought 6061 T 6 aluminum alloy was also tested for comparison. Tensile tests revealed similar ultimate tensile strengths for all aluminum tensile specimens (350 - 380 MPa). Fatigue strength was greatest for wrought 6061 T 6 aluminum (175 MPa). The fatigue behavior was a strong function of build orientation for the additive manufactured specimens. The 0 °, 30 °, and 60 ° orientations had fatigue strengths close to 104 MPa while the 90 ° orientation had a fatigue strength of 125 MPa. All test specimens failed primarily in a ductile manner.

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} and {{investigate}} the state-led madrassa reforms initiated under the banners of Islamization and Enlightened Moderation philosophies which {{also served as a}} backdrop of madrassa-state relations in General Zia-ul-Haq and General Musharraf era. In order to approach the facts, the study has made use of the primary and secondary sources. This study has given an insight of how both the military regimes initiated the madrassa reforms with a great vigour but on the implementation stages diverted from the projected process. They kept on shaping and reshaping the reform plans by granting concessions to few among the stakeholders till they became adjustable to the regimes. This study has shown that modification of curriculum in order to integrate the madrassa system with the formal system of education in both regimes was the top priority besides resolving financial problems in Zia era and regulating madrassas in Musharraf era. The essence of the entire reform plans in both eras was declared to bring the madrassas into mainstream national life. Besides pointing out flaws left at the formulation and implementation stages, this study has taken into account the implications of reforms by categorizing the stakeholders into four as; madrassa students, madrassa administration, government and society. Firstly, taking into a glimpse at madrassa the study depicted that nothing concrete came up for the benefits of madrassa students and graduates in both eras. Infact, their conditions remained as deplorable as prior to reforms, their curriculum did not undergo any major shift that could give them acceptability in any other field for employment and they remained subservient to their teachers even after the reforms as they were ever before. Secondly, the study giving an indepth analysis has shown that madrassas' high ups enjoyed political <b>powers</b> <b>hatched</b> out of madrassa reforms and legitimized the military regimes by extending support in legislature. The only connection between the madrassa administrations and students driven out of madrassa reforms in Zia era was that students and graduates brought accommodation to the regime on the international level by participating in Afghan war against the USSR over the directions of their teachers most of whom were state's recipient for economic and political benefits. Thirdly, this study has highlighted that the state adopting the rational approach framed the madrassa reforms as the term 'mainstreaming' which was a sole and a common objective in both the aforementioned eras was not candidly defined either by the policy makers or literary circles. The military rulers used the term in their own ways to achieve maximum out of it and assigned roles to madrassa's high-ups in politics of the state under Islamization and Enlightened Moderation Ideologies, which was assumed as mainstreaming of madrassas in both eras. Fourthly, the study scratched out that the reforms directly and indirectly sowed the seeds of few of the contemporary issues prevailing in society such as sectarianism and violence. Briefly, this study concluded that the interests of madrassa students and on a broader level society were quite divergent to the interests of madrassa administration and the state who was the real beneficiaries of implications emerged out of the realm of reforms in both the addressed eras. Moreover, this study asserts that neither madrassa administration nor the state were really interested in reforming madrassas for the benefits of the students and graduates in the long run rather reforms served as a shadow to settle their mutual 'gives and takes' which were accomplished successfully as the state had most of the attributes of a neo-patrimonial state...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Electron cloud is an unwanted effect limiting the performance of particle accelerators with positively charged particle beams of high-intensity and short bunch spacing. However, electron cloud caused by beam induced multipacting can be sufficiently suppressed if the secondary electron yield (SEY) of accelerator chamber surface is lower than unity. Usually, the SEY is reduced by two ways: modification of surface chemistry and engineering the surface roughness. The objective of this PhD project is a systematic study of SEY {{as a function of}} various surface related parameters such as surface chemistry and surface morphology, as well as an effect of such common treatments for particle accelerators as beam pipe bakeout and surface conditioning with a beam, ultimately aiming to engineer the surfaces with low SEY for the electron cloud mitigation. In this work, transition metals and their coatings and laser treated surface were studied as a function of annealing treatment and electron bombardment. The transition metal thin films have been prepared by DC magnetron sputtering for further test. In the first two Chapter of this thesis, the literature review on electron emission effect is introduced, which includes the process of the electron emission, the influence factor and examples of low SEY materials. In the third Chapter, the experimental methods for SEY measurements and surface investigation used in this work are described. In Chapter 4, the SEY measurement setup which is built by myself are introduced in detail. In Chapter 5 transition metals and their coatings and non-evaporable getter (NEG) coatings have been studied. All the samples have been characterized by SEY measurements, their surface morphology was analysed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and their chemistry was studied with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Different surface treatments such as conditioning by electron beam, thermal treatment under vacuum on the sample surfaces have been investigated. For example, the maximum SEY (δmax) of as-received Ti, Zr, V and Hf were 2. 30, 2. 31, 1. 72 and 2. 45, respectively. After a dose of 7. 9 × 10 - 3 C mm- 2, δmax of Ti drops to 1. 19. δmax for Zr, V and Hf drop to 1. 27, 1. 48 and 1. 40 after doses of 6. 4 × 10 - 3 Cmm- 2, 1. 3 × 10 - 3 and 5. 2 × 10 - 3 Cmm- 2, respectively. After heating to 350 ⁰C for 2. 5 hours, the SEY of bulk Ti has dropped to 1. 21 and 1. 40, respectively. As the all bulk samples have a flat surface, there are no difference of morphology. So this reduction of SEY is believed to be a consequence of the growth of a thin graphitic film on the surface after electron bombardment and the removal of the contaminations on the surface after annealing. Chapter 6 of this thesis is about the laser treated surface. Laser irradiation can transform highly reflective metals to black or dark coloured metal. From SEM results, metal surfaces modified by a nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation form a highly organised pyramid surface microstructures, which increase the surface roughness. Due to this reason, δmax of as-received laser treated surface could be lower than 1, which can avoid the electron cloud phenomenon. In this Chapter, the influence of different laser treatment parameters, such as <b>power,</b> <b>hatch</b> distance, different atmospheres on SEY has been investigated. Meanwhile, different surface treatments such as electron conditioning and thermal treatments are studied on the laser treated surface with the investigation of XPS. For example, the δmax of as-received type I with hatch distance 50, 60 and 80 μm in Air are 0. 75, 0. 75 and 0. 80, respectively. After heating to 250 ºC for 2 hours, in all case the δmax drop to 0. 59, 0. 60, 0. 62, respectively. The SEYs of all as-received samples are lower than 1 due to the increasing the roughness on the surface by the special pyramid structure. After thermal treatment, the SEY reduces even further. This is caused by removing the contaminations on the surfaces. In conclusion, the present study has largely improved the knowledge of the electron cloud mitigation techniques by surface engineering of vacuum chambers. On the one hand, the surface treatments can modify the surface chemistry, such as the produce the graphic carbon layer on the surface by electron condition and the removal the contamination layer {{on the top of the}} surface by thermal treatment. On the other hand, the SEY could be critically low by engineering the surface roughness. Both methods allow reaching δmax less than unity. The efficiency of laser treated surface for e-cloud was demonstrated for a first time leading to a great interest to this new technology application for existing and future particle accelerators...|$|R
