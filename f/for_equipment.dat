5|$|Camouflage <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> and {{positions}} was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and below, to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|E
25|$|Typically, railroads {{operating}} in the United States reserve one- to four-digit identification numbers <b>for</b> powered <b>equipment</b> such as diesel locomotives and six-digit identification numbers <b>for</b> unpowered <b>equipment.</b> There is no hard and fast rule <b>for</b> how <b>equipment</b> is numbered; each railroad maintains its own numbering policy <b>for</b> its <b>equipment.</b>|$|R

5|$|Grameen has diversified {{the types}} of loans it makes. It {{supports}} hand-powered wells and loans to support the enterprises of Grameen members' immediate relatives. It has found that seasonal agricultural loans and lease-to-own agreements <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> and livestock help the poor establish better agriculture. The bank has set a new goal: to make each of its branch locations free of poverty, as defined by benchmarks such as having adequate food and access to clean water and latrines.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Maryland Agricultural, a land-grant {{school with}} a {{military}} curriculum requirement, had a new commandant of cadets take office. Lieutenant Clough Overton, who opposed football at the university, cut funding <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> and instituted strict rules limiting practice time. Instead of accepting this serious disadvantage against their opponents, the players declined to field a football team for the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Seattle Symphony {{selected}} a city block adjacent to University Street station, used during tunnel construction <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> staging and storage, {{as the site}} of their new concert hall. The building, later named Benaroya Hall, required the closure of the station's 2nd Avenue entrance. The entrance was re-opened in 1998, {{at the same time the}} new hall was inaugurated.|$|E

5|$|Technetium-99 decays {{almost entirely}} by beta decay, {{emitting}} beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard beta emitter, and is used <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> calibration. Technetium-99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, Baker was {{transferred}} to the 13th Aero Squadron after its commander, Captain Charles Biddle, requested that he join the squadron as a flight commander. Though reluctant to leave the 103rd, Baker felt that Biddle would not have requested him without confidence in his abilities. On July 20, the 13th Squadron recorded its first confirmed kill during a flight led by Baker; he and two other men shot down a German plane. In August, Baker and another pilot were promoted and given command of their own squadron; Baker was given charge of the 141st Aero Squadron, composed of 26 pilots and 180 enlisted men stationed behind the front line, where they had to wait <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> to arrive before leaving for the front.|$|E
5|$|Excavation of the {{downtown}} bus tunnel began in early 1987, and construction reached the University Street area later that year. The twin tunnel boring machines used to excavate the tunnel reached University Street in October 1987, and continued north towards Westlake station. In December, Metro agreed to pay $2.4 million to real estate developer Marathon Company for use of a city block they owned adjacent to the station <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> staging and storage, delaying the planned construction of office buildings on the site. During excavation and construction of the University Street tunnel station, cracks and minor settling {{were found in the}} historic Seattle Tower, located nearby. The ground around the tower was later stabilized to prevent additional settlement, and was renovated with private funding in 1990.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In November 1965, {{together}} with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico. The partners were {{spurred on by}} the closure of a professional kitchenware shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of Terence Conran's Habitat shops, which sold among much else imported kitchen equipment for which there was evidently a market. Among her customers were Albert and Michel Roux, who shopped there <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> that they would otherwise have to buy in France.|$|E
5|$|On March6, 2012, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced that it}} was going forward with an all-electronic tolling plan. Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, the turnpike commission will implement all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E

5|$|Soviet {{personnel}} {{losses at}} Prokhorovka for 12 July were {{estimated by the}} historian Christer Bergström to have been as high as 5,500 men. <b>For</b> <b>equipment</b> damaged or destroyed, David Glantz and Jonathan House estimate that the whole 5th Guards Tank Army lost at least 400 tanks in its attacks on 12 July. The Soviet historians Grigoriy Koltunov and Boris Soloviev estimate about 300 tanks and self-propelled guns of 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed on 12 July. The study by the US Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation reports that the 2nd Guards, 18th and 29th Tanks Corps altogether permanently lost 144 tanks on 12 July, not including self-propelled guns. George Nipe estimates that 600–650 tanks of the 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed while fighting both the II SS-Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in {{the area}} was spurred by food and fodder {{shortages}} during the winters of 1913, 1915, and 1916. Fairbanks businessmen also encouraged the growth of farming. Wickersham provided more funding for the experimental farm, the Tanana Valley Railroad provided free grain seed acquired from an experimental farm in Sweden, and William Fentress Thompson, editor of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, wrote frequent editorials {{in favor of more}} farming. Prominent Fairbanks businessmen formed the Alaska Loyal League, a group that encouraged farming. Farmers also created the Tanana Valley State Fair in 1924 to demonstrate their agricultural success. It is Alaska's oldest state fair and still operates today. Despite these moves, the agriculture movement in Fairbanks had only limited success. A farmers' bank established in 1917 to provide loans <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> purchases went out of business two years later, and although the Alaska Railroad allowed for cheaper shipment of tractors and other agricultural equipment, it also permitted a steady supply of food shipments to Fairbanks. In 1929, Alaska farms met only about 10 percent of the state's food demand. By 1931, the University of Alaska had grown {{to the point that the}} experimental farm was annexed by the school.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit {{for a particular}} grid {{will depend on the}} existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow <b>for</b> <b>equipment</b> failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.|$|E
