25|$|The Spanish colonizers {{reserved}} {{the term}} Filipino {{to refer to}} Spainards born in the Philippines. The {{use of the term}} was later extended to include Spanish and Chinese mestizos, or those born of mixed Chinese-indio or Spanish-indio descent. Late in the 19th century, Jose Rizal popularized {{the use of the term}} Filipino to refer to all those born in the Philippines, including the Indios. When ordered to sign the notification of his death sentence, which described him as a Chinese mestizo, Rizal refused. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death saying that he was indio puro.|$|E
25|$|Since 1985, Shastri's {{career had}} been in steady decline but {{he was able to}} turn it around in 1990. The pitches in England were good for batting and he scored two {{hundreds}} in the three Tests. He was now back as an opener. While India faced a huge England score at Lord's, he scored an exact hundred. It wasn't a faultless innings – too often he played and missed and most of the runs came with his usual flicks and nudges. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> hundred hitting the English spinner Eddie Hemmings for two fours and a six in an over, and departed immediately attempting another big hit.|$|E
25|$|Marduk-apla-iddina {{attempted}} {{to flee to}} Elam but the king forbade him entry. Taking hostages from Ur, Uruk, and other towns, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ancestral city of Dūr-Jakin which he further fortified by adding to the walls and digging a canal from the Euphrates to flood the surrounding area. In 709 BC Sargon's troops gained a victory outside the city but could not take Dūr-Jakin, where Marduk-apla-iddina had fled. A negotiated settlement was reached whereby Sargon would spare Marduk-apla-iddina's life provided the city walls were demolished. It {{is not clear whether}} they were, since two years later, Sargon returned to take them down himself.|$|E

25|$|On December 23, 1951, Mantle married Merlyn Johnson (1932–2009) in Commerce, Oklahoma; {{they had}} four sons. In an autobiography, Mantle said he married Merlyn {{not out of}} love, but because {{he was told to}} by his domineering father. While his {{drinking}} became public knowledge during his lifetime, the press (per established practice at the time) kept quiet about his many marital infidelities. Mantle was not entirely discreet about them, and when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> retirement ceremony in 1969, he brought his mistress along with his wife. In 1980, Mickey and Merlyn separated for 15 years, but neither filed for divorce. During this time, Mantle lived with his agent, Greer Johnson, who was not related to Mantle's wife.|$|E

25|$|The {{strain of}} {{carrying}} the Premiership and Foreign Office {{contributed to his}} second stroke at 10 Downing Street after dinner {{on the evening of}} 23 June 1953. Despite being partially paralysed down one side, he presided over a Cabinet meeting the next morning without anybody noticing his incapacity. Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> country home, Chartwell, to recuperate, {{and by the end of}} June he astonished his doctors by being able, dripping with perspiration, to lift himself upright from his chair. He joked that news of his illness had chased the trial of the serial killer John Christie off the front pages.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} last people to see Paula alive was a man who lived along Harbour Road. He {{was in the midst of}} an argument with his girlfriend when she walked by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was a person of interest in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he told at least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle talk. When no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both {{direct and}} cross examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he {{testified that he}} had known {{for five or six}} years) came into the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that some time {{afterward}} Mae Taub (daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday) asked him for a ride into town, so <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> room (1219) to change his clothes and discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting in the toilet. Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle {{and a few of the}} guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. After the doctor declared that Rappe was just drunk, Arbuckle then drove Taub to town.|$|E

500|$|For {{most of his}} life, Bizet had {{suffered}} from a recurrent throat complaint. A heavy smoker, he may have further undermined his health by overwork during the mid-1860s, when he toiled over publishers' transcriptions for up to 16 hours a day. In 1868, he informed Galabert {{that he had been}} very ill with abscesses in the windpipe: [...] "I suffered like a dog". In 1871, and again in 1874, while completing Carmen, he had been disabled by severe bouts of what he described as [...] "throat angina", and suffered a further attack in late March 1875.

At the end of the month, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> holiday home at Bougival and, feeling a little better, went for a swim in the Seine.

Afterwards, Favre said, [...] "I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game.

500|$|Ultimately, the {{producers}} turned to 30-year-old Sean Connery for five films. It is often reported that Connery won the role through a contest {{set up to}} [...] "find James Bond". While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a Gregory Peck quality, but proved unable {{to cope with the}} role. When Connery was invited to meet Broccoli and Saltzman he appeared scruffy and in unpressed clothes, but Connery [...] "put on an act and it paid off" [...] as he acted in the meeting with a macho, devil-may-care attitude. When he left both Saltzman and Broccoli watched him through the window as <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> car, both agreeing that he was the right man for Bond. After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor [...] "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".|$|E
