5000|$|The [...] "capabilities" [...] of a {{terminal}} comprise various dumb terminal {{features that are}} above and beyond what is available from a pure teletypewriter, which programs can make use of. They (mainly) comprise escape codes that {{can be sent to}} or received from the terminal. The escape codes sent to the terminal perform various functions that a CRT terminal (or software terminal emulator) is capable of that a teletypewriter is not, such as moving the terminal's cursor to positions on the screen, clearing and scrolling all or parts of the screen, turning on and off attached printer devices, programmable function keys, changing display colours and attributes (such as reverse video), and setting display title strings. The escape codes received from the terminal signify things such as function key, arrow key, and other special keystrokes (home key, end key, help key, PgUp key, PgDn <b>key,</b> <b>insert</b> key, delete key, and so forth).|$|E

5000|$|If a new key, {{other than}} the null string, is {{inserted}} into a leaf node of the trie, then the computer {{can go to the}} last preceding node where there was a key or a bifurcation to perform a depth-first search to find the lexicographic successor or predecessor of the <b>inserted</b> <b>key</b> for the purpose of splicing the new key into the circularly linked list. The last preceding node where there was a key or a bifurcation, a fork in the path, is a parent node in the type of trie shown here, where only unique string prefixes are represented as paths in the trie. If there is already a key associated with the parent node that would have been visited during a movement away from the root during a right-hand, forward-moving, depth-first traversal, then that immediately ends the depth-first search, as that key is the predecessor of the <b>inserted</b> <b>key.</b> For example, if Bashful is inserted into the trie, then the predecessor is the null string in the parent node, which is the root node in this case. In other words, if the key that is being inserted is on the leftmost branch of the parent node, then any string contained in the parent node is the lexicographic predecessor of the key that is being inserted, else the lexicographic predecessor of the key that is being inserted exists down the parent node's branch that is immediately {{to the left of the}} branch where the new <b>key</b> is being <b>inserted.</b> For example, if Grumpy were the last <b>key</b> <b>inserted</b> into the trie, then the computer would have a choice of trying to find either the predecessor, Dopey, or the successor, Happy, with a depth-first search starting from the parent node of Grumpy. With no additional information to indicate which path is longer, the computer might traverse the longer path, D, O, P. If Dopey were the last <b>key</b> <b>inserted</b> into the trie, then the depth-first search starting from the parent node of Dopey would soon find the predecessor, [...] "Doc", because that would be the only choice.|$|R
