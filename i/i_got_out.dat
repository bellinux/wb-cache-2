[...] "There was a huge screaming noise and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the car as the plane came over. Everybody was running away in different directions. It was tilting its wings up and down like it was trying to balance. It hit some lampposts on the way in."

500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because I think {{there was a lot of}} cocaine going around, and that's when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|Kate Capshaw {{called her}} {{character}} [...] "not {{much more than}} a dumb screaming blonde." [...] Steven Spielberg said in 1989, [...] "I wasn't happy with Temple of Doom at all. It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered Poltergeist. There's not an ounce of my own personal feeling in Temple of Doom." [...] He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, [...] "Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, 'Well the greatest thing that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of that was I met Kate Capshaw.' We married years later and that to me was the reason I was fated to make Temple of Doom." ...|$|E

The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E

Due to the radiation involved, she reluctantly passed through a full-body scanner. [...] "The T.S.A. Agent told me to put my I.D. on my back," [...] she said. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of there the agent said because my I.D. was on my back, I had to go to a personal screening area." [...] During what she described as an [...] "aggressive" [...] pat-down search, security screening personnel forced her to remove and show her prosthetic breast.

500|$|Only a {{month after}} Lunney graduated, President Eisenhower signed into {{existence}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), into which NACA was subsumed. His timing was perfect, for as Lunney later said, [...] "there {{was no such thing}} as space flight until the month <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of college". Lunney was soon transferred to Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where in September 1959 he became a member of the Space Task Group, which was the body given responsibility for the creation of NASA's manned space program. Aged twenty-one, he was the youngest of the forty-five members of the group. His first assignment was with the Control Center Simulation Group, which planned the simulations used to train both flight controllers and astronauts for the as-yet unknown experience of manned spaceflight.|$|E
500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E

500|$|Joan Ganz {{was born}} on November 30, 1929 in Phoenix, Arizona, to Sylvan Ganz, a banker, and Pauline (née Reddon), a homemaker. Her father was a native Phoenician {{who was born in}} the U.S. so that his mother could receive medical care after his birth. [...] Her {{grandfather}} Emil Ganz was a tailor from Walldorf, Thuringia [...] in Germany, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1858 and was president of the First National Bank of Arizona and mayor of Phoenix for three terms. [...] Joan Ganz was the youngest of three siblings. [...] She described her childhood as [...] "upper middle class, country club atmosphere" [...] and stated, [...] "I was raised in the most conventional way, raised to be a housewife and a mother, to work an interesting job when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of college, and to marry at the appropriate age, which would have been twenty-five". Her father was Jewish and her mother was Catholic.|$|E
500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like'.

500|$|Promoted acting wing {{commander}} in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of No.71 Wing, which controlled No.75 Squadron {{and three other}} combat units. On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest of my body was...was just flames...And {{then all of a sudden}} the flames dropped down a bit and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> and went like mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria. In August, at the age of 24, he was promoted to temporary group captain, the youngest in the RAAF. That December he took command of No.81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, as the overcast skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Watkins sent down four overs for 19 runs with his bruised shoulder {{and did not}} bowl again. He was in much pain and his limp bowling did little to trouble the Australian openers. Morris and Barnes batted comfortably and passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking {{less than an hour}} to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove [...] "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle". Australia reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. The score had reached 117 after only 126 minutes, when Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The right-handed Australian opener stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the leather. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had already announced the tour would be his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat; Yardley led the Englishmen and the crowd in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers, before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6,996 Test career runs, Bradman needed only four runs to average exactly 100 in Test cricket. Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies, a leg break, from the back foot. The leg spinner pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. It was claimed by many, including Hollies, that Bradman became emotional and had tears in his eyes at the ovation given to him by the crowd and the English players, and that this hampered his ability to see and hit the ball. Bradman admitted to being moved by the applause, but always denied shedding tears, saying [...] "to suggest <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> as some people did, because I had tears in my eyes while I was looking at the bowler was quite untrue. Eric Hollies deceived me and he deserves full credit." ...|$|E

[...] "I was {{severely}} depressed, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> without needing analysis." [...] The most controversial event of Mathieu's career, according to the media of the time, occurred when she took over Stark's office, and ended her business relationship with Nadine Joubert. She lost confidence in Nadine who tried to modernize her act after Mathieu's l'Américain album failed miserably, with the strain of Stark's legal affairs having set her back financially. Her sister Monique stepped in to become her business manager, and the two women have remained profitable in the industry ever since.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics on Tormented are {{influenced}} by Staind frontman Aaron Lewis' life. Lewis spoke about it, saying: [...] "My life, {{up to a point}} was shit. But I've come a long way. I grew up in a trailer park in Vermont. That was the shit <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of me in Tormented and Dysfunction, and tailing into Break the Cycle. But the title, Break the Cycle, says it all." [...] AllMusic described Tormented as [...] "grittier and more raw than" [...] Staind's [...] "subsequent releases". The album's music has been compared to that of heavy metal band Pantera, featuring singing and screaming. Despite being an intense heavy metal record, Tormented features a rather soft song, [...] "Four Walls".|$|E
