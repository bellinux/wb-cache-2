50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of pantoprazole is to inhibit the final step in gastric acid production. In the <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> of the stomach, pantoprazole covalently binds to the H+/K+ ATP pump to inhibit gastric acid and basal acid secretion. The covalent binding prevents acid secretion of up to 24 hours and longer.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of development of Cushing ulcers {{is thought to}} be due to direct stimulation of vagal nuclei as a result of increased intracranial pressure. Alternatively, it may also be a direct result of Cushing reaction. Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve then release acetylcholine onto <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> M3 receptors, causing insertion of hydrogen potassium ATPase vesicles into the apical plasma membrane. The end result is increased secretion of gastric acid with eventual ulceration of the gastric mucosa.|$|E
40|$|Antibodies cross-reacting with rat <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> and {{the brush}} border of renal tubules have been {{demonstrated}} at a serum dilution of 1 in 5 in 14 % of 262 human subjects. The highest incidence was found in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (27 %) or pernicious anaemia (22 %); normal group AB blood donors showed an incidence of 18 %. Studies with enzymes and solvents suggested that the antigen might be a protein, perhaps masked incompletely by lipid. The antibody also reacted with guinea-pig <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> and kidney. The inability to react with human or mouse <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> clearly distinguishes the antibody from that found commonly in patients with pernicious anaemia...|$|R
40|$|Tandem repeats are {{ubiquitous}} in the genome of organisms and their mutated forms {{play a vital}} role in pathogenesis. In this study, tandem repeats in Gastric Intrinsic Factor (GIF) of <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> have been investigated using an in silico approach. Six types of the nucleotide tandem repeat motifs have been investigated, including mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide. The distribution of the repeat motifs in the gene was analyzed. The results of this study provide an insight into the biomolecular mechanisms and pathogenesis implicated by the GIF of <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells.</b> Based on the findings of the tandem repeats in GIF of <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells,</b> therapeutic strategies and disease markers may be developed accordingly by the biomedical scientists.

40|$|Actin {{cytoskeleton}} {{plays an}} important role in the establishment of epithelial cell polarity. Cdc 42, a member of Rho GTPase family, modulates actin dynamics via its regulators, such as IQGAP proteins. <b>Gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> are polarized epithelial cells in which regulated acid secretion occurs in the apical membrane upon stimulation. We have previously shown that actin isoforms are polarized to different membrane domains and that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for acid secretion. Herein, we show that Cdc 42 is preferentially distributed to the apical membrane of <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, we revealed that two Cdc 42 regulators, IQGAP 1 and IQGAP 2, are present in <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells.</b> Interestingly, IQGAP 2 is polarized to the apical membrane of the <b>parietal</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas IQGAP 1 is mainly distributed to the basolateral membrane. An IQGAP peptide that competes with full-length IQGAP proteins for Cdc 42 -binding in vitro also inhibits acid secretion in streptolysin-O-permeabilized gastric glands. Furthermore, this peptide disrupts the association of IQGAP and Cdc 42 with the apical actin cytoskeleton and prevents the apical membrane remodeling upon stimulation. We propose that IQGAP 2 forms a link that associates Cdc 42 with the apical cytoskeleton and thus allows for activation of polarized secretion in <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lymphocyte subpopulations and {{intrinsic}} factor and <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> antibodies have been measured in 23 patients with megaloblastic anaemia {{who responded to}} treatment with hydroxocobalamin. The ratio of helper (OKT 4) to suppressor (OKT 8) lymphocytes was significantly increased in patients with {{intrinsic factor}} antibody compared with those who lacked the antibody. No such correlation was found for <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> antibody.

40|$|Five of 33 {{patients}} with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) {{were found to}} have <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> antibody in their sera, whereas it was not found in 30 healthy controls of comparable age distribution. Fifteen of the {{patients with}} DH underwent further studies to investigate the histological and functional state of their gastric mucosa. Atrophic gastritis was found in all five patients whose sera contained <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> antibody and in three of 11 patients with no antibody in their sera.

Somatostatin cells from the canine gastric fundus were isolated by EDTA-collagenase dis-persion and counterflow elutriation, and soma-tostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) release in response to SOS was measured by radioimmu-noassay.

40|$|Secretory {{compartments}} of neurons, endocrine cells, and exocrine glands are acidic {{and contain}} {{high levels of}} labile Zn 2 +. Previously, we reported evidence that acidity is regulated, in part, by the content of Zn 2 + in the secretory [i. e., tubulovesicle (TV) ] compartment of the acid-secreting <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell.</b> Here we report studies focusing on the mechanisms of Zn 2 + transport by the TV compartment in the mammalian (rabbit) <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell.</b> Uptake of Zn 2 + by isolated TV structures was monitored with a novel application of the fluorescent Zn 2 + reporter N-(6 -methoxy- 8 -quinolyl) -para-toluenesulfonamide (TSQ). Uptake was suppressed by removal of external ATP or blockade of H+-K+-ATPase that mediates luminal acid secretion. Uptake was diminished with dissipation of the proton gradient across the TV membrane, suggesting Zn 2 +/H+ antiport as the connection between Zn 2 + uptake and acidity in the TV lumen. In isolated gastric glands loaded with the reporter fluozin- 3, inhibition of H+-K+-ATPase arrested the flow of Zn 2 + from the cytoplasm to the TV compartment and secretory stimulation with forskolin enhanced vectorial movement of cytoplasmic Zn 2 + into the tubulovesicle/lumen (TV/L) compartment. Our findings suggest that Zn 2 + accumulation in the TV/L compartment is physiologically coupled to secretion of acid. These findings offer novel insight into mechanisms regulating Zn 2 + homeostasis in the <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> and potentially other cells in which acidic subcellular compartments serve signature functional roles...|$|E
40|$|Rat stomach {{provided}} an excellent substrate for immunofluorescence testing of <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> autoantibodies in 65 human sera.

The rat stomach had some advantage over human stomach in its ready availability {{in the fresh}} state, its occasional brighter staining reactions, and its avoidance of non-specific staining by the sandwich immunofluorescence technique...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{persistently}} colonize {{the human}} stomach {{and have been}} linked to atrophic gastritis and gastric carcinoma. Although {{it is well known that}} H. pylori infection can result in hypochlorhydria, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here we show that VacA permeabilizes the apical membrane of <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> and induces hypochlorhydria. The functional consequences of VacA infection on <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> physiology were studied using freshly isolated rabbit gastric glands and cultured <b>parietal</b> <b>cells.</b> Secretory activity of <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> was judged by an aminopyrine uptake assay and confocal microscopic examination. VacA permeabilization induces an influx of extracellular calcium, followed by activation of calpain and subsequent proteolysis of ezrin at Met 469 -Thr 470, which results in the liberation of ezrin from the apical membrane of the <b>parietal</b> <b>cells.</b> VacA treatment inhibits acid secretion by preventing the recruitment of H,K-ATPase-containing tubulovesicles to the apical membrane of <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells.</b> Electron microscopic examination revealed that VacA treatment disrupts the radial arrangement of actin filaments in apical microvilli due to the loss of ezrin integrity in <b>parietal</b> <b>cells.</b> Significantly, expression of calpain-resistant ezrin restored the functional activity of <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> in the presence of VacA. Proteolysis of ezrin in VacA-infected <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> is a novel mechanism underlying H. pylori-induced inhibition of acid secretion. Our results indicate that VacA disrupts the apical membrane-cytoskeletal interactions in <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> and thereby causes hypochlorhydria...|$|R
50|$|This {{condition}} can {{be due to}} a dietary {{deficiency of}} B12, malabsorption of B12 in the terminal ileum, lack of intrinsic factor secreted from <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells,</b> low <b>gastric</b> pH inhibiting attachment of intrinsic factor to ileal receptors.|$|R

40|$|Ultrastructural {{immunostaining}} of carbonic anhydrase in <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> {{was accomplished}} with the immunoglobulin-peroxidase bridge procedure applied to cryostat sections of fixed guinea-pig stomach prior to dehydration and embedment. Of {{a variety of}} fixatives tested, only freshly prepared paraformaldehyde buffered with calcium acetate provided both immunostaining and adequate preservation of ultrastructural morphology. Delipidization or exposure of specimens to detergent prior to staining enhanced {{the intensity of the}} immunostaining and increased the sensitivity of the method. Increased diaminobenzidine concentration in the peroxidase substrate appeared also to intensify the densification at the reactive site. Carbonic anhydrase was localized ultrastructurally with this pre-embedment immunobridge procedure in the hyaloplasm of <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> and less consistently in the superficial surface epithelium. The basal portion of the <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> stained more intensely than the apical region and immunoreactivity appeared concentrated at the plasmalemma and around mitochondria...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> {{migrate from}} the luminal to the basal {{region of the}} gland and they {{gradually}} lose acid secretory activity. So far, distribution and function of K+-Clcotransporters (KCCs) in <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> have not been reported. We found that KCC 3 a but not KCC 3 b mRNA was highly expressed and KCC 3 a protein was predominantly expressed in the basolateral membrane of rat <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> located in the luminal region of the glands. KCC 3 a and Na+,K+-ATPase α 1 -subunit (α 1 NaK) were co-immunoprecipitated {{and both of them}} were highly localized in a lipid raft fraction. The ouabain-sensitive K+-dependent ATP-hydrolyzing activity (Na+,K+-ATPase activity) was significantly inhibited by a KCC inhibitor (DIOA). The stable exogenous expression of KCC 3 a in LLC-PK 1 cells resulted in association of KCC 3 a with endogenous α 1 NaK and it recruited α 1 NaK in lipid rafts, accompanying increases of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and ouabain-sensitive Na+ transport activity which were suppressed by DIOA, while the total expression level of α 1 NaK in the cells was not significantly altered. On the other hand, the expression of KCC 4 induced no association with α 1 NaK. In conclusion, KCC 3 a forms a functional complex with α 1 NaK in the basolateral membrane of luminal <b>parietal</b> <b>cells</b> and it up-regulates α 1 NaK in lipid rafts, while KCC 3 a is absent in basal <b>parietal</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

40|$|Following {{the recent}} {{identification}} of <b>gastric</b> <b>parietal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma (Capella et al., 1984), a histological and clinical review of 125 consecutive cases of gastric cancers treated surgically during a 9 -year period was undertaken. The pathology was reviewed blind {{and in addition}} to H & E sections, staining with Luxol Fast Blue, phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin and E-M studies were performed to identify parietal cell differentiation. The surgical procedures performed were curative R 2 gastrectomy (n = 56), palliative resection (n = 30), gastro-enterostomy (n = 25) and intubation (n = 14). The 30 -day operative mortality was 12 / 125 (10 %) overall and 4 / 56 (7 %) in the curative resection group. Two parietal cell cancers were identified and a further 4 tumours showed areas of parietal cell differentiation. All occurred in male patients (mean age 55 years, range 43 - 62). Sixteen patients out of the 56 patients (29 %) who underwent curative R 2 resection have survived long-term (mean 5. 5 years, range 2. 5 - 11) : 4 / 5 mucosal/submucosal cancers (T 1 N 0), 5 / 29 intestinal cancers (T 2 N 0 - 2) 2 / 16 diffuse cancers (T 2 N 1) and 5 / 6 with parietal cell cancer/differentiation (T 2 - 3 N 0 - 2).
