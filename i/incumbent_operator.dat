40|$|During {{the past}} few years there have been {{numerous}} reports and articles from the telecommunications sector, focusing on technological convergence and aiming at presenting managerial implications for operators active in the industry. This paper adds to the discussion by suggesting that there lies value-creation potential in convergence processes. The case of VoIP is discussed and analysed {{as an example of a}} market, where <b>incumbent</b> <b>operators</b> are most likely not winners, but are rather defeated by new entrants (allowed by industry convergence) and other providers with more customer-focused strategies (such as pure VoIP providers, ISPs and cable companies). The paper raises questions concerning technological convergence and its role in the telecommunications landscape, which is characterized by increasing competition and technological development. The paper thus suggests that technological convergence may be used as a tool in order to create value for <b>incumbent</b> and service <b>operators</b> in telecommunications Based on this study, one could assume that challengers and attacker’s possess an advantage when it comes to converging markets such as the VoIP market, and creating value for both the firm and the end-customers. <b>Incumbent</b> <b>operators</b> entering the VoIP market are likely to cannibalize their own revenues and missing out on value-creation. ...|$|R

In case of technology risks, 'the <b>incumbent</b> <b>operators</b> are naturally favoring the harmonized approach (i.e. cooperation) since it decreases risks regarding the diffusion of the new technologies they have invested in and guarantees economies of the scale effects’ [3]. The market risk is mainly concerned with the price fluctuations and demand shocks.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{upcoming}} {{privatization of}} two remaining telecom operators in Bosnia, {{and not so}} recent privatization {{of one of the}} incumbent, will create dynamic and changing sector environment for all participants. At the same time the investors are scanning the sector trying to find the right approach and the market niche for more competitive start. In our overview we have looked at regulatory status, core services figures, followed by financial overview for <b>incumbent</b> <b>operators</b> in the past decade, as well as mobile users’ attitudes in carrier section. What we will show is that sector development and the expansion of consumers’ base is far from over. The services offered are still at rudimental level, and the potential owners of <b>incumbent</b> <b>operators</b> as well as new entrants will have considerable room for development. Financial analysis has shown that revenue for all three <b>incumbent</b> <b>operators</b> is stagnating in the last years, while the small private operators are experiencing steady growth. Although BH Telecom is still the largest company in the sector, it dose face slight decline in net profit while its biggest competitor – Telecom Srpske in 2013 had biggest ROE. We find that BH Telecom and Telecom Srpske had unexploited franchise growth and competiveness potential. We assessed the intrinsic value of all three companies stocks by application of Franchise Factor Model and find that BH Telecom stock price is in equilibrium, Telecom Srpske stock is underpriced and Croatian Telecom is stock strongly overpriced. Finally, the analyses of consumers’ perspective have revealed existence of network effect in mobile market and the strong competition between two market leaders. In all, BiH telecommunication sector is still in its expanding phase and the potential owners of state operators as well as new entrants will have competitive well regulated market...|$|R
