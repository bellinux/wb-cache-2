40|$|Stone Matrix Asphalt is a gap-graded hot-mix asphalt mixture {{composed}} of a coarse aggregate skeleton and a binder-rich mortar. The mixture type was first introduced to the United States in 1991, {{with one of the}} first test sections placed on I- 70 near Richmond, Indiana. To help control the selection of coarse aggregate, the Indiana Department of Transportation specified a maximum Los Angeles Abrasion loss value of 30 percent. An investigation into the coarse aggregate specifications for use in Stone Matrix Asphalt was completed in this study. Emphasis was placed on evaluating various tests that may be useful is specifying coarse aggregates, and to develop a test or set of tests and specifications. Finally, the validity of the current 30 percent Los Angeles Abrasion loss value as requirement for coarse aggregate selection was determined. A survey of state agencies revealed a large variation in the Los Angeles Abrasion values currently specified. Laboratory testing revealed that the Micro-Deval test is a good compliment to the Los Angeles Abrasion test. The Micro- <b>Deval</b> <b>test</b> presents an added benefit as it includes the presence of water. Of the four tests investigated, aggregate degradation during compaction was the most accurate method for predicting coarse aggregate performance of the four tests. A combination of the Los Angeles Abrasion, Micro-Deval, and aggregate degradation tests was even more accurate in predicting coarse aggregate performance...|$|E

It is important to continue the development to create greater understanding of how these constructions are affected by degradation to not build long life constructions that are not fulfilling tomorrow’s changed demands. In constructions consisting of aggregates degradation caused by external loads is described by effects like changed properties of the soil mass. One {{step in the right}} direction when it comes to better understanding degradation is to describe the grain shape changes that occur. A number of grain shape describing variables are presented: soliditycircularity, aspect ratio, roundness and. These are measured with two dimensional digital image processing (DIP). The degradation is simulated by the material quality tests Los Angeles and micro <b>Deval</b> <b>tests.</b> A great number of grains from their samples are analyzed before and after the tests to compare the change of the grain shape. The results are analyzed to find the change of the grain shape and differences of the grain shape change of the two tests. The Los Angeles samples show a significant decrease in size indicating that fragmentation is the degradation mode. The samples also to some extent show more circular grains after <b>testing.</b> The micro <b>Deval</b> samples show smaller grains, but not to the same extent as for the Los Angeles samples. The micro Deval samples also show that the grains are more even and circular indicating the grains are exposed to wearing. These results verify the degradation modes for the micro Deval and Los Angeles tests. The data is also analyzed with factor analysis to identify connections between the measured variables’ results. A clear connection can be seen for Los Angeles and micro <b>Deval</b> <b>tests</b> both before and after testing. Circularity and solidity are varying alike and represents a shape factor, measuring a grain’s shape in two scales. Another analysis was completed for flakiness index to explore if there is a way to perform a similar grain shape test with two dimensional digital image processing. There is a great difference between the results from the laboratory test and the DIP. This is because of the fact that only two dimensions are identified with the DIP, and the data collected from the DIP does not represent the data from the flakiness index test. That one dimension is not identified with the two dimensional DIP can also affect the grain shape results. Despite this, it is possible that the great number of analyzed grains can counter this effect. Further investigation is necessary to verify this.
