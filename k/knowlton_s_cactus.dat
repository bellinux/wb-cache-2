5000|$|Opuntia lindheimeri is <b>s</b> <b>cactus</b> {{which is}} treated by some botanists {{as a species}} {{separate}} and distinct from O. engelmannii. Britton and Rose also considered that O. lindheimeri is a stand-alone species as did Engelmann who described it in 1850. The point is not settled, and other botanists accept O. lindheimeri as a variety of O. engelmannii. Whatever their taxonomic relationship, the plants are easily distinguished when grown side-by-side and do not generally overlap in their natural ranges.|$|R

50|$|Zygocactus virus X is a little-understood plant virus {{which was}} first {{reported}} in a Thanksgiving <b>Cactus</b> (<b>S.</b> truncata) from Missoula, Montana, United States. Transmission takes place through mechanical inoculation. Once infected, the cactus develops symptoms which can include (varying with the host infected) reddening of the pads, mosaics, mottles, ringspots or necrosis. The virus has few known family hosts (under 3) and the exact spread of this virus is unknown, but known to be based in the United States.|$|R

Averaging reduces the often large riat ti on in the response of chlorophyll to phosphorus (Chl-TP) that characterizes measurements of these variables in lakes.

2500|$|Stenocereus fruit (sour pitayas) are {{a variety}} that is {{commonly}} eaten in the arid regions of the Americas. They are more sour and refreshing, with juicier flesh and a stronger taste. The sour pitaya or pitaya agria (S. gummosus) in the Sonoran Desert {{has been an important}} food source for indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Seri people of northwestern Mexico still harvest the fruit, and call the plant ziix is ccapxl [...] "thing whose fruit is sour". The fruit of related species, such as S. queretaroensis and the dagger <b>cactus</b> (<b>S.</b> griseus), are also locally important foods. The fruit of the organ pipe cactus (Stenocereus thurberi, called ool by the Seris) is the pitaya dulce [...] "sweet pitaya". It still has a more tart aroma than Hylocereus fruit, described as somewhat reminiscent of watermelon; it has some uses in traditional medicine.|$|R
40|$|Crapemyrtle bark scale, Acanthococcus (=Eriococcus) lagerstroemiae (Kuwana) (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), is a newly {{introduced}} {{insect pest}} on crapemyrtles, Lagerstroemia spp. (Myrtales: Lythraceae), {{one of the}} most popular flowering shrubs in the U. S. Since first detected in Texas in 2004, this pest has spread to twelve states causing losses to stakeholders. To develop a management plan, we reviewed current knowledge about the pest’s biology and ecology, and suggested research approaches including studying its thermal tolerance, host range, plant resistance and biological control. Parasitoids and predators have been reared from A. lagerstroemiae in the U. S. and China. However, new surveys of natural enemies should be conducted in China, and studies on the host range and impacts of natural enemies on A. lagerstroemiae may help determine the potential for classical biological control. The life history, preying efficiency and rearing methods are important for coccinellid predators found in the U. <b>S.</b> including Chilocorus <b>cacti</b> L. and Hyperaspis spp. To enhance natural enemy performance, it is important to evaluate a sustainable insecticide program that considers efficacy, timing, rate and impact on pollinator health. Finally, an integrated management program of A. lagerstroemiae is discussed including planting resistant cultivars, using host specific natural enemies, and prudent use of insecticides...|$|R
40|$|Protected areas {{globally}} {{are threatened}} by the potential negative impacts that invasive alien plants pose, and Camdeboo National Park (CNP), South Africa, is no exception. Alien plants have been recorded in the CNP since 1981, before it was proclaimed a national park by South African National Parks in 2005. This is the first publication of a list of alien plants {{in and around the}} CNP. Distribution maps of some of the first recorded alien plant species are also presented and discussed. To date, 39 species of alien plants have been recorded, of which 13 are invasive and one is a transformer weed. The majority of alien plant species in the park are herbaceous (39 %) and succulent (24 %) species. The most widespread alien plant species in the CNP are Atriplex inflata (= A. lindleyi subsp. inflata), Salsola tragus (= <b>S.</b> australis) and <b>cacti</b> species, especially Opuntia ficus-indica. Eradication and control measures that have been used for specific problematic alien plant species are described. Conservation implications: This article represents the first step in managing invasive alien plants and includes the collation of a species list and basic information on their distribution in and around the protected area. This is important for enabling effective monitoring of both new introductions and the distribution of species already present. We present the first species list and distribution information for Camdeboo National Park. How to cite this article: Masubelele, M. L., Foxcroft, L. C. & Milton, S.
