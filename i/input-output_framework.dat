30|$|In {{this paper}} I bring to {{fruition}} the neoclassical measurement of performance change in an <b>input-output</b> <b>framework.</b> Some pitfalls are avoided. First, market prices {{need not be}} perfectly competitive and, more generally, the observed allocation of resources may be inefficient. Solow’s ascription of TFP-growth to technical change holds in an idyllic neoclassical world where resources are rewarded according to their marginal productivities, but not beyond. Market power, managerial slacks and other sources of inefficiency abound and we must factor in their variations to properly account for performance changes. Since these conditions differ between industries, an <b>input-output</b> <b>framework</b> seems promising.|$|E

Findings suggest that the economically large counties with diversified industry have greater economic impacts not just as a result of higher retiree spending owing to in-migration of high-income retirees, but also due to more opportunities to purchase goods and services from local establishments, leading to higher output, employment and value-added multip-liers.

40|$|Limits on the {{precision}} of technical relationships within <b>input–output</b> <b>frameworks</b> {{have led to the}} use of stochastic analytical methods. The notion of stochastic analysis is developed in this paper to discern how the inherent imprecision effect, when aggregated data are utilised, affects the concomitant key sector analysis. Through a Monte Carlo based simulation, the stochastic key sector graph is introduced, with numerical expressions defined which quantify the association of the individual sectors to quadrants of the graph. The technical developments are benchmarked on a small problem, before a stochastic key sector analysis on an aggregated regional input–output table is reported. Comparisons are made between results when the aggregation of sectors is not employed. The paper reveals that aggregation in key sector analysis is inevitably a poor idea. However, it is argued that aggregation is often a practical necessity, so quantifying the uncertainty that is attendant on this aggregation is important, with the “association” expressions introduced potentially central to elucidate this uncertainty. The conclusions of this paper suggest that where analysts and decision makers are obliged to aggregate tables for analytical purposes then problems might be mitigated where marginal sectors are treated with care...|$|R

First, the hybrid rectangular <b>input-output</b> <b>framework</b> expressed in both monetary and physical terms is introduced to relax the effects of different energy prices among industrial sectors on the input structure in physical terms. Second, the demand structure of the input-output system is decomposed into the structure of energy sectors and other sectors by applying the hierarchy system with feedback loops of non-energy sectors. We identify the sources of the changes in Japan's energy use structure between 1985 and 1990. The major findings are that the total energy requirement has increased, mainly because of the changes in the non-energy final demand, while the product-mix changes have opposite effects, that is, energy savings.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyse structural changes which occurred in Italy in the period 1992 - 2000. The analysis is carried out within the I-O framework by the use of multipliers, I-O elasticities, structural decomposition and causative approaches. These tools are used to assess over time the degree of sector interrelationships, the potentiality of sectors in fostering economic growth, the sources of change in the economy and contribution of sectors to growth. In particular, the structural decomposition approach is based on the use of a revised version of RAS finalised to isolate productivity and substitution effects affecting technology changes. From the analysis, there emerges that, in the nineties, the process of development has led to reinforcement of sectors more related to service supply and to an increasing reduction of the importance of agriculture and manufacturing sectors. Moreover, Italy has been interested by structural changes mainly due to the variation of the level of final demand, in particular of consumption, rather than technological changes. Finally, the Italian economy, in line with the general tendency of other industrialised countries, has been involved by the process of rising diffusion and importance of computer and communication technologies throughout the whole economy.

The MIO model integrates information on intrametropolitan flows of people, commodities and services through the embedding approach within an <b>input-output</b> <b>framework.</b> Accordingly, the model has been built in one methodological framework (<b>input-output</b> <b>framework)</b> and operated by using one calculation system (inversion of input coefficient matrix), taking interspatial and intersectoral linkages into consideration. Another unique characteristic of the proposed model is that the input coefficient matrix of the MIO model consists of three partitioned matrices that have different spatial dimensions: interindustrial technical coefficients by place of production; the income coefficients by place of residence, and consumption coefficients by place of consumption. The MIO model can be applied for the impact analysis {{of a variety of}} urban policy evaluations.
