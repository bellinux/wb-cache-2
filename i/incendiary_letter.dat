60|$|Johnson's prologue was solemn in itself, {{and being}} {{delivered}} by Brinsley in lugubrious tones {{suited to the}} ghost in Hamlet, seemed to throw a portentous gloom on the audience. Some of the scenes met with great applause, and at such times Goldsmith was highly elated; others went off coldly, or there were slight tokens of disapprobation, and then his spirits would sink. The fourth act saved the piece; for Shuter, who had the main comic character of Croaker, was so varied and ludicrous in his execution of the scene in which he reads an <b>incendiary</b> <b>letter</b> that he drew down thunders of applause. On his coming behind the scenes, Goldsmith greeted him with an overflowing heart; declaring that he exceeded his own idea of the character, and made it almost as new to him as {{to any of the}} audience.|$|E
50|$|In summer 2008, Levi posted an Open Letter to the RIAA in his blog. This <b>incendiary</b> <b>letter</b> spoke angrily of the {{possibility}} that Pandora.com would soon be shutting down due to measures taken by the Riaa and SoundExchange.|$|E
50|$|The guys bungle Dave's {{negotiating}} strategy, but end up {{appearing in}} the commercial. When the executives ask for Bret and Jemaine's work permits to process their fees, Bret and Jemaine {{find themselves in a}} quandary, because they are illegal immigrants. They call Murray to ask hom for their passports, which Murray says are in the consulate. Murray is reluctant to return to the place because he resigned with an <b>incendiary</b> <b>letter,</b> but he braces himself and finds that no one had noticed his quitting several months before and the letter is still on his desk, unread. He embraces his old desk in relief.|$|E
50|$|Botts {{spent eight}} weeks in solitary confinement. He was {{released}} after promising {{not to publish}} any more <b>incendiary</b> <b>letters,</b> and in January 1863 moved to a plantation he had won gambling, Auburn, in Culpeper County, Virginia, where Botts entertained both Union and Confederate officers at various times. He was arrested on October 12, 1863 by order of Confederate General J. E. B. Stuart, for entertaining Union officers (although three of his slaves had absconded for Union lines and he requested their return but was denied), but released later the same day.|$|R
5000|$|The Portland Mercury is an {{alternative}} weekly newspaper published in Portland, Oregon. It serves to chronicle the Portland music scene, and generally includes interviews, commentaries, reviews, and concert dates. It has an [...] "I, Anonymous" [...] section, in which local readers are encouraged to submit anonymous, usually impassioned, and often <b>incendiary</b> <b>letters</b> to the city at large, and Dan Savage's syndicated advice column Savage Love. There are adult, abstract and surrealist comic strips such as Maakies by Tony Millionaire, Kaz's Underworld by Kaz, and Idiot Box by Matt Bors. The Mercury is similar in style to its sibling publication, Seattle, Washington's The Stranger.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, he wrote {{much as a}} musical critic in the Ère nouvelle. After the {{performance}} of the ballet Parade (1917), he wrote a virulent criticism and Érik Satie sent him some <b>incendiary</b> <b>letters,</b> the most famous being thus written: [...] "Monsieur and dear friend, you are only an arse, worse, an arse without music". This being sent on a postcard without envelope, so likely to have been read by the concierge, Satie fell short of a one-year sentence for public defamation. At the trial Jean Cocteau was arrested and beaten by police for repeatedly yelling [...] "arse" [...] in the courtroom. Satie was given a sentence of eight days in jail. Satie was forced to pay a fine but on appeal his prison sentence was suspended and ultimately vacated. See Volta, [...] "Satie Seen Through His Letters", ...|$|R
50|$|On 5 April 1793, the French {{military}} commander and former minister of war General Charles François Dumouriez defected to Austria, following {{the publication of}} an <b>incendiary</b> <b>letter</b> in which he threatened to march his army on the city of Paris if the National Convention did not accede to his leadership. News of his defection caused alarm in Paris, where imminent defeat by the Austrians and their allies was feared. A widespread belief held that revolutionary France was in immediate peril, threatened not only by foreign armies and by recent anti-revolutionary revolts in the Vendée, but also by foreign agents who plotted {{the destruction of the}} nation from within.|$|E
2500|$|... 1898 January 13: The French writer Émile Zola {{exposed the}} Dreyfus affair {{to the general}} public in a famously <b>incendiary</b> open <b>letter</b> to President Félix Faure to which the French {{journalist}} and politician Georges Clemenceau affixed the headline [...] "J'accuse!" [...] (I accuse!). [...] Zola's world fame and internationally respected reputation brought international attention to Dreyfus' unjust treatment.|$|R
50|$|At first Jean {{decided to}} remain in Riobamba with his new wife, but in 1743 he offered to {{accompany}} La Condamine on his next expedition. He stayed behind to see Isabel through her pregnancy. But, when he heard of his father's death in March 1749, Godin {{decided to return to}} France with his family. He planned to travel alone to Cayenne, French Guiana via the Amazon to test whether the journey would be safe for them to take, and to make the necessary arrangements with the French authorities. Upon arriving in Cayenne, Godin found the Portuguese and Spanish colonial authorities would not let him — a Frenchman of no importance — return through their territory. Unwilling to return to France without his family, he became a reluctant resident of French Guiana, constantly writing pleas to Europe to allow for his return to Riobamba. Eventually, La Condamine wrote on Godin's behalf to the Portuguese king, who due to changing political circumstances was eager to befriend the French. In 1765 he ordered a galiot, crewed by thirty oarsmen, to take Godin back to his wife. However, as Godin had written some <b>incendiary</b> <b>letters</b> against the Portuguese, he was suspicious of the offer of passage up the Amazon, and abandoned the ship at its first port. The captain of the galiot continued upriver without him, to fetch the Frenchman's wife as ordered.|$|R
60|$|May 20.--This is the Selkirk election, which I {{supposed}} {{would be}} as tumultuous as the Jedburgh one, but the soutars of Selkirk had got a new light, and saw in the proposed Reform Bill nothing but a mode of disfranchising their ancient burgh. Although the crowd was great, yet there was a sufficient body of special constables, hearty in their useful office, and the election passed as quietly as I ever witnessed one. I came home before dinner, very quiet. I am afraid there is something serious in Galashiels; Jeffrey is fairly funked about it, and has written letters to the authorities of Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire to caution us against making the precognitions public, which looks ill. Yet I {{think he would have}} made arrests when the soldiers were in the country. The time at which I settled at Abbotsford, Whitsunday 1811, I broke up a conspiracy of the weavers. It will look like sympathising with any renewal if another takes place just now. <b>Incendiary</b> <b>letters</b> have been sent, and the householders are in a general state of alarm. The men at Jedburgh Castle are said to be disposed to make a clean breast; if so, we shall soon know more of the matter. Lord William Graham has been nearly murdered at Dumbarton. Why should he not have brought down 50 or 100 lads with the kilts, each with a good kent[461] in his hand fit to call the soul out of the body of these weavers? They would have kept order, I warrant you.|$|R
40|$|The French bishops, {{the first}} {{body of the}} first Order of the state, were {{frequently}} consulted during the 1780 s, which indicates their importance. On 24 th January 1789, {{the right to vote}} was accorded to {{all the members of the}} secular clergy and the baillage was fixed as the electoral unit, thus breaking with tradition by choosing the bishops in the dioceses. There were only about forty bishops in the Estates General and they took part in all the 1789 debates, especially in the discussions concerning the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the nationalisation of Church property and the establishment of the Catholic Church. The bishops «refusal to proclaim catholicism the state religion (28 th August) was the first sign of disagreement with the deputies, followed in October by the distribution of <b>incendiary</b> pastoral <b>letters</b> ».
