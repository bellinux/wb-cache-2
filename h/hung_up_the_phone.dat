25|$|After {{returning}} to Fitzroy Crossing, Oscar worked in state government community welfare and health departments, before becoming the Junjuwa Community Women’s Resource Officer in 1989. She then became the Chairperson of the Marra Worra Worra Aboriginal Corporation, one of Australia’s {{oldest and most}} respected Aboriginal community centres, until 1991, when she was appointed Commissioner of the Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Commission for a 2-year term. When she was 29 years old, Oscar {{received a phone call}} from Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner asking her to join the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. She <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> because she thought the call was a hoax but then decided to call him back.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked {{to the front of the}} property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E
500|$|When {{journalist}} Murat Halstead telephoned McKinley from Chicago {{to inform}} him that Bryan would be nominated, he responded dismissively and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> [...] Bryan's nomination briefly gratified the Republicans, believing that his selection {{would lead to}} an easy victory for McKinley. In those days when the presidential campaign did not begin in earnest until September, Hanna had planned a vacation while McKinley anticipated a quiet summer. [...] The Republicans were caught by surprise by the wave of enthusiasm that Bryan's speech and nomination caused, and scuttled these plans; as Hanna wrote to McKinley on July 16, [...] "the Chicago convention has changed everything".|$|E
50|$|On October 5, 2007 a white Lincoln Continental {{was found}} burning {{in a field}} in Topeka, Kansas. A body was found inside, {{severely}} burned. A week later it {{was determined to be}} the remains of Edwyn Owen. The Kansas state Fire Marshall's Office determined that the car's heated catalytic converter set fire to the dense dry grass around the vehicle. Only later was Owen's increasingly bizarre behavior reported. He <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> abruptly on <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with old friends, left rambling telephone messages and claimed he was a character in a fictional children's book.|$|R
50|$|Sushil Sharma {{objected to}} his wife Naina Sahni's {{friendship}} with Matloob Karim. Matloob and Naina were classmates and fellow Congress workers. Sushil suspected Naina of having an extramarital relationship with Matloob. On the night of 2 July 1995, Sushil came home and saw Naina talking on <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and consuming alcohol. Naina on seeing Sushil <b>hung</b> <b>up.</b> Sushil redialed <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to find Matloob on the other end. Enraged he fatally shot Naina. He took the body to a restaurant called Bagiya and tried to dispose it off with the restaurant manager, Keshav Kumar. The body was chopped into pieces {{and put in a}} tandoor (clay oven) to burn. Police arrested Keshav Kumar but Sharma managed to flee. He surrendered on July 10, 1995. The case also involved the use of DNA evidence to establish the identity of the victim.|$|R
5000|$|Sallam studied law, {{receiving}} {{a law degree}} from Cairo University in 2007 and a Maîtrise in Commercial Law from Pantheon-Sorbonne University in Paris, France in 2007. She also studied in the United States, and received a Master of Laws degree (LL.M.) in International Human Rights Law from the University of Notre Dame in 2010. While pursuing these degrees, she also worked professionally as a human rights activist in Egypt. As a researcher at the Cairo offices of the Institut de recherche pour le développement, a French think-tank, she investigated the effects of divorce law and policy on Egyptian women's lives. Later she joined the Civil Freedoms Unit at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), a leading domestic human rights group. There she focused on discrimination and violence against religious minorities. Hossam Bahgat, founder of the EIPR, later recalled: “One of the remarkable things about Yara is her ability to carry out professional work without losing sight of her feelings ... I remember in 2009 when there were attacks on Bahá'ís’ home in a village near Sohag, I came into Yara’s office while she was taking a testimony over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> from a 70-year-old woman; the woman’s house had been burned down, she had been expelled from her village, and her only hope was to return to her home to die there. Yara <b>hung</b> <b>up,</b> put <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> down next to her, and started writing on the computer while bursting into tears.” ...|$|R
500|$|All of {{the players}} were {{cooperative}} except for Jose Canseco, who was intimidating. He disliked his original part and insisted it be rewritten, and the writers grudgingly made him as heroic as possible. He was originally slated {{to wake up in}} bed with Edna Krabappel and miss the game, but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected. He disliked his caricature, stating that [...] "the animation looked nothing like ," [...] but that he found the acting was very easy. When asked in 2007 about his part by the San Jose Mercury News, he responded, [...] "that was 100 years ago," [...] <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and did not answer any of the paper's subsequent calls for an interview about his guest spot.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{nomination}} in June, McKinley's team had {{believed that the}} election would be fought {{on the issue of}} the protective tariff. [...] Chicago banker Charles G. Dawes, a McKinley advisor who had known Bryan when both lived in Lincoln, had predicted to McKinley and his friend and campaign manager, Mark Hanna, that if Bryan had the chance to speak to the convention, he would be its choice. [...] McKinley and Hanna gently mocked Dawes, telling him that Bland would be the nominee. [...] In the three weeks between the two conventions, McKinley spoke only on the tariff question, and when journalist Murat Halstead telephoned him from Chicago to inform him that Bryan would be nominated, he responded dismissively and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> [...] When Bryan was nominated on a silver platform, the Republicans were briefly gratified, believing that Bryan's selection would result in an easy victory for McKinley.|$|E
500|$|When McKinley {{heard that}} Bryan {{was likely to}} be the nominee, he called the report [...] "rot" [...] and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> The Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination, stating his view that the silver {{sentiment}} would be gone in a month. When McKinley and his advisers, such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna, realized that the views were more than transitory, they began intensive fundraising from corporations and the wealthy. The money went for speakers, pamphlets, and other means of conveying their [...] "sound money" [...] campaign to the voter. With far less money than McKinley, Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then-unprecedented scale. [...] McKinley on the other hand, opted for a front porch campaign. Both men spoke to {{hundreds of thousands of people}} from their chosen venues.|$|E

50|$|Another simple trick {{used by the}} {{fraudsters}} is to ask the called {{parties to}} hang up and dial their bank, but after <b>the</b> victim hangs <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> fraudster does not, keeping the line open and remaining connected when <b>the</b> victim picks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to dial. When in doubt, calling a company's telephone number listed on billing statements or other official sources is recommended, as opposed to calling numbers received from messages or callers of dubious authenticity. However, sometimes hanging up and redialing is insufficient: if the caller has not <b>hung</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> victim might still be connected, and the fraudster spoofs a dial tone down <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> line to entice the victim to dial. Then the fraudster's accomplice answers and impersonates whomever the victim is trying to call. This {{is known as a}} 'no hang-up' scam. Hence consumers are advised to use a different phone when dialing a company's number to confirm.|$|R
500|$|A.G. Gaston, who {{was appalled}} {{at the idea of}} using children, {{was on the phone with}} white {{attorney}} David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. [...] When Gaston looked out the window and saw the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, [...] "Lawyer Vann, I can't talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the trades}} {{indicated}} production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg {{and asked him}} bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where {{he had heard the}} rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was [...] "out to get him" [...] and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. In truth, Katzenberg was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt, which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release. Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major issue}} in the {{campaign}} that was considered to have hurt the DFL nominees was lieutenant gubernatorial candidate Judi Dutcher's response to a questiona about E-85. When asked {{about the impact of}} the gasoline alternative on the economies of rural Minnesota by then KSAX-TV anchor Corey Poppe, Dutcher was unable to comment, asking Poppe to define E-85. In the subsequent questioning about her response, gubernatorial candidate Mike Hatch reportedly called a Forum Communications reporter [...] "a Republican whore" [...] and promptly <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Hatch claimed he had said [...] "hack", not [...] "whore", but the incident, occurring only three days before the last poll listed in this article, is believed to have swung the race. It put Hatch on the defensive in the campaign's last week.|$|E

2500|$|In 1968, {{one year}} after their live debut and now dubbed the Stooges, the band signed with Elektra Records, again {{following}} in the footsteps of The Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (reportedly, Pop called Moe Howard to see if it was all right to call his band [...] "The Stooges," [...] to which Howard responded by merely saying [...] "I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're not the Three Stooges!" [...] and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone).</b> The Stooges' first album The Stooges, (on which Pop was credited as [...] "Iggy Stooge"), was produced by John Cale in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, Fun House produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of Fun House did not receive the recognition it expected, it was later ranked #191 in Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003. Shortly after the new members joined, the group disbanded because of Pop's worsening heroin addiction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Thayer was {{the author}} of a {{controversial}} series of articles about race demonstrations in Charleston, South Carolina, in the wake of shootings carried out by Dylann Roof. The stories, which were first published in MarxRand, eventually attracted attention from the mainstream press. In particular, a story called [...] "Patriot Games" [...] was picked up by mainstream news organizations after being published on MarxRand, and subsequently commissioned as a separate story run in Vice later the same week. In the original version of the story, Thayer claimed that a Ku Klux Klan leader named Chris Barker was doubling as an undercover FBI operative [...] "working for and protected by the U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force." [...] As a result of Barker's outing, Thayer wrote in September 2015 that [...] "Mr Barker (has called and) <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> several times, sent me incendiary emails and made threatening phone calls, and has since gone on White Nationalist internet forums to try to denounce the articles and defend his reputation" [...] and that other Klan members had [...] "threatened to decapitate my dog." ...|$|E
2500|$|One official, Back Judge Adrian Burk, {{signaled}} that {{the play was}} a touchdown, but the other game officials did not immediately make any signal. When the officials huddled, Burk and another official, Umpire Pat Harder, thought that the play was a touchdown because Tatum and Fuqua had both touched the ball, while three others {{said that they were}} {{not in a position to}} rule. Referee Fred Swearingen approached Steelers sideline official Jim Boston and asked to be taken to a telephone. Boston took Swearingen to a baseball dugout in the stadium. There was a video monitor in the dugout, but it was not used by Swearingen. (Terry Bradshaw's assertion that a special television was rigged up on the sideline so that Swearingen could watch the replay is not supported by other accounts.) From the dugout telephone Boston put in a call to the press box to reach the NFL's supervisor of officials, Art McNally. Before the call McNally had [...] "an opinion from the get-go" [...] that the ball had hit Tatum's chest, which he confirmed by looking [...] "at one shot on instant replay." [...] In the press box the telephone was answered either by Dan Rooney, son of Steelers owner Art Rooney, or by Steelers public relations director Joe Gordon (reports vary), and McNally was put on the line. According to McNally, Swearingen [...] "never asked me about the rule, and never asked what I saw. All he said was, 'Two of my men say that opposing players touched the ball.' And I said, 'everything's fine then, go ahead.'" [...] After Swearingen <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> Boston asked, [...] "What do we got?" [...] "We got a touchdown," [...] answered Swearingen, who then went back onto the field to signal the ruling to the crowd. Franco Harris crossed the goal line at approximately 3:29 PM EST. Fans immediately rushed the field, and it took 15 minutes to clear them so that the extra point could be kicked to give the Steelers what turned out to be their final margin of victory, 13–7.|$|E
