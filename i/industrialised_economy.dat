40|$|Abstract: Although FDI {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{to have a positive}} effect on economic growth, the exact mechanism of how FDI impacts upon the development process of the newly <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies</b> is far from being well understood. This paper presents and tests two propositions on the role of FDI in economic growth from a newly <b>industrialising</b> <b>economy’s</b> perspective. First, FDI is a mover of production efficiency because it helps reduce the gap between the actual level of production and a steady state production frontier. Second, FDI being embedded with advanced technologies and knowledge is a shifter of the host country’s production frontier. Due to its dual role as a mover of production efficiency and a shifter of production frontier, FDI is a powerful driver of economic growth for a newly <b>industrialising</b> <b>economy</b> to catch up with the world’s most advanced countries. China’s economic success over the past decades provides an ideal example to test the hypotheses. JEL...|$|R

Further, German banks are supervised by two supervisory institutions and have the highest deposit insurance in the world. And last but not least, German banks are numerous, perform poorly, and are part of a historically grown three-pillar system. Hence, German banks can indeed be characterised as unique when compared to other <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R

50|$|Agricultural {{developments}} have meant {{that since the}} 1960s unemployment has fallen from over 60 percent to under 10 percent in the early-2000s. In the same period food prices halved, hunger decreased (from 2.55 million households in 1988 to 418,000 in 2007) and child malnutrition was reduced (from 17 percent in 1987 to seven percent in 2006). This has been achieved through a strong state role in ensuring investment in infrastructure, education, and access to credit and successful private initiatives in the agribusiness sector. This has supported Thailand's transition to an <b>industrialised</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Developments in {{agriculture}} since the 1960s have supported Thailand's transition to an <b>industrialised</b> <b>economy.</b> As recently as 1980, agriculture supplied 70 percent of employment. In 2008, agriculture, forestry and fishing contributed 8.4 percent to GDP; in rural areas, farm jobs supply half of employment. Rice {{is the most}} important crop in the country and Thailand had long been the world's number one exporter of rice, until recently falling behind both India and Vietnam. It is a major exporter of shrimp. Other crops include coconuts, corn, rubber, soybeans, sugarcane and tapioca.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the slow}} rate of {{industrialisation}} into the 19th century, many important changes {{were taking place}} in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth. These innovations included government-sponsored programmes of enclosure, aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato. Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in Swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party). Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the <b>industrialised</b> <b>economy</b> that exists today.|$|E

40|$|The {{globalisation}} hypothesis {{has altered}} {{many of the}} common-sense ‘truths’ around which the social world is organised. * In particular, globalisation is thought to restrict {{the parameters of the}} politically and economically possible. Indeed, the notion of constrained choice is so pronounced that we are increasingly confronted with the image of globalisation’s ‘logic of no alternative’; an image which is predicated on the assumption of perfect capital mobility. Capital is considered to be sufficiently rational to take advantage of enhanced exit options from the national economy in circumstances in which its interests are served by moving off-shore. Moreover, global markets are also assumed to have exploited contemporary technological developments {{to such an extent that}} they now clear instantaneously; consequently, allowing capital to further its interests wherever in the world new profit opportunities arise. Thus, we are presented with the fundamental ‘reality’ of globalisation as currently narrated throughout much of the west: unless the market can be allowed to restore a competitive global equilibrium, capital will exit high-wage, high-cost western economies and re-locate in lower-wage, lower-cost, newly <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies.</b> Under the auspices of ever more hostile wage competition from the newly <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies,</b> globalisation is commonly presumed to act as a trigger for an ‘inevitable’ job displacement effect as capital deserts the advanced <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R

The increase in manufacturing reflects a more <b>industrialised</b> <b>economy,</b> despite the 1811 Census data being recorded in the time of Industrial Revolution; Boraston had little involvement as a small remote community with a small work force. An increase in services as an occupational category also reflects the UK's shift from primary production to having an increased tertiary sector of the economy.|$|E

[...] The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership {{as a consequence of}} the effects of the Great Depression on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an <b>industrialised</b> <b>economy.</b> The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the Nair Service Society (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.|$|E

We examine the use of one class {{of advanced}} producer services - those provided by the air cargo industry - by manufacturers in Southeast Asia. The air cargo industry has grown rapidly in this region and plays an increasingly important intra- and interregional integrative role. We are interested specifically in the demand for knowledge-intensive advanced air cargo services, which include for instance time-definite express services, by electronics manufacturers in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. Employing several analytical approaches, we find that demand for advanced air cargo services {{is related to the}} degree to which a firm's operations are knowledge-intensive, its size, and the scope of its internationalisation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} China's growth patterns through its exports, foreign capital inflows, {{balance of payments}} and terms of trade, and projects them into a comparative framework. It brings together, for the first time, various sources of historical data from the first globalisation era, relating to four of the most <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies</b> - the UK, the US, Germany and Japan. By comparison, it finds that China's trade expansion has no doubt exceeded that {{of any of the}} <b>industrialised</b> <b>economies</b> in the first globalisation era; however, this trade boom is a characteristic of post-war globalisation. Large capital inflows, surplus in both current and capital accounts, and the negative correlation between terms of trade and exports are not unique Chinese phenomena in the history of globalisation. However, China's trade liberalisation, industrialisation policy, FDI strategy and cautious foreign exchange policy have all contributed to the exploitation of the positive effects of globalisation. globalisation, exports, foreign direct investment, dual surplus, terms of trade,...|$|R
40|$|This enlightening text {{analyses}} {{the origins}} of Western complaints, prevalent {{in the late nineteenth}} century, that Japan was characterised at the time by exceptionally low standards of 'commercial morality', despite a major political and economic transformation.

Concerns about standards of business ethics extended to other <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies,</b> such as the United States. Hunter examines the Japanese response to the charges levelled against Japan in this context, arguing that this was shaped by a pragmatic recognition that Japan {{had little choice but to}} adapt itself to Western expectations if it was to establish its position in the global economy. The controversy and criticisms, which were at least in part stimulated by fear of Japanese competition, are important in the history of thinking on business ethics, and are of relevance for today's <b>industrialising</b> <b>economies</b> as they attempt to establish themselves in international markets...|$|R
