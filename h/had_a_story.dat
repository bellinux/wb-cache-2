25|$|Hungarian {{comic book}} artists found {{themselves}} in a very new and alien situation: while comics were having their heyday, young readers' interest drifted from Hungarian comics to the much more modern and spectacular superhero comics. Attila Fazekas, whose Star Wars adaptations were printed in 300,000 copies a decade earlier, now tries every way to remain on the surface. He produced and published his own magazine, Botond. These comic books comprised all kinds of stories, from historical to action. Every issue <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of Botond, a character based on Hungarian legends and Asterix. He also experimented with erotic (or rather pornographic) comics – with surprisingly small success.|$|E
25|$|The Aztecs {{were one}} of the last of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples who {{migrated}} to this part of the Valley of Mexico {{after the fall of the}} Toltec Empire. Their presence was resisted by the peoples who were already there, but the Aztecs were able to establish a city on a small island on the western side of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs themselves <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about how their city was founded after being led to the island by their principal god, Huitzilopochtli. According to the story, the god indicated their new home with a sign, an eagle perched on a nopal cactus with a snake in its beak. This image appears in Codex Mendoza, an early post-conquest manuscript, one of many Aztec codices, pictorial texts, and since Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the image is in the center of the Mexican flag. Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states or altepetl around Lake Texcoco, and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the Aztec Empire reached much of Mesoamerica, touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said the}} episode [...] "had plenty of standout bits" [...] {{but that it}} [...] "represented a major flaw" [...] and [...] "perhaps in the program as a whole", citing that [...] "here {{seems to be more}} of an emphasis on comedic 'bits' rather than comedic 'situations,' which doesn't bode well for a situation comedy." [...] He explained that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] in particular [...] "felt very disjointed, bouncing between jokes more than storylines. It even opened with a Jenna surprise-birthday segment that was funny for what it was, but had {{absolutely nothing to do with}} the rest of the show." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.0 out 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich liked that Josh <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in this episode, and said that his impression of Tracy was [...] "pretty good". He remarked that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] was [...] "a solid episode, if a bit too theme-y for my broad-sitcom liking." ...|$|E

500|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura, while exchanging e-mails with director Yoshinori Kitase {{during the}} period between the development of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII, suggested that the game should have a [...] "school days" [...] feel. Because Nojima already <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in mind in which the main characters were the same age, the idea worked. Thus, they created the concept of military academies, called [...] "Gardens", in which students would train to become [...] "SeeD" [...] mercenaries. Nojima also planned for the two playable parties featured in the game—Squall's present day group and Laguna Loire's group of twenty years in the past—to highly contrast with one another. Laguna's group consists of characters in their late twenties and {{have a lot of}} combat experience. They are also close friends who have fought together {{for a long time and}} trust one another. On the other hand, Squall's party is young and inexperienced, and Squall himself does not initially understand the value of friendship.|$|E
500|$|The plot of Final Fantasy VIII was {{conceived}} by Kitase, with the stories for the characters provided by Nomura {{and the actual}} scenario written by Nojima. During the game's pre-production, Nomura suggested the game be given a [...] "school days" [...] feel. Nojima already <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in mind in which the main characters were the same age; their ideas meshed, taking form as the [...] "Garden" [...] military academies. Nojima planned that the two playable parties featured in the game (Squall's present day group and Laguna's group from the past) would be highly contrasted with one another. This idea was conveyed through the age and experience of Laguna's group, versus the youth and naïveté of Squall's group. Nojima has expressed that the dynamic of players' relationships with the protagonist is important to him. Both Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII feature reserved, quiet protagonists {{in the form of}} Cloud Strife and Squall. With Final Fantasy VIII, however, Nojima worked to give players actual insight into what the character was thinking; a direct contrast with his handling of Final Fantasy VII, which encouraged the player to speculate.|$|E
500|$|Hordern was {{appearing}} {{in three to}} four films a year by 1953, a count that increased as the decade progressed. In 1956 he took a leading part in The Spanish Gardener for which he spent many months filming in southern Spain alongside Dirk Bogarde, Cyril Cusack, and Bernard Lee. The New York Times called Hordern's role of the strict and pompous Harrington Brande [...] "an unsympathetic assignment", but thought the actor did [...] "quite well" [...] in his portrayal. [...] By the mid-1950s Hordern's name was becoming one of reliability and good value; as a result, he was offered a clutch of roles. In 1956 he appeared as Demosthenes in Alexander the Great, and Commander Lindsay in The Night My Number Came Up. He appeared in two other films the following year; the medical drama No Time for Tears, and the thriller Windom's Way. The Second World War was a popular genre for filmmakers during the 1950s. Hordern said the conflict took up {{a large part of}} people's lives; [...] "whether it be one of love, loss, nostalgia or tragedy", everybody, according to the actor, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> to tell and could relate to the situations that were being depicted before them on screen. He found his earlier naval experience to be an asset when cast in many war films, including The Man Who Never Was, Pacific Destiny, The Baby and the Battleship, all in 1956, and I Was Monty's Double two years later.|$|E

[...] The codebreakers had reason to correctly interpret the Japanese intent. [...] Edwin T. Layton's staff included Lieutenant Jasper Holmes, who, writing under the pen name Alec Hudson, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> entitled Rendezvous published in an August, 1941, Saturday Evening Post. [...] His fictitious story about refueling United States planes from submarines at a remote island for an air attack on a target 3000 miles away had been withheld from publication for a year until the author convinced United States Navy censors the techniques described were known to other navies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{proved to}} be controversial. The following week, the Greens, who had polled 11.5% of the vote at the 1995 election, had suggested they may not preference Mooney due to his pro-development stance and previous clashes with the environmental movement, especially over the Nelly Bay resort development on Magnetic Island, and Davies, who was directing all calls to the Sydney promoter Harry M. Miller, announced that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that would [...] "rock the Goss Government" [...] when it was told. On 21 December, Davies hit out directly at Goss, accusing him of breaking a promise made to him before he entered politics, saying, [...] "It was a package he was offering me. He {{made a commitment to}} me and I expected him to abide by that commitment." [...] He asserted the claims he would be bankrupted by the legal case were [...] "uninformed", and that the case was public knowledge before he was appointed to the Ministry.

2500|$|Price {{has stated}} that Hasbro does give them freedom to write and draw the comic as they see fit, {{typically}} only asking for changes to achieve [...] "a little bit more show accuracy". In one case, they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> planned that Hasbro told them was being done within the show, and had to scrap it; in another case, they had initially planned to open the first issue with the Cutie Mark Crusaders camping, but found that the show already had a similar scene, within the Season 3 episode [...] "Sleepless in Ponyville", and altered these pages for something different. Other elements of the show have been considered [...] "off limits" [...] for the comics until blessed by Hasbro; the villain Discord {{was considered one of}} these until the start of Season 4 of the show which changed aspects of his character, after which Hasbro allowed the comic to use the character. Price states they tried to keep their novel stories [...] "copacetic" [...] with the show, giving them the chance to take some risks; he stated that Hasbro was initially [...] "scared to death" [...] with their [...] "Reflections" [...] arc, which incorporate many science fiction elements such as alternate universe, but ended up pleased with the result.|$|E

I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E
