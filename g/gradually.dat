5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on August 11 and <b>gradually</b> organized. The next day, an atmospheric circulation developed. Based on this, this system {{was classified as}} Tropical Depression Nine on August 13. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hilary. The system <b>gradually</b> accelerated to the northwest and reached its peak strength on August 15 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It became a depression on August 16, turned {{a little bit more}} westward, and dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death or damage.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} this strength, {{the storm}} slowed and <b>gradually</b> {{took a more}} northwesterly course, heading towards Pinar del Río Province in western Cuba. On September16, the system attained winds of 75mph (120km/h), what would now be considered a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Moving at a slow pace of , the system <b>gradually</b> intensified. Late on September18, {{the center of the}} storm was estimated to have made landfall in Pinar del Río Province with winds of 100mph (155km/h); an atmospheric pressure of 976mbar (hPa; 28.82inHg) was recorded during its passage. The storm's eye passed over the town of Manta for four hours, between 3:00pm and 7:00pm on September17.|$|E

5|$|All healing items, {{including}} {{food and}} water, do not heal the player instantly, but work over {{a short period}} of time. RadAway also takes time to <b>gradually</b> decrease radiation poisoning, rather than instantly.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{division}} was intended purely as an administrative convenience, local authorities <b>gradually</b> gained more {{influence over the}} schools they aided, {{in part because of}} the schools' weak financial position during the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Berni's work <b>gradually</b> {{became more}} spiritual and reflective. In 1980 he {{completed}} the paintings Apocalipsis (Apocalypse) and La crucifixion (The Crucifixion) for the Chapel of San Luis Gonzaga in Las Heras, {{where they were}} installed the following year.|$|E
5|$|During the Roman period, Bayt Jibrin had a mixed {{population}} of Jews, Christians and pagans. Under Muslim rule, Islam <b>gradually</b> became the dominant religion {{and by the}} 20th century, the entire population was Muslim.|$|E

5|$|In late September, three {{tropical}} disturbances moved westward {{across the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. One of them organized into a tropical depression on September28. The {{next day the}} depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Monica. The tropical storm initially headed west-northwestward and <b>gradually</b> curved towards the north. It reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on September29. Monica then <b>gradually</b> weakened. It became a tropical depression on October1. The cyclone dissipated shortly thereafter. No impact was reported in association with Tropical Storm Monica.|$|E

5|$|On Mauritius, {{power and}} water were <b>gradually</b> {{restored}} following the storm, and people without power used generators. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided $10,000 (1989USD) {{to the country}} to purchase water tanks and saws.|$|E

5|$|Some medical thermometers, {{especially}} those for high temperatures, {{are filled with}} mercury; they are <b>gradually</b> disappearing. In the United States, non-prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers has been banned since 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Kowloon Bay salt-fields {{were rich}} in salt, and this brought wealth to the {{residents}} near the bay. <b>Gradually,</b> Ham Tin Shan became villages. Because of the region's shoreline location, agricultural activities started with the plantation of high-salinity crops. With a quarry found in So Mo Ping (now Sau Mau Ping), the region <b>gradually</b> became a small fishing, farming and quarrying town.|$|E
5|$|The Roman levy of 403BC was {{the first}} to be {{requested}} to campaign for longer than a single season, and from this point on such a practice became <b>gradually</b> more common, if still not typical.|$|E
5|$|The SH-30 {{designation}} {{dates back}} to March 31, 1936, when it spanned from Erick to Sweetwater. The highway <b>gradually</b> evolved over the years, reaching its current form in 1970.|$|E

5|$|The {{class was}} <b>gradually</b> {{superseded}} on top link expresses during the 1940s by {{growing numbers of}} Bulleid Pacifics, although throughout the 1950s they were frequently called upon during peak periods or to deputise for failures. The rebuilding of the Pacifics in the late 1950s and their subsequent increased reliability rendered the Lord Nelson surplus to operational requirements, and they were <b>gradually</b> phased out of service. The entire class was withdrawn during 1961 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{ownership}} of the line was <b>gradually</b> {{taken over by the}} municipality through Oslo Sporveier. In 1975, most of the shares were bought, along with those that Oslo Sporveier had received as part of the municipal merger with Aker in 1948. <b>Gradually</b> during the 1970s and 1980s, Holmenkolbanen became more integrated into Oslo Sporveier, including the two using the same rolling stock, tickets and uniforms. Oslo Sporveier upgraded the line in {{the last half of the}} 1970s, laying new ties, upgrading the tracks to higher weight and purchasing new trams.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} moved eastward through the United States {{in the middle}} part of July, and reached the East Coast of the United States on July23. By the {{following}} day, a low pressure area developed just southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina ahead of the frontal zone, and quickly formed into a subtropical depression. In association with a nearby upper-level low, the depression tracked quickly southeastward before turning to the southwest. The subtropical depression <b>gradually</b> organized, and satellite classifications began subsequent to merging with a tropical wave on July25. Convection developed closer {{to the center of}} circulation as it <b>gradually</b> decelerated while continuing southwestward and on July27, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 335miles (539.1km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Activity at Alta Airport {{peaked in}} the {{following}} years. SAS served Alta with up to ten daily services; at peak hours six aircraft were at the airport simultaneously, including two from Widerøe. From 1992, SAS reintroduced direct services from Kirkenes to Oslo, and aircraft in eastern Finnmark again started feeding into Kirkenes. The hub paradigm was thus <b>gradually</b> abandoned by SAS. Flights at Alta <b>gradually</b> decreased, hitting a low of 4,935 movements (landings and take-offs) in 2000. The North Cape Tunnel opened in 1999, connecting Honningsvåg and Nordkapp to the mainland. This reduced travel time to Alta and people from Nordkapp started using Alta more for long-haul flights {{at the expense of}} Honningsvåg Airport.|$|E
5|$|Activity <b>gradually</b> {{declined}} {{over the}} next two years but stabilized at a higher level than before 1975. The increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker since 1975, but no other changes suggest that magma movement is involved.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler and the NSDAP came {{to power}} on 30 January 1933, the SS were {{considered}} a state organization and {{a branch of the}} government. Law enforcement <b>gradually</b> became the purview of the SS, and many SS organizations became de facto government agencies.|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone <b>gradually</b> weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, and {{over a period of}} 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still as a very severe cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to <b>gradually</b> decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E
5|$|All the {{original}} World War II era overpasses dating {{back in the}} 1940s and 1950s built between Whitby and Oshawa will <b>gradually</b> be replaced with new overpasses as part of modern highway safety standards and to allow highway widening sometime in the future.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all traces}} of the Consett {{steelworks}} have been removed. Only the Terra Novalis sculptures (pictured), made with materials from the site, recall past industry.
