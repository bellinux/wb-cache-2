5|$|Having {{left the}} others, Xavier {{returns to the}} safe room and finds a colored number {{on the back of}} Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Minister's true {{identity}} {{is found to}} be that of the Master R.O.B. unit, who rebels against Ganondorf to join the allied characters. The three major groups that had formed over the storyline then all converge in one area, and use the Halberd to battle Ganondorf and Bowser's subspace gunship. Although they destroy the Halberd, all of the characters make it out unscathed in smaller vehicles. Unable to hit so many targets, Ganondorf and Bowser retreat into subspace after Kirby destroys the gunship with his dragoon. An enraged Ganondorf turns Bowser into a trophy with his dark cannon, and he learns that Master Hand was being manipulated by the chains of the actual Subspace Army leader, known only as Tabuu. Ganondorf <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> does the attack on Tabuu who easily defeats him, Ganondorf collides with Master Hand, thus breaking free from the chains and turning Ganondorf into his trophy. Master Hand attempts to attack Tabuu, but to no avail.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, a {{frustrated}} Tom Cruise angrily <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{down on a}} couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is {{a reference to the}} twelfth season episode [...] "The China Probrem", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should [...] "just have sex with him [...] already". Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, {{which is one of the}} many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character. [...] Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as [...] "her," [...] to which the discussion goes [...] "her who?" [...] "her" [...] "oh...her." [...] This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks [...] "what did I ever do to you" [...] and Rick answers [...] "it wasn't what you did to me, it was what you did to her" [...] Steve: [...] "her? oh...her" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Rally Monkey {{was born}} in 2000 when the {{scoreboard}} showed a clip from , after which the Angels rallied to win the game. The clip proved to be so popular that the team hired Katie, a white-haired capuchin monkey, to star in original clips for later games. When seen, she <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down to the House of Pain song [...] "Jump Around" [...] and holds {{a sign that says}} [...] "RALLY TIME!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The whole {{apartment}} {{watches as}} the prostitute <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down naked, and hits a giggling, equally naked Orr {{on the head with}} her heeled shoes. Each time she jumps and hit him, Orr giggles louder, making her even more angry. She then would jump even higher and hit him harder, causing him to giggle even more. The vicious cycle ends after fifteen to twenty minutes when she knocks him out cold with a good whack to his head, leaving him with a concussion [...] "that kept him out of combat for only twelve days." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} {{that led to}} the inspiration for the play was a moment in the 2003 Piers Morgan documentary The Importance of Being Famous where a young girl <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down in a field for several minutes, then asks [...] "Am I famous yet?" [...] This quote was originally intended as the title of the play. However, after looking through a dictionary of quotations, he came across an old English proverb, [...] "It is folly to drown on dry land". The title was changed accordingly, and a similar line was included {{towards the end of the}} play.|$|E

Al Bundy and his friends tie Springer to a chair and take over his show with a stripper who <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down for the crowd's delight. He was in several episodes of George Lopez as Benny Lopez's ex-boyfriend Wayne and made a July 2007 guest appearance on Days of Our Lives as [...] "Pete", a high roller in Las Vegas who helped Nick Fallon win $50,000.|$|E
2500|$|The Angels' 2000 season {{marked the}} {{introduction}} of a mascot known as the Rally Monkey. The whole movement began as a joke by the video crew in the stadium during a game where the Angels were trailing the Giants 5–4. A looped clip of [...] where a monkey <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down was shown on the Jumbotron Video Screen with the flashing sign of [...] "Rally Monkey" [...] during times when the Angels got runners on base while behind or tied. The Angels went on to win that game, and started to build a following as [...] "the comeback kids", most famously exemplified in Game 6 of the 2002 World Series (coincidentally against the Giants).|$|E
2500|$|He {{suggested}} {{more than}} a hundred meditation techniques in total. His own [...] "active meditation" [...] techniques are characterised by stages of physical activity leading to silence. The most famous of these remains Dynamic Meditation, which {{has been described as a}} kind of microcosm of his outlook. Performed with closed or blindfolded eyes, it comprises five stages, four of which are accompanied by music. First the meditator engages in ten minutes of rapid breathing through the nose. The second ten minutes are for catharsis: [...] "Let whatever is happening happen. … Laugh, shout, scream, jump, shake—whatever you feel to do, do it!" [...] Next, for ten minutes one <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down with arms raised, shouting Hoo! each time one lands on the flat of the feet. At the fourth, silent stage, the meditator stops moving suddenly and totally, remaining completely motionless for fifteen minutes, witnessing everything that is happening. The last stage of the meditation consists of fifteen minutes of dancing and celebration.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-July, it was {{announced}} that Douglas had once again left Chow's Gymnastics & Dance Institute. [...] She remained {{in the market for a}} new coach until the beginning of August, when news broke that Douglas would train under Kittia Carpenter at Buckeye Gymnastics in Westerville, Ohio. [...] Nia Dennis, national team member, also trained at Buckeye at the time. [...] Carpenter announced that Douglas would not aim to return to competition at the 2014 national championships, as previously planned, but would instead train with a goal of returning in time for Worlds 2015. [...] The stated reasoning for Douglas's delay is that she wishes to return as strong as – or stronger than – when she left. [...] National Team Coordinator Marta Karolyi, who expressed satisfaction and some surprise with Douglas's physical condition at her first two national team training camps back (while she was once again working with Chow), commented on Douglas's planned comeback in Ohio, [...] "My wish is that she will be consistent in her training. And if that's what she will do, I think she will be fine. But if she <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down and left and right, it will be much harder." ...|$|E
