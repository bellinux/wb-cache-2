While in solution reversible electronic energy transfer is instilled between chromophoric termini of the <b>free,</b> <b>flexible</b> thread as evidenced through delayed luminescence, upon rigidification of the rod the chromophores are mutually distanced and effectively decoupled. Consequently, the chromophores display their individual photophysical characteristics.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{substitution}} with different functional groups and of molecular flexibility by changing within the axle from a single C–C bond to a double C=C bond. Therefore, we present static quantum chemical calculations at the dispersion-corrected density functional level (DFT-D 3) for several Leigh-type rotaxanes. The calculated crystal structure is {{in close agreement with}} the experimental X-ray data. Compared to a stiffer <b>axle,</b> a more <b>flexible</b> one results in a stronger binding by 1 – 3 kcal/mol. Alterations of the binding energy in the range of 5 kcal/mol could be achieved by substitution with different functional groups. The hydrogen bond geometry between the isophtalic unit and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the axle exhibited distances in the range of 2. 1 to 2. 4 Å for six contact points, which shows that not solely but to a large amount the circumstances in the investigated rotaxanes are governed by hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the complex with the more <b>flexible</b> <b>axle</b> is usually more unsymmetrical than the one with the stiff axle. The opposite is observed for the experimentally investigated axle with the four phenyl stoppers. Furthermore, we considered an implicit continuum solvation model and found that the complex binding is weakened by approximately 10 kcal/mol, and hydrogen bonds are slightly shortened (by up to 0. 2 Å) ...|$|R

5000|$|Flexible polyhedra are a {{class of}} polyhedra that can undergo a {{continuous}} motion that preserves the shape of their faces. By Cauchy's rigidity theorem, they must be non-convex, and it is known (the [...] "bellows theorem") that {{the volume of the}} polyhedron must stay constant throughout this motion. A stronger version of this theorem is conjectured, stating that the Dehn invariant of such a polyhedron must also remain invariant throughout any continuous motion. This conjecture is called the [...] "strong bellows conjecture". It is known to be true for the first known flexible polyhedra, the (self-intersecting) Bricard octahedra, and for a non-self-intersecting flexible polyhedron derived from them, Steffen's polyhedron.For more complicated polyhedra with self-intersections the [...] "strong bellows conjecture" [...] is known to be false.

The routine application of these techniques is hindered by the complicated and slow access to synchrotron radiation facilities. Here we propose a new, economic, easily operated laboratory high resolution von Hámos type X-ray spectrometer, which offers rapid transmission experiments for X-ray absorption, and is also capable of recording X-ray emission spectra. The use of a cylindrical analyzer crystal and a position sensitive detector enabled us to build a maintenance <b>free,</b> <b>flexible</b> setup with low operational costs, while delivering synchrotron grade signal to noise measurements in reasonable acquisition times. We demonstrate the proof of principle and give examples for both measurement types.

This paper presents a methodology for calculating the flight dynamic characteristics and gust response of <b>free</b> <b>flexible</b> aircraft. A multidisciplinary coupled numerical tool is developed to simulate detailed aircraft models undergoing arbitrary free flight motion in the time domain, by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Computational Structure Dynamics (CSD) and Computational Flight Mechanics (CFM) coupling. To achieve this objective, a structured, time-accurate flow-solver is coupled with a computational module solving the flight mechanics equations of motion and a structural mechanics code determining the structural deformations. A novel method to determine the trim state of flexible aircraft is also stated. First, the field velocity approach is validated, after the trim state is attained, gust responses for the one-minus-cosine gust profile are analyzed for the longitudinal motion of a slender-wing aircraft configuration with and without the consideration of structural deformation...|$|R

Molecular dynamics simulations of CO 2 molecules in rigid framework ZIF- 11, have then been performed using original AMBER parameters (SIM I) and refined parameters (SIM II), respectively.

40|$|The {{music of}} Benjamin Britten is both inspiring and intriguing: inspiring, because his music {{can move the}} listener; intriguing, because his use of triadic harmonies and rhythmic {{settings}} seems at once <b>free,</b> <b>flexible,</b> and spontaneous yet sensible and appropriate in representing {{the mood of the}} text. Although many of Britten’s harmonies are traditional in nature, e. g. major and minor triads, it is difficult, almost impossible or cumbersome at best, to assign Roman numerals to his harmonies because his manner of chord progression does not always conform to functional theory. In my analyses, I will demonstrate that the logic behind Britten's harmonic progressions can be explained through two types of neo-Riemannian transformation theories, namely Richard Cohn's Four Hexatonic Systems and Leonhard Euler's Tonnetz. In the case of the "Spinning Scene" from The Rape of Lucretia, Hindemith’s "Table of Chord-Groups" will be used to explain the presence of harmonies that {{are not part of the}} four hexatonic systems. Throughout, Schenkerian graphs will be presented to illustrate how the underlying structure and overall harmonic design of each piece work in conjunction with the emotion of the text.
