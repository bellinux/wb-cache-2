2500|$|In 1960, Schell {{returned}} to Germany {{and played the}} title role in William Shakespeare's Hamlet for German TV, a role that he would play on two more occasions in live theatre productions during his career. Along with Laurence Olivier, Schell is considered [...] "one of the greatest Hamlets ever," [...] according to some. Schell recalled that when he played Hamlet for the first time, [...] "it was like {{falling in love with}} a woman.... not until I acted the part of Hamlet did I have a moment when I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love with acting." [...] Schell's performance of Hamlet was featured as one of the last episodes of the American comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1999.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Russ," [...] said Miss Sampson and {{she gazed}} searchingly at me. I had {{dropped off the}} fence, sombrero in hand. I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> for a lecture, and I put on a brazen, {{innocent}} air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Except yourself, Una, {{no human}} soul on earth ever seemed to suspect me. And that wasn't odd; {{for you and}} your father, and perhaps Minnie Moore, were the only {{people in the world who}} ever <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love with you or cared for you in any way." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. [With {{a sudden}} change of tone.] Why not? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure of your love. And God <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love with you.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{am sorry}} for that, Mr. Drood.’ Neville apologises, {{with a real}} {{intention}} to apologise; ‘if <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the artist’s presence—’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, speak! speak!" [...] said Leo, [...] "for <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> sore suspense. <b>I</b> also <b>am</b> {{bewildered by}} {{memories}} and rent with hopes and fears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fi donc, Madame! Yet I must {{own that}} with her timid uneasy way, and his so perfect courtesy, they did alarm {{me a little}} at first. I pitied them, for I saw them so {{resolved}} not to let me feel myself de trop, that I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> their way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had fever, you know, but {{the thing}} was remarkably real. It was like lantern {{pictures}} melting on the screen. Background and figures were accurate and lifelike. In the last scene, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Columbine's cabin and can hardly persuade myself I was quite asleep. The tide splashed about the boat; I could smell the mud." ...|$|E
6000|$|The two dances were {{scarcely}} concluded before Catherine {{found her}} arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella, who in great spirits exclaimed, [...] "At last I have got you. My dearest creature, I {{have been looking}} for you this hour. What could induce you to come into this set, when you <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the other? I have been quite wretched without you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's jest who it was, an' Reddy Jackson {{come with}} him. Course they didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> here, an' <b>I</b> lay low and I heard every word they said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, my dear young friend! If {{you only}} <b>knew!</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> despair! You {{have such a}} {{beautiful}} figure. You would give me such pleasure if I might but finish this lovely gown." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't like to, {{not after}} what happened, and I didn't {{want you to}} <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> difficulties. <b>I</b> shouldn't have <b>been</b> {{surprised}} if you'd just told me I'd only got what I deserved." ...|$|R
60|$|RANKIN. Excuse my delay, Captain Kearney. The leddy sent me on an errand. (Kearney grunts.) I thought I {{should be}} late. But {{the first thing}} I heard when I arrived was your officer giving your {{compliments}} to Leddy Ceecily, and would she kindly allow the prisoners to come in, as you were anxious to see her again. Then I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> time.|$|E
60|$|We held {{on through}} the maze, past trench-sweepers of a handy light pattern, with their screw-tailed charge all ready; and a grave or so; and when I came on men who merely stood within easy reach of their rifles, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the second line. When they lay frankly at ease in their dug-outs, I {{knew it was the}} third. A shot-gun would have {{sprinkled}} all three.|$|E
6000|$|I threw {{one look}} to either hand, [...] And <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Fairyland. [...] And yet {{one point of}} being so [...] I lacked. For, Lady (as you know), [...] Whoever by his might of hand [...] Won {{entrance}} into Fairyland, [...] Found always with admiring eyes [...] A Fairy princess kind and wise. [...] It was not long I waited; soon [...] Upon my threshold, in broad noon, [...] Gracious and helpful, wise and good, [...] The Fairy Princess Moë stood.[1] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope we're friends, Cat?" [...] said he. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> liquor last night, {{and sadly}} {{put out by}} the loss of that fifty pound. They'll ruin me, dear--I know they will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very possibly," [...] Newman rejoined. [...] "But {{she will}} not <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> that convent {{yesterday}} and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what SHE <b>is</b> doing. Lord deliver us! You can guess whether {{it made me feel}} forgiving!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' cried Tom, 'now do you <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> capital spirits today, and {{scarcely}} {{ever felt}} more disposed {{to be good}} company. It was a very kind thing in your predecessor, John, to write to me, was it not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If this man's an impostor," [...] Charles went on--"and {{in spite}} of what he says about the National Gallery and so forth, we know nothing of him--the story he tells is just the sort of one such a fellow would trump up in a moment to deceive me. He could easily learn who I was--I'm a {{well-known}} figure; he <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Brighton, and he may have been sitting on that glass seat on Sunday on purpose to entrap me." ...|$|E
6000|$|I threw {{one look}} to either hand, [...] And <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Fairyland. [...] And yet {{one point of}} being so [...] I lacked.

[...] It was not long I waited; soon [...] Upon my threshold, in broad noon, [...] Gracious and helpful, wise and good, [...] The Fairy Princess Moë stood. {44} ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Very likely not. It {{has been}} kept very quiet, {{for the capital}} was all privately subscribed, and it's too good a thing to let the public into. My brother, Harry Pinner, is promoter, and joins the board after {{allotment}} as managing director. He <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the swim down here, {{and asked me to}} pick up a good man cheap. A young, pushing man with plenty of snap about him. Parker spoke of you, and that brought me here to-night. We can only offer you a beggarly five hundred to start with.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, you <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> {{a regular}} tight place. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> {{how to put}} it. You see, I can't help {{thinking}} that--that--I have rather committed myself--it seems a beastly conceited thing to say--that there's a girl who likes me, I'm afraid.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, they can. Because I {{remember}} my father {{talking about some}} stuff like that to my mother when he didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the room. He was talking about visitors who could talk with the mind. Telepathery or something. <b>I</b> thought he <b>was</b> making it up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Brother,' {{repeated}} Tom, slightly {{raising his}} voice. 'And {{if you will}} say, in the first instance, a gentleman, and then say her brother, <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> obliged to you, as she does not expect me or <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> London, and <b>I</b> {{do not wish to}} startle her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{dying man}} feebly waved a deprecation with his maimed hand, and even smiled faintly. [...] "I knew you'd say that. I knew what you'd think about it, but it's {{all the same}} now. I did it for you and Safie! I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the way; I knew you was the man she orter had; I knew you {{was the man who}} had dragged her outer the mire and clay where I was leavin' her, as you did when she fell in the water. I knew that every day I lived I was makin' YOU suffer and breakin' HER heart--for all she tried to be gentle and gay." ...|$|E
60|$|And running {{there under}} the trees, I fell and lost consciousness. What {{happened}} afterward, with one glimmering exception, I {{had to be}} told. Nelson, with his enormous strength, picked me up and dragged me on and aboard the train. When he had got me into a seat, I fought and panted so terribly for air that even with his obtuseness he <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a bad way. And right there, at any moment, I know now, I might have died. I often {{think it is the}} nearest to death I have ever been. I have only Nelson's description of my behaviour to go by.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "it {{might be}} better, {{and it might}} be worse. This Captain Trent is a remarkably honest fellow--one out of a thousand. As soon as he <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the market, he owned up about the rice in so many words. By his calculation, if there's thirty mats of it saved, it's an outside figure. However, the {{manifest}} was cheerier. There's about five thousand dollars of the whole value in silks and teas and nut-oils and that, all in the lazarette, and as safe as if it was in Kearney Street. The brig was new coppered a year ago. There's upwards of a hundred and fifty fathom away-up chain. It's not a bonanza, but there's boodle in it; and we'll try it on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{fond of the}} article," [...] {{said the}} Lieutenant; [...] "it's a fine cold relish to bacon or ham. You <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand last cruise, Cuticle, and got into sad {{dissipation}} there among the cannibals; come, let's have a bit, if it's only a mouthful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said I {{loved and}} wanted you." [...] The {{brutality}} {{of his first}} astonishment was evaporating. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>in</b> love with you. You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> love with you. And then you go--and half throttle me.... I believe you've crushed a gland or something. It feels like it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{laughed at}} the recollection, though Heaven <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> no {{laughing}} mood. I had found him {{with an array of}} pastry spread out before him, sufficient to make him ill for a week, and I had boxed his ears, and had thrown the whole collection into the road.|$|R
60|$|History {{had been}} {{thrust into the}} background. I was never more aware of this than when, shortly after dawn Wednesday, the massive grey pile of the Palace of Versailles {{suddenly}} rose before me. As the motor shot through the empty Place d'Armes I made {{a desperate attempt to}} summon again a vivid impression, when I had first stood there many years ago, of an angry Paris mob beating against that grill, of the Swiss guards dying on the stairway for their Queen. But it was no use. France has undergone some subtle change, yet I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> France. I knew it when we left Paris and sped through the dim leafy tunnels of the Bois; when I beheld a touch of filtered sunlight on the dense blue thatch of the 'marroniers' behind the walls of a vast estate once dedicated to the sports and pleasures of Kings; when I caught glimpses of silent chateaux mirrored in still waters.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a nice}} kettle of fish, Malcolm, {{about young}} Leslie. I have had the justices down here, asking me all sorts of questions, and they have got into their minds that I taught him not only swordplay but treason, {{and they have been}} {{threatening}} to put me in the stocks as a vagabond; but I snapped my fingers in their faces, saying I earned my money as honestly as they did, and that I concern myself in no way in politics, but teach English officers and the sons of Glasgow tradesmen {{as well as those of}} Highland gentlemen. They were nicely put out, I can tell you; but I didn't care for that, for I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the right of it. But what on earth made the young cock meddle in this matter? How came he to be mixed up in a Jacobite plot? Have you got your finger in it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{recollection}} of {{about three days}} and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a small room and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from {{it would have been}} almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed me. I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside-- ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{about the}} same time the Lizard entered Feinheimer's. In {{the far corner of the}} room Murray was seated at a table. The Lizard {{approached}} and sat down opposite him. [...] "Here I am," [...] he said. [...] "What do you want, and how did you <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> town?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I do {{will depend}} {{a good deal}} on what you do," [...] was the {{somewhat}} low answer. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> your power. But I'd like you to remember one thing--about how I warned you not to drink the drugged water and how I brought you some good water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will act, Richard, if {{you allow}} me," [...] he said. [...] "I would have you <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> no wise hostile to you, my Lord, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> of the King's party. But I admire Mr. Carvel, and I may say <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not wholly out of sympathy with that which {{prompted}} his act." ...|$|R
