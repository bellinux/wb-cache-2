50|$|Kleinschmidt {{began working}} with nascent {{communications}} technology in 1893 while still in his teens. He first patented a Morse keyboard transmitter, in 1895 (Patent No. 964,372; filed February 7, 1895; issued January 11, 1910) and later a Morse <b>keyboard</b> <b>perforator.</b> Keyboard perforators were a development from Charles Wheatstone's perforator of 1858 http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/1859-Wheatstone/, a hand-operated device which produced a punched paper tape for use in automatic telegraph transmitters.|$|E
50|$|An early {{successful}} teleprinter {{was invented}} by Frederick G. Creed. In Glasgow he created his first <b>keyboard</b> <b>perforator,</b> which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was {{the origin of the}} Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.|$|E
50|$|In 1901, Baudot's {{code was}} {{modified}} by Donald Murray (1865-1945), prompted by his {{development of a}} typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a <b>keyboard</b> <b>perforator,</b> which allowed an operator to punch a paper tape, and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At {{the receiving end of}} the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message. As there was no longer a connection between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most frequently used characters.|$|E
50|$|Working in the company’s {{office in}} Iquique, Chile, he became tired of using {{hand-operated}} Morse keys and Wheatstone tape punches, {{and came up}} with the idea of a typewriter-style machine that would allow the operator to punch Morse code signals onto paper tape simply by pressing the appropriate character key. Creed quit his job and moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where he began work in an old shed. Using an old typewriter bought from the Sauchiehall Street market, he created his first <b>keyboard</b> <b>perforator,</b> which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals onto paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 Creed & Company, {{founded by}} Frederick G. Creed, entered the {{teleprinter}} field with their Model 1P, a page printer, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code. The Model 3 tape printer, Creed’s first combined start-stop machine, {{was introduced in}} 1927 for the Post office telegram service. This machine printed received messages directly on to gummed paper tape {{at a rate of}} 65 words per minute. Creed created his first <b>keyboard</b> <b>perforator,</b> which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland Telex service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.|$|E

The Murray code also introduced what became known as [...] "format effectors" [...] or [...] "control characters" [...] - the CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.|$|E
