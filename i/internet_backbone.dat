25|$|Ebbers {{began his}} {{business}} career operating {{a chain of}} motels in Mississippi. He joined with several other people in 1983 as investors in the newly formed Long Distance Discount Services, Inc. (LDDS). Two years later he was named {{chief executive of the}} corporation. The company acquired over 60 other independent telecommunications firms, changing its name to WorldCom in 1995. In 1996, WorldCom acquired MFS Communications, Inc., which itself had recently acquired UUNet and its <b>Internet</b> <b>backbone.</b> At the time, this $12 billion transaction was one of the largest corporate acquisitions in U.S. history, although it would soon be eclipsed by much larger deals, including WorldCom's proposed $40 billion acquisition of MCI.|$|E
25|$|Public {{commercial}} {{use of the}} Internet began in mid-1989 with the connection of MCI Mail and Compuserve's email capabilities to the 500,000 users of the Internet. Just months later on 1 January 1990, PSInet launched an alternate <b>Internet</b> <b>backbone</b> for {{commercial use}}; one of the networks that would grow into the commercial Internet we know today. In March 1990, the first high-speed T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed between Cornell University and CERN, allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites. Six months later Tim Berners-Lee would begin writing WorldWideWeb, the first web browser {{after two years of}} lobbying CERN management. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 0.9, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first Web browser (which was also a HTML editor and could access Usenet newsgroups and FTP files), the first HTTP server software (later known as CERN httpd), the first web server, and the first Web pages that described the project itself. In 1991 the Commercial Internet eXchange was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other commercial networks CERFnet and Alternet. Since 1995 the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by email, instant messaging, telephony (Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP), two-way interactive video calls, and the World Wide Web with its discussion forums, blogs, social networking, and online shopping sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more.|$|E

2500|$|DWDM {{systems have}} to {{maintain}} more stable wavelength or frequency than those needed for CWDM because of the closer spacing of the wavelengths. Precision temperature control of laser transmitter is required in DWDM systems to prevent [...] "drift" [...] off a very narrow frequency window {{of the order of}} a few GHz. In addition, since DWDM provides greater maximum capacity it tends to be used at a higher level in the communications hierarchy than CWDM, for example on the <b>Internet</b> <b>backbone</b> and is therefore associated with higher modulation rates, thus creating a smaller market for DWDM devices with very high performance. These factors of smaller volume and higher performance result in DWDM systems typically being more expensive than CWDM.|$|E
2500|$|Virginia {{served as}} a major center for {{information}} technology during {{the early days of}} the Internet and network communication. Internet and other communications companies clustered in the Dulles Corridor. By 1993, the Washington area had the largest amount of <b>Internet</b> <b>backbone</b> and the highest concentration of Internet service providers. In 2000, more than half of all Internet traffic flowed along the Dulles Toll Road, and by 2016 70% of the world's internet traffic flowed through Loudoun County. Bill von Meister founded two Virginia companies that played major roles in the commercialization of the Internet: McLean, Virginia based The Source and Control Video Corporation, forerunner of America Online. While short-lived, The Source was one of the first online service providers alongside CompuServe. On hand for the launch of The Source, Isaac Asimov remarked [...] "This is the beginning of the information age." [...] The Source helped pave the way for future online service providers including another Virginia company founded by von Meister, America Online (AOL). AOL became the largest provider of Internet access during the Dial-up era of Internet access. AOL maintained a Virginia headquarters until the then-struggling company moved in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recent studies {{reveal that}} <b>Internet</b> <b>backbones</b> {{are capable of}} {{providing}} very low loss rates and end-to-end delays close to {{the speed of light}} (in optical fiber). However link failures may lead to packet losses, delay variations and outages due to missing or inconsistent forwarding information in routers. Link failures occur everyday, and may ultimately affect the quality of service experienced by an ISP’s customers. On the other hand, not all link failures impact customer service. Therefore we advocate the need for a new metric to characterize IP service availability in the presence of link failures.
