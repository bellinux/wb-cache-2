The plant closed in 1992, but there were problems with phenolic oils leaching from the original storage lagoons into the river for some years after closure. Discharges from the Coalite plant reached the river through its tributary, the River Doe Lea. Again, there were significant improvements to the treatment of effluent in 1984, 1989 and 1996. Brookhouse was the smallest of the four works, but closed in the early 1980s before remedial works were implemented. The coking plants were the worst polluters of the river, and their closure resulted in water quality being significantly improved.|$|E

50|$|In open countryside, heavy {{rainfall}} soaks {{into the ground}} and is released relatively slowly into watercourses (ditches, streams, rivers). In an urban area, the extent of hard surfaces (roofs, roads) means that the rainfall is dumped immediately into the drainage system. If left unchecked, this will cause widespread flooding downstream. The function of a balancing lake is to contain this surge and release it slowly. Failure to do this, especially in older settlements without separate storm and <b>foul</b> <b>sewers,</b> can cause serious pollution as well as flooding.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} 50 {{years of the}} 19th century the {{population}} of London more than doubled from 1 million to 2.3 million. Overcrowded graveyards also led to decaying matter getting into the water supply and causing epidemics. There were incidents of graves being dug on unmarked plots that already contained bodies, and of bodies being defiled by sewer rats infiltrating the churchyards' drains from the relatively central Tyburn, Fleet, Effra and Westbourne rivers which were used as <b>foul</b> <b>sewers</b> by this date and later wholly discharged into London's outfall sewers.|$|R

50|$|Willen Lake {{is one of}} {{the largest}} (400,000 m²) {{purpose-built}} stormwater balancing lakes in the UK. The lake is designed to take surface run-off from Milton Keynes, the largest of a number designed to do so. The lake has capacity for an additional level increase of 1.3 metres, equivalent to a once in 200 years event. Unlike most of the rest of the UK, the city has separate storm and <b>foul</b> <b>sewers,</b> so sewage pollution is not a significant problem. Additionally, there are facilities to prevent accidental oil spills and the like from reaching the lake. As well as local storm drains, the lake's primary purpose is to intercept the river Ouzel, a tributary of the river Great Ouse. The catchment area is Oxford Clay that tends to get saturated easily, so field run-off has always been a problem.|$|R
40|$|Collecting and {{disposing}} of rainwater is expensive and can {{give rise to}} significant adverse effects when it goes wrong. Separate surface water and <b>foul</b> <b>sewers</b> may cause pollution through the contamination of surface water, either with foul sewage or from diffuse sources such as run-off from roads and agricultural land. Equally, the foul sewage may become mixed with clean water, causing hydraulic overloading. On the other hand, combined systems require large-diameter pipes, and combined sewer overflows are often needed. The higher flows also necessitate larger tanks and pipework in the wastewater treatment works, {{as well as more}} pumping, adding to costs. The collection of water into pipes removes it from the river system, potentially adding to the problem of low river flows. And when rain does occur, the run-off is discharged rapidly into receiving streams, which become flashy and prone to flooding. Flooding of land and property, especially by sewage, is perceived by the public {{as one of the most}} unpleasant consequences of inadequate infrastructure, and may lead to an embargo by planning authorities on development, perhaps causing a restriction in desired economic activity. An added future complication is the likely effect of climate change...|$|R
2500|$|The medieval {{core and}} plan of Paris changed little during the {{restoration}} of the monarchy through the reign of King Louis-Philippe (1830–1848).

In 1833, the new prefect of the Seine under Louis-Philippe, Claude-Philibert Barthelot, comte de Rambuteau, made modest improvements to the sanitation and circulation of the city. [...] He constructed new sewers, though they still emptied directly into the Seine, and a better water supply system. He constructed 180 kilometres of sidewalks, a new street, rue Lobau; a new bridge over the Seine, the pont Louis-Philippe; and cleared an open space around the Hôtel de Ville. He built a new street the length of the Île de la Cité and three additional streets across it: rue d'Arcole, rue de la Cité and rue Constantine. [...] To access the central market at Les Halles, he built a wide new street (today's rue Rambuteau), and began work on the Boulevard Malesherbes. On the Left Bank, he built a new street, rue Soufflot, which cleared space around the Panthéon, and began work on the rue des Écoles, between the École Polytechnique and the Collège de France.|$|R

50|$|Despite the re-direction {{of sewage}} into brick lined {{channels}} and pipes in the 19th century, the beck remains polluted still. This {{is because of}} the numerous Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) points and other misconnected <b>foul</b> and drainage <b>sewers.</b> The beck is still unsuited to hosting wildlife, but after the Friends of Bradford's Becks set up a regeneration and cleaning programme for the beck in 2013, the waters are cleaner than they have been for a long time. The issue with the lack of wildlife now is that as the beck was culverted, it runs very fast through concrete and stone channels and as such the water flow is too fast to sustain much of the wildlife that would normally inhabit a beck of this size. The Friends of Bradford's Becks are wanting to rectify this by remodelling some of the lower reaches of the beck where it is exposed to daylight and slowing the water flow down by adding in bends.|$|R
40|$|Backwashing using {{ozonated water}} was {{investigated}} to control <b>fouling</b> during direct <b>sewer</b> mining using a ceramic microfiltration (MF) membrane. Primarily treated municipal wastewater was filtered and backwashing was performed using RO filtered tap water in this study. Direct MF filtration in the dead-end filtration mode using the ceramic MF membrane resulted in fouling {{that could not}} be fully removed by conventional backwashing. A steady increase in transmembrane pressure (TMP) was observed after each filtration cycle and could be attributed mostly to cake formation. In contrast, backwashing using ozonated water for 2. 5 min was effective at removing the fouling cake layer; thus, resulting in a stable TMP value after multiple filtration cycles. The effectiveness of ozonated water backwashing could be enhanced by extending the backwashing time. Indeed, the permeability of a heavily fouled membrane was fully restored after 3. 5 min of ozonated water backwashing. Results reported here suggest that backwashing using ozonated water has the ability to remove most foulants deposited on the membrane surface and can be used for sewer mining, where severe cake formation occurs...|$|R

40|$|A major {{drawback}} {{of separate}} sewer systems is {{the occurrence of}} illicit connections: unintended sewer cross-connections that connect foul water outlets from residential or industrial premises to the storm water system and/or storm water outlets to the <b>foul</b> <b>sewer</b> system.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study carried out by the British Geological Survey (BGS) on behalf of the Environment Agency NW to investigate the underlying geology beneath Knowsley Industrial Park, Merseyside, NW England. The overarching aim of the project was to establish a 3 D geoscience framework beneath the Knowsley Industrial Park to enable the Environment Agency (the Agency) to assess the vulnerability of the underlying Sherwood Sandstone aquifer. The vulnerability of the aquifer to pollution from current and historic contamination of land, potentially leaking <b>foul</b> <b>sewers</b> and contaminated surface water drains could then be assessed by reference to the underlying geology. In addition to the 3 D geological model, United Utilities pipeline data for foul and surface water drainage was provided by the Agency. This pipeline information was analysed and integrated with the geological data to provide an assessment of the potential linkage between the pipes and the underling bedrock or superficial geology in which they are sited. Over 300 additional paper borehole records were provided by the Agency from previous environmental site investigations carried out in the industrial park and incorporated into the BGS databases. In total, 1279 coded boreholes were used in the study. Of these, 733 were used to construct 58 geological cross-sections. The 3 D geological model revealed a sequence of superficial deposits across the site comprising glacial, post-glacial and artificial deposits overlying the Sherwood Sandstone Group, that in places are deeply weathered to form loose sand. In the south-east and north-west of the site, rocks belonging to the Sherwood Sandstone Group crop out at surface. The vulnerability of the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer beneath the site, to pollution from contaminated water, depends in part on the distribution and thickness of weakly permeable superficial deposits such as clay or silt. The geological model has revealed that till is the only clay dominated unit present beneath the site and for this reason, invert levels of foul and surface water pipes were compared to this geological deposit as it may influence the potential vulnerability of the underlying aquifer. Invert levels represent the elevation of the base of the pipe. 4722 pipeline segments were analysed and classified according to their minimum invert level (representing the maximum depth below ground level) recorded for each segment. This information was used to identify pipeline segments that occurred above, below or within till. Pipeline segments interpreted to lie within or above the till were subdivided according to whether they were underlain by greater or less than 2. 5 m of till. 2. 5 m represents the average thickness of till calculated from the 3 D geological model. Pipeline segments whose invert level occurs beneath the till will lie directly within the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer or sand and gravel dominated superficial deposits and therefore the relative hazard potential may be higher than those where clay dominated superficial deposits occur between them and the underlying aquifer. In general, the results indicate that the northern part of Knowsley Industrial Park and the northwestern part of the wider project area are underlain by greater than 2. 5 m of till and that pipelines lie above the top surface of the till or within it. In contrast, the southern part of Knowsley Industrial Park and the south-western part of the wider project area are underlain generally by less than 2. 5 m of till and pipeline segments occur below the till or directly within the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer. This information {{can be used as a}} preliminary screening or prioritisation tool. It can identify potential areas where the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer is most vulnerable to pollution from contaminated groundwater from poor condition, potentially leaking sewers and drains in the subsurface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The current {{strategy}} of the pest management department of the Public Health Service in Amsterdam is to identify causal factors {{in order to reduce}} the carrying capacity of pest populations and to minimise the use of pesticides. Rats have been controlled with rodenticides for decades, which has increased the survival of resistant rats. Rodenticide resistance has now been found in several rat populations in Europe. The main aim of this study was to establish the relationship between brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) occurrence in Amsterdam and a number of environmental and socio-economic factors. A second aim was to point out factors that can be managed by the local authorities as a next step towards prevention and pro-active, integrated pest management. The paper begins with a short overview of the biology of the brown rat, with an accent on diseases and habitat factors. The number of rat reports at the neighbourhood level during the years 2009 - 2012 is then related to 16 environmental and socioeconomic variables including availability of water, availability of urban green space, sewer type, construction year of houses, property tax value, number of inhabitants and population composition. A generalised linear model was used; it had a negative binomial distribution and all candidate models were fitted with a maximum of five terms. The most significant terms were number of inhabitants, percentage of area occupied by urban green space, the percentage of houses with a construction year before 1960, and either the length of <b>foul</b> water <b>sewer</b> (separated sewer) or the length of combined sewer. Rats have a short generation time and can produce a large number of offspring. A rat population is therefore able to recover quickly from a reduction in number. It is therefore important to change the carrying capacity of the habitat in which rats are unwanted. This can be achieved by changing the amount of food and cover they can find. The results of the regression analysis suggest that houses constructed before 1960 and their gardens could be evaluated to see if there may be general solutions that would make them less amenable to rats. Furthermore, the results suggest that the structure of urban green space may be adapted to make it less attractive to rats; an example of this would be to replace evergreen shrubs with deciduous shrubs and to mow high vegetation near buildings more frequently. Moreover, the influence of waste near and in urban green space should be investigated. Finally, we suggest that the inspection and maintenance of sewers be continued and that this should include the connection between properties and the public sewer...|$|R
40|$|Total {{water cycle}} {{management}} (TWCM) discussion mostly limits {{the role of}} residential rainwater harvesting to providing an alternate water supply to a fraction of fit-for-purpose end uses. However, with operational improvements, greater outcomes can be achieved. By increasing the portion of roof area connected and developing adaptive rainwater diversion (ARD), reliable stormwater management outcomes can also be achieved. ARD controls tank drawdown by adapting to changes in dwelling consumption and rainfall, thus allowing the available storage to mimic the pre-urbanised catchment storage recovery. The ARD approach has the basis that mains water savings can be achieved in two ways: 1) Rainwater supply - where the rainwater harvest is used directly to reduce mains consumption of that dwelling; and 2) Rainwater diversion - where rainwater is diverted from the dwelling. This does not directly reduce mains consumption of the dwelling but produces a water resource {{that is used by}} others to reduce mains consumption. In this way, total rainwater yield and mains water savings is the sum of rainwater supply and diversion. This research investigates rainwater supply, rainwater diversion, runoff volume and runoff flow frequency for South East Queensland. Results show, the average sized detached dwelling when fitted with a 5 kL tank and ARD system is compliant with the mandated water saving targets and the Queensland Best Practices Environmental Management Guidelines for stormwater flow frequency management. It is recommended that rainwater is diverted into the existing stormwater system where reuse facilities exist. Otherwise, discharging into the sewer, has the potential to reduce <b>sewer</b> <b>fouling</b> and increase the substitution of mains supply with treated effluent. This improves sewerage reticulation by adding a secondary purpose and, by using existing infrastructure, removes many barriers for retrofitting TWCM and water sensitive urban design (WSUD). Also, as ARD brings adaptive and multifunctional infrastructure into our urban design, we begin to develop water sensitive cities. The outcomes of this research are most promising to established and future planned high density residential suburbia, where TWCM policy and WSUD is chiefly needed...|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} {{urban water}} systems (i. e. water distribution and sewer systems) {{it is imperative}} that uncertainty is taken into consideration. However, this is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainty associated with both system loading requirements and the potential for physical components failure. It is therefore desirable to improve the reliability of each system in order to account for these uncertainties. Although it is possible to directly evaluate the reliability of a water distribution systems (WDS) (using reliability measures), the calculation processes involved are computationally intensive and therefore unsuitable for some state-of-the-art, iterative design approaches (such as optimisation). Consequently, interest has recently grown in the use of reliability indicators, which are simpler and faster to evaluate than conventional direct reliability methods. In this thesis, a novel measure (the RUF) is developed to quantify reliability in urban water systems with a view to enhance their robustness under a range of future scenarios (Policy Reform, Market Forces, Fortress World and New-Sustainability Paradigm). The considered four future scenarios were synthesized in the EPSRC supported multidisciplinary 4 year project: Urban Futures. Each investigated urban future scenario is characterised by a distinct household water demand and local demand distribution (emerging due to different urban forms evolving in future scenarios). In order {{to assess the impact of}} urban futures, RUF has been incorporated into Urban Water System (UWS) dynamic simulations for both WDSs and <b>Foul</b> <b>Sewer</b> Systems (FSSs) using open source codes of EPANET and SWMM. Additionally, in order to overcome extensive computational effort, resulting from the use of traditional reliability measures, a new holistic reliability indicator, the hydraulic power entropy (IHPE) has been developed and compared to existing reliability indicators. Additionally, the relationship between the new reliability indicator and the above mentioned RUF reliability measure is investigated. Results suggest that the magnitude of the IHPE in network solutions provides a holistic indication of the hydraulic performance and reliability for a WDS. However, the performance of optimal solutions under some Urban Futures indicates that additional design interventions are required in order to achieve desired future operation. This thesis also proposes a new holistic <b>foul</b> <b>sewer</b> system (FSS) reliability indicator (the IFSR). The IFSR represents sewer performance as a function of excess pipe capacity (in terms of available increase and also decrease in inflow). The indicator has been tested for two case studies (i. e. different sewer network layouts). Results suggest that the magnitude of IFSR has positive correlations with a number of identified key performance indicators (i. e. relating to capacity, velocity, blockages). Finally, an Integrated Design Approach (IDA) has been developed in order to assess the implications of applying design interventions on both a WDS and downstream FSS. The approach holistically considers present and future operation of each interconnected system. The approach was subsequently demonstrated using two proposed design interventions. Results suggest that, for the considered design interventions, there is trade-off between the simultaneous improvement of both WDS and FSS operation and reliability...|$|E

40|$|This {{project reports}} {{results of a}} hydro-geochemical study of {{leachate}} production at the Silent Valley landfill, Blaenau Gwent, South Wales, UK. Silent Valley landfill site is an active unlined landfill in South Wales. It lies on interbedded sandstones and mudstones of the Rhondda Beds, which are overlain by a mixture of boulder clay, head deposits and made ground. The annual rainfall recorded in the area is approximately 1250 mm. Resistivity surveys were performed across part of the site to help improve {{the understanding of the}} internal structure of the landfill. Instrumentation to measure leachate discharge, conductivity and meteorological inputs installed at the Silent Valley landfill site are described and relationships between the rainfall and discharge data are analysed. Regression analysis is used to model the discharge of leachate from the measured meteorological data. Water balance analysis has demonstrated that groundwater is entering the site. The leachate generated on site is collected by a series of drains that feed into the Settlement Tank, which then discharges to <b>foul</b> <b>sewer.</b> The discharge through the Settlement Tank shows a rapid response to rainfall events with dilution effects indicated by conductivity readings and chemical analysis. The volume of discharge from the Settlement Tank is shown to have a long-term upward trend. A preliminary study was undertaken to investigate the use of neural networks to model the discharge in the Settlement Tank. Feedforward backpropogation neural networks were constructed using the measured meteorological data to produce predictions of daily discharge for the Settlement Tank. Ion Chromatography analysis was performed on the leachate to complement the historical leachate analysis data. Element concentration was correlated with conductivity data and variations related to discharge measurements. Since monitoring began in 1993, many of the leachate constituents have shown an increase in concentration. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Odour {{control systems}} in {{wastewater}} collection systems are typically designed to remove hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S); however other compounds in <b>sewer</b> related <b>foul</b> air {{also lead to}} odour complaints. Methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide are rarely investigated for performance in these treatment systems despite being key odorants. Volatile organic compounds readily occur and rarely contribute substantially to odour impact, but could affect the removal of other more odorous compounds. The most common odour control systems are biologically based (biofilters or biotrickling filters) or adsorption based (predominantly activated carbon). Samples on the inlet and outlet of 10 activated carbon systems, 5 biofilters and 3 biotrickling filters across Sydney, Melbourne and Perth in Australia were taken approximately every month for 18 months. Samples were analysed {{for a wide range}} of volatile organic and sulfurous compounds as well as H 2 S. The collected data were filtered for warm and non-warm periods, wet weather, and for those where data points were greater than three times the standard deviation over the average (known as ‘spikes’). Performance of treatment systems were analysed under these conditions. An analysis of the most common volatile organic and sulfurous compounds on the inlet samples found that there was no clear relationship between any compounds, meaning that when sampling <b>sewer</b> <b>foul</b> air, all key odorants needed to be tested. All treatment system types perform well at H 2 S removal. Activated carbon systems exhibited the poorest and most variable treatment of non-H 2 S based compounds, particularly halogenated volatile organics; however treatment of most compounds improved during spike conditions. Biofilters generally showed the most stable and greatest removal of non-H 2 S based compounds; however treatment deteriorated during spike conditions. In selecting an odour treatment technology, the concentration and variability of contaminants, treatment required and the space available, allow the most efficient technology selection to be made. Two stage processes are generally required for high level treatments whilst single stages are appropriate for lower treatments. Biofilters are generally preferred as the first (or only) stage, with biotrickling filters used where space is constrained. Activated carbon is suitable for low load scenarios or as a polishing filter...|$|R
40|$|These {{guidelines}} {{are intended to}} assist those in the construction and demolition industry with responsibility for managing {{the environmental impact of}} their activities.

Sites are considered according to individual circumstances and early consultation with your local Agency office is advisable. Contact details will be found at the end of these guidelines. 1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK a. The Agencies are responsible for both the protection of “controlled waters ” from pollution and for the prevention of pollution of the environment, harm to human health and detriment to local amenity by waste management activities under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. “Controlled waters ” include all watercourses, lakes, locks, coastal waters and water contained in underground strata (or “groundwater”) and it is an offence to pollute such waters, either deliberately or accidentally. In addition, the formal consent of the Agency is required for many discharges to controlled waters, including both direct discharges and discharges to soakaways. Such consents are granted subject to conditions and are not granted automatically. b.

40|$|This {{research}} {{identifies the}} contaminants found during {{a series of}} storm events impacting on the River Sherbourne culvert, and discusses the relationship {{between them and the}} increased flow measured The methodology was divided into 3 Phases; Phase 1 examined all of the watercourses in the River Sowe catchment, and identified the culverted streams and drainage system giving an indication of the presence of pollutant sources. Continuous monitors were deployed within the four identified drainage systems to pinpoint intermittent and illegal contaminated discharges, and these discharges were subsequently redirected to the <b>foul</b> <b>sewer</b> or stopped. Phase 2 examined the quality of the River Sherbourne culvert upstream and downstream of the city centre, and demonstrated (using continuous monitors and automated sampling), that six combined sewer overflows discharging to the watercourse upstream of the culvert were operating unsatisfactorily. The dissolved oxygen levels were significantly reduced during rainfall events (with a loss of diurnal variation), and total ammonium levels exceeded current water quality standards. The results were used to instigate a remediation scheme to replace the overflows with additional foul sewerage capacity, and a single high-level storm relief. Phase 3 examined the impact of urban runoff during rainfall events after the improvements made following Phases 1 and 2. The results suggest a marked improvement in the water quality, with little impact from organic pollutants. Dissolved oxygen concentrations remained high during many of the post-remedial rainfall events, and ammonia levels remained largely insignificant. The results indicated a fall in pH levels during the rainfall events and increases in all of the heavy metals analysed, though not beyond current water quality guidelines. The efficiency of using continuous monitoring in Coventry was assessed and likely sources of the contaminants in urban runoff were considered. The statistics of compliance with percentile standards do not allow for short-term pollution or storm events, which may kill all aquatic life whilst not breaching water quality standards. Using continuous monitors to identify intermittent and illegal discharges in underground drainage systems was an efficient and cost-effective method of reducing the impact of urban runoff in a failing watercourse. The methodology can be applied to other urban areas to identify unidentified illegal and intermittent point sources. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} no {{previous}} studies carried out {{on the impact of}} urban runoff in the Coventry City centre area. The culverted nature of the River Sherbourne, and many of its tributaries, makes the investigation of intermittent pollution and rainfall events expensive and impractical, when using traditional spot sample methods. Storm events have been monitored over a period of over 60 months upstream and downstream of the City, using continuous water quality monitors and auto-spot sample methods. The receiving waters of the River Avon had previously suffered annual fish mortalities as a result of summer storm events causing oxygen depletion. Previous studies (Clifforde and Williams 1997) on the impact of Coventry Sewage Treatment Works effluent on the watercourse, have suggested a major component of the intermittent pollutant load arising from the City (upstream of the Sewage Treatment Works), which requires evaluation and remediation. This research identifies the contaminants found during a series of storm events impacting on the River Sherbourne culvert, and discusses the relationship between them and the increased flow measured. The methodology was divided into 3 Phases; Phase 1 examined all of the watercourses in the River Sowe catchment, and identified the culverted streams and drainage system giving an indication of the presence of pollutant sources. Continuous monitors were deployed within the four identified drainage systems to pinpoint intermittent and illegal contaminated discharges, and these discharges were subsequently redirected to the <b>foul</b> <b>sewer</b> or stopped. Phase 2 examined the quality of the River Sherbourne culvert upstream and downstream of the city centre, and demonstrated (using continuous monitors and automated sampling), that six combined sewer overflows discharging to the watercourse upstream of the culvert were opening unsatisfactorily. The dissolved oxygen levels were significantly reduced during rainfall events (with a loss of diurnal variation), and total ammonium levels exceeded current water quality standards. The results were used to instigate a remediation scheme to replace the overflows with additional foul sewage capacity, and a single high-level storm relief.

Using continuous monitors to identify intermittent and illegal discharges in underground drainage systems was an efficient and cost-effective method of reducing the impact of urban runoff in a failing watercourse. The methodology can be applied to other urban areas to identify unidentified illegal and intermittent point sources. Routine monthly monitoring of an urban watercourse may not identify the peaks and troughs associated with rainfall events that may breach toxicological guidelines, and will not identify intermittent and unknown pollutant sources; particularly when discharging outside of normal working hours. This research was a unique and comprehensive investigation into the nature and composition of urban runoff in the City of Coventry, and local data gathered will be invaluable in promoting further research, improving local knowledge of the urban environment in preparation for the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC), and in planning for environmental improvements in the future...|$|E
40|$|Combined sewer {{overflows}} (CSOs) {{are a part}} of {{the combined}} storm water and <b>foul</b> <b>sewer</b> system. CSOs should protect the downstream sewer system against overloading during heavy rainfall and snow melting. This report investigates how three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be applied to evaluate the quality performance of combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Separation efficiency is a performance indicator defined as the fraction of sediments that are treated and not overflowing. Emissions from poorly constructed CSOs have a harmful impact on receiving water quality. Predicted increase in rainfall in the northern hemisphere due to climate change is enhancing stresses imposed on these structures. EU established the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in 2000 to ensure good ecological and chemical quality for receiving streams and lakes. To meet this standard, a reduction in emissions of pollutants is required through improvement of separation efficiency of CSOs. Numerical modelling creates new opportunities for detailed analyzes of existing and new structures as such tools where not available when the first CSOs where built. In this report, the assessment of a CSO with CFD is presented in the context of a geometry from &# 197;rhus. The CSO is one of the case studies in the EU project PREPARED Enabling Change, which aims to adapt Europe&# 146;s water supply and sanitation systems to climate change. It is a complex device with one inlet, four overflow chambers and two outlet pipes. Prior to the modelling, a literature review was carried out to identify the characteristics of combined sewage. The purpose was to determine what particles that should be modelled and find appropriate boundary conditions. The sewer quality showed large variations dependent on flow rate, locations inside the system and between different systems. The combined sewage consists of a mixture of organic and inorganic material and no unique relationship between density and particle size could therefore be found. A wide range of sediments with size 100 m - 5 mm and densities 1002 kg/m 3, 1170 kg/m 3, 1400 kg/m 3, 1720 kg/m 3, 2000 kg/m 3 and 2650 kg/m 3 were therefore selected to represent sewer sediments in the numerical model. At the bed of the CSO a criteria was needed to determine if a particle settled or was suspended in the fluid. A bed shear stress (BSS) boundary condition was found to be appropriate. The shear stress at the bed was compared to a critical value specified by the user. A study by Berg (1988) showed that the critical value for settling of particles in a combined sewer with sand traps was 1. 0 Pa. The numerical modelling was done with the commercial software FLUENT. Analyzes where carried out for two scenarios; (1) filling of the CSO with throughflow to the treatment plant, and (2) during overflow to receiving waters. Three velocities was used (0. 3 m/s, 0. 5 m/s and 0. 7 m/s) to test the influence of velocity on the separation efficiency. The paper demonstrates how the discrete phase model (DPM) can be utilized to predict particle trajectories and final destination of particles and how this can be used to calculate separation efficiency. The conclusion is that the particle tracking routine was found to be suitable for analyzes of sediment transport and separation efficiency. Overall the CSO in &# 197;rhus showed a good separation efficiency higher than 50 % for all velocities. The exception was sand particles with size 0. 1 mm and organic material withdensity 1170 kg/m 3 and diameters up to 0. 5 mm. The results showed that velocity had a strong influence on separation efficiency and flow streamlines on the distribution of particles on the different overflows. It was crucial to define appropriate boundary conditions as it has a significant effect on the result. Difference in separation efficiency for different types of particles was most significant during slow flow conditions. A references to previous work has shown that the particle tracking routine probably overestimates the separation efficiency for high velocities (Stovin & Saul, 1998). In future work the results from &# 197;rhus should be compared with measurements, to determine if this is the case for the &# 197;rhus results as well. CFD modelling in combination with modern measurement techniques provide great opportunities for optimization of CSOs. The intention is that this can serve as a pilot project for future research and work with adaption of CSOs under climate change. </p...|$|E
