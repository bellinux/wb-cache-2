40|$|Background: Bleomycin-induced lung {{fibrosis}} {{has been accepted}} as an animal model for fibrosis in rats. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of saffron aqueous extract on this disorder paving the way for more investigation in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in human. Methods: Male Wistar rats (250 – 300 gr) were instilled a single dose of bleomycin (5 mg/kg) via <b>intratracheal</b> <b>tube</b> (n= 6) in 2015. Sham group received normal saline. Saffron aqueous extract (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) were given orally in two different treated groups with bleomycin for 28 days. Lung Indices was calculated at the end of this experiment. Lung segments fixed in 10...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the severe}} damage caused by unyielding, low {{residual}} volume cuffs, various modifications to the cuff of an <b>intratracheal</b> <b>tube</b> have been introduced. The merits of two low-pressure cuffs were assessed in an experimental study in dogs; both cuffs produced little visible damage to the tracheal wall in dogs intubated continuously over a two-week period. A modified technique of producing tantalum tracheobronchograms without distrubing the mucous blanket or traumatizing the tracheal wall is described. These tantalum radiological studies demonstrated a progressive temporary increase in size of the trachea at cuff level over the period of intubation with these cuffs. The implications of such a progressive weakness occurring in the tracheal muscle are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the adverse}} health effects of nanoparticles/materials have been {{proposed}} and are being clarified, their facilitating effects on preexisting pathological conditions have not been fully established. We provide insights into the environmental immunotoxicity of nanoparticles as an aggravating factor in hypersusceptible subjects, especially those with respiratory disorders, using our in vivo models. We first {{examined the effects of}} nanoparticles/materials on lung inflammation induced by bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) as a test model against innate immunity, and demonstrated that nanoparticles instilled through both an <b>intratracheal</b> <b>tube</b> and an inhalation system can exacerbate lung inflammation. Secondly, we examined the effects of nanoparticles/materials on allergic pathophysiology, and showed that repetitive pulmonary exposure to nanoparticles has aggravating effects on allergic airway inflammation, including adjuvant effects on Th 2 -milieu. Taken together, nanoparticle exposure may synergistically facilitate pathological inflammatory conditions in the lung via both innate and adaptive immunological abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of 3497 Staphylococcus aureus strains according to methicillin resistance, specimens, departmental profession and antibiotic resistance patterns was analysed. The strains were cultured from the patients of the Clinical Center of Skopje, Macedonia, between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2004. The {{majority of the}} isolates was obtained from suppurated wounds (28. 5 %), nares (21 %), <b>intratracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> (13 %) and blood cultures (11. 8 %). Overall 1100 (31. 4 %) of the isolates was methicillin-resistant with 1 µg oxacillin disc. Of these 35. 5 %, 30. 5 % and 10. 4 % were cultured from wounds, <b>intratracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> and blood samples, respectively. The prevalence of MRSA strains was 78. 6 %, 75 %, 44. 2 % and 37. 3 % in specimens of ICU, Coma Center, General Surgery and Haematology patients. There were extremely big differences {{in the frequency of}} MRSA between departments with particular specialisation. The 2397 MSSA isolates belonged to practically one antibiotic resistance pattern characterised with penicillin resistance and susceptibility to other antistaphylococcal drugs. The 1100 MRSA isolates distributed to four antibiotic resistance patterns {{on the basis of their}} resistance to oxacillin, penicillin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, azithromycin, clindamycin, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim+sulphamethoxasole, vancomycin and teicoplanin. All the MRSA isolates were multidrug resistant but sensitive to glycopeptides...|$|R
40|$|Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant {{bacteria}} {{present a}} frequent threat to vulnerable patient populations in hospitals around the world. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are particularly susceptible to nosocomial infections due to indwelling {{devices such as}} intravascular catheters, drains, and <b>intratracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> for mechanical ventilation. The increased vulnerability of infected ICU patients demonstrates the importance of effective outbreak management protocols to be in place. Understanding the transmission of pathogens via genotyping methods is an important tool for outbreak management. Recently, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of pathogens has become more accessible and affordable {{as a tool for}} genotyping. Analysis of the entire pathogen genome via WGS could provide unprecedented resolution in discriminating even highly related lineages of bacteria and revolutionize outbreak analysis in hospitals. Nevertheless, clinicians have long been hesitant to implement WGS in outbreak analyses due to the expensive and cumbersome nature of early sequencing platforms. Recent improvements in sequencing technologies and analysis tools have rapidly increased the output and analysis speed as well as reduced the overall costs of WGS. In this review, we assess the feasibility of WGS technologies and bioinformatics analysis tools for nosocomial outbreak analyses and provide a comparison to conventional outbreak analysis workflows. Moreover, we review advantages and limitations of sequencing technologies and analysis tools and present a real-world example of the implementation of WGS for antimicrobial resistance analysis. We aimed to provide health care professionals with a guide to WGS outbreak analysis that highlights its benefits for hospitals and assists in the transition from conventional to WGS-based outbreak analysis...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{present study}} aimed to {{elucidate}} {{the safety and}} effectiveness of a noble and unique airway management technique in which a pediatric intubation tube is used in adult patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing catheter ablation (CA) under continuous deep sedation. Methods: In total, 246 consecutive patients with AF (mean age, 65 ± 10 years; 60 women) underwent CA under dexmedetomidine-based continuous deep sedation. A 4 -mm pediatric intubation tube guided by a 10 -French <b>intratracheal</b> suction <b>tube</b> was inserted smoothly, and {{the tip of the}} tube was located {{at the base of the}} epiglottis. The maximum shifting distance of the heart (MSDH) was measured with the 3 D mapping system (Ensite NavX system) before and after inserting the pediatric intubation tube. Results: At baseline, the MSDH of patients under continuous deep sedation was 23 ± 14  mm. The pediatric intubation tube reduced the MSDH to 13 ± 6  mm (mean reduction from baseline, 38. 4 ± 21. 7 %; P< 0. 0001). In contrast, oxygen saturation was significantly increased from 89 ± 8 % to 95 ± 3 % (P< 0. 0001). The mean distance between the nostril and base of the epiglottis was 16. 6 ± 0. 5  mm. Major periprocedural complications occurred in 9 (3. 6 %) patients including 3 (1. 2 %) cardiac tamponade and 6 (2. 4 %) phrenic nerve injury cases. Larger MSDH (odds ratio, 1. 13; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 04 – 1. 25; P= 0. 007) was a significant predictor of major periprocedural complications. No major airway complications occurred, except in 3 patients (1. 2 %) who had minor nasal bleeding. Conclusion: This unique airway management technique using a pediatric intubation tube for CA procedures performed in adult patients with AF under continuous deep sedation was easy, safe, and effective...|$|R
40|$|We report here {{a case of}} reexpansion {{pulmonary}} edema following laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) for early gastric cancer. A 57 -year-old Japanese woman with no preoperative comorbidity was diagnosed with early gastric cancer. The patient underwent LADG using the pneumoperitoneum method. During surgery, the patient was unintentionally subjected to single-lung ventilation for approximately 247 minutes due to <b>intratracheal</b> <b>tube</b> dislocation. One hour after surgery, she developed severe dyspnea and produced {{a large amount of}} pink frothy sputum. Chest radiography results showed diffuse ground-glass attenuation and alveolar consolidation in both lungs without cardiomegaly. A diagnosis of {{pulmonary edema}} was made, and the patient was immediately intubated and received ventilatory support with high positive end-expiratory pressure. The patient gradually recovered and was weaned from the ventilatory support on the third postoperative day. This case shows that single-lung ventilation may be a risk factor for reexpansion pulmonary edema during laparoscopic surgery with pneumoperitoneum...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the adverse}} health effects of {{nanoparticles}} have been proposed and are being clarified, their aggravating effects on pre-existing pathological conditions have not been fully investigated. In this review, we provide insights into the immunotoxicity of both airborne and engineered nanoparticles as an exacerbating factor on hypersusceptible subjects, especially those with immune-mediated pulmonary inflammation, using our in vivo experimental model. First, we exhibit the effects of nanoparticles on pulmonary inflammation induced by bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide: LPS) as a disease model in innate immunity, and demonstrate that nanoparticles instilled through both an <b>intratracheal</b> <b>tube</b> and an inhalation system can exacerbate the lung inflammation. Second, we introduce the effects of nanoparticles on allergic pulmonary inflammation as a disease model in adaptive immunity, and show that repetitive pulmonary exposure to nanoparticles has aggravating effects on allergic inflammation, including adjuvant effects on Th 2 -milieu. Third, we show that very small nanoparticle exposure exacerbates emphysematous pulmonary inflammation, which is concomitant with enhanced lung expression of proinflammatory molecules (including those that are innate immunity related). Taken together, nanoparticle exposure may synergistically facilitate pathological pulmonary inflammation via both innate and adaptive immunological impairment...|$|E
