40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the drilling}} fluids under high temperature {{is extremely important}} for drilling <b>deepwells.</b> Most commercial oil base drilling fluid systems have limitations such as reduced rheology andfiltration control if the fluid is exposed to higher temperature for prolonged periods of time. Formulating adrilling fluid system that can adequately withstand drilling in a high temperature environment is verychallenging but very often little attention is given to proper fluids design. In this research, a normal oilbased mud suitable for Nigerian formation was formulated and was aged under high temperatureconditions for 16 hours. The effect of aging on the properties of drilling fluids was studied. From thestudy, it is concluded that rheological changes in drilling fluids have many effects on the degree ofefficiency with which a fluid performs its primary functions {{and it is important}} that efforts are made tominimize these detrimental effects...|$|R
40|$|The city of Guwahati {{with a total}} {{municipal}} area of {{more than}} 313 sq. km, has witnessed a rapid growth in population particularly during the last one and half decades. The population jumped from 1, 23, 783 in 1971 to 5, 77, 791 in 1991 and as per census 2001, the figure stands at 8, 14, 575. As a result, there is tremendous pressure on the natural resources like groundwater. Although the mighty river Brahmaputra flows through the northern periphery of the city, water supply depends heavily on the dugwells and <b>deepwells.</b> However, {{it is found that}} due to the geological factors, aquifers with adequate yield are not well developed and are mostly laterally discontinuous. The problem of depleted groundwater table is acutely felt in the new growth centres like Beltola, Panjabari, Motoria etc. The high growth of built up areas and filling up of natural channel ways have adversely affected recharge of the ground water regime. In this backdrop, it is of vital importance to identify the groundwater potential zones of the city area taking into account the geological and anthropogenic factors. Geologically the city is characterised by mostly Precambrian granite gneisses...|$|R

40|$|The A 2 tunnel in Maastricht {{has been}} built within a dry {{building}} pit with a maximum depth of 22 meters with sheet pile walls, suspended in a cement bentonite trench supported by struts at 2 to 4 levels. Dewatering is done by <b>deepwells.</b> The excavation reaches into Limestone layers so the maximum mobilized passive resistance of the sheet pile wall is depending on the strength parameters of these layers. In the design stage of the project uncertainties occurred about both strength parameters and permeability of the Limestone for {{a large part of}} the project. These uncertainties could only partly be reduced by additional soil investigation and in-situ tests, but they were vital for the design of the retaining walls. To combine economical implementation of the project with a very favourable risk profile the “Observational Method” was adapted. This article deals with the background behind the variations in soil conditions and the residual uncertainties. The elaboration of the Observational Method is explained, including the measurement results and the decisional system during the construction. Finally the results of the adaption of this method in the project will be evaluated. In May 2014 the building pit was fully excavated, so final conclusions are drawn...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how metals originate in industrial wastewaters from the mining and metal finishing industries. Treatment of wastewaters containing dissolved metals produces a metallic hydroxide sludge {{which has to}} be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable way. It is estimated that the metal finishing industry annually disposes of 2, 500, 000 pounds and 49, 000, 000 pounds of non-ferrous metals in Canada and the United States respectively. These non-ferrous metals are either discharged to municipal sewers as untreated wastewater where they can interfere with the sewage treatment process and can also pose serious problems for sewage sludge disposal, or they can be disposed of as metallic hydroxide sludges in landfills, <b>deepwells,</b> or holding lagoons. The value of the metals contained in these sludges has long been recognized, and technology has been developed for their recovery. This recovery technology is based on well known chemical unit processes such as leaching, selective precipitation, ion exchange, and electrowinning. These processes are capable of recovering metals in a pure form, however, this technology {{does not appear to}} be economical at this time due to high energy costs, high chemical cost, and undue competition of this pure product from virgin metals. The paper describes a process whereby these non-ferrous metals can be recovered via microbial sulphate-reduction as metallic sulphides suitable as basemetal smelter feed. The bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans is capable of reducing sulphate sulphur to sulphide sulphur while simultaneously oxidizing organic carbon to carbon dioxide. The hydrogen sulphide thus produced reacts with metal hydroxide sludge leachate to produce a high grade metallic sulphide concentrate suitable for basemetal smelter feed. The process described utilizes three industrial waste streams, namely: metallic hydroxide sludge, waste sulphuric acid, and biodegradable waste organics, as feedstocks for the reaction. Bench scale experiments are described which produced concentrates containing in excess of 28 per cent copper and zinc as sulphides. The paper includes a flow sheet and process design for a pilot plant recovering 1000 pounds per year of non-ferrous metal as metallic sulphides...|$|R
