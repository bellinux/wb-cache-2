5|$|Louisville {{took over}} on offense needing {{to get a}} {{touchdown}} to regain a lead before the waning clock finally ran out of time. After the Tech kickoff and a touchback, the Cardinals took over at their 20-yard line. Michael Bush ran for 10yards and a first down, and Hunter Cantwell scrambled for six more on a rushing play. Facing third down and needing four yards, Cantwell dropped back to pass for the first down. As the pass soared through the air, Tech defender James Anderson <b>jumped</b> <b>and</b> caught the ball, intercepting it. Still on his feet, Anderson quickly rushed the other way and, unimpeded, ran 39yards {{into the end zone}} for a Virginia Tech touchdown. The score and extra point energized Virginia Tech's offense and defense and gave the Hokies an 11-point lead—35–24—with 4:45 remaining in the game.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} several notable jumpers as well. The first person to jump from the bridge was Robert Emmet Odlum, brother of women's rights activist Charlotte Odlum Smith, on May 19, 1885. He struck the water at an angle and died shortly {{thereafter}} from internal injuries. Steve Brodie dropped from underneath the bridge in July 1886, although there is some doubt about this. Larry Donovan made a slightly higher jump from the railing a month later {{and went on to}} an international bridge jumping career. Cartoonist Otto Eppers <b>jumped</b> <b>and</b> survived in 1910, and was then tried and acquitted for attempted suicide. A lesser known early jumper was James Duffy of County Cavan, Ireland, who, on April 15, 1895, asked several men to watch him jump from the bridge. Duffy <b>jumped</b> <b>and</b> was not seen again.|$|E

25|$|Firefighters often carry {{personal}} self-rescue ropes. The ropes {{are generally}} 30 {{feet long and}} can provide a firefighter (that has enough time to deploy the rope) a partially controlled exit out of an elevated window. Lack of a personal rescue rope is cited {{in the deaths of}} two New York City Firefighters, Lt. John Bellew and Lt. Curtis Meyran, who died after they jumped from the fourth floor of a burning apartment building in the Bronx. Of the four firefighters who <b>jumped</b> <b>and</b> survived, only one of them had a self-rescue rope. Since the incident, the Fire Department of New York City has issued self-rescue ropes to their firefighters.|$|E
25|$|After Carnegie's death, an {{electric}} fence was built around Points North Landing's landfill {{to prevent future}} predatory animal incidents. Eleven years later, a lone timber wolf attacked a young male twenty-six-year-old worker in Cigar Lake. The worker was on his midnight break when it <b>jumped</b> <b>and</b> mauled him less than one hundred meters from the main camp. A nearby female security guard frightened the wolf away. She administered first aid and called for an air ambulance, which airlifted him six hundred and seventy-five kilometres {{to a hospital in}} Saskatoon, where he recovered. After the attack, authorities ordered that wolves in the area be tracked down and shot. In addition, authorities required food disposal systems and inspected the fence around Cigar Lake's landfill, as well as providing more education to the mining staff members.|$|E

25|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles, {{which featured}} a combined gasoline and electric powertrain, {{were seen as}} a balance, offering an environmentally friendly image and improved fuel economy, without being hindered by the low range of electric vehicles, albeit at an increased price over comparable gasoline cars. Sales were poor, the lack of interest attributed to the car's small size {{and the lack of}} necessity for a fuel-efficient car at the time. The 2000s energy crisis brought renewed interest in hybrid and electric cars. In America, sales of the Toyota Prius (which had been on sale since 1999 in some markets) <b>jumped,</b> <b>and</b> a variety of automakers followed suit, releasing hybrid models of their own. Several began to produce new electric car prototypes, as consumers called for cars that would free them from the fluctuations of oil prices.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was between Vader (accompanied by Harley Race) and Ric Flair for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Flair {{would have to}} retire from {{professional}} wrestling if he lost. The match started with Vader having the advantage with attacks. After Vader performed a gorilla press slam, Flair rolled outside the ring, and Vader performed a gorilla press drop onto the guard rail. Vader then missed an attack, {{and ran into the}} guard rail. Flair fought back, and sent Vader into the ringpost. Race then attacked Flair, and Vader regained the advantage. Vader dominated Flair, performing a superplex and a body avalanche. Flair fought back, and sent Vader's left leg into the ringpost. Flair attacked the leg with a chair, and continued to target the leg. After Vader missed a corner slingshot splash, Flair applied the figure four leglock. Vader reached the ropes, and fought back, but missed a moonsault. Flair attempted to pin Vader while Race climbed the turnbuckle Vader jumped from. Race attempted a diving headbutt to break up the pin, but Vader powered Flair off of him to kick out just as Race <b>jumped</b> <b>and</b> as a result the champion took the diving headbutt from his manager. After referee Randy Anderson threw Race out of the ring, Flair hit a running forearm smash on Vader then proceeded to chop the champion repeatedly. Flair then attempted another running maneuver only to be met with a bell clap from Vader. Flair then grabbed Vader's left leg, causing him to trip and fall, and pinned him with a roll-up to win the match and the title.|$|E
500|$|The wolf, {{after some}} complaint, agrees {{to this and}} the two proceed through the woods after the prize—all the while the fox {{considers}} how to trick the wolf. Eventually, as the wolf complains of the fruitlessness of their quest, they arrive at a [...] with buckets on each end of a rope. Seeing {{the reflection of the}} moon in the water {{at the bottom of the}} well, the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox down to pick it up. When he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone, the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help. However, this pulls up the other bucket, into which the fox has <b>jumped,</b> <b>and</b> so the two swap places; the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped. The narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well, but that the tale is at an end.|$|E

500|$|The concert {{began with}} the lights dimming and a sole {{spotlight}} being focused on the crowd. The spotlight then followed Shakira {{as she entered the}} hall wearing a hooded fuchsia gown. Singing the [...] "pensive" [...] and [...] "sentimental" [...] ballad [...] "Pienso En Tí" [...] ("I Think of You"), she began walking towards the stage while shaking her fans' hands and hugging them. As soon as Shakira climbed the stage, she threw off the gown to reveal her main attire: a mesh gold crop top coupled with skin-tight leather pants. A more energetic routine followed as she [...] "sprinted, <b>jumped,</b> <b>and</b> yodelled" [...] across the stage while performing more guitar-oriented versions of [...] "Why Wait" [...] and [...] "Te Dejo Madrid" [...] ("I Leave You Madrid"). After stopping to play a harmonica solo, Shakira performed [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] ("If You Go") accompanied by [...] "dense" [...] musical instrumentation.

500|$|The feud between The Undertaker and Randy Orton and [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton {{began at}} SummerSlam. At the event, Randy faced off against Undertaker. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob (disguised as a fan) {{came into the}} ring and {{interrupted}} the match. Following this, Randy pinned Undertaker after he <b>jumped</b> <b>and</b> pulled Undertaker's head down over his shoulders, a move dubbed the RKO, to win. After the match, Randy peeled off the latex mask of the fan and revealed him to be his father, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob. On the September 16 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker defeated Randy. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob drove a U-Haul truck down to the ring and unloaded a casket. As Undertaker went to put Randy inside the casket, he opened it and found a mannequin of himself inside. Despite this distraction, Undertaker pinned Randy after he drove Randy's head into the mat in an upside down position, a move called the Tombstone Piledriver. The following week, druids wheeled out a casket. Undertaker appeared on the TitonTron and urged The Ortons to look inside. The Ortons opened the casket and found mannequins of themselves inside. Undertaker then proclaimed {{that this would be}} their fate at No Mercy.|$|E
500|$|The Shreveport Pirates were {{actually}} a transplantation of Bernie Glieberman and his organization from Ottawa. The Gliebermans had hinted at moving the Rough Riders to the United States, making {{them even more}} unpopular than they already were in Canada's capital. [...] As part of a settlement with the CFL, Glieberman sold the Rough Riders to Bruce Firestone for CAN$1.85 million, and in return was granted a US-based expansion team which became the Shreveport Pirates. As part of the deal, Glieberman not only had to pay the expansion fee, but also had to settle his previous Ottawa debts. [...] There was a groundswell of local support for the team but also significant difficulties in their first year: stifling weather, cultural clashes, organizational screw-ups, and serious hints of under-capitalization (during training camp the team was housed in a dorm above a milking barn). A woeful record did not help: the team lost their first 14 games. The {{end of the season}} showed promise for the team, as it finished its last four games with a 3–1 record; once the team was finally winning, attendance also <b>jumped,</b> <b>and</b> the home finale drew over 32,000 fans to 40,000-seat Independence Stadium, the highest for any U.S.-hosted CFL game outside Baltimore.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we <b>jumped</b> <b>and</b> ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with." [...] When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, [...] "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular {{kind of things that}} were on the album." [...] Author Domenic Priore notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, [...] "the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared".|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel cage match contested between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper), with the losing team {{disbanding}} forever. Mid-way through, Skipper handcuffed Harris to {{the ropes and}} kept the key away from the referee. Storm later took the key from Skipper and freed Harris from the cuffs. [...] At {{one point in the}} match, Skipper and Daniels double teamed Harris and performed America's Most Wanted signature finishing maneuver, the Death Sentence by holding Harris in place while the other member climbed to the top rope and performed a leg drop across Harris's neck and head. Skipper followed by covering Harris for a pinfall, however, he kicked out before the count of three. Harris later climbed {{up to the top of}} the cage. While Harris sat on top of the cage, Skipper climbed up at another corner and walked across the top similar to walking a tightrope. Skipper then <b>jumped</b> <b>and</b> grabbed Harris's head with his legs, falling backwards towards the ring in a move he dubbed the New School. This move caused Harris to fly off of the top of the cage and land on his back in the middle of the ring. A brief time later, all four men were positioned at certain points on one of the padded turnbuckles to perform what TNA calls the [...] "Tower of Doom". In a variation of the move, Daniels was being held upside-down by Storm, until Skipper grabbed Storm and placed his head between Storm's legs to lift him off of a padded turnbuckle. Harris then grabbed Skipper and placed Skipper on his shoulders while he held Storm, who remained holding Daniels. Harris then performed a powerbomb on Skipper, while Skipper pulled down Storm, who suplexed Daniels off of the top of the cage. The conclusion to the match saw America's Most Wanted cuff Daniels to the ropes and perform Triple X's signature maneuver, the Powerplex by lifting Skipper up onto Storm's shoulders while Harris held Skipper's head. Storm and Harris then fell to the mat, forcing Skipper's neck into Harris's shoulder and mat while slamming his back into the mat as well. Storm then pinned Skipper for the pinfall victory. As a result of Triple X's loss, the team had to disband forever.|$|E
