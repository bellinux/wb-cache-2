The US units rapidly pursued them north, passing over the Naktong River positions, which were no longer of strategic importance.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} {{mediation}} in Marxism is {{also referred to}} as the problem of determination, or namely how social actors navigate the social structures that bind them. For Marx, the primary form of mediation is labor, which forms a dialectical relationship between a worker’s body and nature. Labor thus mediates between humans and the natural world. Once labor becomes reified, or made into an abstraction that becomes a commodity, however, it becomes alienated from the worker who owns it and becomes exchangeable just like any other commodity. Once this occurs, capital becomes the mediating or determining factor, with the capitalist setting the wage rate or exchange-value of labor. The only thing the worker owns in this case, his or her labor power or ability to work, becomes the worker’s sole means of subsistence. The worker must <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> value from his or her labor as is possible on the open market in order to survive.|$|E

In contrast to his previous work on the Persona series, Meguro did not use contemporary musical elements. Instead, he created a more mature experience to reflect the game's story and setting.

The choir sounds were created using Eastwest Quantum Leap Symphonic Choirs, a synthesizer which could realistically simulate a choir.

500|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the management team, the Monks conducted extensive rehearsals with a focus on gritty, rhythmically oriented music. The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a Maestro fuzz box (and eventually a wah-wah pedal) for Burger, a floor tom for Johnston, and a six-string banjo for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section. Shaw explained that the group's motivation was to possess [...] "high rhythm and high energy". He elaborated further, saying [...] "The idea of it was to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> 'beat' out of it as we could. As much 'bam-bam-bam-bam' on the beat or whatever. The only time cymbals would be used would be for accent. If anyone wasn't contributing towards rhythm, then it wasn't part of the Monks sound". However, the band's transformation into the Monks was painstakingly slow, taking the group nearly a year of trial-and-error before they were confident enough to return to the studio.|$|E

500|$|This fact did {{not escape}} {{government}} officials, and when, in 1863, {{they attempted to}} restore coins to circulation, the use of bronze coins, which would not contain their face values in metal, was considered. In his annual report submitted October1, 1863, Mint Director James Pollock noted that [...] "whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins, they merely want the inferior [...] money for convenience in making exact payments". He observed that the private cent tokens had sometimes contained {{as little as a}} fifth of a cent in metal, yet had still circulated. [...] He proposed that the copper-nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of the same size. Pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal; its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery. On December8, Pollock wrote to Treasury Secretary Salmon P.
