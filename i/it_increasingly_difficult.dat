5|$|Although she {{appeared}} {{on television and}} in dramatic roles, her career petered out in the late 1950s, as complications from her diabetes made <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> for her to work. Her final stage appearance was in a 1958 off-Broadway production of Jean Cocteau's 1934 play, The Infernal Machine, appearing alongside John Kerr and June Havoc.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the Flames found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to retain}} their best players as {{salaries}} escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar. Calgary {{has always been one}} of the smallest markets in the league (it is currently third-smallest, behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg) and the NHL's small-market Canadian teams found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to compete in the new environment. In 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season. The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season, and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return.|$|E
5|$|Bilateral {{relations}} with the United States are strained because the U.S. Department of State supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also because the Belarusian government has made <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E

5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to stage}} her fake pregnancy.

Orson suggests coming clean {{to avoid the}} humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E

In her spare time she enjoys shopping, playing with her children, and {{browsing}} the internet; she has stated that she finds <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to enjoy shopping due to being constantly recognised. She has stated that she prefers being backstage over giving concerts, as {{she does not have}} to wear make-up or rehearse.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E

5|$|The Russians avoided Napoleon's {{objective}} of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance {{was made at}} Smolensk in August; the Russians were defeated {{in a series of}} battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to forage food for themselves and their horses.|$|E
5|$|The rebel bands {{had worked}} {{independently}} {{of each other}} until July, when al-Hajj Muhammad, Arif Abd al-Raziq and Fakhri Abd al-Hadi decided to coordinate the actions of their respective militias. Abd al-Raziq was based in the Bani Sa'b area around Tayibe, while Abd al-Hadi operated in Sha'ruwiya, around Arraba. All of their areas of operation were concentrated in the north-central highlands. Another meeting between the leaders was held in August to designate official areas of operation and specific targets to attack. The Jerusalem-area militia of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was absent from both of these meetings, making <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to form a solid military command among rebels across the country.|$|E
5|$|With the Americans {{moving closer}} towards Kiska and Attu, the Japanese were finding <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{resupply}} their bases there. In March 1943, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid established a naval blockade around the islands, {{refusing to let}} Japanese ships through. On March 26, Admiral Hosogaya attempted to break the blockade with eight battle ships as well as three transports, resulting in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, the last battle fought only between surface ships in the Pacific War. Following the American victory in this battle, the Japanese were forced to resupply their occupied possessions in the Aleutian chain by submarine.|$|E

5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> or {{impossible}} {{to roll over}} their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Robert the Bruce {{exploited}} {{his victory}} at Bannockburn to raid northern England, initially attacking Carlisle and Berwick, and then reaching further south into Lancashire and Yorkshire, even threatening York itself. Edward undertook an expensive but unsuccessful campaign {{to stem the}} advance in 1319, but the famine made <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to keep his garrisons supplied with food. Meanwhile, a Scottish expedition led by Robert's brother successfully invaded Ireland in 1315, where Edward Bruce declared himself the King of Ireland. He was finally defeated in 1318 by Edward II's Irish justiciar, Edmund Butler, at the Battle of Faughart, and Edward Bruce's severed head {{was sent back to}} the King. Revolts also broke out in Lancashire and Bristol in 1315, and in Glamorgan in Wales in 1316, but were suppressed.|$|E
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of}} the north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E
5|$|The film {{serves as}} a satire of the social conditions, {{dominant}} practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, {{as well as the}} film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Filmmaking was becoming more expensive and requiring larger technical resources, particularly with the rise of sound production, making <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> for amateur filmmakers to enter the profession. This deepened a divide between amateurs and Hollywood professionals, and as a result, a growing number of amateurs started lampooning Hollywood in their films, including A Hollywood Extra. The subject of the film is an extra who starts his Hollywood career with hopes and dreams, but ultimately finds himself used and discarded by the industry, and his artistic ambitions destroyed. At the start of the film, the protagonist has a name (Mr. Jones) and a letter of recommendation outlining his talents, but his abilities are ignored and he is reduced to a number, symbolizing his dehumanization.|$|E
50|$|However, in the 1970s, {{control of}} state {{education}} became more centralised, with {{more emphasis on}} what could be termed behaviourist principles.

5|$|The {{heyday of}} the Free State was over by the 1940s. Because of {{conflicts}} with the United States Treasury, the Hollywood Dinner Club was shut down in the late 1930s. The local clubs found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to attract major entertainment figures. Gambling had been legalized in Nevada in 1931 and this distinct advantage over Galveston, and other illegal gambling centers, gradually lured mob figures such as New York City's Bugsy Siegel to Las Vegas. The competition created by the up-and-coming entertainment center in the desert substantially challenged the island on the Gulf {{over the next several}} years. Still, even during its later years, the Balinese Room was able to attract the likes of Tony Bennett and Peggy Lee, among others. And as late as 1950 the annual income of the Maceo empire was reportedly $3.84 million ($ in today's terms).|$|E
5|$|The hill {{required}} {{a lot of}} volunteer work to maintain and run during the season and particularly for the tournament. It also lacked a ski lift. Combined, this made <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to recruit new ski jumpers during the 1960s, particularly after a lift was installed on Mount Revelstoke in 1961. Skiing activities moved to Mount Mackenzie during the 1960s and in 1973, the ski club also relocated to there. The Tournament of Champions during 1971 and 1972 incurred a heavy loss. The last major tournaments in Nels Nelson Hill were the Western Canadian Ski Jumping Tournament, the Canadian Junior and Senior Ski Jumping Championship and the International Cross Country Championship, held in February and March 1974. The last tournament was a junior event held in 1975. The venue has since fallen into disrepair.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's {{commitment}} to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found <b>it</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen. The surprising removal of Sallal on November 5 by Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen, resulted in an internal shift {{of power in the}} capital, while the royalists approached it from the north. The new republic government was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman, all of which shortly either resigned or fled the country, leaving the disarrayed capital under the control of Prime Minister Hassan Amri. The 1967 siege of Sana'a became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel with peace talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic, and a ceasefire came into effect.|$|E
