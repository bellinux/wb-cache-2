25|$|Romania {{originally}} proposed Senator Varujan Vosganian, however {{he quickly}} met with opposition from Socialists and the Commission itself {{due to his}} far right views and having no experience of the EU or profile outside Romania. That nomination was replaced by Leonard Orban who was given the portfolio of Multilingualism, previously part of Education, Training & Culture. This however was met a cool reception <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> slim portfolio. PES Group leader Martin Schulz MEP suggested it should instead focus on ethnic minorities but this was rejected by Barroso. Orban was approved by Parliament with 595 votes in favour, 16 against and 29 abstentions.|$|E

He told his courtiers, [...] "I am sorry, gentlemen, <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> time a-dying", and {{expressed}} regret at his treatment of his wife. On the last evening {{of his life he}} was received into the Catholic Church, though the extent to which he was fully conscious or committed, and with whom the idea originated, is unclear. He was buried in Westminster Abbey [...] "without any manner of pomp" [...] on 14 February.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} the song on multiple occasions, including the song {{as part of}} her set list on The Beyoncé Experience (2007). Beyoncé cried during the performance, and was then embraced by a male dancer dressed as an angel. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly praised Beyoncé's performance of the song stating [...] "The true defibrillator moment, all freakum dress changes aside, is 'Flaws and All', during which Beyoncé weeps real tears (nightly, according to reports from earlier overseas shows) while apologizing <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> bitch. That's a rare campy, melodramatic performance in an otherwise energized two hours." [...] The performance also caught the attention of The New York Times writer Jon Pareles who stated, [...] "Along the way the concert was a showcase for her consistently expanding music, from the kinetic dance beats of songs like 'Get Me Bodied' to dramatic ballads like 'Flaws and All', which Beyoncé sang wide-eyed in a video close-up." [...] J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post wrote that during the performance she was offering a [...] "litany of her own 'imperfections' that her lover embraces unconditionally". John Aizlewood from the Daily Mail criticized the angel embrace {{at the end of the}} [...] "Flaws and All" [...] performance as being the weakest part of The Beyoncé Experience set. A writer of The Times also gave a mixed review for the performance of the song, saying that [...] "Her attempt at an introspective ballad, Flaws and All, was less convincing." [...] Anthony Venutolo of New Jersey On-Line wrote that the performance was [...] "silly". The performance of the song in Los Angeles on September 2, 2007 was taped and included on The Beyoncé Experience Live. The performance of the song was also shown independently at MTV.com and was released via digital download at the iTunes Store on November 19, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Agents {{from the}} British SOE who were parachuted into France to help {{organize}} the resistance often complained {{about what they}} {{considered to be the}} carelessness of the French groups when it came to security. A favorite tactic of the Gestapo and the Abwehr was to capture a résistant, [...] "turn" [...] him or her to their side, and then send the double agent out to infiltrate the resistance network. Numerous resistance groups were destroyed by such double agents, and the SOE often charged that the poor security arrangements of the French resistance groups left them wide open to being destroyed by one [...] "turned" [...] résistant. For example, the Interallié group was destroyed when Carré was captured and turned by Abwehr Captain Hugo Bleicher on 17 November 1941 as she betrayed everyone. The same month, Colonel Alfred Heurtaux of the OCM was betrayed by an informer and arrested by the Gestapo. In November 1941, Frenay recruited Jacques Renouvin, whom he called an [...] "experienced brawler" [...] to lead the new Groupes Francs para-military arm of the Combat resistance group. Renouvin taught his men military tactics at a secret [...] "boot camp" [...] in the countryside in the south of France and led the Groupes Francs in a series of attacks on collaborators in Lyon and Marseilles. Frenay and Renouvin wanted to [...] "blind" [...] and [...] "deafen" [...] the French police by assassinating informers who were the [...] "eyes" [...] and [...] "ears" [...] of the police. Renouvin, who was a well known [...] "tough guy" [...] and experienced killer personally accompanied résistants on their first assassinations to provide encouragement and advice. If the would be assassin turned out to be in Renouvin's phrase to be a [...] "sissy" [...] who was unable to take a life, Renouvin would assassinate the informer himself and then afterwards berate the would be assassin <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sissy" [...] who was not tough enough for the hard, dangerous work of the resistance.|$|E
