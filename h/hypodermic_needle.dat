5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle,</b> using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E

5000|$|Although dry {{needling}} originally utilized only <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needles</b> due to {{the concern}} that solid needles had neither the strength or tactile feedback that <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needles</b> provided and that the needle could be deflected by [...] "dense contraction knots", those concerns have proven unfounded and many healthcare practitioners who perform dry needling {{have found that the}} acupuncture needles not only provides better tactile feedback but also penetrate the [...] "dense muscle knots" [...] better and are easier to manage and caused less discomfort to patients. For that reason, both the use of <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needles</b> and the use of acupuncture needles are now accepted in dry needling practice.

Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle</b> into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle,</b> which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Fine needle {{aspiration}} biopsy (FNAB) cytology {{has been}} a highly effective methodology for tissue diagnosis and for various ancillary studies including molecular tests. In addition to other benefits, FNAB predominantly retrieves the diagnostic loosely cohesive cells in the lesion {{as compared to the}} adjacent supporting stroma with relatively higher cohesiveness. However, FNAB procedure performed with currently available resources is highly skill dependent with inter-performer variability, which compromises its full potential as a diagnostic tool. In this study we report a device overcoming these limitations. Methods 'Tissue Harvester with Functional Valve' (THFV) was evaluated as part of a phase 1 National Institute of Health (NIH) research grant under Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program. Working prototypes of the device were prepared. Each of the four cytopathologists with previous cytopathology fellowship training and experience in performing FNAB evaluated 5 THFV and 5 <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needles</b> resulting in 40 specimens (20 with THFV, 20 with <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needles).</b> A piece of fresh cattle liver stuffed in latex glove was used as the specimen. Based on these results a finished design was finalized. Results The smears and cell blocks prepared from the specimens obtained by THFV were superior in terms of cellularity to specimens obtained with <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needles.</b> The tissuecrit of specimens obtained with THFV ranged from 70 to 100 μl (mean 87, SD 10), compared to 17 to 30 μl (mean 24, SD 4) with conventional <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needles</b> (p Conclusion The specimen yield with the new THFV was significantly higher when compared to <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needles.</b> Also, the FNAB procedure with THFV was relatively easier in comparison with <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needles.</b> The final version of Shidham's THFV device would improve the FNAB specimen yield by eliminating the skill factor. The increased specimen yield by this device would also facilitate wider application of FNAB specimens for various ancillary tests, including molecular tests. </p...|$|R

25|$|The urticating setae or spines {{can cause}} {{irritation}} when they break off and lodge in skin. In some species these structures are hollow {{and connected to}} poison-producing cells, functioning like a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle.</b> Generally most hairs are only irritating, but some are dangerous to the eyes and respiratory tract, and some can cause severe skin necrosis and shedding. Certain species of Lonomia in the family Saturniidae actually can inject venom that is life-threatening to humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} popular {{approaches}} are injection of DNA in saline, using a standard <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle</b> and gene gun delivery. Injection in saline is normally conducted intramuscularly (IM) in skeletal muscle, or intradermally (ID), delivering DNA to extracellular spaces. This can be assisted by electroporation; by temporarily damaging muscle fibres with myotoxins such as bupivacaine; or by using hypertonic solutions of saline or sucrose. Immune responses to this method can be affected by factors including needle type, needle alignment, speed of injection, volume of injection, muscle type, and age, sex and physiological condition of the recipient.|$|E
25|$|A {{blood test}} is a {{laboratory}} {{analysis performed on}} a blood sample that is usually extracted from a vein in the arm using a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle,</b> or via fingerprick. Multiple tests for specific blood components, such as a glucose test or a cholesterol test, are often grouped together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work. Blood tests are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease, mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and organ function. Typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or a complete blood count. Blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse. In some of the United States, a blood test is required before marriage.|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{modifications}} of Moniz's operation were introduced with little delay by Italian medical practitioners. Most notably, in 1937 Amarro Fiamberti, the {{medical director of}} a psychiatric institution in Varese, first devised the transorbital procedure whereby the frontal lobes were accessed through the eye sockets. Fiamberti's method was to puncture the thin layer of orbital bone {{at the top of}} the socket and then inject alcohol or formalin into the white matter of the frontal lobes through this aperture. Using this method, while sometimes substituting a leucotome for a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle,</b> it is estimated that he leucotomised about 100 patients in the period up to the outbreak of World War II. Fiamberti's innovation of Moniz's method would later prove inspirational for Walter Freeman's development of transorbital lobotomy.|$|E
25|$|Optical fibers {{can be used}} as {{sensors to}} measure strain, temperature, {{pressure}} and other quantities by modifying a fiber so that the property to measure modulates the intensity, phase, polarization, wavelength, or transit time of light in the fiber. Sensors that vary the intensity of light are the simplest, since only a simple source and detector are required. A particularly useful feature of such fiber optic sensors is that they can, if required, provide distributed sensing over distances of up to one meter. In contrast, highly localized measurements can be provided by integrating miniaturized sensing elements with the tip of the fiber. These can be implemented by various micro- and nanofabrication technologies, such that they do not exceed the microscopic boundary of the fiber tip, allowing such applications as insertion into blood vessels via <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The surgeon {{tests the}} closure {{tension of the}} wound sutures by in-folding the breast over the index finger, and towards the {{transposed}} nipple-areola complex, to observe if the skin blanches (whitens) or over-stretches, afterwards, the nipple-areola complex-area dermis is de-epithelialized. In the combined mastopexy–augmentation procedure, wherein the breast prosthesis is emplaced to a submuscular implant pocket, an anaesthetic tumescent solution is injected along the marked incision line. When the breast implant will be emplaced to a subglandular implant pocket, the <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle</b> penetrates un-resisted into the anatomic plane above the pectoralis major muscle; the tumescent solution anaesthesia allows blunt dissection. After establishing anaesthesia, the surgeon de-epithelializes each edge of skin by undermining it , with a razor scalpel, thereby facilitating {{the closing of the}} surgical wound without tight sutures. In a mastopexy–augmentation, the breast-implant pocket (locale) determines when the surgeon performs the de-epithelialization of the B pedicle; for submuscular implantation, the skin pedicle de-epithelialization is performed after the emplacement; for subglandular implantation, the skin pedicle de-epithelialization is performed before the emplacement.|$|E

500|$|Bousman {{came up with}} an idea whereby a character's {{hands would}} get stuck in some sort of vessel and this {{resulted}} in the [...] "Hand Trap". It proved to be a challenge but after much discussion, Hackl, property master Jim Murray and art director Michele Brady came up with a suitable design. They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>needle</b> with the antidote and which had two hand-holes on the underside. As soon as Vaugier's character Addison put her hands into the holes razor blades would close in on her hands and any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death. In order for the trap to be used safely, the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress's hands, thus allowing her to slide her hands out. Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put her hands into the trap as there was a lock with a key on the other side box that would have opened the contraption.|$|E
