5|$|Shortly after forming, Kujira tracked near Pohnpei, {{resulting}} in heavy rainfall across the island, peaking at 250mm (10in). Despite the typhoon's far {{distance from the}} island, two people were killed– one died after being crushed by a prostrated tree, while the other was killed offshore for unknown reasons. It also caused minor damage to buildings and crops on the island. The outer rainbands of the typhoon would later bring gale-force winds and heavy precipitation as it passed well south of Guam. Afterwards, the storm remained well removed from landmasses {{for a period of}} time. On April18, however, PAGASA issued a public storm warning signal No.1 for Catanduanes in the Philippines due to the likelihood for gusty winds and rainfall. As Kujira neared the archipelago, the No.1 warning was expanded to include the Babuyan Islands while a No.2 warning was introduced for the Batanes Islands in northern Philippines. In preparation for the typhoon, the National Disaster Coordinating Council readied regional disaster coordinating councils and contingency plans while the Armed Forces of the Philippines prepared for any potential <b>emergency</b> <b>situation.</b> The Philippine Coast Guard patrolled Filipino waters throughout Kujira's close passage in order to redirect ships away from the typhoon. Though the typhoon had also threatened to cancel the biennial San Fernando Race, the concurrent SARS outbreak which had impacted the Philippines ultimately resulted in its cancelling. Eventually any effects in the Philippines remained minimal.|$|E
