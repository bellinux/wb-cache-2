40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} emphasis on the interpersonal function of metadiscourse features in academic texts. This means that research on writing in academic contexts began to focus on the rhetorical features, such as <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> that writers use to present their voice in writing. These developments in academic writing have also considered the context in which specific genres are produced. Using a multiple-methods approach to genre analysis, this article compares students’ use of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> features in two undergraduate courses, Media Studies and Primary Education at the University of Botswana. A total of 40 student essays were analysed. Interviews with students and lecturers in the two departments were also done to understand {{the context in which the}} essays were produced. The comparison of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> features in the two corpora indicated that <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers were present, but that there were variations in the use and distribution of these features by the learners. Contextual information shows that such variations reflect the different values and beliefs about academic writing of the discourse communities that students belong to. These values and beliefs can be problematic for English for Specific Purposes (EAP) lecturers who have to prepare students for writing in the various disciplines in L 2 contexts...|$|E
40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is Interpersonal Metadiscourse Markers used in Michelle Obama Speech. It has two objectives. First, it is aimed at finding out the types of {{interpersonal}} metadiscourse markers in each sentences used in Michelle Obama Speech. Second, it is aimed to explain the functions of them. This research uses qualitative research, because the research does not give the numeral or statictics, but just depends on {{the knowledge of the}} researcher in analyzing the data. The data of this study were analyzed by using some steps; first, reading the speech transcript; second, identifying and classifying the interpersonal metadiscourse markers, then, describing the function of interpersonal metadiscourse markers, and the last steps is interpreting the data and drawing conclusion. The result showed that there are two categories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers used in Michelle Obama Speech; those are interactive and <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> There are 165 (44, 2 %) interactive metadiscourse and 209 (55, 8 %) <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> Kinds of interactive metadiscourse found in Michelle Obama Speech are 145 (38, 8 %) transitional which is the highest percentage, because transitional is conjunction that functions to relate one sentence with other sentences, next is 9 (2, 4 %) frame markers, then 7 (1, 8 %) code glosses and the last is 4 (1, 1 %) evidentials. Meanwhile, kinds of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> found in Michelle Obama Speech are 40 (10, 7 %) hedges, 8 (2, 1 %) boosters, after that 135 (36 %) self mentions. Self Mentions is the dominant <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> because when Michelle Obama speaks about her opinion, she gives statement to audience who became author for them and the last for interactional category is 26 (7, 0 %) engagement marker...|$|E
40|$|Academic writing, {{particularly}} writing research articles, is {{an indispensable}} {{part of every}} major in higher education. Hyland (2004) argued that a valuable means of exploring academic writing, and comparing the rhetorical features and preferences of different discourse communities, is through the metadiscourse analysis of the text. The present study examines {{the differences in the}} use, type, and frequency of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers in the introduction and conclusion sections of research papers across the two disciplines of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. To this end, 42 research articles (21 Mechanical and 21 Electrical Engineering) written by English native speakers were randomly selected from two major international journals. The current study made use of Hyland’s (2005) model for analyzing the <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers used in the selected corpus, consisting of 41484 words. To analyze the data, the frequency, patterns of use, and type of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers were elicited both through a manual corpus analysis and concordance package. Furthermore, to examine whether there is any significant difference in the use of metadiscourse markers in the introduction and conclusion sections of these papers, a Chi-square analysis was run. The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that although there were some minor differences in the frequency and type of these metadiscourse markers, there was no statistically significant difference across the disciplines, which {{can be attributed to the}} close nature of these fields. The findings of this study may render some pedagogical implications for ESP courses and especially writing research papers...|$|E
30|$|The <b>{{interact}}ional</b> {{aspect of}} <b>metadiscourse</b> {{deals with the}} way the authors interact with their readers and engage them. Thus, intensity markers (IMs) fulfill interpersonal functions in RAs and can be regarded as metadiscourse markers. According to Quirk et al.' (1985) model of IMs, these markers are classified into three major classes of emphasizers, amplifiers, and downtoners. Crismore et al. (1993) also viewed intensity markers are one type of metadiscourses which actualizes interpersonal functions. They also stated that IMs display the communicative value of the discourse and writers’ stance toward the proposition.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{academic}} discourse {{has been}} reported to be persuasive (e. g. Bhatia, 2004). Writers endeavour to represent themselves in a credible way to get their research accepted by the international academia. Metadiscourse is the linguistic system that enables writers to get positive evaluation of their studies and negative evaluation of previous ones (e. g., Hyland, 2005). Little research has investigated the extent to which EFL subject specialists are aware of the <b>interactional</b> function of <b>metadiscourse</b> when reading field-related materials. This study attempted to fill this gap. Fifty EFL geography researchers were asked to read 4 field-related research articles (RAs) and to perform an oral protocol for each. They also responded to language proficiency test, subject background quizzes and a post-reading questionnaire. The protocols were coded in terms of evaluative metadiscourse based on Hyland's (2005) taxonomy. Results showed that language proficiency was the main blocking factor confirming the linguistic threshold hypothesis (Cummins, 1979). The findings have important implications on how metadiscourse might improve field-related RA comprehension in English...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes a}} comparative {{exploration of the}} use of some metadiscourse resources in a small corpus of texts from popular scientific magazines in English and Italian, namely Scientific American (henceforth SA) and Le Scienze (henceforth LS). Scientific popularization is a meeting point of different discourse communities with their own needs, intentions and modes of communication (see Calsamiglia 2003, Myers 2003, Gotti 2005, 2013). Metadiscourse (cf., among others, Crismore and Farnsworth 1990, Crismore, Markkanen, Steffensen 1993, Hyland 1998, 2005) can be modulated and can modulate communication in different ways, as it covers a variety of linguistic elements which are aimed at organizing the text for its readers – the interactive dimension – and at engaging them in exposition and argumentation – the interactional dimension (see Hyland 2005). Recent research (e. g. Neff and Dafouz 2008, Musacchio and Ahmad 2009, Musacchio and Palumbo 2010, Suau 2010, Masi 2013) has indeed pursued comparisons of metadiscourse devices associated with scientific discourse domains and genres of popularisation in different languages to appraise the extent of cross-linguistic correspondence and avoid, for example, inappropriate translations. 	Special attention is here devoted to both interactive and <b>interactional</b> devices of <b>metadiscourse,</b> i. e. the representation of scientific and non-scientific ‘actors’ (cf. Calsamiglia 2003, Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) through a range of acts of reporting as evidentials, i. e. the most explicit form of inclusion of other-discourse/voice in one’s discourse, as well as through a selection of self-mention and engagement markers lending themselves to quantitative along with qualitative evaluation. Altogether, the variety of items under analysis can be viewed as representing the three axes (third person reference vs. I/we vs. you) for the construction and evaluation of the roles of different identities (including text producer and implied target receiver) in scientific popularisation. Language diversification, then, is here tackled both from the intra-linguistic standpoint of the different construction of identities within a form of media discourse, and from a cross-linguistic viewpoint, i. e. the extent to which such constructions differ in the two language samples in question, in the attempt to ultimately detect possible preferential metadiscourse strategies that are specific to each language represented in the corpus. The macro-analytical background presupposed by the works here referred to (in particular Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) is that of Critical Discourse Analysis, although the implications of the present research are also relevant for the perspective of Language Variation (and, to some extent, for Translation too) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{interactive}} features of language {{has been a}} very productive source of insights into written discourse in recent years, revealing the ways that writers engage with readers to successfully persuade them of a particular viewpoint in a range of different genres and contexts. While a variety of approaches have illuminated our understanding of these features, the concept of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> has been particularly valuable in revealing how writers project themselves into their discourse to signal their understandings of their material and their audience. In this paper we draw on Hyland’s (2005 a) model of metadiscourse to explore some of the ways that interaction contributes to the success of two journalistic genres: popular science and opinion articles. Examining 200 popular science and 200 opinion texts, we show that despite the broadly similar audience and sources of these genres, authors structure their interactions very differently, contributing to the rhetorical distinctiveness of these genres. The paper not only offers a detailed account of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> in these genres, but illustrates how interpersonal connections are accomplished for particular persuasive purposes in everyday public texts. postprin...|$|E
40|$|Summary of the {{doctoral}} dissertation Interpersonality Strategies in International Student Handbooks Written by Native Speakers of English (NSE) and Non-native Speakers of English (NNSE) Tesis doctoral presentada por: Stan McDaniel Mann Valencia, 2014 	Have you ever read a brochure or handbook written in English by a non-native speaker of English (NNSE), {{noticed that the}} grammar and syntax was excellent and the terminology was near-perfect, but you still {{did not understand the}} essence of what the author was trying to communicate, or you had the feeling that the information was ambiguous? It was precisely for these two reasons that this research on interpersonality strategies was carried out. Through this analysis it is hoped to contribute to explaining why international student handbooks written by NNSE do not persuade effectively enough and do not establish a proper writer-reader relationship, which are precisely two of the main goals of interpersonality. Interpersonality is also referred to as <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> or interpersonal metadiscourse, and all three terms are used interchangeably throughout this study. 	Since the term metadiscourse was coined over 50 years ago, the definitions for it have continuously evolved. Metadiscourse may be broadly described as overtly expressing the writer´s acknowledgement of the reader (Dahl, 2004, p. 1811). There are two classifications of metadiscourse, textual metadiscourse and <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> For this study, <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> has been chosen due to its focus on establishing a close writer-reader relationship. 	Hyland and Tse´s (2004) model of analysis proved to be the most reliable for this study {{due to the fact that}} it was the first classification of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers with 5 main <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> categories: hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions, each category with its corresponding subcategories for a more precise classification and analysis. The main objective was to see the difference of interpersonal metadiscourse usage between NSE and NNSE authors of international student handbooks. The corpus for this study consisted of 50 international student handbooks written by NSE authors, 10 handbooks from 10 different universities from the following NSE countries: USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, and Australia, and 50 handbooks written by NNSE authors, 10 handbooks from 10 different universities from the following NNSE countries: France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, and Japan. A total of 31, 989 interpersonal metadiscourse markers from NSE handbooks were classified and analyzed, and a total of 12, 948 interpersonal metadiscourse markers from NNSE handbooks were classified and analyzed. 	This study was rather unique in that, unlike the vast majority of the previous research performed on interpersonal metadisdourse which was done on the genre of the research article, it was focused on the business-academic genre of international student handbooks. 	For the statistical analysis, the obtained data was submitted to SPSS, and the ANOVA and T-tests were run. For the percentage analysis, percentages were computed for the main categories and subcategories of interactional metdisdourse. Significant and highly significant differences were discovered and discussed. On a general level, NNSE authors used a total of 10. 03...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} interpersonality in {{research}} article abstracts analysed {{in terms of}} <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> The evolution {{in the distribution of}} three prominent interactional markers comprised in Hyland's (2005 a) model, viz. hedges, boosters and attitude markers, is investigated in three decades of abstract writing in the field of applied linguistics in the broad sense. On the basis of a quantitative corpus survey of abstracts in Journal of Pragmatics, two major points are made. One is that the distribution of hedges, boosters and attitude markers in abstracts, when compared with their distribution in research articles, supports the idea that abstracts are not just pale reflections of the full-length articles, but rather have a specific make-up, which can plausibly be linked to their function. The second point is that the use of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> in abstracts has undergone interesting changes {{in the course of the}} past 30 years. On the whole, the degree of interpersonality realised by hedges, boosters and attitude markers diminishes over time, though notable differences exist with regard to the subcategories in the interactional domain. In the discussion section, we try to arrive at an explanation for the changes that have occurred, taking genre, discourse community, research practice and rhetoric strategy into account. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to seek two types of {{interpersonal}} model of Hyland (2005) used in conclusion sections of 30 Master Theses of English Teaching, English Literature, and English Translation written by male and female graduate students. These conclusion sections were categorized into two groups of male and female writers: 15 conclusion sections belonged to male writers and other 15 conclusion sections belonged to female writers. The interactive and <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers were counted and analyzed to find if male or female writers utilize these metadiscourse markers differently or similarly in conclusion sections of English disciplines (Translation, Teaching, and Literature). These metadiscourse markers were analyzed descriptively and referentially. The descriptive analysis show that both male and female writers in Translation, Teaching and Literature applied more interactional markers than interactive ones. In Translation and Teaching, female writers used more interactional resources comparing to male writers. But, in Literature, male writers employed more interactional markers than female writers. The referential statistics indicate that in English Translation and English Literature, there are significant differences between male and female writers concerning use of Interactive and <b>Interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> Markers, while in English Teaching, there are not any significant differences between male and female writers regarding use of these metadiscourse Markers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Metadiscourse markers as rhetorical devices {{refer to}} ‘self-reflective {{linguistic}} expressions’ (Hyland, 2004) {{that make the}} writers more powerful in interaction. Since metadiscourse is a rhetorical device, it could be different based on the user’s culture and mother tongue. In this study, three groups of research articles including native English (NE), native Persian (NP), and non-native English (NNE) articles (written by Iranian academics) were analyzed based on Hyland and Tse’s (2004) taxonomy plus two metadiscourse strategies by Abdi et al. (2010). The {{difference between the two}} cultures of English and Persian represented in texts was examined in terms of the impact of English as L 2 on the non-native English research articles written by Iranian academic writers. To find the significant difference among the three corpora, the researchers used chi-square test. The findings of analyzing about 9000 lines of 26 published research articles on ELT and theoretical linguistics revealed the native Persian academic writers used interactive metadiscourse markers in their L 1 writings more than the native English and non-native English academic writers (Iranian) whereas they used the least number of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> (with the exception of self mentions). It was interesting that Persian academic writers used the most number of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers when they wrote in L 2 (English). Regarding the other variable of the study i. e. gender, the findings further proved no relevance between gender and metadiscourse marker...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} article {{is one of}} the widely practiced genres of communication among members of academic discourse community to contribute their own new knowledge and get acceptance from the audience. A generic analysis of {{research article}}s can cover a wide variety of issues; among them rhetorical features. As argued by Hyland (2004), a valuable means of exploring academic writing and of comparing the rhetorical features and preferences of different discourse communities is through metadiscoursal analysis. Metadiscourse is an aspect of language which provides a link between texts and disciplinary cultures, helping to define the rhetorical context by revealing some of the expectations and understandings of the audience for whom a text is written. Differences in metadiscourse patterns may prove to be an essential means of distinguishing discourse communities (Hyland, 1998). The present paper focused on <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers in the result and discussion section of academic research articles across four disciplines, namely, English Language Teaching, Civil Engineering, Biology, and Economics. Sixteen research article result and discussion sections (4 from each discipline) were sourced from four leading international journals for analysis. Results revealed that there were worth-pointing differences, but not statistically significant differences excepting in terms of boosters, between disciplines in the use of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers. Similarities and differences are explained by way of an explication of genre features in terms of contextual configuration and genre specific needs dealing with applied metadiscourse markers by discipline...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{research}} on writing in academic contexts {{began to focus}} on the types and nature of writing tasks students encounter in the content subjects. Research has also examined particular rhetorical features like the use of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> features that writers use to present their voice in writing and which might distinguish specific genres. These developments in academic writing have also considered the socio-cultural context in which specific genres are produced. The pedagogical motivation for researchers has been to better understand students' writing needs in their content subjects in order to prepare them for academic writing in their disciplines. Much of this research has focused on other fields of study like science and engineering and business students and in L 1 contexts and I have found nothing that relates specifically to academic writing for Media Studies and Primary Education in the context of Botswana. Using mixed-methods approach to genre analysis, this thesis compares students' use of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> features to present voice in three writing contexts, the EAP preparatory course and two undergraduate courses (Media Studies and Primary Education) at the University of Botswana. A sub-corpus of L 1 (BAWE) undergraduate writers working on similar essays was also used to compare how the L 2 writers and L 1 writers in this study vary in the use of these features in essay writing. A total of 123 essays from these various contexts were analyzed. Interviews with students and tutors in the EAP department and Media Studies and Primary Education departments were also done to understand the socio-cultural context in which the essays were produced. The results indicate that writing tasks in the departments of Media Studies and Primary Education included both the general essay and discipline specific genres. The comparison of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> features in the different sub-corpora indicated variations in the use of these features by the different groups of learners. Contextual information shows that such variations reflect the different values and beliefs about academic writing of the concrete discourse communities that students belong to. These values and beliefs can be problematic for EAP tutors who have to prepare students for writing in the various disciplines. The research has provided valuable insights into writing in Botswana context and may prove to have relevance for similar contexts. They have raised pedagogical implications for the design of the EAP writing course at the University of Botswana where a focus on a more contextual approach to teaching the academic writing would prove useful. The findings of this study are also potentially beneficial to the wider EAP community and the field of Applied Linguistics {{as an example of a}} mixed-method, contextual approach to genre analysis.

Based on the findings of the study, it can be inferred that there is much evidence in the use of metadiscourse in Philippine investigative journalism blogs; thus, the use of metadiscourse as an appropriate linguistic resource is supplemental and essential. The data revealed that the investigative journalism blogs have a higher frequency of use of interactive resources, allowing writers to organize and structure their propositions so that the text becomes more coherent to the readers. Among the five categories of interactive resources, the use of evidentials has the highest frequency. As regards the use of interactional resources, hedges are the most frequent.

More recently, however, the attention paid by genre analysis to text similarities has incipiently switched towards the examination of cross-disciplinary, cross-discursive and cross-generic differences. In the light of these latest analytic perspectives, the study relies on two corpora comprised of instances of two genres: the Letter to Shareholders appearing {{at the beginning of}} company’s financial annual reports (ARs), and the discussion section of marketing academic research articles (RAs). The paper brings insights into the different strategies and metadiscursive devices which are deployed by banks’ Presidents and RA authors to discuss findings and to fulfil more rhetorical purposes, i. e. to build credibility and to impart confidence in readers. The comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis suggests that from the ideational viewpoint, the genres under study share similar research- and result-oriented lexical items. However, it is from the viewpoint of interpersonal or <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> (Vande Kopple, 1985 and Hyland, 2005) that discrepancies can be identified.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions. The first five comprise interactive metadiscourse, and the rest comprise <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWriting is like {{a mirror}} that {{reflects}} the social and personal realities. Any culture and society has some specific ways and strategies for text and talk organization and communication, e. g. generic conventions, moves, metadiscourse markers, etc. are some of such strategies for better text organization and communication. Metadiscourse categories are specific rhetorical devices that help the participants to effectively {{communicate with each other}} (Hyland, 2005). Employing these interactional devices is different in various languages and societies, in other words metadiscourse strategies are context dependent. In order to find differences between the use of <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> strategies, in two different societies and contexts, we analyzed and critically interpreted their usage in the discussion sections of 40 research articles written by Iranian and English scholars in English. This critical analysis was based on the socio-cognitive approach of van Dijk. This analysis showed similarities and differences in the rhetorical behaviour of these authors in their use of interactional metadiscoursive strategies. There was a considerable tendency to the use of ‘hedging’ by both groups of writers. The main difference was in the use of self-mentions and engagement markers. The frequency rate of such strategies was very low amongst Iranian writers. The social constructions and cognition of participants may have undeniable effects on the use of interactional strategies. The findings of such studies can have useful implications for ESL, EFL, and ESP courses in general; and for developing academic literacy in particular...|$|E

Moreover, this research also explains how the metadiscourse functions are applied {{in relation to the}} moves. The method of this study is qualitative research. The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> is infrequently used. In terms of functions of metadiscourse in relation to moves, discourse goal (sub-type of frame markers) characterizes Move 2. Then, the resources of boosters which characterize move 4 are show, found, obtained, embodied, and revealed. Conclude (resources of frame markers sub-type—discourse stage) characterizes move 5. Some metadiscourse types related to the moves applied are evidentials, hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions. There are also certain resources in certain metadiscourse types which exist in certain move such as the resource of transitions and code glosses. In conclusion, only few abstracts from science support support Day’s (1995) model. In the use of metadiscourse, the use of interactive metadiscourse is dominant. From 10 types of metadiscourse, transitions are frequently employed...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} gender {{differences}} {{has proved to be}} a popular line of inquiry for researchers for decades, and the recent growing interest in the pervasive phenomenon of metadiscourse makes it a major domain in the research of discourse analysis and corpus-based analyses. This study extends the investigation of gender and metadiscourse to newspaper opinion columns. The study seeks to explore both gender and metadiscourse in media texts by analyzing a corpus of British and Saudi opinion columns. Using corpus-linguistics techniques, the study aims to investigate gender differences in the writings of men and women columnists regarding their use of metadiscourse and selected linguistic and stylistic features. Drawing on Hyland’s (2005) model of metadiscourse, the study further aims to compare the use of metadiscourse markers among both columnists in order to identify which categories predominate in this type of discourse and how they are distributed according to cultural preferences. The corpus consists of 320 opinion columns totaling 273, 773 words, selected from four elite newspapers. The columns were searched electronically using concordancing software programs and then all the metadiscourse devices were examined qualitatively in context to determine their actual functions. All frequencies reported have been normalized and tested statistically. Results confirmed that there were 33, 854 metadiscourse tokens in the corpus, an average of 105. 49 occurrences per column or 3 elements of metadiscourse in every 25 words in each of the two corpora. Findings revealed both male and female columnists showed more similarities than differences in their overall use of metadiscourse especially in the interactive dimension. In spite of that, some significant gender-based variations in the use of interactional dimension of metadiscourse were also found. Female columnists used more self-mentions, engagement markers, adjectives, pronouns, and adverbs than their male counterparts, and tended to adopt a personalized engaging subjective style that relies on personal experiences. In contrast, male columnists used more hedges, verbs, numerical terms, and swear words, and tended to adopt a more factual informative style. In addition, results revealed that both columnists made use of interactive and <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> and some statistically significant variations in the amount and type of metadiscourse were reported. The study concludes that metadiscourse is a useful concept in the discourse of opinion columns and that gender is a significant source of variation that influences the linguistic and the stylistic choices of opinion columnists along with the genre’s conventions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} {{challenges}} faced by non-native researchers writing their scientific papers for publication in English. To publish in peer-reviewed international mainstream journals, researchers {{should be able to}} write in a genre-specific and persuasive manner. Academic writing requires explicit organization of texts, caution in making claims, signposting connections, and creating coherence and clarity in the text. The research article (RA) is a key genre of scientific publishing with a special communicative and rhetorical structure. The structure and language of the RA partly depend on the disciplinary knowledge-making practices and writing conventions applied in the field of research. The subjects of this study were doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in Materials Science at Tampere University of Technology (TUT), all of them non-native speakers of English. The objective of the study was twofold: first, to explore the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, challenges, and wishes for further training of the researchers writing in English; second, to examine how they employed certain linguistic devices to present the results of their research. The study applied two methods to answer the research questions: an e-mailed questionnaire and a descriptive analysis of published sample RAs written by the subjects. Swales’ Create-A-Research-Space (CARS) model for RA introductions and Hyland’s model of interactive and <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> were used as investigative tools to study certain rhetorical and textual features. On the whole, the TUT respondents showed a positive attitude to writing in English. Approximately half of them felt disadvantaged in writing RAs when compared to native speakers. The researchers considered “creating text flow and coherence to make my reasoning easy to understand” and “expressing my interpretation of the results with an appropriate degree of confidence” most challenging. Both skills involve the ability to write reader-friendly and professionally convincing text. Most sample RAs followed the 3 -move rhetorical pattern of the CARS model. Most of the metadiscoursal items were interactive, which is characteristic of quantitative RAs in natural sciences and engineering. Overall, the writers employed a rather limited selection of metadiscoursal devices. Since proofreaders often pay attention only to obvious lexico-grammatical mistakes in scientific papers, an interactive system with early-stage consultation between writers and proofreaders can help to create persuasive and genre-specific argumentation. Discipline-based writing instruction and materials on textual and rhetorical organization beyond the sentence level could help writers to construct coherent texts...|$|E
40|$|Los foros de viajeros constituyen un tipo de encuentro de servicios en forma de ciber-género. Las interacciones entre autor y lector son cruciales para el propósito comunicativo: ofrecer opinión positiva o negativa de viajes, destinos y alojamientos, en respuesta a preguntas concretas formuladas por los propios usuarios. Su objetivo no solo tiene que ver con la persuasión sino también con la evaluación, desde la solidaridad. El resultado es un texto dialógico de dos o varios participantes (White, 2003; Martin & White 2005; Hyland, 2008). Los marcadores interpersonales (Hyland & Tse, 2004; Hyland, 2008) son herramientas que intervienen directamente a través de la voz del autor y del lector para construir este discurso y este tipo de comunicación. Aquí se estudia este fenómeno comunicativo comparando foros de viajeros en inglés y español y extrayendo sus similitudes y diferencias, con objeto de caracterizar este ciber-género desde un punto de vista nuevo, como es el metadiscurso interpersonal. Travelers’ forums {{constitute}} {{one type}} of service encounter cybergenre where interactions between writer and audience are crucial to gear the text towards its ultimate purpose, i. e. give a positive or negative opinion about trips, destinations {{and a number of}} touristic products, as well as answering specific travelers’ queries. Their ultimate goal, then, does not only relate to persuasion but also to evaluation and solidarity, and the resulting dialogic communication can be both diaglossic and heteroglossic (White, 2003; Martin & White 2005; Hyland, 2008), depending on how many voices intervene. Interpersonal markers (Hyland & Tse, 2004; Hyland, 2008) are tools that directly apply to this end and through which the different intervening voices position themselves socially and construe their discourse through stance, engagement, or a blend of both. This is achieved by combining the exposition of factual information with a personal interaction with the intended readers, that in their turn respond, thus creating a diaglossic or heteroglossic discourse. This phenomenon has been analysed by a number of authors (Hunston, 1994; Hyland, 1998, 2004, 2008; Latour & Woolgar, 1979; Skelton, 1997) mostly interested in academic writing. We intend now to explore a radically different discipline, that of tourism in English and Spanish, where the <b>interactional</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> framework has already provided a number of works (Suau Jiménez & Dolón Herrero, 2007; Mapelli, 2008; Suau Jiménez 2012 a, 2012 b) that have shown relevant cross-cultural differences in the way writer and reader deploy their voices to attain persuasion in promotional genres. The study of travelers’ forums in English and Spanish constitute a new challenge since dialogic engagement is inherent to this genre, with several functions and purposes intertwined –persuasion, solidarity, evaluation-. The expected results are that cross-cultural and cross-linguistic differences between English and Spanish might be confirmed, since metadiscursive interaction is strongly stemmed on socio-linguistic roots. The new generic variable –travelers’ forums- may unveil new uses in the way writer and audience relate through interactional markers to construe their voices and reach persuasion, evaluation and solidarity...|$|E
40|$|Esta tese investiga sob uma perspectiva retÃrico-contrastiva, os usos e as funÃÃes das marcas metadiscursivas de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica (hedges), em artigos de pesquisa, considerados, aqui, textos especializados (HOFFMANN, 1998), pertencentes ao contexto comunicativo: especialista-especialista (PEARSON, 1998), produzidos por autores (as) brasileiros (as) e alemÃes (as). Para cumprir tal objetivo, a pesquisa intenciona {{responder}} aos seguintes questionamentos: (a) qual a freqÃÃncia das estratÃgias de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica utilizadas nas seÃÃes introduÃÃo e conclusÃo? (b) qual a relaÃÃo existente entre o nÃmero de marcas metadiscursivas de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica em cada subcorpus e as caracterÃsticas retÃricas de cada seÃÃo em anÃlise? (c) qual a freqÃÃncia dos itens lÃxico-gramaticais que realizam as marcas metadiscursivas de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica em cada subcorpus. Para tanto, parte-se do pressuposto de que textos pertencentes a um mesmo gÃnero discursivo, porÃm escritos em lÃnguas distintas apresentam diferenÃas retÃricas marcantes. Tais diferenÃas no discurso acadÃmico escrito podem ser descritas pelo uso das marcas de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica como elemento discursivo-pragmÃtico caracterizador de um âmodus dicendiâ de uma determinada Ãrea do conhecimento, no caso, a Medicina. Para a investigaÃÃo dessas marcas de atenuaÃÃo, selecionamos um corpus composto por 120 artigos de pesquisa em Medicina de periÃdicos nacionais e internacionais, coletados, no site de periÃdicos da CAPES, escritos em lÃngua alemÃ e em lÃngua portuguesa. O referido corpus de estudo compÃe-se de: 60 artigos em Medicina escritos em portuguÃs e 60 artigos escritos em lÃngua alemÃ, divididos em dois subcorpora, a saber, Corpus 1 - Medicina AlemÃo, composto por dois subcorpora: (i) Medicina AlemÃo IntroduÃÃo (MAI) e (ii) Medicina-AlemÃo DiscussÃo (MAD), Corpus 2 - Medicina PortuguÃs, com dois subcorpora: (i) Medicina PortuguÃs IntroduÃÃo (MPI) e (ii) Medicina PortuguÃs DiscussÃo (MPD). Na anÃlise e tratamento dos dados, utilizamos os princÃpios metodolÃgicos da LingÃÃstica de Corpus, aplicando seu carÃter instrumental. Para avaliar os dados dessa pesquisa, utilizamos o programa computacional de anÃlise lingÃÃstica, WordSmith Tools (SCOTT, 1997), versÃo 3. 0, as ferramentas Wordlist e o Concord. Para investigar e analisar os usos e as funÃÃes das marcas metadiscursivas de atenuaÃÃo, sob uma perspectiva do Metadiscurso Interacional (HYLAND, 2005) e da RetÃrica Intercultural (CONNOR, 2008), tendo em vista os corpora em anÃlise, propomos um modelo classificatÃrio, em conformidade com as taxonomias propostas por Hyland (2005), Cabrera (2004) e MartÃn-MartÃn (2008). Conforme os resultados, a seÃÃo de discussÃo concentra o maior nÃmero de ocorrÃncias das marcas de atenuaÃÃo retÃrica nas duas lÃnguas, seguida da seÃÃo de introduÃÃo. Ambas apresentam um elevado nÃmero de ocorrÃncias das estratÃgias de indeterminaÃÃo (as expressÃes epistÃmicas, como verbos modais, lexicais, semi-auxiliares) e os adjetivos/advÃrbios modais,) e desagentivaÃÃo (as expressÃes impessoais, voz passiva). A partir desses resultados, conclui-se que os autores tanto em portuguÃs como em alemÃo nos artigos de pesquisa na Medicina fazem uso na mesma proporÃÃo de estratÃgias de atenuaÃÃo para atender aos propÃsitos comunicativos do gÃnero textual-artigo de pesquisa, como tambÃm pela posiÃÃo que ocupam na comunidade acadÃmica e pela relaÃÃo interpessoal que desejam estabelecer com a audiÃncia. Essa pesquisa contribui para minimizar a lacuna existente com relaÃÃo aos estudos sÃcio-retÃricos das marcas metadiscursivas de atenuaÃÃo, sob uma perspectiva contrastiva, em corpora escritos em portuguÃs e alemÃo de artigos acadÃmicos na Medicina. This thesis investigates, from a rhetoric-contrastive perspective, {{the uses}} {{and functions of}} rhetoric mitigation metadiscursive marks (here hedging devices) in research articles produced by Brazilian and German authors and understood as specialized texts (HOFFMANN, 1998), inserted in the expert-expert communicative context (PEARSON, 1998). To achieve this goal, the present study aims at answering the following questions: (a) how often are hedging strategies employed in the introduction and conclusion sections? (b) {{what is the relationship}} between the number of hedges in each subcorpus and the rhetorical characteristics of each analyzed section? (c) how often do the lexico-grammatical items performing the role of hedges appear in each subcorpus? The starting point for the investigation was the assumption that texts belonging to the same genre but written in different languages present striking rhetorical distinctions. Such differences in academic writing can be described by the use of hedges as discourse-pragmatic elements which characterize the "modus dicendi" of a given knowledge area; in the present case, Medicine. A corpus of 120 research articles from national and international medical journals was built, including texts written in German and Portuguese; the articles were collected from the CAPES periodics website. This corpus consists of 60 Medicine articles written in Portuguese and 60 articles written in German, divided into two subcorpora, namely, Corpus 1 : Medicine-German and Corpus 2 : Medicine-Portuguese. The former is made of two subcorpora, (i) German Medicine Introduction (MAI) and (ii) German Medicine Discussion (MAD); the latter is also subdivided into two parts, (i) Portuguese Medicine Introduction (MPI) and (ii) Portuguese Medicine Discussion (MPD). The data were analyzed and processed in accordance with the Corpus Linguistics methodological principles, in an instrumental application of its methods. The data were treated with the help of a linguistic analysis software called WordSmith Tools (SCOTT, 1997), version 3. 0, especially the Wordlist and Concord tools. In order to investigate and analyze the uses and functions of the hedges, from the <b>Interactional</b> <b>Metadiscourse</b> (HYLAND, 2005) and Intercultural Rhetoric (CONNOR, 2008) perspectives, given the corpora collected, we have proposed a classification model, in accordance with the taxonomies proposed by Hyland (2005), Cabrera (2004) and MartÃn-MartÃn (2008). The results of the analysis have pointed to the occurrence of a largest number of hedges, in both languages, in the discussion section of the articles, followed by the introduction section. Both present a high number of occurrences of indetermination devices (epistemic expressions, such as modal verbs, lexical verbs, semi-auxiliary verbs, and modal adjectives / adverbs) and disagentivization (impersonal expressions, passive voice). We can therefore conclude that the authors of the Medicine research articles, both those in Portuguese and in German, employ the same amount of hedges in order to achieve the communicative purposes of the research paper genre, given the position the authors occupy in the academic community and the interpersonal relationship they wish to establish with the audience. This research contributes to minimize the gap in the studies on hedging under a contrastive perspective, based on corpora of scholarly texts in Portuguese and German in the Medicine area...|$|E
