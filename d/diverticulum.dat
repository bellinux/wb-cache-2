5|$|From there, the pharynx passes {{food to the}} esophagus, {{which could}} be just a simple tube passing {{it on to the}} crop and proventriculus, and then onward to the midgut, as in most insects. Alternately, the foregut may expand into a very {{enlarged}} crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a <b>diverticulum,</b> or fluid-filled structure, as in some Diptera species.|$|E
5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral <b>diverticulum)</b> would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the <b>diverticulum</b> next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of people with a Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> are asymptomatic. An asymptomatic Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> is called a silent Meckel's <b>diverticulum.</b> If symptoms do occur, they typically appear {{before the age of}} two years.|$|E
25|$|Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> {{was first}} {{explained}} by Fabricius Hildanus {{in the sixteenth}} century and later named after Johann Friedrich Meckel, who described the embryological origin of this type of <b>diverticulum</b> in 1809.|$|E
25|$|In Meckel's <b>diverticulum,</b> the {{proximal}} part of vitelline duct fails to regress and involute, which remains as {{a remnant of}} variable length and location. The solitary <b>diverticulum</b> lies on the antimesenteric border of the ileum (opposite to the mesenteric attachment) and extends into the umbilical cord of the embryo. The left and right vitelline arteries originate from the primitive dorsal aorta, and travel with the vitelline duct. The right becomes the superior mesenteric artery that supplies a terminal branch to the <b>diverticulum,</b> while the left involutes. Having its own blood supply, Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> is susceptible to obstruction or infection.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation in the ileal <b>diverticulum</b> has {{symptoms}} that mimic appendicitis, therefore its diagnosis is of clinical importance. Detailed {{knowledge of the}} pathophysiological properties is essential {{in dealing with the}} life-threatening complications of Meckel's <b>diverticulum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the <b>diverticulum</b> can mimic {{symptoms}} of appendicitis, i.e., periumbilical tenderness and intermittent crampy abdominal pain. Perforation of the inflamed <b>diverticulum</b> {{can result in}} peritonitis. Diverticulitis can also cause adhesions, leading to intestinal obstruction.|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} {{asymptomatic}} Meckel's <b>diverticulum,</b> some recommend that {{a search for}} Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> should be conducted in every case of appendectomy/laparotomy done for acute abdomen, and if found, Meckel's diverticulectomy or resection should be performed to avoid secondary complications arising from it.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> are {{diagnosed}} when complications manifest or incidentally in unrelated {{conditions such as}} laparotomy, laparoscopy or contrast study of the small intestine. Classic presentation in adults includes intestinal obstruction and inflammation of the <b>diverticulum</b> (diverticulitis). Painless rectal bleeding most commonly occurs in toddlers.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifetime}} {{risk for a}} person with Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> to develop certain complications is about 4–6%. Gastrointestinal bleeding, peritonitis or intestinal obstruction may occur in 15–30% of symptomatic patients (Table 1). Only 6.4% of all complications requires surgical treatment; and untreated Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> has a mortality rate of 2.5–15%.|$|E
25|$|Strangulation of the <b>diverticulum</b> in the {{obturator}} foramen.|$|E
25|$|Where <b>diverticulum</b> {{contains}} embryonic {{remnants of}} mucosa of other tissue types.|$|E
25|$|As the vitelline duct {{is made up}} of {{pluripotent}} cell lining, Meckel’s <b>diverticulum</b> may harbor abnormal tissues, containing embryonic remnants of other tissue types. Jejunal, duodenal mucosa or Brunner's tissue were each found in 2% of ectopic cases. Heterotopic rests of gastric mucosa and pancreatic tissue are seen in 60% and 6% of cases respectively. Heterotopic means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location. Inflammation of this Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> may mimic appendicitis. Therefore, during appendectomy, ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel's <b>diverticulum,</b> if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix.|$|E
25|$|Pain, {{bleeding}} or perforation of the bowel at the <b>diverticulum</b> may result.|$|E
25|$|A Meckel's <b>diverticulum,</b> a true {{congenital}} <b>diverticulum,</b> is {{a slight}} bulge in the small intestine present at birth and a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct (also called the vitelline duct or yolk stalk). It {{is the most common}} malformation of the gastrointestinal tract and is present in approximately 2% of the population, with males more frequently experiencing symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Tumors in Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> {{may cause}} bleeding, acute {{abdominal}} pain, gastrointestinal obstruction, perforation or intussusception.|$|E
25|$|In {{asymptomatic}} patients, Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> {{is often}} diagnosed as an incidental finding during laparoscopy or laparotomy.|$|E
25|$|Association {{with the}} mesodiverticular band {{attaching}} to the <b>diverticulum</b> tip where torsion has occurred, causing inflammation and ischaemia.|$|E
25|$|Littre's hernia: a hernia {{involving}} a Meckel's <b>diverticulum.</b> It {{is named after}} the French anatomist Alexis Littré (1658–1726).|$|E
25|$|Following {{perforation}} by trauma or ingested {{foreign material}} e.g. stalk of vegetable, seeds or fish/chicken bone that become lodged in Meckel's <b>diverticulum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> {{is located}} in the distal ileum, usually within 60–100cm (2feet) of the ileocecal valve. This blind segment or small pouch is about 3–6cm (2inch) long and may have a greater lumen {{diameter}} than that of the ileum. It runs antimesenterically and has its own blood supply. It is a remnant of the connection from the yolk sac to the small intestine present during embryonic development. It is a true <b>diverticulum,</b> consisting of all 3 layers of the bowel wall which are mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fourth}} week of embryological development, the stomach rotates. The stomach, {{originally}} {{lying in the}} midline of the embryo, rotates so that its body is on the left. This rotation also affects {{the part of the}} gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become the duodenum. By the end of the fourth week, the developing duodenum begins to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the hepatic <b>diverticulum,</b> which will go on to become the biliary tree. Just below this is a second outpouching, known as the cystic <b>diverticulum,</b> that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.|$|E
25|$|Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> {{occurs in}} about 2% of the population. Prevalence in males is 3–5 {{times higher than}} in females. Only 2% of cases are symptomatic, which usually {{presents}} among children {{at the age of}} 2.|$|E
25|$|Osler's {{syndrome}} is a syndrome of recurrent episodes of colic pain, with typical radiation to back, cold shiverings and fever; {{due to the}} presence in Vater’s <b>diverticulum</b> of a free-moving gallstone which {{is larger than the}} orifice.|$|E
25|$|The vitelline vessels remnant {{that connects}} the <b>diverticulum</b> to the {{umbilicus}} may form a fibrous or twisting band (volvulus), trapping the small intestine and causing obstruction. Localised periumbilical pain may be experienced in the right lower quadrant (like appendicitis).|$|E
25|$|Bleeding of the <b>diverticulum</b> is {{most common}} in young children, {{especially}} in males who are less than 2 years of age. Symptoms may include bright red blood in stools (hematochezia), weakness, abdominal tenderness or pain, and even anaemia in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Pertechnetate is {{actively}} accumulated and secreted by the mucoid {{cells of the}} gastric mucosa, and therefore, technetate(VII) radiolabeled with Tc99m is injected into the body when looking for ectopic gastric tissue as is found in a Meckel's <b>diverticulum</b> with Meckel's Scans.|$|E
25|$|Acute disease {{might include}} infections such as oesophagitis, trauma caused {{ingestion}} of corrosive substances, or rupture of veins such as oesophageal varices, Boerhaave syndrome or Mallory-Weiss tears. Chronic diseases might include congenital {{diseases such as}} Zenker's <b>diverticulum</b> and esophageal webbing, and oesophageal motility disorders including the nutcracker oesophagus, achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm, and oesophageal stricture.|$|E
25|$|From there, the pharynx passes {{food to the}} esophagus, {{which could}} be just a simple tube passing {{it on to the}} crop and proventriculus, and then on ward to the midgut, as in most insects. Alternately, the foregut may expand into a very {{enlarged}} crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a <b>diverticulum,</b> or fluid filled structure, as in some Diptera species.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with these}} {{misplaced}} gastric cells may experience peptic ulcers as a consequence. Therefore, other tests such as colonoscopy and screenings for bleeding disorders should be performed, and angiography {{can assist in}} determining the location and severity of bleeding. Colonoscopy might be helpful to rule out other sources of bleeding {{but it is not}} used as an identification tool. Angiography might identify brisk bleeding in patients with Meckel's <b>diverticulum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{upper surface}} of the tongue is called the dorsum, and is divided by a groove into {{symmetrical}} halves by the median sulcus. The foramen cecum {{marks the end of}} this division (at about 2.5cm from the root of the tongue) {{and the beginning of the}} terminal sulcus. The foramen cecum is also the point of attachment of the thyroglossal duct and is formed during the descent of the thyroid <b>diverticulum</b> in embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|In the {{classical}} age Caieta, {{famous for its}} lovely and temperate climate, like the neighbouring Formia and Sperlonga, was a tourist resort and site of the seaside villas of many important and rich characters of Rome. Like the other Roman resorts, Caieta {{was linked to the}} capital of the Empire by Via Appia and its end trunk Via Flacca (or Valeria), through an opposite <b>diverticulum</b> or by-road. Its port was of great importance in trade and in war, and was restored under Emperor Antoninus Pius. Among its antiquities is the mausoleum of Lucius Munatius Plancus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the duct persists, and forms the tube of the epididymis, the ductus deferens and the {{ejaculatory}} duct, while the seminal vesicle arises {{during the third}} month as a lateral <b>diverticulum</b> from its hinder end. A {{large part of the}} head end of the mesonephros atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the testis; while the posterior tubules are represented by the ductuli aberrantes, and by the paradidymis, which is sometimes found in front of the spermatic cord above the head of the epididymis.|$|E
25|$|The toothless {{mouth is}} small and terminal, ending in a pointed snout. As in related {{families}} (e.g. Argentinidae), an epibranchial or crumenal organ is present behind the fourth gill arch. This organ—analogous to the gizzard—consists of a small <b>diverticulum</b> wherein the gill rakers insert and interdigitate {{for the purpose of}} grinding up ingested material. The living body of most species is a dark brown, covered in large, silvery imbricate scales, but these are absent in Dolichopteryx, leaving the body itself a transparent white. In all species, a variable number of dark melanophores colour the muzzle, ventral surface, and midline.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many fish}} {{are capable of}} hearing, the lagena is, at best, a short <b>diverticulum</b> of the saccule, and appears to have no role in {{sensation}} of sound. Various clusters of hair cells within the inner ear may instead be responsible; for example, bony fish contain a sensory cluster called the macula neglecta in the utricle that may have this function. Although fish have neither an outer nor a middle ear, sound may still be transmitted to the inner ear through {{the bones of the}} skull, or by the swim bladder, parts of which often lie close by in the body.|$|E
