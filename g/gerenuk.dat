5|$|Wildebeest are {{the most}} {{commonly}} taken medium-sized ungulate prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with zebra and Thomson's gazelles coming close behind. Cape buffalo are rarely attacked {{due to differences in}} habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to be taken on occasion. In Kruger National Park, blue wildebeest, cape buffalo, Burchell's zebra, greater kudu and impala are the spotted hyena's most important prey, while giraffe, impala, wildebeest and zebra are its major food sources in the nearby Timbavati area. Springbok and kudu are the main prey in Namibia's Etosha National Park, and springbok in the Namib. In the southern Kalahari, gemsbok, wildebeest and springbok are the principal prey. In Chobe, the spotted hyena's primary prey consists of migratory zebra and resident impala. In Kenya's Masai Mara, 80% of the spotted hyena's prey consists of topi and Thomson's gazelle, save for during the four-month period when zebra and wildebeest herds migrate to the area. Bushbuck, suni and buffalo are the dominant prey items in the Aberdare Mountains, while Grant's gazelle, <b>gerenuk,</b> sheep, goats and cattle are likely preyed upon in northern Kenya. In west Africa, it is thought that the spotted hyena is primarily a scavenger, but will occasionally attack domestic stock and medium-size antelopes in some areas. In Cameroon, it is common for spotted hyenas to feed on small antelopes like kob, but may also scavenge on reedbuck, kongoni, buffalo, giraffe, African elephant, topi and roan antelope carcasses. Records indicate that spotted hyenas in Malawi feed on medium to large-sized ungulates such as waterbuck and impala. In Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, spotted hyenas primarily prey on wildebeest, followed by buffalo, zebra, impala, giraffe, reedbuck and kongoni. In Uganda, it is thought that the species primarily preys on birds and reptiles, while in Zambia it is primarily a scavenger.|$|E

5000|$|The Antilopinae are a {{subfamily}} of Bovidae. The gazelles, blackbucks, springboks, <b>gerenuks,</b> dibatags, and Central Asian gazelles {{are often}} referred to as [...] "true antelopes", and are usually classified as the only representatives of the Antilopinae. True antelopes occur in much of Africa and Asia, with the highest concentration of species occurring in East Africa in Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania. The saigas and Tibetan antelopes are related to true antelopes (Antilopinae) and goats (Caprinae), but often placed in their own subfamily, Saiginae. These animals inhabit much of central and western Asia. The dwarf antelopes are sometimes placed in a separate subfamily, Neotraginae, and live entirely in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|R
50|$|Not {{surprisingly}} {{for animals}} with long, slender yet powerful legs, many antelopes have long strides and can run fast. Some (e.g. klipspringer) are also adapted to inhabiting rock koppies and crags. Both dibatags and <b>gerenuks</b> habitually {{stand on their}} two hind legs to reach acacia and other tree foliage. Different antelope have different body types, which can affect movement. Duikers are short, bush-dwelling antelope that can pick through dense foliage and dive into the shadows rapidly. Gazelles and springbok {{are known for their}} speed and leaping abilities. Even larger antelope, such as nilgai, elands, and kudus, are capable of jumping 2.4 m or greater, although their running speed is restricted by their greater mass.|$|R

25|$|The Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari is a 20-minute, one-mile, narrated {{monorail}} ride, which travels {{around the}} watering hole (hippopotamus) rain forest (okapi), mountain (Nubian ibex), woodlands (Grévy's zebra), river (waterbuck, greate white pallicans, Goliath herons, blue cranes), arid desert (scimitar-horned oryx, addra gazelle), semi-arid desert (addax, gemsbok, ostrich) and bush (<b>gerenuk,</b> red-crowned cranes, greater kudu, Thomson's gazelle, marabou storks) exhibits. The monorail features aerial {{views of the}} Simmons Hippo Outpost, Chimpanzee Forest, Nile crocodile, and Penguin Cove exhibits, which are also accessible via the Nature Trail. The monorail originally opened in 1990 but {{after two decades of}} use and over a million passengers, the attraction began to show its age with aging infrastructure and several electrical outages that left passengers stranded on the tour. The final incident in August 2014 prompted zoo officials to shut down the attraction for evaluation. Following the evaluation the DZS decided a $3 million renovation was in order. On March 25, 2016, the Monorail Safari reopened as the Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari featuring a new sound system, an upgraded station, air-conditioning, upgraded mechanical and electrical components and new graphics on the individual cars.

40|$|Several bovid species kept at Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation were {{evaluated}} for neonatal body mass development {{as well as}} their survival rate. Of special interest was the comparison of these parameters between hand- and parent-reared animals. For body mass development, a general pattern could be found, showing weight development stagnation shortly after birth, followed by linear growth. Post natal body mass of parent-reared animals and its development was in all 3 compared species found to be above hand-reared animals. Hand-rearing might be an effect of, not the reason behind this phenomenon. Survival rates in hand-reared individuals were higher than in parent-reared, not only as neonates but also as adults. Especially Beira antelopes (Dorcatragus megalotis) and Speke´s gazelles (Gazella spekei) profited from hand-rearing, whereas the effect on <b>Gerenuks</b> (Litocranius walleri) and Phillip´s dikdiks (Madoqua saltiana phillipsi) was smaller.

40|$|The {{condition}} of ectopic pregnancy is presented from {{different points of}} view, bringing out physiological explanations for its occurrence in primates and the striking absence in other mammals. Ectopic pregnancies have been described in several animal species such as cats, sheep, cows, horses <b>gerenuks,</b> pigs, hamsters, rats, rabbits, marmosets, baboons, squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys and rhesus macaque. Methotrexate (MTX) has anticancer antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, immunosuppressive, antimitotic embryotoxic and teratogenic effects. Methotrexate has species-specific effects. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the medical treatment outcome of ectopic pregnancy by local administration of methotrexate and the adverse effects of increasing levels of MTX on the epithelium of the Fallopian tube as viewed by light microscopy. We treated patients with local and systemic regimen of methotrexate. Local applications were performed by direct injection of 0, 5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg methotrexate into the amniotic sac under sonographic control. Fallopian tubes were removed in patients with methotrexate treatment failure. The histological features we observed in the Fallopian tube were similar in all groups. In particular, histological findings showed necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate that was not quantitatively parallel to the increase in MTX dose. Fallopian tubes in human pregnancy could be resistant to the influence of MTX...|$|R
5000|$|The final {{programme}} documents the Rift Valley's savannah ecosystem. In the rain {{shadow of the}} Ruwenzori Mountains, rainfall is sporadic. Acacias are the only trees that can survive the prolonged droughts, but their proliferation is curbed by browsing animals. Giraffes, <b>gerenuks</b> and dik-diks are all specialist acacia eaters, but elephants are the true architects of the landscape. On the plains, grass is the dominant vegetation, sustaining the largest grazing herds on earth. Antelopes use the long grass to conceal their young from lions, cheetahs and other predators. A unique starlight camera enables filming to continue after dark using available light, revealing hitherto unseen behaviour. In the pitch blackness, three lion cubs practise their hunting skills as their mother digs warthog piglets from their burrow. Hippos roam the grasslands by night, but must return to water before sunrise. At the isolated pools of Mzima, stranded hippos starve to death during the prolonged drought of 2009. Those animals that can follow the rains of the Rift Valley on seasonal migrations. Olive baboons {{are one of the}} few primates adapted to the savannah, but even they must return to the safety of the trees at night.
