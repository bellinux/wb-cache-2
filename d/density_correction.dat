40|$|Abstract. Current Lagrangian {{particle}} dispersion models, used {{to simulate}} the dispersion of passive tracers in the turbulent planetary boundary layer (PBL), assume that the density is constant within the PBL. In deep PBLs, where the density at the boundary-layer top may be lower by more than 20 % than at the surface, this assumption leads to errors in the tracer concentrations {{on the order of}} 10 %. In the presence of a vertical wind shear, this also leads to inaccurate calculations of the horizontal tracer transport. To remove this deficiency, a Langevin equation is presented that contains a <b>density</b> <b>correction</b> term. The effect of the <b>density</b> <b>correction</b> is studied using data from a large-scale tracer experiment.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{developed}} for deriving first order <b>density</b> <b>corrections</b> to gas transport coefficients using the time correlation function formalism. In a moderately dense gas, both kinetic and potential {{contributions to the}} flux are significant. This article extends the projection operator technique developed in our previous work for purely kinetic flux operators [J. Chem.

The method introduces two projection operators, one for each of the kinetic and potential flux contributions, with the consequence that the calculation of a transport coefficient involves a matrix associated with the two flux contributions, and the inversion of this matrix. The binary collision expansion of the resolvent in each of the matrix elements allows a transport coefficient at moderate gas densities to be expressed in terms of integrals over functions of the intermolecular potential.

Material and methodsCIRS® 062 phantom was used to calculate the Hounsfield Unit using 80, 120 and 140 kV. Four CT calibration curves were implanted in the Eclipse® TPS. Forty-two irradiation fields for 4 patients with lung cancer were included and analysed. The patients were treated with 3 -dimensional radiation therapy. For each patient, 3 treatment plans were generated using exactly the same beam configuration. In plan 1, the dose was calculated using the Modified Batho (MB) method. In plan 2, the dose was calculated using the Batho power law (BPL) method. In plan 3, the dose was calculated using the Equivalent Tissue Air Ratio (ETAR) method. To evaluate the treatment plans computed by the three methods, the monitor units, dose volume histograms, conformity index, homogeneity index, planning target volumes conformity index, geometrical index and 2 D gamma index were compared. The statistical analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon signed rank test. ResultsThe three <b>density</b> <b>correction</b> methods in plans 1, 2 and 3 using tested curves produced a difference less than 1 % for MUs and DVH. Wilcoxon test showed a statically significant difference for MUs using ETAR method with calibration curves based on 80 and 120 kV. There was no significant difference for the quality indices between plan 1, 2 and 3, (P > 0. 05), but a significant difference for the planning target volumes conformity index between plans 1, 2 and 3 (P < 0. 05) was observed. The 2 D gamma analysis showed that 100 % of pixels had gamma ≤ 1.
