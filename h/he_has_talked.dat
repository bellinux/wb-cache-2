500|$|Thrive was {{recorded}} at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with producer Mark A. Miller. According to lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the idea behind}} Thrive came from the student ministry he is involved in. As a youth pastor, Hall frequently uses Psalms 1, which metaphorically compares {{the concept of a}} righteous man to a prosperous tree planted by a river. Hall said that many people <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> with are simply surviving, which he feels contrasts with this — he felt that, although hard times can come upon anyone, people are not put in these situations to simply survive through them, but rather to thrive through the adversity. Using the metaphor, Hall noted that, if one were to pull away all the dirt from around a tree, one would find roots digging into the ground in addition to the limbs of the tree reaching out. Hall elaborated that [...] "you need to get your strength from God; you don’t get it on your own. If you’re all limbs, the thorns of life will knock you over. You need to dig your roots in and let God reach out through you". Accordingly, half of the record focuses on 'reaching out', while the other half focuses on 'digging deep'. Hall described the record as being [...] "an effort to draw a picture of what a believer, a follower of Jesus, would look like if they dug into their roots and understood God and themselves more, and then instead of trying to go be Christian for God, they just let God give them chances to be a Christian".|$|E

60|$|Lord Badgery's {{face had}} become {{positively}} animated. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> {{of a single}} subject for {{nearly a quarter of}} an hour.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Luce, during the 1960s, tried LSD and reported that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to God under its influence.|$|R
2500|$|Shajahan Khan, the {{shipping}} minister of Bangladesh, told Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> with environmental experts, {{and they said}} that there will likely be no major damage {{as a result of the}} oil spill. Researchers said that Khan's claim was [...] "unscientific and misleading".|$|E
2500|$|Ever since Reubens {{started giving}} {{interviews}} again after his 1991 arrest, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> {{about the two}} scripts he has written for future Pee-wee Herman films. Reubens once called his first script The Pee-wee Herman Story, describing it as a black comedy. He has also referred to the script as [...] "dark Pee-wee" [...] or [...] "adult Pee-wee", with the plot involving Pee-wee becoming famous as a singer after making a hit single and moving to Hollywood, where [...] "he does everything wrong and becomes a big jerk". Reubens further explained the film has many [...] "Valley of the Dolls moments". Reubens thought this script {{would be the first}} one to start production, but in 2006 Reubens announced he was to start filming his second script in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon is a {{born again}} Christian. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> about {{how in the}} early-1990s he got curious and {{followed}} some drivers to the weekly chapel one week, which is how he first started {{to learn more about}} God. During this time, Gordon kept verses of the Bible taped to his steering wheel. In 2004, Gordon stated he [...] "has a difficult time focusing on one particular faith." [...] When asked again in a 2015 Sports Illustrated magazine interview, he claimed: [...] "I wasn't brought up [...] It was something I got introduced to when I came into the Cup Series. I explored it and learned a lot from that experience. I feel it's helped make me a better person, but I choose to do it more privately now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> {{the matter}} over fully with James, {{and seems to}} have been advised by him. I can't {{understand}} James." ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Horne Fisher had {{considerably}} puzzled everybody {{with his}} new tone and attitude. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to the colonel about the military and mechanical arrangements, and displayed a remarkable knowledge both {{of the details of}} discipline and the technicalities of electricity. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to the clergyman, and shown an equally surprising knowledge of the religious and historical interests involved in the relic. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to the man who called himself a magician, and not only surprised but scandalized the company by an equally sympathetic familiarity with the most fantastic forms of Oriental occultism and psychic experiment. And in this last and least respectable line of inquiry he was evidently prepared to go farthest; he openly encouraged the magician, and was plainly prepared to follow the wildest ways of investigation in which that magus might lead him.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused for}} lack of breath, for indeed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> fast and volubly: Crystal's voice, cold and measured, broke in on the silence that ensued.|$|R
2500|$|He also {{invested}} in a shopping mall in Columbus, Ohio. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> about {{some of those who}} have helped him over the years in business: [...] "I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from Milton Friedman to Donald Trump... and now, Les Wexner and Warren Buffett. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!" [...] He has significant ownership in Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment firm. Schwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnold's Sports Festival, which he started in 1989 and is held annually in Columbus, Ohio. It is a festival that hosts thousands of international health and fitness professionals which has also expanded into a three-day expo. He also owns a movie production company called Oak Productions, Inc. and Fitness Publications, a joint publishing venture with Simon & Schuster.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And revenge,' added Mrs. Brown-Smith. 'I {{have heard}} of his bragging, the monster. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> about me. And I {{remember}} how he treated Violet Lebas.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose {{it should}} be Mr. Gimble, come to deal at last for that picture of mine that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> of buying so long," [...] exclaimed Valentine.|$|E
60|$|As he {{said those}} words, a little gleam of {{pleasure}} shot through Elma's eyes. Her painter hadn't forgotten her, then. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> much about her.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the same}} old priest with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen Hilda, at the confessional; the same with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> of her {{disappearance}} on meeting him in the street.|$|R
60|$|Anne might grieve, but {{she felt}} the {{gratification}} of being talked to by her uncle {{as a woman who}} could understand, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to her mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think his}} mind is made up to it. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> me over--we've had some deep discussions. Yes, I'm {{on the side of}} art!" [...] she ardently said.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt Ippegoo is right," [...] she said, with forced calmness, [...] "but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> of {{a message}} to Okiok. I dare say the wife of Okiok {{would like to hear}} what that message is." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{famous and}} popular Frenchman, Professor of Spectacular Astronomy, Camille Flammarion, affirms {{immortality}} because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> with departed souls {{who said that}} it was true. Yes, monsieur, but surely you know the rule about hearsay evidence. We Anglo-Saxons are very particular about that.|$|E
60|$|In those measurelessly long hot afternoons in {{the little}} shop at Wimblehurst <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> and dreamt of the Romance of Modern Commerce. Here, surely, was his romance come true.|$|R
60|$|He discoursed {{upon his}} schools and reading-rooms till the {{children}} came in, and then bade her good-bye, quite as if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> himself back into an every-day state of feeling.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{frowned and}} hesitated. When <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to Laura before, Stannard {{had called him}} away, but he thought she did not mean him to stay and he went off. When <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone Laura mused.|$|R
6000|$|... "The most obstinate fellow I {{ever knew}} in my life," [...] said Hampstead, laughing. [...] "And <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> my sister {{over to his}} own views." [...] Then he turned {{suddenly}} round to Marion, and asked her a question. [...] "Shall I go now, dearest?" [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|The {{famous and}} popular Frenchman, Professor of Spectacular Astronomy, Camille Flammarion, affirms {{immortality}} because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> with departed souls {{who said that}} it was true.

6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} right to deceive Mamma," [...] said Fanny. [...] "I know him well enough to be quite sure {{that he will not}} take the title, as he has no {{property}} to support it. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> it over with me again and again, and I agree with him altogether." ...|$|E
50|$|A staunch Old Believer, he {{supported}} the Moscow Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy and financed its leader Bishop Pafnuty (Ovchinnikov)'s visit to London where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talks</b> with Alexander Hertsen, Nikolai Ogaryov and Vasily Kelsiyev.|$|R
50|$|The {{subject of}} Aycock's speech was 'Universal Education'. After <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> {{for a few}} minutes, Aycock spoke the words: 'I <b>have</b> always <b>talked</b> about {{education}} -.' Here he stopped, threw up his hands, reeled backward, and fell dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got {{something}} to tell you, Alf," [...] he ses, arter they 'ad said [...] "How d'ye do?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>talked</b> about the weather until Alf was fair tired of it.|$|R
6000|$|Oddly enough, I {{slept in}} this house three days last year with Wilkie. Arthur has the bedroom I {{occupied}} then, and I have one two doors from it, and Gordon has the one between. Not only is he still with us, but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> of going on to Manchester, going on to London, and coming back with us to Darlington next Tuesday!!! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--it is just this. He {{has left}} us that bare {{that there is}} nothing left. And that, they say, isn't the worst of all,--though what can be worse than doing that, how is a woman to think? Parker was that soft, and he had that way with him of talking, that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> me and mine out of the very linen on our backs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] {{said the}} lad, [...] "is {{the kind of}} thing father would do; he's given to {{impractical}} idealism. There's a mine up in the barrens <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> about as long as I remember; but if he found it I believe he'd be content with that and sell the claim to any one for a few hundred dollars. Getting yourself frozen for an abstract idea isn't good business." ...|$|E
60|$|It salved a {{conscience}} on which that fellow's {{figure in the}} doorway weighed; besides, it was necessary, lest Fiorsen {{should go to the}} police. The rest must wait till <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> with Gyp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Critics!" [...] cried Wally. [...] "Well, I've {{just been}} talking to Alexander of the Times, {{and he said it}} was the best musical piece <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever seen and that all the other men <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to thought the same." ...|$|R
60|$|After <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> for a {{short time}} with Mistress De Courcy, Edgar went to the fencing-room with Sir Ralph, and they there put on helmets and quilted leather jerkins, with chains sewn on at the shoulders.|$|R
