50|$|The dam {{consists}} of a masonry dam about 2769 ft long extended on both sides by earthen banks, making a total length of about 3937 ft. There are 111 arched openings of 5 m span in the masonry dam. They can be closed by steel sluice-gates 16 ft high. The piers and arches are founded upon a masonry platform 87 ft wide by 10 ft thick. This platform is protected on its up-stream and down-stream sides by a continuous and impermeable line of cast iron tongued and grooved sheet-piling with cemented joints. This piling extends into the sand bed of the river {{to a depth of}} 23 ft below the upper surface of the platform and prevents it from being undermined. The river bed is protected against erosion for a width of 67 ft upstream by a stone paving laid on a puddle clay blanket to check infiltration, and on the downstream side for the same width by a stone paving having an <b>inverted</b> <b>filter</b> bed underneath, so that any springs that may be caused by the water above the sluices shall not carry sand with them from beneath the paving.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) {{established}} by the choroid plexus (CP) epithelium has been recognized as a potential entry site of immune cells into {{the central nervous system}} during immunosurveillance and neuroinflammation. The location of the choroid plexus impedes in vivo analysis of immune cell trafficking across the BCSFB. Thus, research on cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune cell migration across the BCSFB is largely limited to in vitro models. In addition to forming contact-inhibited epithelial monolayers that express adhesion molecules, the optimal in vitro model must establish a tight permeability barrier as this influences immune cell diapedesis. METHODS We compared cell line models of the mouse BCSFB derived from the Immortomouse(®) and the ECPC 4 line to primary mouse choroid plexus epithelial cell (pmCPEC) cultures for their ability to establish differentiated and tight in vitro models of the BCSFB. RESULTS We found that inducible cell line models established from the Immortomouse(®) or the ECPC 4 tumor cell line did not express characteristic epithelial proteins such as cytokeratin and E-cadherin and failed to reproducibly establish contact-inhibited epithelial monolayers that formed a tight permeability barrier. In contrast, cultures of highly-purified pmCPECs expressed cytokeratin and displayed mature BCSFB characteristic junctional complexes as visualized by the junctional localization of E-cadherin, β-catenin and claudins- 1, - 2, - 3 and - 11. pmCPECs formed a tight barrier with low permeability and high electrical resistance. When grown in <b>inverted</b> <b>filter</b> cultures, pmCPECs were suitable to study T cell migration from the basolateral to the apical side of the BCSFB, thus correctly modelling in vivo migration of immune cells from the blood to the CSF. CONCLUSIONS Our study excludes inducible and tumor cell line mouse models as suitable to study immune functions of the BCSFB in vitro. Rather, we introduce here an in vitro <b>inverted</b> <b>filter</b> model of the primary mouse BCSFB suited to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating immune cell migration across the BCSFB during immunosurveillance and neuroinflammation...|$|E

Woven Synthetic geotextiles are not environmental friendly and as imported these are often found to be costly. Jute geotextiles (JGT) are indigenous and have got enough potential for use as initial reinforcement and moisture absorption accelerator in road subgrades, for river bank protection via facilitating establishment of <b>inverted</b> <b>filter</b> formation and for top soil erosion control of exposed slope surfaces. By employing different modification techniques, JGTs may be converted into designed biodegradable material without changing its environmental friendly properties.

Far better crystallization results were obtained compared to ungelled media. However, there is a certain aging effect linked to filtration in gelled media.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} (1) {{the feasibility}} of preparing cell blocks by <b>inverted</b> <b>filter</b> sedimentation (IFS-CB) from endometrial samplings processed by the ThinPrep(r) (TP) technique (Cytyc Corp., Boxborough, Massachusetts, U. S. A.), and (2) the possibility of increasing the diagnostic accuracy of TP endometrial cytology by examining the tissue architecture as an adjunctive method of detecting endometrial lesions. Study Design: Three hundred one endometrial samplings were obtained, using the Endogyn endometrial device (Biogyn S. n. c., Italy), from perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. The endometrial samplings were collected in a vial with liquid fixative for the TP processing. One TP slide was prepared from each case. If adequate material remained in the vial after the TP slide preparation, it was processed for IFS-CB preparation. Results: IFS-CB preparation was processed in 263 cases (87 %) with adequate material. Diagnoses on IFS-CB preparations obtained by endometrial sampling matched those of the hysterectomy specimens. The addition of IFS-CB histology to the cytologic diagnosis by TP increased the diagnostic accuracy of endometrial cytology to 96. 3 % and 100 % for benign/atrophic endometrium and adenocarcinoma, respectively (p= 3 D 0. 39 and 0. 46). In hyperplasia without atypia and hyperplasia with atypia, the diagnostic accuracy increased significantly, to 96 % and 95. 3 %, respectively (p= 3 D 0. 037 and < 0. 001). Conclusion: This study illustrates the merit of linking TP cytology with direct endometrial sampling, including small tissue fragments and material adequate for IFS-CB preparation.

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle filter elements can be used directly as <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> elements, {{and the development of a}} new type of filter element is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> elements were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> elements, and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> elements are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet filter elements were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet filter element is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet filter element may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet filter elements could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet filter element manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the <b>inverted</b> candle <b>filter</b> system, and it will require more design development, filter element fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R

Thereby, the control is independent on wind speed measurements and the wind turbine itself is used as an anemometer. Tip speed ratio control is implemented by comparing the estimated tip speed ratio to a reference value and adjusting the DC voltage level accordingly.

The amplitude filters to go with the phase-inverting filters are developed as density variations on photographic films. The results of deblurring both linear motion blurred objects and out-of-focus pictures are presented and the degree of deblurring achieved is discussed.

Deblurring filters are also developed as binary holograms and the deblurred outputs presented and discussed. Loss of resolution in the output due to coarse amplitude quantization levels in a binary hologram filter is reduced by splitting the amplitude part of the filter into two halves and having only one of the halves encoded in the binary hologram filter while the other is produced as a photographic density variation.
