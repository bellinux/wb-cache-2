External attack refers to the territorial control, coercive force and political legitimacy that the illicit economy provides non-state armed actors. In this way, I contend that the fragmentation of state power by the illicit narcotics economy is two- fold. First, it diminishes state power in absolute terms - hindering the effective state function in terms of key institutions. Second the illicit narcotics reduces state power in relative terms - drug rents providing for the growth in reach and operational capacities of non-state power rivals when the state {{at the same time}} is losing its own...|$|E

A common job titles classification was used to analyse occupational risk factors. We conducted a standardized mortality ratio analysis based on age, gender and calendar-period-specific national mortality rates and explored the combined effect of job titles and duration through an <b>internal</b> Cox <b>regression</b> analysis. RESULTS: The number of deaths during the follow-up period was 430 (4. 7 %). Malignant neoplasm was the cause of 48. 1 % of deaths.

The readiness for interprofessional learning scale (RIPLS) is a well-known scale that can identify attitudinal barriers and variance across professions, which may affect educational interventions. Objectives: This study aims to translate the English RIPLS into Dutch and to test its reliability and validity. Methods: The scale was translated and back-translated by two pairs of people independently and tested for feasibility and comprehensibility. The translated scale was used with 219 general practitioners, 238 community nurses, and 53 palliative home-care nurses. Exploratory factor analysis was used to assess construct validity. Confirmatory factor analysis was done to generate a fit model.

The sampling technique that will be used in this research is convenient sampling with 100 respondents of the questionnaire. These questionnaire are based on; attributes of buying price, selling price, quality of the engine, materials, fuel consumption, designs, colours, baggage space, spare parts availability, sales’ service offers, simplicity of usage, and weight of the motorcycle Yamaha Mio. The result of double linear regression analysis discovers that the value of attitude is 0. 225, which means that when there is an increase on the variable of attitude, it is able to cause an increase on buying interest. The result of subjective norms’ analysis obtains values of 0. 167, which means that is an increase on subjective norms, it is able to cause an increase on buying interest ceteris paribus. This result of F test with Fcount > Ftable (17. 394 > 3. 07), and probability value is 0. 000 < 0. 05 thus it can be concluded that the variable of attitude of subjective norms simultaneously has got a significant influence to interest of purchase capacity. There is a significant influence between positions (X 1) to interest of buying motorcycle type Yamaha Mio within the citizens in Surakarta, this is based from “t” test result which is given by value of t count 3, 107, hence second hypothesis approved. The existence of significant influence between subjective norms to interest of buying motorcycle type Yamaha Mio within citizens in Surakarta, for significant norms is obtained by value of t count 3, 081, therefore subjective norms (X 2) significantly influence the interest (Y), hence hypothesis third approved.

40|$|In a {{sequential}} auction {{with multiple}} bidding agents, {{it is highly}} challenging to determine the ordering of the items to sell {{in order to maximize}} the revenue {{due to the fact that}} the autonomy and private information of the agents heavily influence the outcome of the auction. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we demonstrate how to apply machine learning techniques to solve the optimal ordering problem in sequential auctions. We learn regression models from historical auctions, which are subsequently used to predict the expected value of orderings for new auctions. Given the learned models, we propose two types of optimization methods: a black-box best-first search approach, and a novel white-box approach that maps learned models to integer linear programs (ILP) which can then be solved by any ILP-solver. Although the studied auction design problem is hard, our proposed optimization methods obtain good orderings with high revenues. Our second main contribution is the insight that the <b>internal</b> structure of <b>regression</b> models can be efficiently evaluated inside an ILP solver for optimization purposes. To this end, we provide efficient encodings of regression trees and linear regression models as ILP constraints. This new way of using learned models for optimization is promising. As the experimental results show, it significantly outperforms the black-box best-first search in nearly all settings. Comment: 37 pages. Working pape...|$|R

The primary aim {{of this study was to}} use a comprehensive measure of personality to investigate which personality traits are most predictive of four types of aberrant driving behaviour (Aggressive Violations, Ordinary Violations, Errors, Lapses) as indicated by the Manchester Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ). We recruited 285 young adults (67 % female) from a university in the southeastern US. They completed self-report questionnaires including the DBQ and the Personality Inventory for DSM- 5, which indexes 5 broad personality domains (Antagonism, Detachment, Disinhibition, Negative Affectivity, Psychoticism) and 25 specific trait facets.

We aimed to confirm {{the factor structure of}} a revised 50 -item version of the measure and test the specific hypotheses that positive beliefs about paranoia would predict frequency of paranoia, and that negative beliefs about paranoia would predict distress associated with paranoia. Method: 185 non-patient participants completed questionnaires assessing beliefs about paranoia, thought control, self-consciousness, anxiety, depression and paranoia. Results: The results showed that the original four-factor solution could not be replicated. Instead a three-factor solution comprising Negative Beliefs about Paranoia, Paranoia as a Survival Strategy, and Normalizing Beliefs was developed. The revised 18 -item measure showed good <b>internal</b> consistency. Stepwise <b>regression</b> analysis showed that, BaPS-negative beliefs accounted for 34 % of the variance with R- 2 of 0. 339, with a multiple R of 0. 585 in relation to frequency of paranoia. In relation to distress arising from paranoia, stepwise regression analysis showed that BaPS-negative beliefs accounted for 34 % of the variance with R 2 of 0. 339, with a multiple R of 0. 585. In both analyses, BaPS-Survival strategy showed a small but significant incremental increase in the variance accounted for in the overall model.

We used target exposures of 50 – 200  ms at the start of randomised step-ramp stimuli, followed by > 400  ms of target disappearance, to investigate the ability to sample target velocity and subsequently generate internally controlled responses. Subjects could appropriately grade gaze velocity to different target velocities without visual feedback, but responses were fully developed only when exposure was > 100  ms. Gaze velocities were sustained or even increased during target disappearance, especially when there was expectation of target reappearance, but they were always less than for controls, where the target was continuously visible. Gaze velocity remained in the direction of target motion throughout target extinction, implying that compensatory (VOR) responses were suppressed by <b>internal</b> drive mechanisms. <b>Regression</b> analysis revealed that the underlying compensatory response remained active, but with gain slightly less than unity (0. 85), resulting in head-free gaze responses that were very similar to, but slightly greater than, head-fixed.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} cancer and other diseases among workers engaged in aircraft manufacturing and potentially exposed to compounds containing chromate, trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and mixed solvents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort mortality study was conducted of workers employed for at least 1 year at a large aircraft manufacturing facility in California on or after 1 January 1960. The mortality experience of these workers was determined by examination of national, state, and company records {{to the end of}} 1996. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were evaluated comparing the observed numbers of deaths among workers with those expected in the general population adjusting for age, sex, race, and calendar year. The SMRs for 40 cause of death categories were computed for the total cohort and for subgroups defined by sex, race, position in the factory, work duration, year of first employment, latency, and broad occupational groups. Factory job titles were classified as to likely use of chemicals, and <b>internal</b> Poisson <b>regression</b> analyses were used to compute mortality risk ratios for categories of years of exposure to chromate, TCE, PCE, and mixed solvents, with unexposed factory workers serving as referents. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 77, 965 workers who accrued nearly 1. 9 million person-years of follow up (mean 24. 2 years). Mortality follow up, estimated as 99 % complete, showed that 20, 236 workers had died by 31 December 1996, with cause of death obtained for 98 %. Workers experienced low overall mortality (all causes of death SMR 0. 83) and low cancer mortality (SMR 0. 90). No significant increases in risk were found for any of the 40 specific cause of death categories, whereas for several causes the numbers of deaths were significantly below expectation. Analyses by occupational group and specific job titles showed no remarkable mortality patterns. Factory workers estimated to have been routinely exposed to chromate were not at increased risk of total cancer (SMR 0. 93) or of lung cancer (SMR 1. 02). Workers routinely exposed to TCE, PCE, or a mixture of solvents also were not at increased risk of total cancer (SMRs 0. 86, 1. 07, and 0. 89, respectively), and the numbers of deaths for specific cancer sites were close to expected values. Slight to moderately increased rates of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were found among workers exposed to TCE or PCE, but none was significant. A significant increase in testicular cancer was found among those with exposure to mixed solvents, but the excess was based on only six deaths and could not be linked to any particular solvent or job activity. Internal cohort analyses showed no significant trends of increased risk for any cancer with increasing years of exposure to chromate or solvents. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this large scale cohort study of workers followed up for over 3 decades provide no clear evidence that occupational exposures at the aircraft manufacturing factory resulted in increases in the risk of death from cancer or other diseases.

The current best clinical method to predict pathologic complete response is SUVmax in F- 18 -FDG PET/ CT imaging. To improve the {{prediction of}} response, we constructed a model to predict complete response to nCRT in EC based on pretreatment clinical parameters and F- 18 -FDG PET/CT-derived textural features. Methods: From a prospectively maintained single institution database, we reviewed 97 consecutive patients with locally advanced EC and a pretreatment F- 18 -FDG PET/CT scan between 2009 and 2015. All patients were treated with nCRT (carboplatin/paclitaxe 1 / 41. 4 Gy) followed by esophagectomy. We analyzed clinical, geometric, and pretreatment textural features extracted from both F- 18 -FDG PET and CT. The current most accurate prediction model with SUVmax as a predictor variable was compared with 6 different response prediction models constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularized logistic <b>regression.</b> <b>Internal</b> validation was performed to estimate the model's performances. Pathologic response was defined as complete versus incomplete response (Mandard tumor regression grade system 1 vs. 2 - 5). Results: Pathologic examination revealed 19 (19. 6 %) complete and 78 (80. 4 %) incomplete responders. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularization selected the clinical parameters: histologic type and clinical T stage, the 18 F-FDG PET-derived textural feature long run low gray level emphasis, and the CT-derived textural feature run percentage. Introducing these variables to a logistic regression analysis showed areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0. 78 compared with 0. 58 in the SUVmax model. The discrimination slopes were 0. 17 compared with 0. 01, respectively. After internal validation, the AUCs decreased to 0. 74 and 0. 54, respectively. Conclusion: The predictive values of the constructed models were superior to the standard method (SUVmax). These results {{can be considered as}} an initial step in predicting tumor re sponse to nCRT in locally advanced EC. Further research in refining the predictive value of these models is needed to justify omission of surgery...|$|R
40|$|The {{departure}} {{point of this}} study is Gilligan’s critique against Kohlberg’s theory of moral development. The main aim was to examine whether the proposed levels of care-based reasoning form a developmental sequence. Care and justice reasoning were studied among practical nursing, bachelor-degree social work and law enforcement students in the beginning of education (N= 66) and after 2 years (N= 59). Main measures were Skoe’s Ethic of Care Interview and Colby & Kohlberg et al’s Moral Judgment Interview. Participants’ real-life moral conflicts were also analyzed. Results showed that 34 % of the participants progressed in care reasoning, and 48 % in justice reasoning. Social work and nursing students progressed in care reasoning. All groups showed progress in justice reasoning. Care and justice reasoning were parallel in terms of <b>internal</b> consistency and <b>regression.</b> 5 % regressed in care reasoning, compared with 3 % in justice reasoning. Participants at the highest justice level also represented high-level care reasoning. Self-concept interviews involved descriptions of developmental transitions. Findings suggest that care reasoning constitutes a developmental sequence, from self-concern (Level 1) to caring for others and self-sacrifice (Level 2) to the balanced caring for self and others (Level 3). For women, age and androgynous gender role were positively related to care reasoning. At the posttest, participants at Level 3 were the most empathic and showed progress in empathy. Role taking was positively related to care reasoning for both genders, and to justice reasoning for men In real-life conflicts, the type of dilemma predicted moral orientation usage. Prosocial dilemmas pulled for care and antisocial dilemmas for justice orientation. Women with connected self-concept tended to use care orientation. Level of justice reasoning varied according to the dilemma type. Real-life care reasoning was consistent with participants’ competence, with the exception of transgression-type dilemmas at the posttest. Participants reporting temptation-type dilemmas were the least developed in care reasoning. Levels of care and justice reasoning were strongly related to each other, and were integrated in mature reasoning. Care reasoning also involved values and ethical principles related to others’ welfare. These results underscore the importance of dilemma type, and suggest that care reasoning is a significant part of real life morality. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Background and aims: Cardiac surgery {{carries a}} {{substantial}} risk of mortality and other postoperative complications. Morbidity following cardiac surgery {{has become more}} important {{in recent years as}} mortality has decreased. Pre-operative risk prediction may be useful for patient counseling, perioperative care planning and quality control. However, mortality scores like the EuroSCORE have often not showed sufficient discrimination or calibration for prediction of other complications. Our aims were therefore to develop separate risk prediction models for postoperative cardiac dysfunction, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and prolonged stay {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU), and to compare our models with various previously published risk scores. The endpoints were chosen because they are common conditions in clinical practice. Our models were developed in a cohort of approximately 5000 Norwegian patients operated at St. Olavs University Hospital from 2000 through 2007. For the cardiac dysfunction and prolonged ventilation models we employed logistic regression. The model for a prolonged ICU stay was developed using Cox <b>regression.</b> <b>Internal</b> validation was performed by bootstrapping. Discrimination was assessed with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve, and calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and graphical comparison of predicted and observed probability. Results: Using preoperative variables that are usually easily obtainable in clinical routine, we developed models showing excellent discrimination and good calibration for prediction of postoperative cardiac dysfunction and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Addition of a few intraoperative variables improved discrimination and calibration. Internal validation indicated that the models should behave with little error in future datasets. Our preoperative models showed better performance than alternative previously published scores. The model for prediction of a prolonged ICU stay showed good calibration and excellent discrimination for a stay of more than 2, 5 or 7 days. Discrimination for ICU stay prediction by the EuroSCORE II and other published models was good, but calibration was poor. None of the models were useful for prediction of ICU stay in individual patients because most patients in all risk categories of all models had short ICU stays (75 th percentiles: 1 day). Comments: Our findings support that locally developed models with easily obtainable preoperative variables may accurately predict various endpoints. Even if addition of intraoperative variables marginally improved the accuracy, preoperative models are more useful for clinical practice. A locally developed model may be more suitable than a model that was originally developed from a different population. Our data showed that a good discriminative ability does not guarantee good calibration. The use of ill-calibrated models may lead to serious under- or overestimation of the true risk and thereby to incorrect information to patients and suboptimal treatment decisions. Our findings demonstrated that length of stay in the ICU does not solely depend on clinical reasons, but also on the policy of the institution. For this reason, it is difficult to make universal a model for prediction of ICU stay. PhD i klinisk medisinPhD in Clinical Medicin...|$|R
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Clinical PsychologyAim: Humanitarian aid {{personnel}} are increasingly {{at risk of}} being exposed to primary and vicarious trauma due to the inherent risks associated with humanitarian work and the increasing politicization of humanitarian aid (Curtis, 2009; McCormack, Joseph, & Hagger, 2009; McFarlane, 2004). There is a need for the humanitarian field to develop an academic discipline that focuses on producing scientifically valid theories and procedures in the selection, training, and postmission support of aid personnel (McCall & Salama, 1999; Musa & Hamid, 2008). Furthermore, {{there is a need for}} a sensitive instrument for determining personnel’s vulnerability to traumatic stress. The PostAID-Q is an 18 -item self-report questionnaire designed to measure Altruistic Identity Disruption (AID). AID is a type of psychosocial distress that leads to feelings of isolation and invalidation, which results in reintegration difficulties and increased risk of psychological morbidity. The aim of this study was to establish the psychometric properties of the Postmission Altruistic Identity Disruption Questionnaire (PostAID-Q), in particular, the construct validity, incremental validity, and internal consistency reliability. Method: Participants were recruited from the DEVEX (www. devex. com) and by word of mouth from the researchers humanitarian aid contacts. A total of 60 participants completed an online survey of 99 questions, comprising six questionnaires: the PostAID-Q, the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12), the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), the Short Depression Happiness Scale (SDHS), the Changes in Outlook Questionnaire (CIOQ), and the Social Provisions Scale (SPS). To determine construct validity, scores on the PostAID-Q were compared to scores on the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12), the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), the Social Provisions Scale (SPS), the short-form Changes in Outlook Questionnaire (CIOQ), and the Short Depression Happiness Scale (SDHS) using bivariate correlations. Incremental Validity was examined using two hierarchical regression analyses. The dependent variable for the first regression was the IES-R and the independent variables were the GHQ- 12 for the first step and the PostAID-Q for the second step. In the second hierarchical regression the dependent variable was the SPS. The independent variables were the same as the first <b>regression.</b> <b>Internal</b> Consistency Reliability was determined by examining the Cronbach’s alpha of the PostAID-Q. Results: The current research replicated previous internal consistency findings for the GHQ- 12, IES-R, SPS, and SDHS. The PostAID-Q demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity and thus construct validity. It also provided incremental validity compared to the GHQ- 12 and strong internal consistency reliability (α =. 82). The intrusion factor of the IES-R and the social integration factor of the SPS each uniquely measured 17 % of PostAID/Q variance. This means that 34 % of PostAID/Q variance is accounted for by intrusion and difficulties with social integration. Conclusion: The PostAID-Q promises to be a useful self-report measure in the postmission care of humanitarian aid personnel and postmission/pre-deployment processes of humanitarian aid organizations. It is able to measure psychosocial distress in humanitarian aid personnel during reintegration. Further research should focus on replicating the validity results and establishing the reliability of the PostAID-Q. Because the PostAID/Q can measure intrusive thoughts and social integration problems in international workers, future research should also determine the validity of its use with military personnel...|$|R
40|$|Disruptive {{behavior}} {{is a frequent}} problem in many American classrooms, especially in schools with large populations of low income students. Nevertheless, many teachers do not use evidence based behavior management strategies. Group contingency interventions (GCIs), a group of thoroughly researched evidence based interventions for reducing disruptive behavior, {{have been found to}} be effective for students from elementary to high school, but the acceptability of these interventions has primarily been studied in elementary schools. The current study surveyed middle school teachers, and sought to identify factors that lead to increased likelihood of teachers finding GCIs acceptable, and possibly worth adopting. First we hypothesized that teaching special education, more previous exposure to GCI, less teacher experience, greater perceived severity of problem was positively related to a higher likelihood of acceptability of GCI over and above the influence of social desirability. Then we hypothesized that teaching special education would lead to greater exposure to GCI and subsequently greater acceptability of GCI. It was also hypothesized that the positive influence of amount of teacher exposure on acceptability would be weakened by perceiving the problem to be less severe and having more years of teaching experience. Finally, it was hypothesized that higher acceptability, greater teacher burnout, and greater intervention specific self-efficacy would be positively related to a higher likelihood of adoption of GCI over and above the influence of social desirability. Teachers (n = 76) from 13 rural, low-income, middle schools within 3 school systems were asked to rate the acceptability of GCIs, and the possibility that they would adopt using GCIs in the future. Teachers also reported whether they taught special education, their years of experience, their intervention self-efficacy, and the level of problem behavior they experienced. In addition, teachers completed measures of burnout and social desirability. Items measuring acceptability and adoption were combined to form one variable based on their <b>internal</b> consistency. A <b>regression</b> model evaluating teacher related variables was used to predict the combined outcome variable (Acceptability) while controlling for social desirability bias. Results indicated that teachers at rural, low-income schools found GCIs to be acceptable interventions for disruptive behavior (M = 21. 42, range = 10 - 27), and the majority of teachers endorsed adoption of the intervention in the future (82 %). Examination of teacher related factors revealed that intervention self-efficacy predicted the combined Acceptability variable (B = 2. 83, p [less than] 0. 01) over and above all other teacher related factors after controlling for social desirability. None of the other teacher related factors predicted acceptability or adoption. Results also indicated higher rates of burnout in the current sample than in previous samples of human services workers (t(70) = 4. 24, p [less than]. 001). Results were discussed within the context of previous literature, and the limitations of the current study. The need for further research relating the implementation of GCIs to environmental, intervention-specific, and other teacher-related factors was described. Strategies to increase implementation of GCIs by teachers were also discussed. The current findings contribute to the limited literature on behavioral interventions for rural schools and middle schools...|$|R
40|$|Ionising {{radiation}} is a known mutagen, {{much of the}} evidence coming from studies on animals, and from studies of occupationally exposed workforces and those exposed after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, {{few studies have examined}} transgenerational effects of paternal exposure in humans. The workforce at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in west Cumbria, is the most highly exposed such workforce in Western Europe and North America. This epidemiological investigation set out to determine whether there was evidence of an association between stillbirth risk and paternal preconceptional exposure to external ionising radiation or <b>internal</b> radionuclides. Logistic <b>regression</b> was used to analyse the relationship between stillbirth risk and paternal preconceptional irradiation (ppi). Further modelling of the risk of stillbirth in relation to ppi was carried out using overdispersion and variance components models. The form of doseresponse was investigated using both threshold and broken-stick models, in addition to varying the power function of the dose term. To assess the effect of errors in the dose estimates for the immediate preconceptional period resulting from the derivation of doses for short intervals pro rata from annual dose summaries, a nested case-control study was also carried out. This used more precise estimates of external doses estimated directly from monthly film badges and internal doses from special dose assessments, which were very time consuming to collate and would have taken several years to compile for the entire workforce. A significant positive association was found between the risk of a child being stillborn and total external ppi (adjusted odds ratio per 100 mSv, 1. 25 95 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 46, p= 0. 019). The risk was higher for stillbirths with congenital anomaly and was highest for the nine stillbirths with neural tube defects, eight of which were anencephalic, the other spina bifida. Although, the possibility of an unmeasured risk factor for stillbirth, confounded with the effect of ppi, cannot be excluded, extensive checks confirmed that all statistical models were a reasonable fit to the data, and there was not statistical evidence of unmeasured risk factors. The statistical models predicted that, were the association to be interpreted as causal, up to 32 of the 130 stillbirths to the workforce between 1950 and 1989 might have been attributable to ppi. However, the increased risk to the current workforce is small. Current knowledge of the transgenerational risks of ionising radiation do not allow the observed relationship to be interpreted as casual, nor does it allow the possibility of a causal relationship to be excluded. The findings of an increased risk of stillbirth with increasing ppi are qualitatively consistent with those from animal models, though the risk estimate is higher. They are also consistent with reports of an increased risk of neural tube defects in the offspring of those occupationally exposed at the Hanford nuclear reprocessing plant. The studies of stillbirth and congenital anomalies in the offspring of the survivors of the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki indicate that up to three stillbirths due to ppi would have been expected amongst the offspring of the male Sellafield radiation workers. The higher estimate observed in this investigation is possibly due to the use of more appropriate statistical methods than were available for the analysis of the Japanese data. A comparable logistic regression analysis of the atomic bomb survivor data would allow a more direct comparison.

40|$|Biodiesel {{fuels and}} their blends with diesel {{are often used}} to reduce carbon trace and to help {{reducing}} engine emissions. However, previous studies have shown mixed effects of biodiesel on NOx emissions. Operating a compression-ignition engine in low- temperature combustion mode as well as using multiple injections can reduce NOx emissions. The effects of injection timing, spray angle and fuel composition are studied using {{a modified version of}} KIVA 3 V code. The objectives of this research include: 1) {{to examine the effects of}} fuel on engine performance and emissions; 2) to study the effects of spray angle on flow patterns and pollutants formation using a discrete multi- component approach; 3) to develop a new droplet evaporation model using the continuous thermodynamics formulation, which is capable in accommodating multiple distribution functions, accounts for preferential evaporation, finite diffusion and surface regression of the droplet; 4) to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model in engine applications. A numerical study is also conducted to study the effect of spray angle in a small bore high speed direct injection engine. Soot located in the squish region or the region above the piston bowl are readily oxidized due to abundance of oxygen. Portions of fuel are burnt in the region about the piston bowl or squish for both spray angles of 150 ?? and 70 ??. Soot located within the piston bowl is oxidized at a much slower rate due to deficient of oxygen after combustion. Soot emissions are mainly due to soot remaining within in the piston bowl at the end of combustion cycle. Any strategy that pushes soot out of the piston bowl can improve the oxidation process, thus, reducing soot emission. Extra oxygen in biodiesel also helps in reducing the emission. The effects of variable cone angle spray on the performance of a diesel engine are studied. Using a variable cone angle injection extends the range of injection time without engine wall wetting, which decreases soot and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. The numerical predictions show a 10 % improvement in thermal efficiency without compromising NOx and soot emissions. The study shows that the evaporation of the fuel affects the ignition behavior and combustion quality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the evaporation and mixing processes is essential for further improvement in engine performance. A multi- component droplet evaporation model, as efficient as a traditional zero-dimensional model, yet preserving the correct description of the underlying physical process is developed in this study. The continuous thermodynamics formulation is used, for which the fuel (or liquid mixture) is described using a probability distribution function. The variation of composition in both liquid and vapor phases is represented by tracing the changes of the probability distribution function parameters. In the present study, the gamma distribution is used to represent the fuel fractions, and, the composition is tracked by tracing the mean and standard deviation of the distribution function. Finite diffusion, <b>internal</b> circulation, surface <b>regression</b> and high pressure effects are all accounted for. The model is shown to reproduce in a satisfactorily manner, experimental measurements adopted from the literature. The model is applied to predict the evaporation of single component (distribution) and multi-component droplets. The results show that the proposed model predicts the important distillation characteristics of practical fuel, which cannot be reproduced by a single component model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Work {{has become}} such an {{important}} part of people’s lives. Not only does it provide a means to meet financial goals, but work also provides people with opportunities for self-expression, achievement and social esteem. People choose an occupation with the expectation that it will meet their needs, and they invest considerable time, energy and resources to gain entry to that occupation. However, in practice, these expectations may not always be met. Examination of the scholarly literature reveals that practitioners {{from a wide range of}} fields express frustration that their chosen occupational role may not be understood, valued or recognised by others. These occupational recognition concerns may well be important as there is growing awareness that practitioners’ experience of being a part of their profession impacts their occupational identification, commitment and, ultimately, their intention to remain in that profession. However, there has been little theoretical or empirical examination of occupational recognition in the literature. In addition, there has been no exploration of the relationship between perceptions of occupational recognition and practitioners’ broader occupational experience of being a member of their chosen profession. This study examines the relationship between Australian clinical social work practitioners’ perceptions of occupational recognition and their occupational identification, commitment and turnover intention. Australian clinical social workers were selected as the study population because there is evidence that they have concerns about the recognition of their occupational role by multiple others—within and outside of their profession. Examination of the occupational literature revealed that existing approaches to conceptualising recognition—status, professionalism, unionism and deprofessionalisation—failed to capture practitioners’ intra-psychic experience of recognition. To overcome this gap in the literature, Axel Honneth’s (1995) social-philosophical conceptualisation of recognition was adapted for use at the occupational level, and three distinct spheres of occupational recognition were hypothesised—intra-professional, inter-disciplinary and policy level recognition. The main thesis underlying this study is that occupational recognition is an important occupational variable and a significant predictor of key occupational outcomes. A two-stage research design was used to direct the study. Stage one encompassed a theoretical review of existing approaches to conceptualising occupational recognition which was then used to guide the design and development of an instrument to measure practitioners’ perceptions of occupational recognition by multiple others. The second stage involved the implementation of a structured web survey to assess practitioners’ perceptions of occupation recognition and the relationship between recognition and other key occupational outcomes (i. e., commitment, identification, turnover intention). Dillman’s (2007) Tailored Design Method was used to maximise recruitment. The final sample of 505 clinical social workers comprised 84 % Australian Association of Social Workers’ members and 16 % non-members. Descriptive analyses of the sample population were undertaken as there had been no known research examining this population in the Australian context. The descriptive analyses of the data revealed that Australian clinical social workers were predominantly female, older and achieved specialisation through supervision (informal route) rather than through formal post-graduate education (formal route to specialisation). Principal component analyses (PCA) of the data supported the hypothesis that occupational recognition can be differentiated at the intra-professional, inter-disciplinary and policy levels. Further, high Cronbach’s alpha scores for the three occupational recognition scales indicated that the new Occupational Recognition instruments have high <b>internal</b> reliability. Multiple <b>regression</b> analyses revealed that inclusion of the occupational recognition variables significantly improved the prediction of occupational affective commitment and occupational identification. Intra-professional recognition—that is, recognition by peers within practitioners’ own profession—was the most influential of the three levels of recognition. Specifically, intra-professional recognition emerged as a strong positive predictor of occupational commitment and a strong negative predictor of occupational turnover intention. Taken together, the results provide support for including occupational recognition as a key indicator of occupational functioning in future research. The study provides a valuable theoretical contribution to existing conceptualisations of occupational recognition, with empirical support for viewing recognition as being distinct at the intra-professional, inter-disciplinary and policy levels. The results highlight the important role that practitioners and professional associations can play in cultivating intra-professional recognition and how this could potentially promote occupational retention and commitment. Finally, the study provided the first known description of Australian clinical social work practitioners and highlighted the need for a standardised framework to safeguard practitioners who follow the informal route (supervision only) to specialisation...|$|R
