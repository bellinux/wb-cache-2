5|$|From 1789 until 1792, {{when the}} French royal court {{resided in the}} Tuileries, the {{apartment}} of the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> of the Pavillon de Flore housed {{the office of the}} princesse de Lamballe, being {{side by side with the}} apartment of queen Marie Antoinette in the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> of the main building of the Tuileries, while the first floor of the Pavillon housed the apartment of Madame Elisabeth.|$|E
5|$|Montacute, {{like many}} Elizabethan mansions, is built in an 'E' shape, a much-used plan in this era. On the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> {{was the great}} hall, kitchens and pantries, on the upper floors, {{retiring}} rooms for the family and honoured guests. Over the centuries, the layout and use of rooms changed: drawing and dining rooms evolved on the <b>ground</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{building}} is closed off for security reasons, but a permanent exhibition on the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> {{is open to the}} public.|$|E
40|$|On coastal dikes in Belgium, many {{residential}} buildings are found. Most {{of the old}} buildings are masonry structures with two to three floors (Figure 1). The <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> are always elevated (Figure 2), and the entrances of the basements are closed by shutters (Figure 3). The most modern buildings are concrete reinforcement structures with concrete piles/columns as foundations. The walls are consisting of masonry or concrete. These buildings are 5 to 9 floors high. Some of the <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> are elevated, and some are used as cafe, restaurant or store. The <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> are equipped with large glass windows and doors. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} to be able to maintain a garrison when required and was well furnished. The <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> and second floor had fireplaces, with the first and second floors also having garderobes. The <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> may have formed a dining area, with the floors above being used for military purposes and sleeping accommodation. The walls of the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> have chasing and sockets cut into them. It is unclear what these were: theories include that they contained timbers to support brickwork that in turn supported the first floor; that they were held timbers that supported the joists of the first floor; or they are the remains of an ammunition store, retrofitted in the tower in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The west façade {{dates to}} the 18th century {{and is the only}} one with {{multiple}} gables; the windows on the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> are sashed.|$|E

50|$|The {{department}} store closed in 1986 {{and the building}} was turned into retail on the <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> and a garment factory on the upper floors.|$|R
50|$|Two-storey byre-dwellings {{with stone}} walled <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> {{occurred}} in the northeast of Baden-Württemberg in the 15th century. They were described as Pastor Mayer houses (Pfarrer-Mayer-Häuser).|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the <b>ground</b> <b>floor.</b> Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, the {{businessman}} Charles Seale Hayne restored Kingswear {{to form a}} summer house, using the local architect Thomas Lidstone; the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> was redesigned, a conical roof added and a detached round tower constructed on the north-west side. During the Second World War, it {{was used by the}} Royal Marines and the site reinforced by a concrete blockhouse. The Landmark Trust acquired it in 1987 for use as a holiday let, restoring the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> of the main building to its original appearance and recreating the earlier flat, lead roof. It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, an arson attack damaged {{sections}} of the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> and first floor. Two people were arrested the following day and released on bail {{in relation to the}} attack.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of construction, the {{railways}} provided a leap in transport for the communities it passed through. NSB saw beautiful and grandeur stations {{as a way to}} draw patronage, and chose, in addition to impressive architecture, to build a park adjacent each stations. As construction went by, funding for stations were reduced, resulting in less grandeur further north. Most stations had two stories and an attic, although some of the stations serving lesser places had smaller buildings. From Steinkjer to Skogn, the <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> were built in random rubble. As construction continued, budgets were reduced and station costs were cut. From Rinnan to Sparbu, the <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> were instead built in brick, and from Mære and north, the stations have wooden <b>ground</b> <b>floors.</b> In addition to a station buildings, stations consisted of an outhouse and a freight house; selected stations also featured a water tower and motive power depot.|$|R
50|$|On {{occasion}} {{the village}} is prone to flooding. In May 2006, due to heavy rainfall, <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> of several houses were flooded in the Queens Crescent and Day Close areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is {{designed in the}} International Style. Above the lobby sits a seven level garage. The tower rises an additional 23 floors {{for a total of}} 31 above <b>ground</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} {{there were}} servants quarters and spaces on the <b>ground</b> <b>floor,</b> and a library {{in the north}} room on the second floor, {{as well as a}} sitting room over the octagonal drawing room. According to Repton, the design should allow <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> rooms where the garden is visible and directly accessible, meaning that servants quarters needed to be placed in their own wing, but without prominence so as to maintain the hierarchy. In the south-east corner of the building there was a gothic loggia which was glazed in the 19th century to create a conservatory, some time after the conservatory in the American Garden was removed.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1332, a fire {{broke out}} in the palace of the podestà, the leading {{magistrate}} of the city. This fire destroyed the roof of the palace and destroyed two-thirds of the entire structure from the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> up, prompting the government to rebuild the palatial residence totally out of stone, {{all the way up to}} the roof. On July 16 of that year the palace of the wool guild caught fire and everything from the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> up was destroyed, prompting the wool guild to reconstruct a new palatial residence on a larger scale and with stone vaults leading up to the roof.|$|E

The front room has recesses {{on either side of the}} arched fireplace. The rear room on the <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> was the hall and still has its 16th-century ceiling panels and four-light window. The ceiling has plaster decorations from the Elizabethan era, when the kitchen block was also added.|$|E
