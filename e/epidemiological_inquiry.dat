40|$|Abstract Susceptibility {{to cancer}} ensues in {{individuals}} carrying malfunctioning DNA repair mechanisms. The impact of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in key DNA repair mechanisms on risk {{for prostate cancer}} was investigated in this case-control study. Samples consisted of 110 patients with confirmed prostate cancer and 200 unaffected men, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. XPD/Lys 751 Gln (rs 13181), APEX 1 /Asp 148 Glu (rs 1130409), and RAD 51 /G 135 C (rs 1801320) SNPs were analyzed by PCR-RFLP. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were calculated and compared by Chi-Square test. The association between SNPs and clinical/epidemiological data was considered significant by Odds Ratio analysis, with IC 95 % and a p-value≤ 0. 05. Only the XPD/Lys 751 Gln SNP significantly increased susceptibility to disease in southeastern Brazilian men, with p≤ 0. 001 [OR= 2. 36 (1. 46 - 3. 84) ], with no association with APEX 1 or RAD 51 SNPs. Combined XPD+RAD 51 SNPs were highly associated with the disease, p≤ 0. 005 [OR= 3. 40 (1. 32 - 9. 20) ]. A Chi-Square significant association between XPD/Lys 751 Gln and Gleason score was also observed (OR= 9. 31; IC 95 %= 1. 19 – 428. 0; p= 0. 022). <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>inquiries</b> revealed that exposure to pesticides significantly impacted the risk for prostate cancer in this population.

40|$|ABSTRACT During a 17 month {{survey of}} air {{pollution}} {{in the town of}} Armadale, central Scotland, the concentrations of some metals (iron, manganese, zinc, lead, copper, chrome, nickel, cadmium, and cobalt) were measured in seven types of low technology sampler-four indigenous and three transplanted-at 47 sites. The geographical patterns of the concentrations in the samplers were compared on two types of map. For most metals, sites with high concentrations were present close to the foundry and also in the north of the town. The differences between the patterns of pollution shown by the various types of sampler probably reflected differing mechanisms for collection and different affinities for various sizes and types of metal particle. During the late 1960 s and for much of the 1970 s, mor-tality from lung cancer and other diseases was excep-tionally high in Armadale, a small industrial town in central Scotland. '` 4 A cluster of deaths from lung cancer was found directly to the south west of the town's steel foundry, a source of local air pollution. 5 6 Subsequent <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiries</b> failed to incrim-inate tobacco or occupational factors as major causes of the high mortality from lung cancer, 7 and hence the possible contribution of industrial air pollution to these epidemiological findings merited further investigation. When airborne metals are emitted from sources near ground level, their concentrations can change substantially over short distances. When such types of emission are investigated, a high density of sampling sites is necessary. 8 In Armadale the low height of the major source of pollution and the significant clus-tering of lung cancer necessitated sampling tech-niques sufficiently inexpensive to allow the relative concentrations of metals in air near the height of human inhalation to be measured at many sites throughout the town.

40|$|The {{discipline}} of epidemiology, which holds major influence on public health policy {{as well as}} on clinical medical practice, has in recent decades to a large extent been concerned with the identification of factors and markers of risk for disease.

40|$|The health {{impact of}} {{environmental}} pollution {{resulting from the}} industrial use of asbestos can be assessed in three ways. First, there are the direct epidemiological surveys. These indicate that domestic exposure {{has been responsible for}} cases of mesothelioma and possibly lung cancer and radiological changes in family contacts of asbestos workers. Exposure in the neighborhood of crocidolite mines and factories has also resulted in cases of mesothelioma but no similar evidence exists for chrysotile or amosite. Neither air nor water pollution has been directly incriminated as a cause of either respiratory or digestive malignancies. Second, a few {{attempts have been made to}} extrapolate from exposure response findings in industrial cohorts. For several reasons, even for lung cancer, this approach is dubious: the observed gradients have a 100 -fold range in slope; the equivalences of dust, fiber and gravimetric measures are largely guesswork; and the carcinogenic potential of mineral fibers, particularly for the pleura, varies enormously with fiber type and/or dimensions. No adequate exposure-response observations have been made for mesothelioma. A third approach makes use of the differing incidence of mesothelioma in men and women. Data from several countries indicate that, until the 1950 s (i. e., 30 - 40 years after significant industrial use of asbestos began), the rates were similar in both sexes. Since then, the incidence in males has risen steeply [...] in the U. S. and U. K. at about 10 % per annum. In females, on the other hand, there has been little or no convincing increase. These data suggest that the "background" level of mesothelioma in both sexes is and has been about 2 per million per annum and that [...] as at least some mesothelioma cases in females are directly or indirectly attributable to occupational exposure [...] there is little room left for any contribution from the general environment. It is recommended that mesothelioma surveillance, backed by appropriate <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiries,</b> offers an effective method of monitoring the health impact of asbestos air pollution...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Results {{are given}} of a case-control study on bladder cancer in West Yorkshire. The {{aim of the}} study was to assess what risks exist for {{cigarette}} smoking in the United Kingdom and also to investigate if a dose response effect was present. The study shows for the first time in the United Kingdom a positive but weak relationship between cigarette smoking and bladder cancer. Close examination of the data with regard to this effect shows that a complex set of relationships result when the quantity smoked and the period of smoking are taken into account. A dose response effect is weakly demonstrated when a medium quantity of cigarettes are smoked but it is not present at all in those who smoked most cigarettes for the longest periods. No risk appears to exist for those who have smoked only filter cigarettes. The results are contrasted with similar studies and the significance of the observations are discussed.

40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY To {{describe}} {{prevalence and}} severity of periodontal diseases among urban and rural 11 - 15 year-olds in Lithuania and to evaluate risk factors, prevention and treatment needs. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 1. 	To evaluate oral hygiene among 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and to describe dependence on gender, age, parients‘ education and living area. 2. 	To evaluate freequence of complaints of the bleeding gingiva among 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and to describe dependence on gender, age and living area. 3. 	To evaluate the dependence of freequence of complaints of the bleeding gingiva on oral higiene, living style and parients‘ education. 4. 	To describe prevalence {{and severity of}} periodontal diseases among urban and rural 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and to elucidate relation with local risk factors and oral hygiene. 5. 	T o evaluate treatment needs of periodontal diseases among urban and rural 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren. 6. 	To create methods of prevention of periodontal diseases for the 11 - 15 year-old schoolchildren and present them too schoolchildren and dentists. ORIGINALITY OF INVESTIGATION OUTCOME For {{the first time in}} Lithuania the periodontal tissue condition of the eleven to fifteen years old town and village schoolchildren, the main periodontal disease risk factors, and the need for periodontal disease treatment was studied and evaluated, as well as the dental caries and periodontal disease risk factor relationship was identified. The periodontal disease prognosis algorithm, which was based on risk factor evaluation, was concluded. An inquiry, which was based on international protocol, was performed together with the public health specialists. Oral hygiene habits, complaints of gum bleeding, oral hygiene means of the Lithuanian schoolchildren as well as gum bleeding relationship to general health condition and schoolchildren way of life or other health-related habits were evaluated with the help of this inquiry. The relationship between the complaints of gum bleeding and the health-risk behaviour signs of the adolescents (smoking, alcohol and drug usage) was analysed. PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY The data of the study reveal a large periodontal disease prevalence and severity among the eleven to fifteen years old schoolchildren, and substantiate the need for preventive measures implementation into functional health care. This problem is especially relevant now, at the time of health care system reform. The data of the oral hygiene inquiry present a substantial schoolchildren approach to tooth brushing, oral hygiene means, and vividly reveal the lack of oral hygiene education, especially among village schoolchildren. Because of that, with the reference to the data of the study, and with an aim to reduce periodontal disease development possibility, as well as to slow the progression of the existing diseases, {{it is very important to}} organise and introduce preventive programmes not only in a field of dental caries, but and the field of periodontal diseases as well. MATERIAL AND METHODS Periods of the study Period 1 comprises of the eleven to fifteen years old Lithuanian schoolchildren inquiry in order to evaluate oral hygiene means variety and the frequency of its application, as well as the frequency of schoolchildren complaints of gum bleeding. The research was carried out in 2002. Period 2 comprises of a more complex investigation. Kaunas and Kaunas region fifteen years old schoolchildren oral cavity hard and soft tissue condition was investigated, periodontal disease risk factors and periodontal disease treatment needs were studied. Lithuanian schoolchildren inquiry about tooth brushing frequency and additional usage of oral hygiene means was performed. The research was carried out in 2003 and 2004. Period 1 inquired children involved 2. 887 (51. 1 percent) boys and 2, 758 (48. 9 percent) girls. The schoolchildren age groups were of almost equal size: 1. 867 (33. 1 percent) eleven year-olds, 1. 873 (33. 2 percent) thirteen year-olds, 1. 905 (33. 7 percent) fifteen year-olds. Inquired children were divided into two groups according to their place of living: group 1 consisted of 2. 402 (42. 6 percent) of schoolchildren living in towns or regional centres; group 2 consisted of 3. 243 (57. 4 percent) of schoolchildren living in a small town or a village. Group 1 was conditionally called “town residents”, and group 2 was conditionally called “village residents”. During period 2 Kaunas, Kaunas region, Jurbarkas region, and Prienai region fifteen years old schoolchildren were properly examined and inquired. Table 1 shows the distribution of the inquired children according to living place and sex. Table 1.

The research protocol for the study complies with the strict ethical standards that the WHO requires of its collaborative research. The surveys of schoolchildren are also being carried out according to the ethical procedures required by each individual participating country or region. Presentation of this paper agrees with the rules of Terms of Reference developed for the HBSC study. In this survey child's oral hygiene habits and complains of gum bleeding were accessed by four questions: 1) How often do you brush your teeth? (twice a day; once a day; at least once a week but not daily; less than once a week; never), 2) How often do you use dental floss? (almost daily; sometimes; never), 3) How often do you rinse your mouth with special rinses? (almost daily; sometimes; never), 4) Does your gum bleed than you brussh teeth? (yes; no). Assessment of oral health status among 11 - 15 year-olds Dental caries was scored by surface on all erupted teeth in accordance with the WHO criteria (WHO, 1978) : 0 – Sound; 1 – Decayed; 2 – Filled with decay; 3 – Filled, no decay; 4 – Missing, as a result of caries; 5 – Missing, any other reason; 6 – sealant, varnish; 7 – bridge abudment or special crown; 8 - Unerupted tooth; 9 – Excluded tooth. according to criteria of WHO. The results were recorded in a form, prepared according to the WHO recommendations. Periodontal status was recorded according to CPITN index (Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs), according to WHO (WHO, 1978). CPI-codes and Treatment Needs are described in table 2.

III	Oral hygiene instructions, scaling and root planing, complex treatment Oral hygiene was evaluation by OHI-S index (Green-Vermillion simplified). The OHI-S index consists of 2 components: plaque index (DI) and calculus index (CI) 		OHI-S = DI + CI There were examined vestibular surfaces of 16; 11; 26 and 31 teeth and lingual surfaces of 36 and 46 teeth. In there is no first molar, second molar was examined, if there was no central incisor, contralateral central incisor was examined. 	The criteria of plaque index (DI) : 	 0 – no plaque present. 	 1 – soft plaque covering not more than ⅓ of tooth surface. 	 2 – soft plaque covering more than ⅓, but not more than ⅔ of the tooth surface. 	 3 – soft plaque covering more than ⅔ of the tooth surface. 	The criteria of calculus index (CI) : 	 0 – no calculus present. 	 1 – supragingival calculus covering not more than ⅓ of the tooth surface. 2 – supragingival calculus cover more than ⅓, but less than ⅔ of the tooth surface, and some subgingival calculus. 3 – supragingival calculus cover more than ⅔ of the tooth surface and subgingival calculus present. 	The sum of scores is divided into 6 (the number of examined teeth). Table 3.

The analyzed groups were described using the characterization of general statistics, dispersion and symmetrical association. The verification of the hypotheses of the relations between qualitative variables was performed using χ 2 criterion. The comparison of quantitative values was performed using Student’s t or Fisher’s F criterion. The mean of the descriptive statistical sample and average square deviation were calculated. These criteria were used for the verification of hypotheses on the means of two or more groups. In case of comparison of the mean values of two or more groups, the conclusions of t and F criteria coincide. The analyzed features of the each group should have normal distribution and the same dispersion when these criteria are used. Using the Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test, we estimated the normal distribution of quantitative values. For the comparison of the quantitative data without normal distribution, the tests of the comparison of non-parametric values were applied. The Mann–Whitney („U”) test was performed for the estimation of the difference between two independent groups, while the Cruscall–Wal („H”) test was performed for the estimation of the difference between several different groups. Pearson’s correlation coefficient r and Spearmen’s rank correlation coefficient R were used for the analysis of the correlation relationships between the criteria of the sample. Also, for the reduction of the number of the analyzed criteria and the clarification of general regularities we used factorial analysis. RESULTS AN...|$|R

But the model of "risk factor" epidemiology faces limits in explaining how neighborhoods, as complex systems, produce health or disease. This paper describes how visual methods can advance <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry.</b> Drawing {{from the work of}} The Health of Philadelphia Photo-documentation Project (HOPPP), this paper asks the following question: how can visual methods inform the work of epidemiologists? The project was conducted in three contiguous neighborhoods that represent a steep socioeconomic gradient. Photographs served as a stimulus for probing the sources of health variation across neighborhoods. The project incorporated three visual data sources: 1) "outsider perspective" images gathered systematically by staff photographers on randomly sampled blocks; 2) "insider perspective" images taken by adult residents during their daily routines; and 3) collaborative images taken by staff photographers in partnership with local participants. During in-depth interviews, these photographs served as prompts to elicit residents' health concerns and beliefs regarding urban environmental causes of good and poor health ("street-level etiologies"). We found that visual methods generated etiologic insights regarding the production of urban health and illness. Photographs enabled systematic observation of urban neighborhoods by the research team; engaged urban residents as active agents in the search for the underlying causes of urban health disparities; and created a social bridge between researchers and urban residents.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the present}} study we have {{investigated}} the anthropometrical indices (weight, height, thorax perimeter, cranial perimeter, body mass index) during infancy and their relation to nourishment (food intake, nutritive value of food). The study was performed {{on a group of}} 54 children (27 girls and 27 boys), aged between 1. 5 - 3 years, in a children’s nursery in Tîrgovişte, Romania. The methods consisted of a transverse <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry</b> using the anthropometrical indices of infant children and a nourishment inquiry, using the list of food released from the storehouse over 10 days, twice (in October 2008 and February 2009). WHO Child Growth Standards (Geneva 2006) were also used to analyze children’s development. The relation anthropometrical indices – nourishment was investigated by aid of linear regression (SPSS 13 program). The anthropometrical indices indicate a decrease to below the minimum values for thorax perimeter and body mass index (BMI) in the age group of 2. 5 - 3 years. According to WHO Child Growth Standards (Geneva 2006), BMIs for age group 2. 5 - 3 years are < 50 percentages for 11. 1 % of total investigated children and 42. 18 % of children included in this age group. There are not significant differences of anthropometrical indices between sexes. Nourishment of children is deficient in milk, eggs, animal fats, vegetables, and excessive in meat, cheese and vegetable fats, with normal intake of protein, deficient in carbohydrates and excessive in fats in both periods of the nourishment inquiry. In the second period of nourishment inquiry, food intake is very increase...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{variation in}} levels and causes of excess mortality and temporal mortality change among young and middle aged adults in a regionally diverse set of poor local {{populations in the}} USA. DESIGN: Using standard demographic techniques, death certificate and census data were analysed to make sex specific population level estimates of 1980 and 1990 death rates for residents of selected areas of concentrated poverty. For comparison, data for whites and blacks nationwide were analysed. SETTING: African American communities in Harlem, Central City Detroit, Chicago's south side, the Louisiana Delta, the Black Belt region of Alabama, and Eastern North Carolina. Non-Hispanic white communities in Cleveland, Detroit, Appalachian Kentucky, South Central Louisiana, Northeastern Alabama, and Western North Carolina. PARTICIPANTS: All black residents or all white residents of each specific community and in the nation, 1979 - 1981 and 1989 - 1991. MAIN RESULTS: Substantial variability exists in levels, trends, and causes of excess mortality in poor populations across localities. African American residents of urban/northern communities suffer extremely high and growing rates of excess mortality. Rural residents exhibit an important mortality advantage that widens over the decade. Homicide deaths contribute little to the rise in excess mortality, nor do AIDS deaths contribute outside of specific localities. Deaths attributable to circulatory disease are {{the leading cause of}} excess mortality in most locations. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences exist among persistently impoverished populations in the degree to which their poverty translates into excess mortality. Social <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry</b> and health promotion initiatives should be attentive to local conditions. The severely disadvantageous mortality profiles experienced by urban African Americans relative to the rural poor and to national averages call for understanding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective The use of {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicine (CAM) {{has not been}} widely studied among children in Italy. ISTAT- 2005 survey showed a prevalence of 10 % concerning children treated with CAM. The lack of data {{about the use of}} CAM in pediatrics in the South of Italy aimed us to conduct an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry</b> in Calabria. Methods The study has been conducted from 2009 and 2011 at the Pediatric Units of: University “Magna Graecia”- Catanzaro (CZ), Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital-Catanzaro (CZ), Annunziata Hospital-Cosenza (CS), Jazzolino Hospital- ViboValentia (VV), Riuniti Hospitals- Reggio Calabria (RC) and San Giovanni di Dio Hospital- Crotone (KR). All information was collected through a questionnaire proposed to children’s parents admitted to these hospitals as out-patients or in-patients. Results 1387 parents were approached to complete the questionnaire. 21 (1, 5 %) refused to answer. A total of 1366 questionnaire was analyzed: 378 at CZ, 450 at CS, 131 at KR, 201 at VV and 206 at RC, with a response rate of 98, 5 %. In total, the percentage of children using CAM varied from 18 % in Crotone to 38 % in Cosenza. The parents who used CAM for their children were older and with a higher education. Phytotherapy was preferred to homeopathy. The gastrointestinal pathologies and upper respiratory tract are those ones for which frequently parents recur to CAM. Of note we have not to disregard their use “ to strengthen” the immune system. In most of cases CAM have been prescribed by pediatrician. Conclusions Our study remarks that the use of CAM is increased dramatically among the calabrian children in the last years as well as in other countries. Pediatricians need to improve their knowledge about CAM in order to better manage the parental attitude. </p...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{consequences}} of the epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza which affected Italy between 1999 and 2000 was an epidemic of Newcastle disease in northern and central Italy. It affected industrially reared poultry, dealer flocks and backyard flocks, with a total of 254 outbreaks notified up to December 31, 2000. Virological investigations yielded virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus, which produced intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranging from 1. 6 to 2. 0 and which, {{on the basis of their}} monoclonal antibody binding patterns, could be classified as belonging to group C 1. The clinical, gross and microscopical findings were typical of Newcastle disease, and different avian species were susceptible to different degrees. Chickens and guinea fowl appeared to be the most susceptible, followed by pheasants, turkeys and ostriches. The <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry</b> highlighted the crucial role of a broiler hatchery in initiating the epidemic, and of dealers in perpetuating it. The control measures imposed by Directive 92 / 66 /EEC are discussed with reference to the outbreaks in backyard flocks. NEWCASTLE disease is a viral infection of birds caused by an avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV- 1), which, together with the other eight APMV serotypes, has been placed in the genus Rubulavirus, subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae, order Mononegavirales in the current taxonomy (Lamb and others 2000). It is highly contagious and can cause a very severe disease in susceptible birds, with mortality rates exceeding 50 per cent in chickens. For this reason it is included in List A of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), and statutory measures for its control are implemented in the EU (CEC 1992). Italy has been experiencing an epidemic of Newcastle disease caused by the 'pigeon strain ' of avian paramyxovirus 1 (PPMV- 1) since 1981, an...|$|E
40|$|Human {{brucellosis}} in Ecuador is underreported {{and based}} only on passive surveillance. Since 2008, brucellosis {{was removed from the}} list of communicable diseases in the country. Until now, the true human brucellosis picture has not yet been determined. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the seroprevalence of the disease, identify risk factors associated with brucellosis seropositivity in humans, and isolate circulating strains of Brucella spp. in the northwestern part of Ecuador. Between 2006 and 2008, a large transect survey was conducted, based on blood sampling of people from the northwestern part of Ecuador (n= 3733) together with an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry.</b> On the basis of three diagnostic tests used in parallel, the overall seroprevalence was estimated as 1. 88 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 48 - 2. 38). Based on a multivariable random effects logistic regression analysis, the main risk factors associated with human brucellosis seropositivity were contact with livestock (odds ratio [OR]= 3. 0; CI 1. 25 - 7. 08), consumption of fetus and placenta (OR= 2. 5; CI 1. 18 - 5. 22), and involvement in activities at risk for brucellosis infection (OR= 1. 8; CI 1. 00 - 3. 35). Noticeable variation in brucellosis seropositivity among humans within cantons was observed. The circulating strain was Brucella abortus biotype 4. This study emphasized that contact with livestock, consumption of fetus and placenta, and occupational hazard group were all significant risk factors for the transmission of brucellosis among individuals in the northwestern part of Ecuador. Alongside encouraging the launching of educational campaigns against brucellosis, especially in rural areas where 36 % of the population lives, controlling this zoonotic disease in animals will directly benefit its prevention in humans, especially because there is no safe and efficacious vaccine against brucellosis in humans...|$|E
40|$|Corporation-induced {{diseases}} {{are defined as}} diseases of consumers, workers, or community residents who {{have been exposed to}} disease agents contained in corporate products. To study the epidemiology and to guide expanded surveillance of these diseases, a new analytical framework is proposed. This framework is based on the agent–host–environment model and the upstream multilevel epidemiologic approach and posits an epidemiologic cascade starting with government-sanctioned corporate profit making and ending in a social cost, i. e., harm to population health. Each of the framework’s levels addresses a specific level of analysis, including government, corporations, corporate conduits, the environment of the host, and the host. The explained variable at one level is also the explanatory variable at the next lower level. In this way, a causal chain can be followed along the epidemiologic cascade from the site of societal power down to the host. The framework thus describes the pathways by which corporate decisions filter down to disease production in the host and identifies opportunities for epidemiologic surveillance. Since the environment of city dwellers is strongly shaped by corporations that are far upstream and several levels away, the framework has relevance for the study of urban health. Corporations that influence the health of urban populations include developers and financial corporations that determine growth or decay of urban neighborhoods, as well as companies that use strategies based on neighborhood characteristics to sell products that harm consumer health. <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry</b> and surveillance are necessary at all levels to provide the knowledge needed for action to protect the health of the population. To achieve optimal inquiry and surveillance at the uppermost levels, epidemiologists will have to work with political scientists and other social scientists and to utilize novel sources of information...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Background: Palliative care {{services}} aim {{to attain the}} best {{quality of life of}} patients. However, the lack of information on the survival of patients under palliative care has resulted in the implementation and assessment of care models being focused on reach without much consideration of the quality of care and {{the quality of life of}} patients in the context of survival. Amongst the few studies undertaken elsewhere, the target groups and settings to which the findings are inferable to are distinct to the Zimbabwean scenario. This studyâ€™s main aim was, therefore, to determine the survival of patients after enrolment into Island Hospice Service (IHS), a Zimbabwean palliative care programme established as the first hospice in Africa. Methodology: The study took the form of a Retrospective Cohort Design with data obtained from a computerized database at IHS. A total of 597 patients enrolled in the programme between 01 / 01 / 06 and 31 / 12 / 07 were included in the study and were retrospectively followed up with respect to mortality from their respective dates of enrolment to the study end-date of 31 / 12 / 08. Observations were censored on the study end-date and date of transfer or relocation. Results: This study found that the overall median survival of patients referred to the IHS palliative care programme is 419 days. This estimate is considerably higher than that found from other previous studies which range from 11 to 54 days. Patients diagnosed with HIV only were noted to have longer survival compared to those with Cancer only as well as those with both HIV and Cancer. The median survival estimates for patients with Cancer only and those with both Cancer and HIV were observed to be 84 days and 113 days respectively whilst that for those with HIV only was indeterminate. Some statistically significant differences in survival were also observed for study factors such as gender, age, source of referral and functional status but with variations under the specific disease groups. Conclusion: Patients enrolled in the IHS programme generally live longer relative to other palliative care programmes. The survival patterns of these patients are influenced by several factors, key among them being the disease status and functional status on enrolment. The study identified the need to incorporate survival data in care planning and modelling. Providing some awareness of the IHS Palliative Care programme to health professionals is also recommended as a possible strategy to improve the timing of referrals. This study also presents an opportunity for further <b>epidemiological</b> <b>inquiry</b> that may contribute to the organisationâ€™s cancer prevention efforts...|$|E
