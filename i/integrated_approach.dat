5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an <b>integrated</b> <b>approach,</b> which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and rural planning.|$|E

The second award, received in 2007, was for the development of a PhD Prep Track to prepare MAcc students to enroll in a PhD program after graduation. For 2013, the bachelor's degree in the School of Accountancy received two #3 rankings, one by Public Accounting Report and the other by U.S. News & World Report. The same two reporting agencies also ranked the school's MAcc program #2 and #7 in the nation, respectively.|$|E

40|$|The optical-flow {{approach}} {{has emerged as}} a major technique for estimating scene and object motion in image sequences. However, the results obtained by most optical flow techniques are strongly affected by motion discontinuities and by large illumination changes. While there do exist many separate techniques for robust estimation of optical flow in the presence of motion discontinuities and for dealing with the problems caused by illumination variations, only a few <b>integrated</b> <b>approaches</b> have been proposed. How-ever, most of these previously proposed <b>integrated</b> <b>approaches</b> use simple models of illumination variation; a common assumption being that illumination changes by either just a multiplicative factor or just an additive factor from frame to frame, but not both. Some other previously proposed <b>integrated</b> <b>approaches</b> are limited to specialized tasks such as image registration or change recovery. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper presents a new robust approach to general motion estimation in an <b>integrated</b> framework. Our <b>approach</b> deals simultaneously with motion discontinuities and large illumination variations. Our model of illumination variation is general, {{in the sense that it}} admits both multiplicative and additive effects.
