To apply reasonable cuts on the allowed parameter regions we perform a precise calculation of the Higgs mass. In addition, we include the limits from direct SUSY searches and dark matter abundance.

25|$|As an example, marlin lures are {{typically}} 7-14 inches or more long with a shaped plastic or metal {{head and a}} plastic skirt. The design of the lure head, particularly its face, gives the lure its individual action when trolled through the water. Lure actions range from an active side-to-side swimming pattern to pushing water aggressively on the surface to, most commonly, tracking along {{in a straight line}} with a regular surface pop and bubble trail. Besides the shape, weight and size of the lure head, the length and thickness of skirting, the number and size of hooks and the length and size of the leader used in lure rigging all influence the action of the lure: how actively it will run and how it will respond to different sea conditions. Experienced anglers <b>fine</b> <b>tune</b> their lures to get the action they want.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} called hybrid particle swarm optimization like algorithm (hybrid PSO) with <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> operators to solve optimisation problems.

In order to accelerate the PSO algorithms to obtain the global optimal solution, three <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> operators, namely mutation, cross-over and root mean square variants are introduced. The effectiveness of the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> elements with various PSO algorithms is tested through three benchmark functions along with a few recently developed state-of-the-art methods and the results are compared with those obtained without the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> elements.

40|$|For {{some types}} of visuo-motor transformations like large visuo-motor {{rotations}} or the complex transformation of a sliding first-order lever, distinct adaptive processes have been hypothesized that produce a rapid, discrete approximation of the transformation and a slow, graded <b>fine</b> <b>tuning,</b> respectively. Here we investigate whether part-task training of only the second of these processes, namely the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning,</b> transfers to the subsequent performance in a condition with the full transformation of the sliding first-order lever. Therefore, we compared performance of three groups with different practice conditions during transfer to the full transformation. While two groups only practiced the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> without the right-left inversion of the lever prior to transfer, a third group practiced the full lever transformation. Our results show a positive, but less than perfect transfer of the isolated practice of the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> on performance with the full transformation. For the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> itself, transfer was not reliably different from being perfect. The observation that the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> can be acquired separately and added to the later adaptation to the left-right inversion of the lever supports the notion that these slow and fast processes progress rather independently. The additional finding that the preceding acquisition of the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> also facilitates the subsequent rapid process {{could be due to}} generalized learning-to-learn or to a more precise assignment of movement errors to the process from which they originate...|$|R

The normal downloaded Chrome installer puts the browser in the user's local app data directory and provides invisible background updates, but the MSI package will allow installation at the system level, providing system administrators control over the update process it was formerly possible only when Chrome was installed using Google Pack.

These [...] "feeler ailerons" [...] were used to provide feedback forces to the pilot's control yoke and to <b>fine</b> <b>tune</b> the roll axes during delicate maneuvers such as aerial refueling.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{framework}} of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) we evaluate the electroweak <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> measure that provides a quantitative test of supersymmetry as a solution to the hierarchy problem. Taking account of current experimental constraints we compute the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> at two-loop order and determine the limits on the CMSSM parameter space and the measurements at the LHC most relevant in covering it. Without imposing the LEPII bound on the Higgs mass, it is shown that the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> computed at two-loop has a minimum Δ= 8. 8 corresponding to a Higgs mass mh= 114 ± 2 GeV. Adding the constraint that the SUSY dark matter relic density should be within present bounds we find Δ= 15 corresponding to mh= 114. 7 ± 2 GeV and this rises to Δ= 17. 8 (mh= 115. 9 ± 2 GeV) for SUSY dark matter abundance within 3 σ of the WMAP constraint. We extend the analysis to include the contribution of dark matter <b>fine</b> <b>tuning.</b> In this case the overall <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> and Higgs mass are only marginally larger for the case SUSY dark matter is subdominant and rises to Δ= 28. 7 (mh= 116. 98 ± 2 GeV) for the case of SUSY dark matter saturates the WMAP bound. For a Higgs mass above these values, <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> rises exponentially fast. The CMSSM spectrum that corresponds to minimal <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> is computed and provides a benchmark for future searches. It is characterised by heavy squarks and sleptons and light neutralinos, charginos and gluinos...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on work that investigates the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in low scale non-minimal supersymmetric models. We present a {{comparative}} and systematic study of the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in Higgs sectors in three scale-invariant NMSSM models: the first being the standard Z 3 invariant NMSSM; {{the second is the}} NMSSM plus additional matter filling 3 (5 + 5) representations of SU(5) and is called the NMSSM+; while the third model comprises 4 (5 + 5) and is called the NMSSM++. Naively, one would expect the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the plus-type models to be smaller than that in the NMSSM since the presence of extra matter relaxes the perturbativity bound on ? at the low scale. This, in turn, allows larger tree-level Higgs mass and smaller loop contribution from the stops. However we find that LHC limits on the masses of sparticles, especially the gluino mass, can play an indirect, but vital, role in controlling the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning.</b> In particular, working in a semi-constrained framework at the GUT scale, we find that the masses of third generation stops are always larger in the plus-type models than in the NMSSM without extra matter. This is an RGE effect which cannot be avoided, and as a consequence the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the NMSSM+ (? ~ 200) is significantly larger than in the NMSSM (? ~ 100), with <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the NMSSM++ (? ~ 600) being significantly larger than in the NMSSM+. Moreover, supersymmetric unified models in which the Z’ couples to the Higgs doublets, as in the E 6 class of models, have large <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> dominated by the experimental mass limit on the Z’. To illustrate this we investigate the degree of <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> throughout the parameter space of the Constrained Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (cE 6 SSM) that is consistent with a Higgs mass mh ~ 125 GeV. Fixing tan ? = 10, and taking specific values of the mass of the Z’ boson, with MZ’ ~ 2 - 4 TeV. We find that the minimum <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> set predominantly from the mass of Z’ and varies from ~ 200 - 400 as we vary MZ’ from~ 2 - 4 TeV. However, this is lower than the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the constrained Minimal Supersymmetic Standard Model (cMSSM) of 0 (1000), arising from the large stop masses required to achieve the Higgs mass. Finally, it was found that varying tan ? below and above 10 does not correspond to lower <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the cE 6 SSM, nor does lowering the mass of the Z’ by lowering its associated coupling g’...|$|R
