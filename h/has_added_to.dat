5|$|As {{an iconic}} skill, bicycle kicks are an {{important}} part of association football culture. Executing a bicycle kick in a competitive football match, particularly in scoring a goal, usually garners wide attention in the sports media. The bicycle kick has been featured in works of art, such as sculptures, films, advertisements, and literature. The manoeuvre is also used in other similar ball sports, particularly in the variants of association football like futsal and beach soccer. The controversy over the move's invention and name in Brazil, Chile, and Peru (and its status as an element of the notable Chile–Peru football rivalry) <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the kick's acclaim in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{is home to}} many {{cultures}} and {{a wide variety of}} ethnic groups, traditions, and values. Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the Pakistani {{government}} implemented an autonomy {{package for}} Gilgit-Baltistan, which entails rights {{similar to those}} of Pakistan’s other provinces. Gilgit-Baltistan thus gains province-like status without actually being conferred such status constitutionally. Direct rule by Islamabad has been replaced by an elected legislative assembly under a chief minister. The 2009 reform has not satisfied locals who demand citizenship rights and it has continued to leave Gilgit Baltistan's constitutional status within Pakistan undefined; although it <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the self-identification of the territory. According to Antia Mato Bouzas, the PPP-led Pakistani government had attempted a compromise between its official position on Kashmir and the demands of a population where the majority may have pro-Pakistan sentiments.|$|E

25|$|Cultural {{globalization}} {{refers to}} the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values {{around the world in}} such a way as to extend and intensify social relations. This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, popular culture media, and international travel. This <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.|$|E
25|$|Although Ramallah and its {{immediate}} region, {{now known as}} Area A, came under collaborative or joint Israeli-Palestinian Authority (PA) administration in September 1995, with civil administration vested fully in the PA, occasionally there have been breaches in security matters (beginning with 2002 in an IDF operation codenamed Operation Defensive Shield), and more recently in March 2017 while attempting to arrest a suspected terrorist, which saw Israeli military intervention in Ramallah. In 2002, the army imposed curfews, electricity cuts, school closures and disruptions of commercial life. Many Ramallah institutions, including government ministries, were vandalized, and equipment was destroyed or stolen. The IDF took over local Ramallah television stations, and social and economic conditions deteriorated. Many expatriates left, as did many other Palestinians who complained that the living conditions had become intolerable. Construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> Ramallah's isolation.|$|E
25|$|Major {{excavations}} {{beginning with}} C. A. Ralegh Radford's {{work in the}} 1930s on and around {{the site of the}} 12th-century castle have revealed that Tintagel headland was the site of a high status Celtic monastery (according to Ralegh Radford) or a princely fortress and trading settlement dating to the 5th and 6th centuries (according to later excavators), in the period immediately following the withdrawal of the Romans from Britain. Finds of Mediterranean oil and wine jars show that Sub-Roman Britain was not the isolated outpost it was previously considered to be, for an extensive trade in high-value goods was taking place at the time with the Mediterranean region. Finds from the excavations are preserved at the Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro. In 1998, excavations discovered the Artognou stone, which <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> Tintagel's Arthurian lore, although historians do not believe the inscription refers to King Arthur. Two seasons of excavation work were undertaken in Tintagel churchyard in the early 1990s.|$|E

500|$|There are six bridges along {{current or}} former {{sections}} of US2 that MDOT <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> its listing of Michigan's Historic Bridges; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A third bridge added to the NRHP in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT's listing however. The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River, which has since been bypassed by a new bridge. The original structure, dating to 1918, is a [...] spandrel arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No.191. The structure was listed on the NRHP on December 9, 1999, for its architectural and engineering significance.|$|E

He continually fails at being a good father, but he never gives up trying, and in some basic and important sense that makes him a good father." [...] The Sunday Times remarked [...] "Homer is good because, above all, he is capable of great love.

[...] "Dothraki", the series' nomadic horsemen, was ranked fourth in a September 2012 Global Language Monitor list of words from television most used on the Internet. In 2012, the media used [...] "Game of Thrones" [...] as a figure of speech or comparison for situations of intense conflict and deceit, such as the 2012 United States Supreme Court decision regarding healthcare reform legislation, the Syrian Civil War and the ousting of Bo Xilai from the Chinese government.|$|E
