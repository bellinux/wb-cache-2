25|$|In Christian {{belief and}} practice, a sacrament is a rite, instituted by Christ, that mediates grace, constituting a sacred mystery.

25|$|Norbert Wiener's {{book was}} {{the forerunner of}} studies in cybernetics, and has {{influenced}} many theorists. It has impacted the fields of computers and technology, engineering, biology, sociology, and {{a broad range of}} other sciences. Numerous books have been published in relation to cybernetics theory which explore alternative concepts and models of feedback, human/machine relationships, systems science, and industrial advancement. William Ross Ashby, another founder of cybernetics, wrote the book Introduction to Cybernetics, which presents many new interpretations and definitions. Other theorists have produced writings on systems, communication, and the human experience in cybernetics. N. Katherine Hayles, author of How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics, describes the effects of technology in the age of virtual information and what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> humans to live in an ever-advancing society. The American Society for Cybernetics (ASC) is a research association founded in 1964, the same year Wiener died, and is dedicated to the cooperative understanding and further improvement of cybernetics theory.|$|E

25|$|Understanding and {{accepting}} the psychological state {{an individual is}} in is paramount. There are many mis-conceptions of what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> a traumatized individual to be in crisis or 'psychosis'. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and cannot comfort themselves, if treated humanely and respectfully they will not get to a state {{in which they are}} a danger. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance they will be taken seriously and not just as a sick, delusional individual. It is vital for the assessor to understand that {{what is going on in}} the traumatized persons head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., posttraumatic symptoms, dissociation, substance abuse, somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established rapport and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, abandonment issues, and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.|$|E

He provided the first axiomatic measure-theoretic description of coin-tossing, which was to influence the full axiomatization of probability by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov a decade later. Steinhaus was also the first to offer precise definitions of what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> two events to be [...] "independent", as well as for what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> a random variable to be [...] "uniformly distributed".|$|E

These are the main points of inquiry behind studies into lexical semantics, structural semantics, and theories of compositionality (respectively).
