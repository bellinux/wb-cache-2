5|$|As {{automobile}} use {{in southern}} Ontario {{grew in the}} early 20th century, road design and construction advanced significantly. A major issue faced by planners was the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> routes connecting Toronto and Hamilton, which were consistently overburdened by the growing traffic levels.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{began to}} quickly develop and grow with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's {{dramatic}} <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microscope. It {{was then that}} scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E

5|$|An <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CFM56-5A series, it was {{originally}} designed to power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000lbf (98kN and 147kN) it can power every model in the A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.|$|E

An <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simple lever-and- tilt hammer device operated by one's foot, the hydraulic-powered trip hammer used for pounding, , and polishing grain was first mentioned in the Han dictionary Jijiupian of 40 BCE. It was also mentioned in the Regional Speech (Fangyan) dictionary written by Yang Xiong (53 BCE– 18 CE) in 15 BCE, the philosophical Xinlun 新論 written by Huan Tan (43 BCE– 28 CE) in 20 CE, the poetry of Ma Rong (79–166 CE), and the writings of Kong Rong (153–208 CE).|$|E

The rebuilding of locks 6 and 7, completed in 2000, brought the number of locks restored to five, and approximately one quarter of the canal has been restored to navigable standard. Much <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towpath has also taken place, and access to it is possible at most of the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight {{services}} and concentrate on the electrification and <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core routes in London. He saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes. On 1 June 1935 the LPTB gave the required six months' notice to the O that it intended to terminate operations on the Brill Tramway.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} to several offices within the Buenos Aires Cabildo in the 1781-1794 period. On April 7, 1789, he helped a number of shoemakers to establish a guild. Although there were several in Spain, no guild constitution from Spain {{was used as a}} model. He promoted the pavement of the streets, and the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings. Supported by the viceroy Nicolás Antonio de Arredondo, he collected $8,000 and provided 500 cattle to mine rocks from the Martín García Island for this work. He married his cousin Justa Rufina de Basavilbaso y Garfias on February 6, 1795.|$|E

5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient {{breast harness}} was the horse collar. The horse collar was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 accurately displays the cushioned collar behind the cross bar. An earlier {{painting of the}} Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted the horse collar as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{the road}} from Marcellus to Camillus along the Nine Mile Creek route was {{improved}} by the Camillus and Marcellus Plank Road Company, which was first chartered in 1853 and authorized to collect tolls from travelers using the road. The <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road led to it becoming a stagecoach route {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. The former plank road alignment in the village of Marcellus (North Street) and the southward continuation along Cherry Street (now South Street) was paved in 1911 as part of the construction of a new state highway that would pass through the town.|$|E

5|$|Institutionally, Reitz {{did much}} for the {{codification}} and review {{of the laws of}} the Orange Free State. With his colleagues C.J. Vels, O.J. Truter, and J.G. Fraser Reitz published the first Ordonnantie boek van den Oranje Vrijstaat (Ordinance Book of the Orange Free State) in 1877, making the acts and ordinances of the republic available to the larger public. He also {{played a role in the}} revision of the constitution of the Orange Free State, with regard to articles on citizenship and the right to vote, was chairman of the examination committee for aspirant practitioners, and contributed to the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison system and the district administration.|$|E

5|$|The fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottomans {{was a clear}} sign to the {{cautious}} {{citizens of}} Dubrovnik that ample defensive measures were quickly needed, the strengthening of its defensive structures the foremost of the issues. The fall of Bosnia, which followed soon in 1463, only hastened the works. As a result, the Republic invited the architect Michelozzo di Bartolomeo of Florence to direct the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's defenses. His work in Dubrovnik resulted in the construction and expansion of numerous buildings of key importance {{for the defense of}} Dubrovnik.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand of manganese dioxide. Until the development batteries with nickel-cadmium and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.|$|E
