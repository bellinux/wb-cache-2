500|$|Rang De Basanti {{suffered}} a significant setback {{when one of}} the initial producers ultimately failed to contribute any funds towards it; the shortfall left production looking uncertain just two months away from the beginning of principal photography. However, after Aamir Khan agreed to act in the film, Mehra approached Ronnie Screwvala of UTV Motion Pictures with the script. Screwvala, who supported Mehra {{from the beginning of the}} production, had faith in the film, reasoning that in historical films, [...] "the treatment and execution is very different from regular masala fare", and that such films [...] "find favour with the audience owing to their elaborate sets and period costumes". The budget was reported as Rs.250million (approximately US$5.5million), and, despite <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over the initially planned budget, Mehra did not have any serious disagreements with UTV.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of Act Two, Mal and Jill hastily agree not to tell anyone what has {{happened}} and to act out each other's lives as normal. Sam notices something is strange – Jill (in Mal's body) daintily and meticulously cleans the kitchen surface, whilst Mal (in Jill's body) slouches and wears the most ghastly choice of clothes [...] but ignores it. Jill goes to work and, to Dean's astonishment, sets to work cleaning the furniture in the shop. She also defuses the problems that Mal created the previous day, although <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over the top in dealing with a stressed member of staff.|$|E

2500|$|Schoolboy Q had {{initially}} announced guest appearances {{on the album}} to include Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, ASAP Rocky, Danny Brown, and Action Bronson, while the production would be handled by in-house producers from Top Dawg Entertainment, such as Digi+Phonics members Sounwave and Tae Beast. In December 2012, Schoolboy Q revealed his collaboration with fellow American rapper Danny Brown, to be titled [...] "Eat." [...] However Schoolboy Q later revealed the song would not appear on the album. In a February 2013 interview, Schoolboy Q said he was [...] "like four records away from being done". During the same interview he claimed {{the making of the}} album was [...] "stressful and fun at the same time". He also stated there was a point in the recording process where he was stuck because he [...] "couldn't find the right beats." [...] In March 2013, he would later say: [...] "I stopped recording for about two months to gather my thoughts and see how I was gonna attack the album. At first I was <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too party. Then I started going too story. I was almost trying to make an album like Kendrick's. You try so many things. Now, I've finally got the right perfect mixture." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the two assault {{companies}} came ashore, a small {{spotter plane}} on an observation mission flew overhead, dropping grenades {{in lieu of}} the promised air support from the 5th Air Force. According to U.S. Marine Corps historians, Hough and Shaw, citing Lieutenant Colonel Isamu Murayama's Southeast Area Operations Record, this impromptu air support was later described by the defenders as heavy. As the initial force pushed inland, several small scale clashes occurred, but the landing was largely unopposed. A beachhead was established about [...] inland and patrols were sent out– on the right Company 'A' quickly met its objective, but on the left Company 'B' found the <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> harder due to swampy ground, which forced them to outflank it around the foothills of Lower Mount Worri where they encountered a small group of Japanese. To sea, the follow on waves were controlled by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Amory, in his own vessel, acting to ensure that the beach was not swamped by too many landing craft {{at the same time to}} ensure an orderly disembarkation as the 2nd Battalion followed up the 1st, moving through the beachhead towards Bitokara Mission. Nevertheless, the coral reefs slowed the boats coming in, forcing them to sail in single file, while the confines of landing beach made unloading slow and the requirement to manpack all equipment also added to the delays. Artillery landing on the water's edge suffered heavily from the Japanese mortars firing on the beach, while the medical staff on the beach also suffered heavily.|$|E
60|$|I {{raised my}} eyebrows at this. It {{seemed to me}} that Mr. de Valentin was <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too far.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no danger," [...] said Rollo. [...] "There is an {{excellent}} railing. I am only <b>going</b> up <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way {{to see how far}} these straight stairs go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, if you won't {{throttle}} a man; {{and let me}} get Tony in here," [...] he added, <b>going</b> on <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{way towards}} <b>a</b> small inn stable- yard.|$|R
60|$|All right. We'll be back. We're just <b>going</b> to have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> talk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] said Mr. Cleveland, sternly, [...] "you are <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too far. My private affairs do {{not concern}} the public." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now tell me, sir, if you please," [...] he continued, [...] "what {{brings out}} his Majesty's ship Drake this fine morning? <b>Going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> airing?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not I," [...] said Boldwood, growing red. [...] "Liddy, you needn't {{stay here}} {{a minute later}} than you wish, so Mr. Oak says. I am now <b>going</b> on <b>a</b> <b>little</b> farther. Good-afternoon." ...|$|R
60|$|On <b>going</b> along <b>a</b> <b>little</b> farther, Rollo {{pointed out}} another house to Mr. George where lamps were {{arranged}} for an illumination; and then, presently, another. Mr. George accordingly stopped {{to ask a}} policeman what it meant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me see," [...] said Hans. Mirah in her childlike way {{turned toward}} him to be looked at; and he, <b>going</b> to <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further distance, knelt with one knee on a hassock to survey her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say!" [...] he cried. [...] "Look here! Aren't you <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too far? This--this is degradation--making a fuss with sleeves. You mustn't {{do things}} like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{closer and}} look into this," [...] said Dave, firmly. [...] "Perhaps it's all right, but that old man may not know Haskers as we do." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was not a}} {{sufficient}} relief to his feelings, and yet he seemed unable to think of any other expression more suitable to the occasion, for after <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further, he repeated, [...] "Curse the jade!" ...|$|E
6000|$|As they {{returned}} to the porch, Bertha put her hand on Haney's shoulder, in the manner of one man to another, saying: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> ride with these people, Captain, if you don't mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, all his {{horses and}} all his men,' Humpty Dumpty went on. 'They'd pick me up again in a minute, THEY would! However, this {{conversation}} is <b>going</b> on <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too fast: let's {{go back to the}} last remark but one.' ...|$|R
60|$|With that, <b>going</b> to <b>a</b> <b>little</b> drawer, he {{produced}} a small basket, filled with a curious looking unfinished frame-work of wood, and several bits of wood unattached. It looked like a nursery basket containing broken odds and ends of playthings.|$|R
6000|$|... "By <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nearer," [...] {{said the}} Sergeant, [...] "some {{of us may}} {{recognize}} the place. Most of us know the American shore {{in this part of}} the lake; and it will be something gained to learn our position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [816:1] A {{rejected}} address--which poor Charles was restless to have used. I fitted {{him with}} an Epilogue of the same calibre with his Prologue, but I {{thought it would be}} <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too far to publish mine. MS. H.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} {{think you}} would be warranted in considering me very much at fault for <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> beyond it. I admit that it would please me to see Ingleby driven out of the valley. The fellow's presumption is almost insufferable." ...|$|E

60|$|He let fall Tito's hand, and <b>going</b> {{backwards}} <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> first {{rested his}} arm on a projecting {{stone in the}} wall, and then sank again in a sitting posture on the straw. The outleap of fury in the dagger-thrust had evidently exhausted him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{time out}} of your life, Lady Angela," [...] I answered. [...] "It is necessary: Lord Chelsford knows that. But I am not going in disgrace. I am very thankful {{to be able to}} tell you that." ...|$|R
60|$|This was <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{further than}} Gif had anticipated. He knew that Brown {{was a fairly}} good player, {{carrying}} considerable weight, and that the cadet's heart would be almost broken if he {{was taken out of}} the games entirely.|$|E
60|$|With {{great joy}} the boys seized the bundle, and <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{distance}} off examined its contents. After {{a good deal}} of trying on they each found things that fitted them fairly. Feeling vastly more comfortable in their new attire, they rejoined the sailors.|$|E
60|$|Fan {{rose and}} {{followed}} her through a back door opening on to a grassy lawn, beyond which were the garden and orchard. After crossing the lawn and <b>going</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way among the shrubs and flowers they came in sight of a large apple-tree white with blossoms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, good night. I'm <b>going</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stroll." [...] His {{brain was}} too active to sleep. He kissed his mother {{good night and}} {{went out into the}} road, his hat in his hand, the cool, moist wind on his hair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Grooton," [...] he said, [...] "I {{rely upon}} {{you to see}} that Lord Cheisford has this note shortly. I am <b>going</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> walk, and shall {{probably}} return this way. I wish you {{to understand that this}} note is for Lord Chelsford's own hand." ...|$|R
60|$|After <b>going</b> on <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{way beyond}} this, {{they began to}} {{approach}} the town of Aigle. Mrs. Holiday was surprised {{that she could have}} come so far with so little fatigue. Rollo told her that it was because she had walked along so slowly.|$|R
