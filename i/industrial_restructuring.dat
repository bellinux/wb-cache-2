Historically, the docks at Salford Quays were an industrial port, though are now (following a period of disuse) a commercial and residential area which includes the Imperial War Museum North and The Lowry theatre and exhibition centre. The BBC is now established in their new home at MediaCityUK, at Salford Quays. This is home to BBC North West, several BBC departments, including BBC Sport, Blue Peter and, since April 2012, BBC Breakfast. Rochdale and Manchester are connected to the history of the cooperative movement; the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers (an early consumer co-operative) was founded in Rochdale in 1844, and The Co-operative Group, the UK's largest mutual business and North West England's biggest company, is headquartered at One Angel Square in central Manchester. Despite this economic diversification, as of November 2012, government plans are under development to revive textile production in Greater Manchester, and restore it as the national home of British textile manufacture.|$|E

40|$|The growing <b>industrial</b> <b>restructure</b> and {{movements}} of cooperation, increase pressures by reducing costs and increasing productivity, thus it has generated {{the formation of}} new arrangements between the companies, with focus on clusters. The clusters are formed when the similar areas and geographical aspects are concentrated and where the expertise and innovation are essential for companies to reach markets beyond their borders. On the other hand, {{one of the challenges}} in developing a cluster is related to its sustainability, in the economic, social and environmental dimensions. Thus, in this essay, we propose a conceptual model that addresses the relationship between clusters and sustainability, taking into account the perspective of networks. Such a model, spiral shaped, involves basic (actors, governance mechanisms, resources and location), intermediate (cluster strength and openness, integration and adaptation, knowledge creation / inventory and movement, exploitation and exploration actions) and resulting aspects (performance and sustainability of the cluster), in a context of life cycle and environmental dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Since the 1980 s, <b>industrial</b> forest <b>restructuring</b> has {{resulted}} in the divestment of industrial timberlands across the U. S. Emerging tenures have benefited from the divestment, including conservation-based tenures that manage for multiple objectives such as restoration, recreation access, and forest and habitat contiguity. Deschutes and Klamath Counties, Oregon, have three proposed conservation tenures: a community forest, a state forest, and a tribal forest. The community forest would be {{the first of its kind}} in the state, a large, land trust-owned forest at the edge of a rapidly-growing city. The state forest, geographically more isolated, would be the first state-owned forest in Oregon in 60 years. The tribal forest, also geographically isolated, would return former reservation land to the Klamath Tribes, which were terminated in 1954. All three forest ownership opportunities were created through opportunistic risk-taking, the leverage of political and human capitals, social networks, strong leadership, and land availability as a result of <b>industrial</b> forest <b>restructuring.</b> This case study research used multiple methods, including interviews and document analysis, to explore the forests' unique histories, and draws lessons about changing community capacities, forest management, and forest governance and under these emerging tenures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} China’s water utilization efficiency {{using the}} directional distance function {{to take into}} account the environmental degradation affecting the economy. We further analyze the spatial correlation and the factors influencing the utilization efficiency using spatial panel data models. The results show that water utilization efficiency in China differs between provinces and regions. For example, water utilization efficiency in the eastern coastal provinces is significantly higher than that of inland provinces. The pattern of spatial auto-correlation Moran’s I index presents significant spatial auto-correlation and evident cluster tendencies in China’s inter-provincial water utilization. Factors that contribute to water utilization efficiency include economic development, technological progress, and economic openness. Negative factors affecting water utilization efficiency arise from industrial structure, government interference, and water resources endowment. In addition, the price of water resources is insignificant. The improvement of water utilization efficiency is essential to sustainable economic development. To raise the utilization efficiency of water resources, China should focus on transforming its <b>industrial</b> <b>restructure,</b> advancing technological development, enhancing economic openness, and encouraging entrepreneurial innovations. Moreover, establishing a mechanism to encourage water conservation and reduce wastewater pollution will further increase water utilization efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at {{studying}} the degree of similarity and qualitative differences {{of the process of}} <b>restructuring</b> <b>industrial</b> enterprises and innovation process, implemented at the micro level, as well as clarifying the place of innovation problematics in the overall problem of strategic management of development and, in particular, <b>restructuring</b> <b>industrial</b> enterprises. It has been shown that the process of <b>restructuring</b> <b>industrial</b> enterprises as a management object is a more general concept than the concept of an innovation process undertaken at the enterprise level; the list of tasks arising from strategic management of the innovation process is by its nature identical to the set of tasks to be solved in managing the restructuring of enterprises; the same set of methods for analysis, forecast and decision-making can be used to meet these challenges. The intersubordination of the process of restructuring and innovation process at the enterprise level, identified in the article, makes topical the problem of the correct consideration of innovation factor in the tasks of strategic management of restructuring enterprises, refining the methodology and methodical approaches to considering this factor in the strategic decision-making, which {{can be seen as a}} direction for further research in this area...|$|R

With expansion of the auto industry in the early 20th century, the city and its suburbs experienced rapid growth, and by the 1940s, the city had become the fourth-largest in the country.

Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census, Detroit's population has declined by more than 60 per cent. In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Industrial</b> {{structure}} <b>restructuring</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} features that measure the development of national economy. Input-output analysis on industrial structure is a vital method to investigate industrial inner mechanism. Therefore, to <b>restructure</b> the <b>industrial</b> structure in Hubei Province, the input-output analysis has been implemented. Results show that the influence coefficient of heavy chemical sectors and light manufacturing industries is relatively large. The stimulating effect of consumer is relatively comprehensive to sectors in Hubei. And the investment mainly stimulates the heavy chemical sectors and manufacturing industries. Furthermore, according to the focused industries from “Twelfth Five-Year Plan ” in Hubei, secondary industry still accounts for too large after the simulative adjustments of industrial structure, so the industrial structure is not completely rational...|$|R
