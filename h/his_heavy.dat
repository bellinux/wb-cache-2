5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still {{in pursuit of the}} Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E

5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} {{of a brain}} haemorrhage, {{followed by}} competing reports {{that he had been}} mugged and even that he had drunk himself to death. Later, there was speculation about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death– pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> drinking his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.|$|E

He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} the fiction is thought by Donald Tuck to have {{generally}} fallen during Santesson's period at the helm, though this was not entirely his faultthere were a great many other magazines competing for stories by the top writers. Santesson himself, despite a modicum of controversy over <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> use of UFO and related material, was kind and helpful to writers, and was well liked as a result.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{had long}} been neglectful of his health and diet, smoking heavily, and rarely exercising. <b>His</b> <b>heavy</b> {{drinking}} had charmed the reporters in Philadelphia in 1940, but by 1944 it was becoming a problem.

5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on {{the ship}} {{of the line and}} by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in the stern of the ship. Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{collapse}} of the Imperial army, the battle proved to be of little strategic significance. At the insistence of Francis I, the French army resumed the siege of Carignano, where Colonna held out for several weeks. Soon after the city's surrender, Enghien was forced to send twenty-three companies of Italian and Gascon infantry—and nearly half <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> cavalry—to Picardy, which had been invaded by Charles V. Left without a real army, Enghien was unable to capture Milan. D'Avalos, meanwhile, routed a fresh force of Italian infantry under Pietro Strozzi and the Count of Pitigliano at the Battle of Serravalle. The end of the war saw a return to the status quo in northern Italy.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E

He organised the new department and co-ordinated Australia's repatriation effort, and was briefly acting Prime Minister in 1919, when he settled a seamen's strike. Millen resigned from the ministry in February 1923 and died later that year, his illness attributed to <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> workload in the post-war years.|$|E
5|$|In July 1801, First Consul Bonaparte {{appointed}} d'Hautpoul as inspector-general of {{the cavalry}} and then awarded him {{command of the}} cavalry in the camps of Compiègne and Saint-Omer. In August 1805, d'Hautpoul was given command of the 2nd division of cuirassiers under Joachim Murat. At Austerlitz, d'Hautpoul distinguished himself by leading <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> cavalry into the Russian center at the Pratzen heights, breaking the infantry squares. In 1804, Napoleon made him a grand officer (grand cordon) of the Légion d'honneur and a senator, which carried with it an annual income of 20,000 francs.|$|E

5|$|In November 1940, Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{was sent}} to the Naval Gunnery School at Wik to {{complete}} <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> gun training courses, which ended his position as Lindemann's personal adjutant. Lindemann's new adjutant was the signals officer Second Lieutenant Wolfgang Reiner. Bismarcks heavy guns were first test-fired {{in the second half of}} November, and Bismarck was shown to be a very stable gun platform. After the 1940 Christmas celebration on board, Lindemann and the majority of the officers, non-commissioned officers and sailors went on home leave. First gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider relieved Lindemann as Bismarcks commander during his absence. Lindemann spent his leave with his wife and daughter and returned on 1 January 1941.|$|E
5|$|Wishing to {{capitalize}} on Soult's failure to defend Bordeaux, Wellington sent Beresford and the 4th and 7th Divisions to seize the seaport. Beresford departed the Allied camp on 7 March and occupied Bordeaux on 12 March. Leaving the 7th Division as an occupation force, Beresford hurried back with the 4th Division to join Wellington on 19 March. During this period, Allied infantry strength fell to 29,000 which was why Wellington did not trouble Soult. To {{make up for the}} deficit, the British army commander called for <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> cavalry brigades to join him. He also asked for 8,000 Spanish reinforcements to be forwarded to the army, the soldiers to be paid by the British treasury. The Battle of Toulouse would be fought on 10 April.|$|E
5|$|Abram Lincoln Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 – November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic {{of blacks in the}} United States. Considered by many as the first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for <b>his</b> <b>heavy</b> influence on black radical and neo-conservative thought in the United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance on racial relations by examining historical black involvement in the workplace, and suggested that African Americans needed to take more action in race relations.|$|E
