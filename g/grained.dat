5|$|Monument 141 is a {{very well}} {{preserved}} hieroglyphic panel carved from fine <b>grained</b> white limestone with almost the whole inscription intact. It describes the dedication of a ballcourt by K'inich B'aaknal Chaak.|$|E
5|$|Pyroclastic density {{currents}} can also produce ash particles. These are typically produced by lava dome collapse or {{collapse of the}} eruption column. Within pyroclastic {{density currents}} particle abrasion occurs as particles {{interact with each other}} resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine <b>grained</b> ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within the flow. These processes produce large quantities of very fine <b>grained</b> ash which is removed from pyroclastic density currents in co-ignimbrite ash plumes.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka {{cues from}} the Gus Szamboti era are typified by {{straight}} <b>grained</b> maple forearms bearing four ebony points, with four veneers included, normally colored black, green, white and mahogany, or sometimes with an orange veneer {{in place of}} mahogany. Balabushka cues from this era, spanning {{the last five years}} of his life, are considered the finest of his career as a class. There have been unconfirmed rumors that some few cues made during this period included splices made by Balabushka himself.|$|E
5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine <b>grained</b> ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are driven from thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which are driven by thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature {{difference between the two}} causes violent water-lava interactions that make up the eruption. The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer <b>grained</b> than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} room, {{like the}} exterior, is oriented east-west. The most prominent decorative element inside is the hand graining detail {{on the wood}} surfaces. An elevated gallery lines the north wall facing the pews which are bisected by 3½ ft (1.1 m) tall, 5 in (13cm) wide beaded board partition. The pews, partition, door, and window trim are all hand <b>grained.</b> The interior walls are covered with 6 in (15cm) pine wainscotting. The original iron stoves have been replaced with oil-burning stoves, set into the original flues.|$|E
5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely <b>grained</b> iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{interior}} of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial magmatic activity around 58 million years ago in the Paleogene period. This comprises an outer ring of coarse granite and an inner core of finer <b>grained</b> granite, which was intruded later. This granite was intruded into the Late Proterozoic to Cambrian metasediments of the Dalradian Supergroup. Other Paleogene igneous rocks on Arran include extensive felsic and composite sills in the south of the island, and the central ring complex, an eroded caldera system surrounded by a near-continuous ring of granitic rocks.|$|E
5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse <b>grained</b> dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains {{are the source of}} the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E
5|$|Earl Thomas {{granted the}} manor to his steward, Robert de Holland, in February 1308. In 1311, Robert {{obtained}} a licence to crenellate from Edward II {{in order to}} fortify the manor house, and the more modest earlier building was converted into a castle between 1311 and 1322. Local tradition says that the stone was obtained from a quarry {{on the site of}} what is now Melbourne Pool. The records show £1,313 was spent on the project in the year 1313–14, of which £548 was paid to masons for dressing stone. Several masons working on the project were involved in an affray at Ravenstone in 1315. The important medieval buildings in Melbourne were constructed from the local bedrock, Millstone Grit. This is a coarsely <b>grained</b> sandstone which can be worked to produce good-quality ashlar. The village was centred around the church, castle and High Street until the late eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be as fine as 1 μm. The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer <b>grained</b> material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.|$|E
5|$|The rotund to {{ellipsoid}} spores are 7.5–10µm {{long and}} 6–7.6µm wide. The surface ornamentation extends to 0.5µm high and is mainly from warts and short, wide ridges, which are linked through few fine lines {{to form an}} incomplete net (reticulum). The suprahilar area, a distinctly limited zone above the , is weakly amyloid. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 45–60 × 9.5–12µm. They are roughly cylindrical to somewhat club-shaped and often have an oil droplet or a granular body. The sterigmata are 4.5–5.5µm long. The thin-walled pleurocystidia are sparse, but somewhat common near the gill edge. They are protruded and are 45–65µm long and 5–8µm wide, they are sometimes smaller near the gill edge. Nearly spindle-shaped, they are often straightened or constricted like a string of pearls at the apex. The body is often fine and <b>grained.</b> Pseudocystidia are largely present. They are 4–6µm wide and are sometimes protruded, but are often shorter than the basidioles (basidia in the early developmental stage). The basidioles are cylindric to spiral and have an ochre-coloured substance, similar to the laticifers. Near the top they are, however, almost hyaline (transparent). The gill edge is usually sterile and has a few to many cheilocystidia. The thin-walled cheiloleptocystidia are 15–25µm long and 5–10µm wide. They are almost club-shaped or irregularly shaped and transparent, and often contain a granular material. The cheilomacrocystidia are also thin-walled and measure 25–50µm long and 6–8µm wide. They are slightly spindle-shaped and often have a tip resembling a string of pearls; their interior is hyaline or granular. Laticifers are abundant, striking and body is ochre coloured. The cuticle of the cap is an ixocutis, whereby the hyphae are linked in a jellylike matrix, that can swell up in moisture to become heavily slimy.|$|E
5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine <b>grained</b> matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E
25|$|Association of {{the fine}} <b>grained</b> charnockite and the {{porphyritic}} biotite hornblende granite suggest common age (Omotoyinbo,1994).|$|E
25|$|The billet is {{used more}} uniformly so {{extrusion}} defects and coarse <b>grained</b> peripherals zones are less likely.|$|E
25|$|Shannons Flat Granodiorite is poor in xenoliths and is coarse <b>grained.</b> It was intruded {{after the}} clear Range Granodiorite.|$|E
25|$|All {{wood trim}} is No. 1 grade, oiled teak and {{includes}} hand rails on cabin, cabin trim, cockpit trim and rub rails. The tiller is straight <b>grained</b> ash.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no current}} {{commercial}} market for bigcone Douglas-fir wood due to limited distribution and access. It is heavy, hard, and fine <b>grained</b> but not durable. There is less sapwood than heartwood, {{and the latter}} contains pockets of resin.|$|E
25|$|The {{conglomerate}} {{is typically}} a medium to fine <b>grained</b> brown to buff sandstone consisting of angular to sub angular grains with scattered flakes of mica; {{it makes a}} good building stone. Conglomerates occur in the basal part of the sequence and shale bands that are micaceous occur in the highest beds. Viewed regionally, the conglomerates appear to be impersistent. Near {{the southern end of}} the district where the ground is not covered by drift three conglomerates can be mapped. The bottom and most important is mostly pebbles - quartz and quartzites with occasional grits and rarely some igneous. These are set in a medium to coarse <b>grained</b> sand matrix. the pebbles can be up to 100mm long.|$|E
25|$|Shale {{is a fine}} <b>grained,</b> hard, {{laminated}} mudrock, {{consisting of}} clay minerals, and quartz and feldspar silt. Shale is lithified and fissile. It must have at least 50-percent of its particles measure less than 0.062mm. This term is confined to argillaceous, or clay-bearing, rock.|$|E
25|$|The summit plateau is {{composed}} of volcaniclastic sandstone of the Seathwaite Fell Formation, with a dyke of andesite and hybridized andesite porphyry running due north from Sprinkling Tarn. The coarse <b>grained</b> sandstone and breccia of the Cam Crag Member is exposed further down the norther slope.|$|E
25|$|That {{entrance}} {{leads to}} a vestibule and then inside to the sanctuary. It features wainscoting beneath the chair rail as well as paneling on the gallery parapet, and painted and <b>grained</b> pews. The gallery and ceiling are supported by Doric columns, and the original 19th-century light fixtures.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} the Greenwood Granite, the Sutton Granite is a medium <b>grained</b> granite intruding the Pittman {{formation}} in the hills to the north east of Canberra Airport. The outcrop covers 4 square kilometres in the ACT. It was intruded during the late Silurian and is dated at 410+4Mya.|$|E
25|$|An infill plane has a body {{of metal}} filled with very dense and hard wood on which the blade rests and the handles are formed. They are {{typically}} of English or Scottish manufacture. They are prized {{for their ability to}} smooth difficult <b>grained</b> woods when set very finely.|$|E
25|$|As of the HiSeq 2500 Illumina {{gives the}} option to output qualities that have been coarse <b>grained</b> into quality bins. The binned scores are {{computed}} directly from the empirical quality score table, which is itself tied to the hardware, software and chemistry that were used during the sequencing experiment.|$|E
25|$|Other crop {{varieties}} bred {{and introduced}} to UK agriculture include Gartons Lupin in 1922, Gartons Field Parsnips (1902), Gartons Number 12 Potato (1912), Gartons Purple Sprouting Broccoli (1903), Gartons Giant Winter Bean (1922), GS Giant Winter Bean (1950), P/L 14 Giant Winter Bean (1954), Gartons Giant Large <b>Grained</b> Winter Rye (1922).|$|E
25|$|Proper {{preservation}} techniques {{slow down}} the rate of degradation. One method to combat the lichen, algae and moss problem is to smear in fine <b>grained</b> moist clay over the entire stone. This is then left to sit for a few weeks, which suffocates the organic matter and kills it.|$|E
25|$|Egg {{sizes are}} {{approximately}} 1.65cm to 2.36cm in length. Shape varies from oval to rounded and elongate oval. The shell is close <b>grained,</b> smooth and usually lustreless {{with a dull}} white base colour, over which is evenly distributed freckles and spots of blackish-brown, with underlying markings of dull bluish-grey (North 1909).|$|E
25|$|The Sepetiba Formation is the {{uppermost}} {{formation in the}} Santos Basin. It has a variable thickness due to the proximal erosion of {{the uppermost}} part. The formation consists of whitish grey fine to coarse <b>grained</b> carbonitic sands. They are feldspar-rich, glauconitic coquinas consisting of bivalve fragments and foraminifera. The depositional environment {{is thought to be}} coastal.|$|E
25|$|Atom probe has {{typically}} {{been employed}} in the chemical analysis of alloy systems at the atomic level. This has arisen {{as a result of}} voltage pulsed atom probes providing good chemical and sufficient spatial information in these materials. Metal samples from large <b>grained</b> alloys may be simple to fabricate, particularly from wire samples, with hand-electropolishing techniques giving good results.|$|E
25|$|Sapwood may {{range in}} colour from straw to grey-white with clear {{demarcation}} from the heartwood. The heartwood is golden to dark brown with chocolate growth rings. The timber is generally straight <b>grained</b> {{but may be}} wavy or interlocked. Quartersawn surfaces may produce an attractive fiddleback figure. The wood is lustrous and possesses a fine to medium texture.|$|E
25|$|Tidbinbilla Quartzite {{has been}} {{modified}} by granite intrusions close by. It consists of medium <b>grained</b> sandstone, partly silicified and changed to quartzite. Belts of silstone and sandstone are included becoming more frequent at the top. The exposure is 300 metres thick. Low down {{there is a}} 2-metre thick bed of ashstone across a broad area {{that can be used}} as a marker bed.|$|E
25|$|The world's rivers {{transport}} the largest volume of suspended and dissolved loads of clay and silt to the sea, {{where they are}} deposited on ocean shelves. At the poles, glaciers and floating ice drop deposits directly to the sea floor. Winds can provide fine <b>grained</b> material from arid regions, and explosive volcanic eruptions contribute as well. All of these sources vary {{in the rate of}} their contribution.|$|E
25|$|Another is the Hopi language's {{words for}} water, one {{indicating}} drinking {{water in a}} container and another indicating a natural body of water. These examples of polysemy served the double purpose of showing that indigenous languages sometimes made more fine <b>grained</b> semantic distinctions than European languages and that direct translation between two languages, even of seemingly basic concepts such as snow or water, is not always possible.|$|E
25|$|Narrabundah Ashstone is {{a member}} of the Canberra {{formation}} and is found is eastern Narrabundah and in a geological monument along Fairbairn avenue. Ashstone is a fine <b>grained</b> tuff. In addition to the ashstone the Canberra Formation has layers of green-grey to reddish dacite, also tuff, quartz andesite, but mostly it is calcareous shale, limestone or sandstone. Much is deeply weathered, which has posed difficulties for building foundations.|$|E
25|$|Docimian marble {{was highly}} admired and valued for its unique colors and fine <b>grained</b> quality, by ancients such as Romans. When the Romans took control over Docimian quarries, they were blown away about the {{beautiful}} color combinations of Docimian Pavonazzetto, {{which is a}} type of white marble with purple veins. A trend started about it right away. Emperors Augustus, Trajan, Hadrian, all made extensive use of Docimian marble to all their major building projects.|$|E
