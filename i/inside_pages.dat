25|$|In 1980 his brother, {{cardiologist}} Michael J. Halberstam, {{was shot}} and killed during a home invasion by escaped convict and prolific burglar Bernard C. Welch, Jr. His only public comment related to his brother's murder came when he and Michael's widow castigated Life magazine, then published monthly, for paying Michael's killer $9,000 to pose in jail for color photographs that appeared on <b>inside</b> <b>pages</b> of the February 1981 edition of Life.|$|E
2500|$|The logo for the magazine's news page is a donkey-riding naked Mr Punch caressing his erect and {{oversized}} penis, while hugging {{a female}} admirer. It is a detail from [...] by [...] "Dickie" [...] Doyle that once formed the masthead of Punch magazine, which {{the editors of}} Private Eye had come to loathe for its perceived descent into complacency. The image, hidden away in the detail of the frieze, had appeared {{on the cover of}} Punch for nearly a century and was noticed by Malcolm Muggeridge during a guest-editing spot on Private Eye. The [...] "Rabelaisian gnome", as the character was called, was enlarged by Gerald Scarfe, and put on the front cover of issue 69 in 1964 at full size. He was then formally adopted as a mascot on the <b>inside</b> <b>pages,</b> {{as a symbol of the}} old, radical incarnation of Punch magazine that the Eye admired.|$|E

2500|$|In many ways, USA Today {{is set up}} {{to break}} the typical {{newspaper}} layout. Some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers (front-page paragraphs referring to stories on <b>inside</b> <b>pages),</b> sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside; the lead reefer is the cover page feature [...] "Newsline," [...] which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, USA Today cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps for the continental United States, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, and temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world (temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as [...] "t" [...] for thunderstorms, referencing the expected weather conditions); the colorized forecast map, originally created by staff designer George Rorick (who left USA Today for a similar position at The Detroit News in 1986), was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges. National precipitation maps {{for the next three}} days (previously five days until the 2012 redesign), and four-day forecasts and Air Quality Indexes for 36 major U.S. cities (originally 16 cities prior to 1999) – with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map – are also featured. Weather data is provided by AccuWeather, which has served as the forecast provider for USA Today for most of the paper's existence (with an exception from January 2002 to September 2012, when The Weather Channel provided data through a long-term multimedia content agreement with Gannett). In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is [...] "Weather Focus", a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event.|$|E
60|$|The item he {{referred}} to was only twelve lines long and located {{at the bottom of}} a column on one of the <b>inside</b> <b>pages</b> of the newspaper.

Two of the names were Napoleon Martell and Slogwell Brown, Jr.|$|E

Gertie giggled. Mrs. Cowles frowned. He followed their glance.|$|E

6000|$|Nick had a room {{under his}} mother's roof, which he mainly used {{to dress for}} dinner when dining in Calcutta Gardens, and he had [...] "kept on" [...] his {{chambers}} in the Temple; for {{to a young man}} in public life an independent address was indispensable. Moreover, he was suspected of having a studio in an out-of-the-way district, the indistinguishable parts of South Kensington, incongruous as such a retreat might seem {{in the case of a}} member of Parliament. It was an absurd place to see his constituents unless he wanted to paint their portraits, a kind of [...] "representation" [...] with which they would scarce have been satisfied; and in fact the only question of portraiture had been when the wives and daughters of several of them expressed a wish for the picture of their handsome young member. Nick had not offered to paint it himself, and the studio was taken for granted rather than much looked into by the ladies in Calcutta Gardens. Too express a disposition to regard whims of this sort as extravagance pure and simple was known by them to be open to correction; for they were not oblivious that Mr. Carteret had humours which weighed against them in the shape of convenient cheques nestling between the <b>inside</b> <b>pages</b> of legible letters of advice. Mr. Carteret was Nick's providence, just as Nick was looked to, in a general way, to be that of his mother and sisters, especially since it had become so plain that Percy, who was not subtly selfish, would operate, mainly with a [...] "six-bore," [...] quite out of that sphere. It was not for studios certainly that Mr. Carteret sent cheques; but they were an expression of general confidence in Nick, and a little expansion was natural to a young man enjoying such a luxury as that. It was sufficiently felt in Calcutta Gardens that he could be looked to not to betray such confidence; for Mr. Carteret's behaviour could have no name at all unless one were prepared to call it encouraging. He had never promised anything, but he was one of the delightful persons with whom the redemption precedes or dispenses with the vow. He had been an early and lifelong friend of the late right honourable gentleman, a political follower, a devoted admirer, a stanch supporter in difficult hours. He had never married, espousing nothing more reproductive than Sir Nicholas's views--he used to write letters to the Times in favour of them--and had, so far as was known, neither chick nor child; nothing but an amiable little family of eccentricities, the flower of which was his odd taste for living in a small, steep, clean country town, all green gardens and red walls with a girdle of hedge-rows, all clustered about an immense brown old abbey. When Lady Agnes's imagination rested upon the future of her second son she liked to remember that Mr. Carteret had nothing to [...] "keep up": the inference seemed so direct that he would keep up Nick.|$|E
