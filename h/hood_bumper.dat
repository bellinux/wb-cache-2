5000|$|The third {{generation}} Mercury Grand Marquis saw an extensive update for the 1998 model year. Although it bore a strong {{resemblance to the}} successful [...] "Aero" [...] style of the 1992-1997 model, only the roof and the doors were identical between them. The front and rear fascia were redesigned, with a new grille, <b>hood,</b> <b>bumpers,</b> headlamps/taillamps, and side mirrors. [...] The interior carried over from the 1995 update, with Ford's new two-spoke steering wheel replacing the previous four-spoke design.|$|R

50|$|Bugatti {{commissioned}} Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign {{to create}} a full-size saloon version of the Bugatti EB 110 supercar. The result was the EB 112, which was a retro-styled four-door fastback saloon reminiscent of older Bugatti models, such as the well-known type 57 Galiber. The body was made entirely of aluminium, with a carbon chassis. An update of the EB 112 was created in 1999, the EB 218. The EB 218 is longer than the EB 112 and the <b>hood,</b> <b>bumpers</b> and lights {{differ from those of}} the EB 112. It also featured a W18 engine instead of the EB 112's V12 engine.|$|R

40|$|To provide {{protection}} to pedestrians in collision with passenger vehicles, {{the design and}} construction of a vehicle’s <b>bumper,</b> <b>hood</b> and fender panels must be addressed. TNO has undertaken a research project in conjunction with DSM to investigate how this may be done. Vehicle styling, packaging and an analysis led design process will be shown for {{the front of the}} vehicle and in particular the <b>hood</b> and <b>bumper.</b> The recommendations of EEVC working group 10 are used as a target to asses the design proposal’s suitability...|$|R
5000|$|The first hot rods {{were old}} cars (most often Fords, {{typically}} Model Ts, 1928-31 Model As, or 1932-34 Model Bs), modified to reduce weight. Typical modifications were removal of convertible tops, <b>hoods,</b> <b>bumpers,</b> windshields, and/or fenders; channeling the body; and modifying the engine by tuning and/or replacing {{with a more}} powerful type. Speedster was a common name for the modified car. Wheels and tires were changed for improved traction and handling. [...] "Hot rod" [...] was sometimes a term used in the 1950s as a derogatory term for any car that did not fit into the mainstream. Hot rodders' modifications were considered to improve the appearance as well, leading to show cars in the 1960s replicating these same modifications along with a distinctive paint job.|$|R
5000|$|Panama was {{the name}} of Roth's car. He had the <b>hood</b> and <b>bumper</b> mounted in his hallway, which can be seen in his video for [...] "SHOOBop". He has a stuffed deer's behind {{crashing}} through the front windshield. A plaque underneath reads, [...] "Your First deer, courtesy of PANAMA." ...|$|R
50|$|The 4102 was {{the first}} Russian {{executive}} car that did not utilized body-on-frame construction, instead it utilized unitized construction. It was also half a meter longer than the Gaz Volga and weighed half a ton less than the ZIL-41041. The roof panels and floor, trunk lid, <b>hood</b> and <b>bumpers</b> were made of fiberglass.|$|R
5000|$|Bugatti {{commissioned}} Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign {{to update}} the EB 112 4-door sedan concept that he designed for Bugatti Automobili SpA in 1993. The EB218's wheelbase measures 3 meters (118 inches) and a total length of 5385 mm (212 in). This makes the EB 218 longer that the EB 112 by 315 millimeters. The most notable visual differences between the EB 218 and the EB 112 is a redesigned <b>hood,</b> <b>bumpers</b> and lights. The overall design is far less controversial than the EB 112's [...] "Droopy hatchback-sedan" [...] look and has a {{much more of a}} typical sedan shape rather than the EB 112's hatchback-sedan shape. The interior design is very simple yet extremely luxurious, with beige leather seats and a large wooden dash which manages to keep all the instruments and vents [...] "composed". The EB 218 draws inspiration from the classic Bugatti Type 101 Berline Tourisme.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the number}} of {{pedestrian}} fatalities and injuries is steadily declining worldwide, pedestrian protection is still an important issue. Extensive researches {{have been carried out}} for pedestrian protection in order to establish regulations for pedestrian safety. The automobile <b>hoods</b> and <b>bumpers,</b> which pedestrians frequently collide into during accidents, should be designed {{for the safety of the}} pedestrians. Two analysis methods, a real experiment and computer simulation, are utilized to design safe structures of the <b>hood</b> and the <b>bumper.</b> A real experiment is very expensive while computer simulation has modeling imperfections. It would be optimal to obtain all the data from experiments to identify the design tendency. However, computer simulation is generally used due to budget restrictions. In this research, a method, which uses an experiment and simulation simultaneously, is developed. Orthogonal arrays are employed to link the two methods. The minimum number of experiments is allocated to some rows of an orthogonal array and the simulations are allocated to the rest of the rows. Experiments should be allocated to have the cases of the experiments orthogonal. Mathematical error analysis is conducted. Based on the proposed methods, a <b>hood</b> and a <b>bumper</b> are designed to protect pedestrians. Real experiments and computer simulations are conducted for the rows of orthogonal arrays. The results show that the errors are distributed uniformly and a precise design is obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the event}} of an impact with an automobile, {{pedestrians}} suffer multiple impacts with the <b>bumper,</b> <b>hood</b> and the windscreen. The characteristics of a vehicle’s front end and structural stiffness have a significant influence on the kinematics and injury risk of the pedestrian’s body regions, in a vehicle-to-pedestrian collision. In this present study, the injury risk of the pedestrian is investigated in an impact with a deformable vehicle front end model for the purpose of validating the developed model. A simplified vehicle front end model consisting of a multi body windscreen and a finite element cowl, <b>hood</b> and <b>bumper</b> is developed. The MADYMO human pedestrian multi body dummy model is impacted by the vehicle front end model at the speed of 40 km/h. The injury to the various body segments namely the head, neck, sternum, lumbar, femur and tibia is obtained. The simulation values are compared to the experimental values for verification of the vehicle front end model...|$|R
5000|$|Styling {{changes for}} the sedan and wagon {{included}} new front fender caps on the same fenders as used since 1969, and <b>hood,</b> grille, <b>bumpers,</b> rear fascia, instrument panel, interior trim, hood ornament, and a new font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille showed off a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights, and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille's crosshatch trim. Headlamp bezels were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new <b>hood</b> and front <b>bumper</b> followed the grille's central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight [...] "coffin nose" [...] look. The contemporary Matador saw a similar frontal treatment, but with a much more pronounced effect and with different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille insert.|$|R
5000|$|A damage system {{returns to}} Undercover, but {{differs from the}} prior title ProStreet in that the damage is only {{cosmetic}} and does not adversely affect performance. However, a car can still be [...] "Totaled" [...] in the new [...] "Highway Battle" [...] mode (except PlayStation 2 and Wii versions) and in some missions in career mode. During these missions a car damage bar is displayed, which indicates the amount of damage done to the player's vehicle. The primary goal of these missions is to deliver certain cars without totaling them. In general, damage is automatically repaired after every career race or police pursuit, unlike in ProStreet where {{it had to be}} repaired by the player at a cost (either money or a [...] "repair marker"). The damage system has been updated, which is more detailed given that scratches and dents are now seen on the player's car (which represent minor damage), or heavy damage such as entire sections of the car ripped off (like <b>bumpers,</b> <b>hoods</b> etc.) or large deformations or dents. Police vehicles can sustain damage but in a different way than they did in Most Wanted and Carbon. Instead of the damage being made up of static models (although doors, trunk doors, <b>hoods,</b> <b>bumpers</b> and sirens could be broken off), the damage models are now flexible, and each area of the car can suffer from none, light, medium, or major damage (unlike Most Wanted or Carbon where each area can be in only two states of damage, undamaged or damaged). Many minor hits to different areas will gradually make the sustained damage more and more severe.|$|R

The optional V6 engine was also upgraded to the 3.1 L V6 and 140 horsepower. The convertible was dropped from availability to prevent internal competition with a planned Beretta convertible. However, the Beretta convertible was shelved at the eleventh hour, before a 1990 Cavalier convertible could be prepared.The Cavalier got {{a more extensive}} restyling in 1991 that involved a new <b>hood,</b> <b>bumpers,</b> headlights, taillights, wheel covers and a redesigned interior, however with the body style remaining unchanged. Most notably, the cooling system was redesigned to draw air from the bumper, giving it a Ford Taurus-style bumper and grille-less nose. The new bumpers were unpainted, with the option to have them colored grey, black or white; the latter only available on white-colored models. The RS and the Z24 eschewed this for a color keyed body package. Z24 models also gained the options for a height adjustable driver's seat and a CD player. The platform and trim lines were carried over, while the convertible was brought back mid-year in the RS trim only with the V6 standard.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Pedestrians are {{vulnerable}} road users {{who are at}} high risks in a road traffic collision with motor vehicles. A large number are getting killed in traffic accidents each year, {{the majority of them}} being children and senior citizens. During impact with an automobile, pedestrians suffer multiple impacts with the <b>bumper,</b> <b>hood</b> and windscreen. Fatality is seen mostly due to the head injuries obtained by the pedestrians. Thus this paper aims to introduce the development and validation of a simplified hybrid vehicle front end profile for the mitigation of head injury. The vehicle model is represented by a multi body windscreen and finite element cowl, <b>hood</b> and <b>bumper.</b> A two step validation procedure is performed, firstly the crash kinematics validation to determine the overall kinematics and fall pattern of the pedestrian during impact. Secondly, the hybrid vehicle model is tested against the pedestrian injury criteria values for pertinent body parts namely the neck, sternum, lumbar, femur and tibia. The hybrid vehicle model is made to impact an adult human dummy model obtained from TNO (TASS Netherlands). The injury criterias are reprensented through the Head Injury Criteria (HIC), neck compression force, sternum and tibia accelerations and lumbar and femur bending moments. The simulation results were compared to the experimental values and a good correlation was achieved...|$|R
