40|$|Recent {{history has}} lent casual support to three popular {{theories}} about U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> demand: (i) U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> consumption is very insensitive to changing oil prices, (ii) non-price conservation has reduced U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> demand, and (Hi) U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> consumption falls more when oil prices rise than it rises when oil prices fall. Together, these theories suggest {{that one could}} hold oil consumption constant without much economic sacrifice. The authors' econometric evidence does not support these theories. This evidence indicates that U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> consumption is fairly responsive to price changes over the long run, but with a considerable lag. Sharp oil price increases-or an equivalent policy action-would be needed to hold oil consumption constant during the 1990 s. Copyright 1991 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R

The purpose of this correlational study was to assess the relationship between leader traits and preestablished learning organization culture benchmarks within Alberta 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>oil</b> and gas industry. Learning organization culture is an extension of Senge 2 ̆ 7 s learning organization theory. Simple random sampling was used to attain a population comprised of 52 employees in Alberta 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>oil</b> and gas industry who were accountable to an organizational supervisor. Data were collected via the NEO-FFI- 3 and the Learning Organization Survey; summarization was accomplished by means of an online third party survey administration service. Regression analyses revealed that each of the 5 -factor traits was correlated to learning organization culture. When the model was changed to multiple regression using all traits together, only 2 traits remained significant. Openness to experience positively correlated with learning organization culture, whereas neuroticism was negatively correlated with learning organization culture.

40|$|Since the 1979 - 80 {{oil price}} doubling, U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> {{consumption}} has declined by about 20 percent, {{in part because}} of price-induced conservation.

Set-identification of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> supply shock is achieved through imposing dynamic sign restrictions on the impulse responses of the model.

40|$|Abstract. Oil is {{much more}} toxic to coastal fish, birds, and mammals than {{previously}} predicted by short-term laboratory bioassay studies used during the 1970 s and 1980 s to develop a “paradigm ” or model understanding of oil toxicity. Hundreds of comprehensive field assessments and lab studies conducted by government and academic researchers after the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) show that oil is persistent in important shoreline environments and causes long-term, population-level injury to coastal sealife. These 1990 s studies frame a new oil toxicity paradigm, showing that risk evaluation or “ecotoxicity ” models developed in the 1970 s severely understate environmental damage from chronic oil pollution. Public policies based on the 1970 <b>s</b> <b>oil</b> toxicity paradigm are not adequately protective of sealife. Policies guiding every phase of oil use from production to consumption and waste disposal need to be reevaluated {{in light of the}} 1990 <b>s</b> <b>oil</b> toxicity paradigm...|$|R

Contrary to popular perceptions, the num-bers of oil spills, {{as well as the}} amount spilled, have decreased significantly over the last two decades, particularly {{in the last few years}} despite overall increases in oil transport.

It then reviews the effects of the ban on U. <b>S.</b> crude <b>oil</b> exports, of capacity constraints in refining and transporting crude oil, of differences in the quality of conventional and unconventional crude oil, and of the recent regional fragmentation of the global market for crude oil on the determination of U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> and gasoline prices. It discusses the reasons for the persistent wedge between U. <b>S.</b> crude <b>oil</b> prices and global crude oil prices in recent years and for the fact that domestic oil prices below global levels have not translated to lower U.

40|$|World {{oil supply}} {{disruptions}} lead to U. S. economic losses. Because oil is fungible {{in an integrated}} world oil market, increased oil consumption, whether from domestic or imported sources, increases the economic losses associated with oil supply disruptions. Nevertheless, increased U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> production expands stable supplies and dampens oil price shocks, whereas increased U. <b>S.</b> <b>oil</b> imports boosts the share of world oil supply that comes from unstable producers and exacerbates oil price shocks. Some of the economic losses associated with oil supply disruptions—gross domestic product losses and some transfers abroad—are externalities that can be quantified as oil security premiums. To estimate such premiums for domestic and imported oil, we take into account projected world oil market conditions, probable oil supply disruptions, the market response to oil supply disruptions, and the resulting U. S. economic losses. Our estimates quantify the security externalities associated with increased oil use, which derive from the expected U.
