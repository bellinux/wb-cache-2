40|$|We analyze optimal hedging {{contracts}} between a protection buyer and protection sellers. When a seller observes that the hedge {{is likely to}} become a liability for her, it reduces her incentives to exert unobservable risk-prevention effort. Hedging can thus generate endogenous counterparty risk. To avoid such risk, the protection buyer may prefer to give up some insurance to maintain the seller’s incentives. Variation margins, compelling the protection seller to liquidate some of her risky positions after bad news, relax the incentive problem. <b>Initial</b> <b>margins</b> address the market failure caused by unregulated trading of {{hedging contracts}} among protection sellers...|$|R
25|$|Return on margin (ROM) {{is often}} used to judge {{performance}} because it represents the gain or loss compared to the exchange’s perceived risk as reflected in required margin. ROM may be calculated (realized return) / (<b>initial</b> <b>margin).</b> The Annualized ROM is equal to (ROM+1)(year/trade_duration)-1.

Several popular methods are used to compute initial margins. They include the CME-owned SPAN (a grid simulation method used by the CME and about 70 other exchanges), STANS (a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology used by the OCC), TIMS (earlier used by the OCC, and still being used by a few other exchanges).|$|E
500|$|As {{the flowers}} grew in popularity, {{professional}} growers paid {{higher and higher}} prices for bulbs with the virus, and prices rose steadily. By 1634, in part {{as a result of}} demand from the French, speculators began to enter the market. The contract price of rare bulbs continued to rise throughout 1636, but by November, the price of common, [...] "unbroken" [...] bulbs also began to increase, so that soon any tulip bulb could fetch hundreds of guilders. That year the Dutch created a type of formal futures market where contracts to buy bulbs {{at the end of the}} season were bought and sold. Traders met in [...] "colleges" [...] at taverns and buyers were required to pay a 2.5% [...] "wine money" [...] fee, up to a maximum of three guilders per trade. Neither party paid an <b>initial</b> <b>margin</b> nor a mark-to-market margin, and all contracts were with the individual counter-parties rather than with the Exchange. The Dutch described tulip contract trading as windhandel (literally [...] "wind trade"), because no bulbs were actually changing hands. The entire business was accomplished on the margins of Dutch economic life, not in the Exchange itself.|$|E
30|$|In the post-crisis world, CCPs {{have assumed}} a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} financial system. They exist as the agent between two counterparties on opposite sides of a trade, with the purpose of eliminating counterparty risk. The questions their role poses are whether they are themselves a safe counterparty, and whether their size constitutes a significant systemic risk. CCPs’ business is complex to model. Each CCP may have thousands of clients, also called general clearing members (GCMs), and each GCM may deal with multiple CCPs. There are <b>initial</b> <b>margins,</b> variation margins and default fund contributions to be considered. The correlation structure is such that an analytical description of this system is impossible. Studies on CCPs’ efficiency have returned mixed results.|$|R

40|$|We analyze optimal hedging {{contracts}} {{and show that}} although hedging aims at sharing risk, {{it can lead to}} more risk-taking. News implying that a hedge is likely to be loss-making undermines the risk-prevention incentives of the protection seller. This incentive problem limits the capacity to share risks and generates endogenous counterparty risk. Optimal hedging can therefore lead to contagion from news about insured risks to the balance sheet of insurers. Such endogenous risk is more likely to materialize ex post when the ex ante probability of counterparty default is low. Variation margins emerge as an optimal mechanism to enhance risk-sharing capacity. Paradoxically, they can also induce more risk-taking. <b>Initial</b> <b>margins</b> address the market failure caused by unregulated trading of {{hedging contracts}} among protection sellers.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of CCPs in most derivative transactions will dramatically change {{the landscape of}} derivatives pricing, hedging and risk management, and, according to the TABB group, will lead to an overall liquidity impact about 2 USD trillions. In this article we develop {{for the first time}} a comprehensive approach for pricing under CCP clearing, including variation and <b>initial</b> <b>margins,</b> gap credit risk and collateralization, showing concrete examples for interest rate swaps. Mathematically, the inclusion of asymmetric borrowing and lending rates in the hedge of a claim lead to nonlinearities showing up in claim dependent pricing measures, aggregation dependent prices, nonlinear PDEs and BSDEs. This still holds in presence of CCPs and CSA. We introduce a modeling approach that allows us to enforce rigorous separation of the interconnected nonlinear risks into different valuation adjustments where the key pricing nonlinearities are confined to a funding costs component that is analyzed through numerical schemes for BSDEs. We present a numerical case study for Interest Rate Swaps that highlights the relative size of the different valuation adjustments and the quantitative role of <b>initial</b> and variation <b>margins,</b> of liquidity bases, of credit risk, of the margin period of risk and of wrong way risk correlations...|$|R

40|$|The G 20 OTC (over-the-counter) {{derivatives}} reforms impose large collateral/liquidity {{demands on}} clearing members of Central Counterparty (CCP) clearing platforms {{in the form}} of <b>initial</b> <b>margins,</b> variation margins and contributions to the default fund. In Heath et al. (2016), it was shown how this introduces a trade-off between liquidity risk and solvency risk with the system manifesting considerable systemic risk from these two sources of risk while CCP penetration is at current levels. The authors extend this analysis to include the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) skin-in-the-game requirements for CCPs, which aim to ameliorate the contributions to the default fund by clearing members and also to prevent moral hazard problems associated with the too-interconnected-to-fail (TITF) status of CCPs as more and more derivatives are centrally cleared.

40|$|When hot magma {{contacts}} cold solid rock, a chilled margin forms {{because the}} heat flux from the magma cannot balance {{the very large}} initial conductive flux in the rock. However, the conductive flux decreases with time and can eventually be exceeded by the heat flux from the magma. In these circumstances, the chilled margin begins to remelt and can even disappear. This process i modelled quantitatively for {{the case of a}} constant heat flux from th e magma. The results are applied to the turbulent steady flow of komatiite magma in dykes and as lavas. The <b>initial</b> chilled <b>margin</b> with cold rock only survives for a few tens of seconds and so does not inhibit hermal erosionsignificantly. The theory can also be applied to magmatic ntrusions where the heat flux varies with time. Results are ~presented forthe remelting of a chilled margin formed at the roof of a basaltic sill.

Three kinds of contact are predicted at the margins of intrusions. First, contacts are developed where the chilled margin grows continually without any meltback. Second, meltback can occur, but does not completely redissolve the <b>initial</b> chilled <b>margin.</b> This causes an internal contact to form within the intrusion.

40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} hedge fund {{industry}} has brought substantial benefits to financial markets. At the same time, hedge funds can {{in some circumstances}} {{give rise to a}} number of potential risks. Not unlike in the period following the Asian crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, governments, regulators, and central banks have been called upon to assess whether additional regulatory initiatives are required to mitigate these risks. There are three potential regulatory objectives that can be invoked. They are investor protection, market integrity protection and financial system protection. The link between hedge funds and the stability of the financial system relates to the possibility that large losses in one or several hedge funds get transmitted to one or several large internationally active banks.
