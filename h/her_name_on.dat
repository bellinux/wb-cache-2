5|$|While {{training}} for the World Championships in Tokyo, Sacramone tore her Achilles tendon. She returned to the U.S. immediately for surgery. However, the team kept <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the roster, and she was given a gold medal despite not competing. This gave her the most World Championships medals of any female American gymnast, with ten. Simone Biles would break that record in 2015.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, 2006, Meader {{was awarded}} the title of honorary member of the American Geographical Society and was invited to sign <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> its Fliers' & Explorers' Globe. This {{was part of a}} {{tradition}} spanning back to the 1920s in which noted explorers are asked to place their signature on the Globe. Meader was the 79th to do so. Other signers of the globe include Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, Sir Edmund Hillary, Robert Peary, Richard Byrd, and the astronauts on Apollo 8. Meader was one of only three people to sign it twice; across East Africa and the Andes.|$|E

5|$|Tracy finally {{achieved}} {{some success}} by joining {{forces with the}} notable stock manager William H. Wright {{in the spring of}} 1924. A stage partnership was formed with the young actress Selena Royle, who had already made <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> Broadway. It proved a popular draw and their productions were favorably received. One of these shows brought Tracy to the attention of a Broadway producer, who offered him the lead in a new play. The Sheepman previewed in October 1925, but it received poor reviews and closed after its trial run in Connecticut. Dejected, Tracy was forced back to Wright and the stock circuit.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is {{fearful that}} she will be cut from the hospital's staff, so she tries to get <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the {{surgical}} board. Stevens and Hunt operate on Randy, and it is revealed that he is terminal. Lexie wants to donate her liver to Thatcher, but she is not a viable candidate, so she asks Meredith to do it, who subsequently agrees. Randy and his wife are dismayed with the outcome of the surgery, and Stevens proposes a plan to Hunt on how they can save him. Hunt agrees, but when the surgery suffers complications, the patient is pronounced dead, and Hunt condemns Stevens. Meredith undergoes the surgery, and it is a success for both her and Thatcher. Yang confronts Webber, and tells him that if a cardiothoracic surgeon is not hired, she should be cut from the program. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens sees the bear, and ultimately agrees that she and Karev need to relocate, out of the forest.|$|E
5|$|Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre had, since 1849, {{designed}} coins {{with various}} visages {{of the goddess}} Liberty, based on a bust, Venus Accroupie, {{he had seen in}} a Philadelphia museum on loan from the Vatican. Although the Liberty as used on the three-cent nickel piece is closest to Longacre's experimental cents of 1857 and quarter eagles of 1860, she resembles most of the Chief Engraver's other depictions of Liberty. On the three-cent piece, she wears a coronet with <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it, and a ribbon binds her hair. For the reverse, Longacre combined the Roman numeral III as rendered on the silver three-cent piece with the laurel wreath used on the 1859 Indian Head cent reverse. Breen suggested that the similarity of design to other Longacre coins has contributed to the low level of collector interest in the three-cent nickel.|$|E

Subsequently, she is seen dancing in a place sprayed with graffiti and sporting an orange swimsuit paired with a bright blue jacket. Next, while a few males are playing basketball in front of her, she is portrayed watching and interacting with them while wearing a khaki jacket with denim short shorts, a white vest top and white shoes. After the singer and the others further walk through their surrounding and perform to the track, the visual ends with Stan leaning on a wall from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who {{has been charged with}} the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. In a bizarre twist, it is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.|$|E

5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

25|$|Tristan relapses and {{recalls that}} the {{shepherd}}'s mournful tune {{is the same}} as was played when he was told of the deaths of his father and mother ("Muss ich dich so versteh'n, du alte, ernst Weise"). He rails once again against his desires and against the fateful love potion ("verflucht sei, furchtbarer Trank!") until, exhausted, he collapses in delirium. After his collapse, the shepherd is heard piping the arrival of Isolde's ship, and, as Kurwenal rushes to meet her, Tristan tears the bandages from his wounds in his excitement ("Hahei! Mein Blut, lustig nun fliesse!"). As Isolde arrives at his side, Tristan dies with <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> his lips.|$|E
25|$|Crick and Watson {{felt that}} they had benefited from collaborating with Wilkins. They offered him a co-authorship on the article that first {{described}} the double helix structure of DNA. Wilkins turned down the offer, a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgment of experimental work done at King's College in the eventual published paper. Rather than make any of the DNA researchers at King's College co-authors on the Watson and Crick double helix article, the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from King's College along with the helix paper. Brenda Maddox suggests that because of the importance of her experimental results in Watson and Crick's model building and theoretical analysis, Franklin should have had <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the original Watson and Crick paper in Nature. Franklin and Gosling submitted their own joint 'second' paper to Nature {{at the same time as}} Wilkins, Stokes, and Wilson submitted theirs (i.e. the 'third' paper on DNA).|$|E
25|$|Lawson began {{performing}} {{at a young}} age. When she was only five she sang at Feethams for soldiers wounded during the First World War and soon became a regular at Darlington's Scala theatre on Eldon Street. Lawson took on other roles and in 1920 she had a part in a Babes in the Wood panto. At {{the age of twelve}} she led a performing group of young girls that toured County Durham for three years. In addition to her pure acting ability, Lawson developed into exceptional dancer. In her mid-teens she landed a role in a panto in Brighton and later performed in Frinton-on-Sea in Essex, where she was spotted by comedian Gracie Fields. With Fields's support, Lawson was able to become the resident act at The May Fair Hotel in London. Lawson incorporated into her show the song Varsity Drag from the musical Good News, which at the time was being performed by American Zelma O'Neal at the Carlton Theatre in the West End. Her performance was such a success that when O'Neal returned to the United States, the Carlton Theatre choose 17-year-old Lawson as her replacement. Lawson made <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> stage in 1928 at the Carlton in the role Flo in the production of Good News. In 1929, Lawson departed for Australia on a tour, where she appeared in the productions of The Desert Song and Hold Everything!.|$|E

25|$|Lange {{began the}} new decade {{in the light}} romp How to Beat the High Co$t of Living (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, but it {{received}} mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, she was contacted by director Bob Rafelson regarding a project on which {{he was working with}} Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for Goin' South (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater, and has famously recounted how he watched the budding actress conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided that he had found the lead for his film. After his meeting with Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was absolutely right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic film noir, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981). Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope in which he had placed the piece of paper with <b>her</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it. Although the controversial film received mixed reviews, Lange was widely praised for her performance.|$|E
