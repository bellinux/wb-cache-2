50|$|The arenas used in {{professional}} bull riding vary. Some are rodeo arenas {{that are used}} only for bull riding and other rodeo events. Others are event centers that play host to many different sports. Common to all arenas is a large, open area that gives the bulls, bull riders, and bull fighters {{plenty of room to}} maneuver. The area is fenced, usually 6 to 7 feet high, to protect the audience from escaped bulls. There are generally exits on each corner of the arena for riders {{to get out of the}} way quickly. Riders can also hop onto the fence to avoid danger. One end of the arena contains the bucking chutes from which the bulls are released. There is also an <b>exit</b> <b>chute</b> where the bulls can exit the arena.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} side of The Beach is the third tower, {{featuring}} five slides also by WhiteWater West: Half Pipe, Typhoon, Tropical Cyclone, The Breakers, and AquaTube. All of the slides on this tower use two-person inline tubes. Half Pipe is a Boomerango of a similar design to Bombora; however, the <b>exit</b> <b>chute</b> from the vertical wall features a small camel hump for a second moment of weightlessness. Typhoon is a Rattler where riders slide down open flume sections before entering two cylinders at right angles. Riders oscillate back and forth inside the cylinders before emerging and continuing with the open slide. Tropical Cyclone is a Constrictor, a slide characterised by three wide helices. Internally, these helices measure 2.1 m in diameter as opposed to the 1.3 m diameter evidenced {{in the rest of the}} slide. The Breakers are a set of four Master Blaster slides. These slides mimic roller coasters by providing not only descents, but ascents as well. Ascents are achieved though water jets blasting the raft uphill. AquaTube is a traditional flume ride that features enclosed twists and turns in complete darkness. The ride is a Giant AquaTube by WhiteWater West.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of more stringent environmental and occupational {{health and safety}} regulations have instigated efforts {{to reduce the amount of}} dust generated during loading of ships with dusty bulk materials. The work presented in this paper demonstrates that to reduce dust emissions during ship loading of dry bulk materials, the material stream <b>exiting</b> the loading <b>chute</b> should be concentrated and at high velocity. This encapsulates the majority of the dust within the stream and buries it within the pile. The chutes that have been designed to achieve this result also keeps the impact angle of the bulk material with the chute low, reducing particle degradation and therefore minimising additional dust generation. Further reductions in dust emissions are possible with the use of a self adjusting flap above the material stream which prevents dust laden air from <b>exiting</b> the spoon <b>chute...</b>|$|R

A total of 240 crossbred Bos taurus steers were used. Steers were ear tagged, implanted, and weighed (400 ± 23. 38 kg) on arrival and allotted to balance weight and breed. Behavioral data were collected using a 10 min scan sampling technique using live observation by two experienced observers from 0800 h to 1600 h on days 39, 75 and 118 of the trial. Two behaviors (head in bunk and head in waterer) and three postures (lying, walking and standing) were recorded. The day post-behavior collection, steers were moved through a squeeze chute for subjective temperament scoring.

HP steers spent more time at the feedbunk (P = 0. 04) than FD steers between treatments, however there was no difference (P = 0. 66) for time spent at the waterer. Lying was higher (P = 0. 008) for HP steers compared to their FD counterparts.

40|$|ABSTRACTDespite {{increasing}} {{public scrutiny}} of practices used in raising animals for food, {{there is little}} readily available information about how cattle handling is managed in feedyards. The {{purpose of this study}} was to score cattle handling in commercial feedyards using the most widely adopted program for managing cattle handling, and to make these scores available as evidence of producer commitment to proper care and handling of cattle. Our objectives were to estimate compliance with the Beef Quality Assurance Feedyard Assessment (BQA FA) for cattle handling, to validate 6 cattle handling categories of the BQA FA, and to document management practices and elements of facility design. Categories scored were electric prod use; chute operation; rates of cattle vocalizing, stumbling, and falling; and rate of cattle jumping and running. This study compiles findings for cattle handling scores in commercial feedlots using the BQA FA. Of 28 sites, average scores were in compliance with BQA FA for the following 4 categories: electric prod use, vocalization, stumbling, and falling. For the following 2 categories, average scores were not in compliance: a score of 4. 2 % versus the target of 0 % was recorded for cattle caught improperly in the squeeze chute; and a score of 52 % versus the target of 25 % was recorded for cattle that jumped or ran from the squeeze <b>chute</b> <b>exit.</b> All but one site exceeded this target. Curved crowd systems were recorded for 89 % of feedyards, 11 % used Bud Box systems, and 78. 5 % had rubber mats at the squeeze <b>chute</b> <b>exit...</b>|$|R

However, his more familiar encounter with Bodacious happened in the championship round of the 1995 PBR World Finals in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was jerked down by the bull upon <b>exiting</b> the <b>chutes</b> so Bodacious could thrust his head up and smash Tuff's face with it, shattering every major bone in his face. He managed to walk out of the arena, albeit a bloody mess. He required several hours of reconstructive surgery for his face, and less than two months later, he was riding again. At the NFR later that year, he drew Bodacious again, this time in round 7. He decided to turn him out - getting off him when he left the chute. He then tipped his hat to him and received a standing ovation for his decision. He did this at the request of his son because Bodacious had smashed his face earlier that year.|$|R

Animals— 40 Holstein bull calves Procedures—Calves weighing 108 to 235 kg received the following treatments prior to sham castration and dehorning (Period 1) and castration and dehorning (Period 2) (n= 10 calves/group) : (i) 0. 9 % saline solution IM (PLACEBO) (ii) sodium salicylate (SAL) supplied free-choice in water to provide concentrations from 2. 5 to 5 mg/mL beginning 24 hours prior to Period 1 to 48 hours after Period 2; (iii) 0. 025 mg/kg butorphanol, 0. 05 mg/kg xylazine, 0. 1 mg/kg ketamine co-administered IM immediately prior to both periods (XKB); and (iv) a combination of treatments (ii) and (iii) (SAL + XKB). Plasma drug concentrations, average daily gain (ADG), <b>chute</b> <b>exit</b> speed, serum cortisol concentrations and electrodermal activity (EDA) were evaluated. Results—ADG (0 - 13 d) was significantly greater in the SAL and SAL + XKB groups. Calves receiving XKB had significantly slower <b>chute</b> <b>exit</b> speed in both periods. Serum cortisol concentrations were significantly increased in all groups during Period 2 compared to Period 1. However, XKB attenuated serum cortisol response for the first hour after castration and dehorning while oral salicylate significantly reduced cortisol from 1 - 6 hours. XKB administration significantly decreased EDA scores in both periods. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Free-choice sodium salicylate decreases cortisol concentrations and reduced weight loss associated with castration and dehorning in calves...|$|R

Our objective was to determine effects of BVDV type I vaccination protocol, calf behavior (chute score, and <b>chute</b> <b>exit</b> velocity), and gender on calf gain and immunoglobulin (Ig) response. Crossbred calves (n = 64) were randomly allotted to one of two vaccination protocols. In protocol 1, calves were vaccinated at 60 d of age (d 0) and at weaning (d 147). Calves assigned to protocol 2 were vaccinated against BVDV type I at 21 d prior to (d 126) and at weaning (d 147). Blood samples were collected from half of the calves in each protocol group on d 0 (60 days of age), d 21, d 126 (21 days prior to weaning), and d 147 (at weaning); serum was harvested and Ig titers were determined. Titers for BVDV type I were transformed (log base 2) and analyzed using a mixed model procedure. Calves vaccinated at d 0 and weaning had larger (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) titers than calves vaccinated at d 126 and weaning (7. 5 ± 0. 36 and 5. 1 ± 0. 36, respectively). Mean BVDV titers were larger (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) on d 147 when compared with d 126, d 21, and d 0 (8. 3 ± 0. 39, 5. 1 ± 0. 40, 5. 9 ± 0. 39 and 5. 7 ± 0. 39, respectively). A treatment × day interaction (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) also affected BVDV titers. However, BVDV titers were not affected (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) by calf gender, chute score, or <b>chute</b> <b>exit</b> velocity. Weaning weight and pre-weaning average daily gain (ADG) were not related to BVDV type I titers. This study indicated that vaccinating beef calves against BVDV was effective in triggering an Ig response.

40|$|The study {{objective}} was to compare serum cortisol as an acute stress measure, <b>chute</b> <b>exit</b> velocity as a behavioral measure, and ADG {{as an indicator of}} performance and well-being after castration, dehorning, or concurrent castration/dehorning of calves when performed in parallel and in series. Intact male Holstein calves, 3 to 4 mo, underwent sham handling before 2 procedures performed in series separated by 2 to 3 wk. In Period 1, calves were either dehorned by amputation, surgically castrated, concurrently castrated/dehorned, or served as nonsurgical controls (n = 10 /treatment). In Period 2, calves that had been dehorned, castrated, or castrated/dehorned were then castrated, dehorned, or served as nonsurgical controls, respectively. Indicators of distress were measured after all procedures; ADG was assessed for 7 d after each procedure and over the 2 to 3 wk interim. Period 1 cortisol concentrations in dehorned calves were less than in castrated and castrated/dehorned calves at 120 min and from 50 to 240 min, respectively (P 3 ̆c 0. 02). There was marginal evidence that cortisol concentrations were greater in castrated/dehorned than castrated calves at 60 min (P = 0. 06). Period 2 cortisol concentrations were less in dehorned than castrated calves at 120 min (P = 0. 005) but were greater from 360 to 480 min (P 3 ̆c 0. 002). The Period 2 cortisol profile of control calves did not differ from the baseline obtained during sham handling, despite the intervening castration/dehorning in Period 1, suggesting that memory did not affect cortisol. The cortisol profile of castrated calves did not differ between periods except at 720 min, when Period 1 concentrations were greater than Period 2 (P = 0. 02). Cortisol concentrations of calves dehorned in Period 2 were greater than those dehorned in Period 1 at 20 and 240 to 480 min (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). In both periods, castrated calves <b>exited</b> the <b>chute</b> slower than dehorned calves (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The ADG did not differ between surgically treated calves in Period 1; in the interim, the ADG of castrated calves was greater than that of castrated/dehorned calves (difference ± SED, 1. 4 ± 0. 6 kg/d; P = 0. 03), and in Period 2, the ADG of dehorned calves was less than castrated calves (1. 8 ± 0. 6 kg/d; P = 0. 005). Our study supports both the common practice of concurrent castration/dehorning and the sequence of dehorning and castration. Delayed dehorning (vs. delayed castration) appeared to be more acutely stressful and more detrimental to ADG...|$|R
40|$|The {{restricted}} suckling {{requires the}} daily handling of calves and cows for their separation, increasing {{the frequency of}} contact with humans. Thus, when subjected to aversive handling procedures such as fire branding, {{it is expected that}} these individuals present lower reactivity due to their close intimacy with humans. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of fire branding procedure on the flight speed of calves subjected or not the restricted suckling. We used 70 calves from Nellore, Guzerath purebreds and their crosses, allocated into two treatments: Permanent suckling (PS) - 17 females and 18 males aged 212 (± 33. 27) days, remained continuously with their dams and; restricted suckling (RS) - 16 females and 19 males aged 232 (± 42. 39) days, daily separated from their dams during the breeding season (90 days of duration). A handling was done (D 0) to evaluate the flight speed (FS) of the calves, this handling consisted only of physical restraint on the squeeze chute, followed by the release and recording of the speed (in m/s) at which the animals <b>exited</b> the <b>chute</b> to a pen of the corral. The next day (D 1) a second handling was carried out with the same individuals, performing the aversive handling that consisted of physical restraining in the chute, fire branding and, only on females, the application of brucellosis vaccine (according to the IN n. 33, 24 th August 2007, MAPA-Brazil), after this handling the FS was recorded using the same procedure described above. For statistical analysis we used the analysis of variance with a generalized linear model (PROC GLM, SAS) that included FS as dependent variable and the effects of aversive handling (D 0 or D 1), type of suckling (permanent or restricted), sex (male or female), and the interaction between aversive handling and the type of suckling. There was a trend of females (2. 53 ± 0. 12 m/s) had higher FS than males (2. 24 ± 0. 12 m/s) (F = 0. 10, P = 0. 09) and, a trend of increasing FS of calves when they were subjected to the aversive handling (D 0 : 2. 23 ± 0. 12 and D 1 : 2. 54 ± 0. 12 m/s, F = 2. 95, P = 0. 07). There was no significant effect of type of suckling (F = 3. 39, P> 0. 05) nor of interaction between type of suckling and aversive handling (F = 0. 24, P> 0. 05) on FS. The results of this study confirmed that the fire branding is aversive to the calves that responded increasing the speed at which they <b>exited</b> the squeeze <b>chute.</b> We concluded that the fire branding changes the behavioral response of calves to the handling and the restricted suckling is not able to reduce the higher reactivity caused by the exposition to aversive handlings...|$|R

40|$|Cattle {{producers}} {{historically have}} selected for docile temperaments simply for management convenience because calmer animals are conducive to safe environments for their peers {{as well as}} their handlers. As many producers would acknowledge, however, {{there seems to be a}} relationship between temperament and cattle health, and calmer cattle tend to frequent the working chute for treatment of disease less often. Positive correlations have been found in cattle between temperament traits (chute scores, pen scores, and <b>chute</b> <b>exit</b> velocities) and cortisol concentration in the blood, suggesting that more excitable cattle are easily stressed (Curley et al., 2006; Cooke et al., 2009). Curley et al.

Temperamental cattle have significantly higher mean temperament responses at all points (Oliphint, 2006). Higher basal serum cortisol concentrations may suggest that easily excitable cattle are chronically stressed (Curley et al., 2007), possibly resulting in a compromised immune system, illness, and decreased fat and protein deposition.

40|$|Turbulent mixing {{enhancement}} of two confined, co-axial jets having a low annular to core area ratio of 0. 26 is achieved {{with the help}} of a 20 ° chute mixer. Detailed measurements were performed in the flowfield of a chute and contours of mean velocity and streamwise and transverse turbulence intensities were plotted to gain a deeper insight into the mixing enhancement process. The results from this work will aid in designing the mixer for low bypass turbofan engines. Mean velocity and turbulence intensity distributions were also obtained downstream of the chute mixer. Total and static pressure measurements were made to study the total pressure loss and the static pressure variation due to mixing. The high velocity annular stream was found to quickly diffuse after entering through the chutes and mix with the core stream due to higher levels of turbulence generated in the mixing region. A strong transverse turbulence component immediately downstream of the <b>chute</b> <b>exit</b> enhanced the mixing of the penetrating stream with the core flow. With the aid of the chute mixer, nearly complete mixing is achieved over a length of 2. 2 duct radii, suggesting feasibility of shortening the length of the turbofan engine mixing duct by more than 50 %. However, a higher total pressure loss of about 1. 71 % is the penalty to be paid for the enhanced mixing of jets...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} setting a milling unit is essentially {{based on the}} desire to achieve a particular bagasse moisture content or fibre fill in each nip of the mill. This approach relies on {{the selection of the}} speed at which the mill will operate for the selected fibre rate. There is rarely any checking that the selected speed or the selected fibre fill is achieved and the same set of assumptions is generally carried over to use again in the next year. The conventional approach largely ignores the fact that the selection of mill settings actually determines the speed at which the mill will operate. Making an adjustment with the intent of changing the performance of the mill often also changes the speed of the mill as an unintended consequence. This paper presents an alternative approach to mill setting. The approach discussed makes use of mill feeding theory to define the relationship between fibre rate, mill speed and mill settings and uses that theory to provide an alternative means of determining the settings in some nips of the mill. Mill feeding theory shows that, as the feed work opening reduces, roll speed increases.

Crossbred calves (313 ± 4. 7 kg; n = 54; 24 steers, 30 heifers) from a single herd were stratified by gender, body weight, and initial chute score, then allocated randomly to one of six pens. Each pen was {{randomly assigned to one}} of two handling treatments (good or adverse) applied on days 7, 35, 63, and 91. The objective of good treatment was to handle the calves quietly and gently to minimize stress. The objective of adverse treatment was to move the calves quickly and expose them to stimuli. Body weight, <b>exit</b> velocity, and <b>chute</b> scores (based on 5 point subjective scale) were recorded and salivary samples for cortisol were collected (4 calves/ pen) on days 0, 7, 35, 63, and 91. Pen scores (5 point subjective scale) were recorded on days 12, 42, and 87. Data were analyzed statistically using a mixed model. Chute scores tended to be higher (more agitated) in the adverse treatment on day 7, but scores did not differ on subsequent days (treatment × day; P = 0. 06). Salivary cortisol concentrations on day 63 were greater in cattle on the adverse treatment (treatment × day, P = 0. 001). Body weight, exit velocity, and pen scores were not affected by treatment (P ≥ 0. 24). While differences were observed, these cattle appeared to acclimate to short-term adverse handling which did not seem to dramatically affect performance or behavior of beef cattle...|$|R
40|$|The Nelore breed is {{recognized}} as rustic and well adapted to parasites and high temperatures, and these features composes {{a good part of}} the Zebu genetic group. However, they are considered more reactive than other breeds and for this reason they require more time to be managed, putting at risk the safety of employees, the animals themselves and also compromise installations. In order to solve problems such as short duration and high nocturnal occurrence of oestrus many properties choose to perform artificial insemination during the breeding season. At this time, there is an intensification of human-animal interaction in short periods and at different times. When animals are more reactive on handling and are exposed to an uncomfortable thermal environment the stress rises causing impacts on reproduction and production. Stress is comprehended by a set of behavioral and physiological changes when in threatening or uncomfortable situations caused by stressors (physical environment, social or management practices). Some farms have already made the selection for temperament, using different methods of evaluation in accordance with the conditions of creation and infrastructure available at the property. Thus, the aim of this research was to evaluate the reactivity of Nelore cows in different managements that occur in the breeding season. Was evaluated 20 multiparous Nelore cows from October 2013 to March 2014, during the spring and summer seasons with air temperature averages ranging from 22. 7 ± 4. 9 °C to 25. 2 ± 4. 7 °C, in the Campus’ beef cattle sector of the Universidade de São Paulo in Pirassununga. Reactivity was evaluated using scores of escape velocity or output speed using subjective scores: 1 - does not leave the chute, needs to be touched; 2 - walking out the chute; 3 - <b>exits</b> the <b>chute</b> at average speed; 4 – exists the chute quickly. So, as higher is the score as higher is the stress. The scores were given immediately after the animals exists the chute from the managements of sync (M 1), artificial insemination (M 2), pregnancy diagnosis at 30 days (M 3), pregnancy diagnosis at 60 days (M 4), pregnancy diagnosis at 90 days (M 5). The data of the escape score was analyzed using analysis of variance, using the GLM procedure of SAS and means were compared using the Tukey test at 5 %. It was noted that, there was no differences on the average of escape score (2. 34) at the managements M 1, M 2, M 3 and M 4. However, in management M 5 the average was 1. 79 differing from the other managements (P< 0. 05). In this way, at the last management, there was a reduction of 23. 50 % in escape score. So, we conclude that with the increase in frequency of human-animal interactions during the reproductive managements, there is a decrease in the escape score and consequently the stress, contributing to the agility on each management, security of employees, lower physical trauma on animals and damages to facilities...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Science and IndustryR. L. WeaberThis thesis {{includes}} two studies that assessed {{the relationships between}} docility and reproduction in Angus heifers, both from a phenotypic and genetic standpoint. The objective of the first study was to elucidate the phenotypic relationships between docility and first service AI conception rate in heifers. Data (n = 337) included <b>exit</b> velocity (EV), <b>chute</b> score (CS), fecal cortisol (FC), and blood serum cortisol (BC). Statistical analysis was done using logistic regression with 30 day pregnancy rate as the dependent variable. The model included the fixed effect of contemporary group, and the covariates FC, BC, EV, CS, weight, and age. Correlation coefficients were also calculated between all continuous traits. The power of our test could not detect any significant predictors of 30 d pregnancy for the combined data from all ranches. The objective of the second {{study was to determine}} the genetic control of docility and reproduction in heifers as measured by pregnancy rate. A subjective chute scoring system was used as the basis of their genetic evaluation for docility. Pedigree information was obtained on approximately 508, 015 animals over 30 generations. Data included approximately 26, 878 records on heifer pregnancy and 113, 412 records on docility, with 7, 849 animals having both docility and heifer pregnancy records. Contemporary groups were formed by the concatenation of weaning contemporary group, yearling contemporary group, and breeding contemporary group. Heritabilities were calculated from estimates of genetic and residual variance components computed using ASReml 3. 0 (VSN International; Hemel Hempstead, UK). Heifer pregnancy variance components were estimated from a univariate, threshold model, with pregnancy outcome as the dependent variable. Animal and contemporary group were fit as a random effects, while age at first breeding was fit as a covariate. The heritability of heifer pregnancy was estimated to be 0. 16 ± 0. 02. Docility was fit as a univariate, linear animal model with docility score as the dependent variable. Animal and contemporary group were both modeled as random effects. The heritability for docility score was estimated to be 0. 22 ± 0. 03. Fertility is a complex trait that is dependent on many factors; our data suggest that docility is one factor that warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Do {{you know}} someone who’s temperamental? What about an animal? Amazingly, cattle can be temperamental too, which {{influences}} how they should be handled, how they perform, and even how they react to viruses that cause diseases. For cattle, temperament {{is defined as the}} reactivity or fear response to humans or handling. Terms used to describe temperamental animals include “flighty,” “excitable,” and “high strung. ” These animals can potentially injure themselves or their handlers. Beef cattle experience stressful events during routine management practices— weaning, transportation, social mixing, and vaccination. These practices have been shown to induce secretion of the stress-related hormones cortisol and epinephrine. Stress can negatively affect growth, reproduction, welfare, and immune function— predisposing cattle to infectious intestinal and respiratory diseases that cost U. S. cattle producers an estimated 500 million per year. Reducing adverse consequences of stressful incidents and identifying animals that may react differently to stressors may benefit cattle’s growth and health. A team of scientists in the Agricultural Research Service’s Livestock Issues Research Unit (LIRU) in Lubbock, Texas, Mississippi State University (MSU), and Texas AgriLife Research—a member of the Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University System—are studying interrelationships of stress and cattle temperament with transportation, immune challenges, and production traits. They have found that, depending on temperament, cattle respond differently. Testing Temperament Most studies were done shortly after weaning to emulate what happens in the industry, says Ron Randel, animal physiologist at the Texas AgriLife Research and Extension Center in Overton, Texas. One of the most stressful times for an animal is after it is weaned. The team was among the first in the United States to adopt and use the exit velocity system developed in Australia, Randel says. The system measures the rate at which an animal <b>exits</b> a squeeze <b>chute</b> or scale box where it’s been restrained or held after transport. A fast exit indicates the animal is showing fear and is stressed by handling and human activity. Scientists also used pen scoring, a subjective measurement in which small groups of cattle are scored based on their reactions to a human observer. Scores range from 1 —calm, docile, and approachable, to 5 —aggressive and volatile...|$|R

Phenotypic {{relationships}} between docility and reproduction in Angus heifers. Journal of Animal Science, 94 (2), 483 - 489. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2015 - 9327 The {{objective of this}} study was to elucidate the phenotypic {{relationships between}} docility and first-service AI conception rate in heifers. Data (n = 337) collected from 3 cooperator herds in Kansas at the start of synchronization protocol included <b>exit</b> velocity (EV), <b>chute</b> score (CS), fecal cortisol (FC), and blood serum cortisol (BC). Data were analyzed using logistic regression with 30 -d pregnancy rate as the dependent variable. The model included the fixed effect of contemporary group and the covariates FC, BC, EV, CS, BW, and age. Correlation coefficients were calculated between all continuous traits. Pregnancy rate ranged from 34 % to 60 % between herds. Blood cortisol positively correlated with EV (r = 0. 22, P < 0. 01), negatively correlated with age (r = - 0. 12, P < 0. 03), and tended to be negatively correlated with BW (r = - 0. 10, P = 0. 09). Exit velocity was positively correlated with CS (r = 0. 24, P < 0. 01) and negatively correlated with BW (r = - 0. 15, P < 0. 01) and age (r = - 0. 12, P < 0. 03). Chute score negatively correlated with age (r = - 0. 14, P < 0. 01), and age and BW were moderately positively correlated (r = 0. 42, P < 0. 01), as expected. Older, heavier animals generally had better temperament, as indicated by lower BC, EV, and CS. The power of our test could detect no significant predictors of 30 -d pregnancy for the combined data from all ranches. When the data were divided by ranch, CS (P < 0. 03) and BW (P < 0. 01) were both significant predictors for 30 -d pregnancy for ranch 1. The odds ratio estimate for CS has an inverse relationship with pregnancy, meaning that a 1 -unit increase in average CS will reduce the probability of pregnancy at ranch 1 by 48. 1 %. Weight also has a negative impact on pregnancy because a 1 -kg increase in BW will decrease the probability of pregnancy by 2. 2 %.

40|$|Forty-eight Gelbvieh x Angus steers (265 ¡À 40 kg) were {{utilized}} {{to determine the}} relationships among molecular breeding values (MBV), steer performance, and carcass traits. Body weight (BW), hip height (HH), hip width (HW), exit velocity (EV; rate at which steers <b>exited</b> the squeeze <b>chute</b> and traversed 1. 8 m) and body ultrasound measurements of steers were recorded at d 0, 93 and 154 of grazing mixed stockpiled endophyte-infected and -free tall fescue. Tissue samples were collected for genomic profiling (Igenity, Merial Limited, Duluth, GA). Steers were transported to the Oklahoma State U fed for 159 d, harvested and carcass parameters recorded. At d 0 and 154 of grazing, BW was correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with MBV for ADG (r = 0. 31 and 0. 32 for d 0 and 154, respectively). Hip width was correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with MBV for ADG (r = 0. 33 and 0. 32 for d 0 and 154, respectively) at d 0 and 154. An inverse correlation between EV and MBV for LM area on d 0 (P 3 ̆c 0. 01; r = - 0. 48) and d 154 (P 3 ̆c 0. 03; r = - 0. 03) of grazing was observed; on d 93, EV and MBV for LM area tended to be inversely correlated. Ultrasound measurements for intramuscular fat on d 0 were correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with MBV for docility (r = 0. 40). Predictive potential of MBV from the stepwise procedure for steer performance and carcass composition was low (r 2 ¡Ü 0. 22). Molecular breeding values were correlated with several measurable traits that can be obtained on-farm. Incorporation of MBV may aid cattle producers in more accurate selection practices to increase profitability of beef production. Environmental and managerial conditions are known to affect subsequent performance and carcass traits of beef cattle. The objective of the second study was to document the effect of stocking rate (SR), grazing method (GM) and breed of sire on carcass traits. Steers and heifers (n = 460) grazed ¡®Maton¡¯ rye (Secale cereale L.) and ¡®TAM 90 ¡¯ annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) pastures from January to mid-May during 5 yr. Cattle were allotted to stocking rates (SR) of high (9 animals/ha), medium (6 animals/ha), or low (4 animals/ha), GM of continuous (CONT) or rotational (RT), and fed in commercial feedyards. Calves were sired by bulls from the following breeds; Angus (n = 171), Bonsmara (n = 108), Brahman (n = 109), Braunvieh (n = 31), Hereford (n = 12), and Simmental (n = 29). Body condition score (BCS); ultrasound measurements of intramuscular fat (UIMF), longissimus dorsi muscle area, and rump fat at end of grazing; ADG during grazing (119 d ¡À 25) and feedyard (125 d ¡À 28) phases; hot carcass weight (HCW); carcass ribfat (CRF); carcass LM area (CLMA); and yield grade (YG) were determined. Effects of year, gender, SR, GM, breed of sire, and interactions were determined by ANOVA. Simmental offspring had greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) amounts of UIMF than Bonsmara and Brahman (0. 11 ¡À 0. 03 and 0. 13 ¡À 0. 03, respectively). Stocking rate affected the HCW of cattle (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with high SR (314. 1 ¡À 5. 8 kg) cattle having lighter HCW than low SR (329. 0 ¡À 4. 9 kg). Stocking rates and breed of sire did affect carcass traits, and these variables can be managed to maximize carcass value...|$|R
