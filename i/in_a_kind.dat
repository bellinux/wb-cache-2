5|$|Life in {{proximity}} to humans and other domestic animals {{has led to}} a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E

25|$|With {{his book}} Il socialismo, {{published}} in 1884 in Catania, {{he became one}} of the first theoreticians of the Italian workers movement. His socialism was not based on the scientific Marxist approach, but was closer to the ideology of Mazzini – one of the fathers of Italian unification – with some influence of French utopian thinkers such as Georges Sorel, and in terms of practical politics resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of radical-democratic reformism.|$|E
25|$|This {{engagement}} {{is situated}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of middle ground of relationality, {{a space that}} is neither purely objective, because it is reciprocally constituted by a diversity of lived experiences motivating the movements of countless organisms, nor purely subjective, because it is nonetheless a field of material relationships between bodies. It is governed exclusively neither by causality, nor by intentionality. In this space of in-betweenness phenomenology can overcome its inaugural opposition to naturalism.|$|E
25|$|Historians debate Catherine's {{technical}} status, some {{seeing her}} as a regent or as a usurper, tolerable only during the minority of her son, Grand Duke Paul. In the 1770s, a group of nobles connected with Paul (Nikita Panin and others) considered a new coup to depose Catherine and transfer the crown to Paul, whose power they envisaged restricting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of constitutional monarchy. However, nothing came of this, and Catherine reigned until her death.|$|E

25|$|The series raises, explores, {{and offers}} fresh {{insights}} about ethical and moral issues {{emerging from the}} paradoxical nature of a counterterrorism organization which resorts to terrorist methods to succeed in its own ostensibly altruistic goals, and the attendant dilemmas in which the generally unwilling operatives in such an organization find themselves. Nikita's unwavering belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of moral absolutism (as opposed to Section One's prescribed philosophy of situational ethics) consistently and coherently motivates the underlying dramatic plot conflicts {{in the majority of}} the episodes.|$|E

25|$|The Acoma {{suffered}} high mortality from smallpox epidemics, as {{they had}} no immunity to such Eurasian infectious diseases. They also suffered raiding from the Apache, Comanche, and Ute. On occasion, the Acoma would side with the Spanish to fight against these nomadic tribes. Forced to formally adopt Catholicism, the Acoma proceeded to practice their traditional religion in secrecy, and combined elements of both in a syncretic blend. Intermarriage and interaction became common among the Acoma, other pueblos, and Hispanic villages. These communities would intermingle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of creolization to form the culture of New Mexico.|$|E

Drake, having raided Cartagena harbor a decade before, decided this important place was the next target.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the American and British {{counterculture}} and hippie {{movement had}} moved rock towards psychedelia, heavy metal, progressive rock and other styles that incorporated socially and politically incisive lyrics. The 1968 German student movement, French protests and Italian student movement had created a class of young, intellectual continental listeners, while nuclear weapons, pollution, and war inspired protests and activism. Avant-garde music had taken a turn towards the electronic in the mid-1950s. The avant-garde minimalist music current emerged in the early 1960s with the works of Americans La Monte Young, Terry Riley and Steve Reich. They used drones and loops (often with synthesizers and tapes) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of psychedelic and space-oriented music.|$|E

25|$|Then between 1986 and 1989, new {{techniques}} were brought into play {{to combine the}} signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one, more powerful signal, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of an antenna array. This was done at Goldstone, California, Canberra, and Madrid using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, the Parkes Radio Telescope was brought into the array {{in time for the}} fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, the Very Large Array in New Mexico was brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone. Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth.|$|E
25|$|At Bathurst, Rutherford {{became a}} member of the council, had a term as mayor in 1868, and was {{treasurer}} to the Agricultural Society for 30 years. He encouraged the planting of trees in the town, and exercised an open-handed philanthropy. During his long period as governing-director of Cobb and Co., he kept in touch with his large station-properties, riding large distances as a young man, and later often travelling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of Cape cart. Even in his eighties he continued the supervision of his stations, and he died at Mackay, Queensland, on 13 September 1911, when returning from a visit to one of them.
