50|$|Additional {{radiotherapy}} is {{also used}} if total removal is not possible. Due to the poor outcomes associated with damage to the pituitary and hypothalamus from surgical removal and radiation, experimental therapies using <b>intracavitary</b> phosphorus-32, yttrium, or bleomycin delivered via an external reservoir are sometimes employed, especially in young patients. The tumor, being in the pituitary gland, can cause secondary health problems. The immune system, thyroid levels, growth hormone levels and testosterone levels can be compromised from craniopharygioma. All of the before mentioned health problems can be treated with modern medicine. There is no high quality evidence looking at the use of bleomycin in this condition.|$|E
50|$|Cervical cancers can recur with {{symptoms}} of vaginal bleeding and/or discharge, pelvic pain, {{pain in the}} back and legs, leg swelling (edema), chronic cough and weight loss. It can recur in the vagina, pelvis, lymph nodes, lung, or liver. “If radiation was not given previously, recurrences that are confined to the pelvis may be treated with external beam radiation with chemotherapy and <b>intracavitary</b> or interstitial radiation therapy. If radiation therapy was already given, the only option is the removal of the vagina, uterus, and the bladder and/or rectum with the creation of an artificial bladder-a pelvic exenteration. The five-year survival rate after a pelvic exenteration is about 50 percent.” (womenscancercenter.com) Chemotherapy is useful in women with recurrent tumors which cannot be removed surgically or in women with metastatic diseases.|$|E
50|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{the most}} common inherited cardiac disease, occurring in 1:500 individuals in the general population. It is estimated that there are 600,000 individuals in the United States with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The most common variant of HCM presents with left ventricular (LV) <b>intracavitary</b> obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and mitral-septal contact, diagnosed readily with echocardiography. Pharmacologic treatment with negative inotropic drugs is first-line therapy. Beta-blockers are used first, and while they improve symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain and exercise intolerance, they do not reduce resting LV intraventricular pressure gradients and often are inadequate to control symptoms. Many investigators and clinicians believe that disopyramide controlled release {{is the most}} potent agent available for reducing resting pressure gradients and improving symptoms. Disopyramide has been actively used for more than 30 years. Disopyramide administration for obstructive HCM has a IIa recommendation in the 2011 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation guidelines for treatment of obstructive HCM. A IIa treatment recommendation indicates that benefits outweigh risk, and that it is reasonable to administer treatment.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of applying trans-applicator <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonography to image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer. Material and methods : For this experiment, a phantom was created and included a polyethylene tube, intended to simulate a tandem applicator, which was inserted into chicken meat and embedded in agar, along with magnetic reso­nance imaging (MRI) -compatible ovoid applicators. Three-dimensional images of the phantom were obtained using computed tomography (CT), MRI (T 2 -weighted), and <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonography sectional images acquired at 1 mm slice intervals. <b>Intracavitary</b> ultrasonography images were acquired from within the simulated tandem applicator using a radial transducer. Magnetic resonance imaging and <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonography images were manually registered onto CT images. The chicken meat was contoured as the target volume independently on the CT, MRI, and <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonography images, and the Dice similarity coefficient {{was used to compare}} the target volumes. The dose distributions of a sample brachytherapy plan were also evaluated. Results : Computed tomography, MRI, and <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonography all visualized the three-dimensional phantom volumes. <b>Intracavitary</b> ultrasonography images depicted the meat with high echoic signals and a border clearly distinguishable from the surrounding agar. The Dice similarity coefficient values for the target volumes on CT vs. MRI, CT vs. <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonography, and MRI vs. <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonography were 0. 966, 0. 965, and 0. 971, respectively, indicating similar contouring with the three modalities. Among the modalities, the differences in D 50, D 90, D 98, and D 100 values were 1. 8 %, 2. 9 %, 3. 7 %, and 2. 9 %, respectively. Conclusions : Three-dimensional reconstructed trans-applicator <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonographic images clearly depicted meat tissue within the phantom, and could thus be used for brachytherapy planning. This study proves the concept of trans-applicator <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonography for <b>intracavitary</b> brachytherapy. Further research such as development of <b>intracavitary</b> ultrasonography system, 3 D reconstruction method, ultrasonography-compatible applicators, and ultrasonography-based target concept is warranted to assess the potential clinical application...|$|E

40|$|The {{correlation}} between <b>intracavitary</b> thrombosis detected by cross sectional echocardiography and systemic embolism was studied in 126 consecutive patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who were examined from January 1980 to September 1987. A total of 1041 serial echocardiograms were obtained with 3. 5 and 5 MHz transducers. The mean follow up period was 41. 2 months. The survival rate was 88 % at {{two years and}} 56 % at five years. Echocardiography showed <b>intracavitary</b> thrombi in 14 (11. 1 %) patients; 13 were mural and 11 were localised {{at the apex of}} the left ventricle. Twelve patients (8. 4 %) had systemic emboli; this corresponded to an incidence of new embolic events of 1. 4 for 100 patient-years. Patients with <b>intracavitary</b> thrombi or systemic emboli were treated with oral anticoagulants, as were nine in functional class IV of the New York Heart Association, for 61 patient-years. The cumulative observation period for the whole population study was 418 patient-years. None of the patients with <b>intracavitary</b> thrombosis had embolic complications and none of those with embolism had <b>intracavitary</b> thrombi. Rates of <b>intracavitary</b> thrombosis and systemic embolism in this series were low and there was no overlap between the two events. This may have been because the patients did not have severe dilated cardiomyopathy, because echocardiography did not detect all the thrombi, or because patients were treated with oral anticoagulants. The presence of intracardiac thrombosis detected by cross sectional echocardiography is not predictive of systemic embolism in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Criteria {{for the use of the}} anticoagulant treatment remain largely empirical in these cases...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the efficacy of 252 Californium neutron <b>intracavitary</b> brachytherapy using a two-channel Y applicator combined with external beam radiotherapy for the treatment of endometrial cancer. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with stage I-III endometrial cancer were recruited for this study. The stage I patients received only 252 Californium neutron <b>intracavitary</b> brachytherapy with a two-channel applicator. The stage II and III patients received both 252 Californium neutron <b>intracavitary</b> brachytherapy using a two-channel applicator and parallel-opposed whole pelvic radiotherapy.

40|$|High-intensity focused {{ultrasound}} (HIFU) is an ablative treatment undergoing {{assessment for}} the treatment of benign and malignant disease. We describe the first reported <b>intracavitary</b> HIFU ablation for recurrent, unresectable and symptomatic cervical cancer. A 38  year old woman receiving palliative chemotherapy for metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma was offered ablative treatment from an <b>intracavitary</b> trans-rectal HIFU device (Sonablate® 500). Pre-treatment symptoms included vaginal bleeding and discharge that were sufficient to impede her quality of life. No peri-procedural adverse events occurred. Symptoms resolved completely immediately post-procedure, reappeared at 7  days, increasing to pre-procedural levels by day 30. This first time experience of <b>intracavitary</b> cervical HIFU suggests that it is feasible for palliation of advanced cervical cancer, with no early evidence of unexpected toxicity. Ethical approval had also been granted for the use of per-vaginal access if appropriate. This route, alone or in combination with the rectal route, may provide increased accessibility in future patients with a redesigned device more suited to trans-vaginal ablations. <b>Intracavitary</b> HIFU is a potentially safe procedure {{for the treatment}} of cervical cancer and able to provide symptomatic improvement in the palliative setting...|$|E

40|$|A 45 -year-old {{male who}} had an {{intermediate}} pretest probability and had some atypical ECG changes while undergoing the tread mill test was referred for a CT coronary angiogram. The CT angiogram revealed an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the left coronary sinus. The proximal RCA coursed between the aortic root and the main pulmonary artery (inter-arterial “malignant ” course). Kinking and narrowing of the proximal RCA was noted as it passed between the right ventricular outflow tract and the aortic root (Figs. 1 and 2). The distal segment of the RCA showed an <b>intracavitary</b> course for a distance of 2 cm in the right atrial cavity. There were no plaques {{in the course of}} any of the coronary arteries. Majority of the congenital anomalies of coronary arteries are related to their ectopic origins. The other less common anomaly is <b>intracavitary</b> course of a vessel (1). Although <b>intracavitary</b> course of the RCA is clinically silent, but it might pose a great challenge to an unsuspecting interventional cardiologist who might damage the <b>intracavitary</b> portion of the vessel during interventional angioplasties, electrophysiological studies and ablation procedures.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} was to analyze the outcomes of the patients, who received salvage radiotherapy for incidentally discovered cervical cancer following simple hysterectomy, and to identify the influence of <b>intracavitary</b> radiotherapy on treatment outcomes. Methods: Data from 117 patients with occult cervical cancer who underwent simple hysterec-tomy followed by salvage radiotherapy from September 1979 to November 2010 were collected. All the patients received external beam radiotherapy with (n 45) or without (n 72) intracavi-tary radiotherapy. Local control, disease-free survival, overall survival and treatment-related toxicity were investigated. Results: The median follow-up time was 75 months. The 5 - and 10 -year local control/disease-free survival/overall survival rates were 93 / 87 / 87 % and 90 / 84 / 83 %, respectively.
