25|$|Upper Crab Creek was dry {{before the}} CBP and remains {{intermittent}} today. From its source near Reardan it flows generally southwest then west, collecting tributaries including Rock Creek, Coal Creek, Duck Creek, Canniwai Creek, and Wilson Creek. It empties into Brook Lake, located {{just south of}} Billy Clapp Lake, an <b>equalizing</b> <b>reservoir</b> of the CBP created by Pinto Dam.|$|E
50|$|An oxygen {{concentrator}} has an air compressor, two cylinders filled with zeolite pellets, a pressure <b>equalizing</b> <b>reservoir,</b> and some valves and tubes. In the first half-cycle the first cylinder receives {{air from the}} compressor, which lasts about 3 seconds. During that time the pressure in the first cylinder rises from atmospheric to about 1.5 times normal atmospheric pressure (typically 20 psi/138 kPa gauge, or 2.36 atmospheres absolute) and the zeolite becomes saturated with nitrogen. As the first cylinder reaches near pure oxygen (there are small amounts of argon, CO2, water vapour, radon and other minor atmospheric components) in the first half-cycle, a valve opens and the oxygen enriched gas flows to the pressure <b>equalizing</b> <b>reservoir,</b> which connects to the patient's oxygen hose. At {{the end of the}} first half of the cycle, there is another valve position change so that the air from the compressor is directed to the 2nd cylinder. Pressure in the first cylinder drops as the enriched oxygen moves into the reservoir, allowing the nitrogen to be desorbed back into gas. Part way through the second half of the cycle there is another valve position change to vent the gas in the first cylinder back into the ambient atmosphere, keeping the concentration of oxygen in the pressure <b>equalizing</b> <b>reservoir</b> from falling below about 90%. The pressure in the hose delivering oxygen from the <b>equalizing</b> <b>reservoir</b> is kept steady by a pressure reducing valve.|$|E
50|$|An {{equalizing}} basin (Ausgleichsbecken) or <b>equalizing</b> <b>reservoir</b> {{regulates the}} flow of water below an intermittently operated hydropower station or peaking power plant. This could be a part-load power station (Teillast-Durchfluss-Kraftwerk) or a storage power station. Also called a balancing reservoir.|$|E
25|$|As the {{pressure}} in the train line {{and that of the}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>equalize,</b> the triple valve closes, causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in, and the brake cylinder is not pressurized.|$|R
50|$|The Mountain Dell Dam {{provides}} a water <b>equalizing</b> and storage <b>reservoir</b> for Salt Lake City, Utah located 10 mi {{east of the}} city in northeastern Salt Lake County, near Interstate 80 in Parley's Canyon.|$|R
50|$|During the Battle of Festung Breslau in 1945 {{the tower}} {{served as a}} command point. The {{surrounding}} area was heavily bombed and damaged in raging combat, yet the tower remained almost intact during World War II. However, {{the war and the}} following years saw the tower suffer greatly from neglect. Until the mid eighties the tower served as a <b>reservoir,</b> <b>equalizing</b> water pressure for the southern districts.|$|R

50|$|Dry Falls Dam is a rockfaced earthfill type dam in the U.S. {{state of}} Washington. Located in Grant County near Coulee City, {{it was built}} {{as part of the}} Bureau of Reclamation's Columbia Basin Project. Water from the Columbia River, impounded by Grand Coulee Dam, is pumped into Grand Coulee, a {{formerly}} dry canyon, through the short Feeder Canal. Grand Coulee's north end is sealed by North Dam and Dry Falls Dam stretches across the midsection of the Coulee. This allows the water pumped from the Columbia River to fill the upper Grand Coulee, creating a large <b>equalizing</b> <b>reservoir</b> known as Banks Lake. Water from the reservoir is fed into the irrigation project's Main Canal, which runs south from Dry Falls Dam to another reservoir called Billy Clapp Lake, formed by Pinto Dam.|$|E
30|$|Multiple differing FCD {{geometries}} {{have been}} commercialized {{to accomplish the}} goal of <b>equalizing</b> <b>reservoir</b> flux along the wellbore. All FCD geometries are similar in that they induce an additional pressure drop as fluid travels between the reservoir and the completion base pipe so that the total pressure drop for any fluid flow path is equivalent and thus fluid conformance is maximized (Atkinson et al. 2004). However, the mechanism by which this pressure drop is created can vary wildly between geometries, resulting in drastically different long-term injection/production behavior as reservoir and operational conditions change (Carpenter 2015; Denney 2015). Following sections will explain the existing FCD types.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have modeled a {{high-temperature}} Root's type compressor and compared predicted results with measurements. Compression process is modeled using multiple control volumes. Initially, there are two control volumes connected by an “expansion nozzle” naturally formed by the rotor tip and the blower casing. The “nozzle” has time-varying geometry and is modeled to allow transition from choked to non-choked flow. The well-filling process is modeled via expansion of the compressed gas from the high-pressure reservoir into the well through this “nozzle. ” When the pressures in the well and <b>reservoir</b> <b>equalize,</b> the “passive” part of the compression process is taken to be complete. At this point, the gas in the well {{is assumed to be}} fully-mixed and the two control volumes are subsequently considered as one. Then the “active” part of compression takes place. Numerical computations are shown to agree well with the experimental data...|$|R
