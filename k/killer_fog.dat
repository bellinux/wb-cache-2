50|$|The {{adaptation}} is very {{faithful to}} the novel except for moving the setting to the show's 1950's timeframe and two minor changes in detail: Lucy's beach house becomes a country house, and Lucy is interested in preventing <b>killer</b> <b>fog</b> from occurring in New York City.|$|E
50|$|Pea soup, or a pea souper, {{also known}} as a black fog, <b>killer</b> <b>fog</b> or smog is a very thick and often yellowish, greenish, or blackish fog caused by air {{pollution}} that contains soot particulates and the poisonous gas sulphur dioxide. This very thick smog occurs in cities and is derived from the smoke given off by the burning of soft coal for home heating and in industrial processes. Smog of this intensity is often lethal to vulnerable people such as the elderly, the very young and those with respiratory problems. The result of these phenomena was commonly known as a London particular or London fog, which then, in a reversal of the idiom, became the name for a thick pea and ham soup.|$|E
5000|$|Industrial Nightmares 21 September 1921: the BASF {{fertilizer}} factory {{explosion in}} Oppau Germany results in 561 deaths and over 2000 injuries. Since the ammonium nitrate had compacted in the silo, small explosive charges {{were used to}} break it up. This was generally a safe practice. However, this time it wasn't. It was determined {{that there was a}} change in chemical composition in the silo that caused a blast that was felt for miles and was heard as far away as Munich, over 300 km. // December 1930: a <b>killer</b> <b>fog</b> forms in the Meuse Valley industrial region in Belgium. Beginning 1 December 1930, a thick fog settled over the Meuse Valley in Belgium. The rancid air causes many to have breathing problems. After a few days, the Guard tried to dispel the yellow, foul-smelling fog by burning brush and branches, but the smoke only added to the bad conditions. By the time it cleared 60 people died, mostly from dyspnea, shortness of breath. Most of the victims were elderly, the oldest being 89, but one young girl, only 20, also died. Blame was placed on the burning of sulfurous coal for fuel. The conditions that caused the fog also kept the fumes from rising. Changes were made in both the use of coal for fuel and for the height of chimneys in the area. ©2005 ...|$|E

50|$|During the Quell, Peeta {{comes in}} contact with a force field and his heart stops. Katniss and Peeta’s {{efficient}} ally, Finnick Odair, succeeds in reviving him with CPR. Finnick Odair is the District 4 male victor tribute and a stunningly good-looking young man. The three soon band together with a few other tributes: Mags from District 4, Beetee and Wiress from District 3, and Johanna Mason from District 7. Eventually, they {{find out that the}} arena is shaped like a clock, with 12 sections, and each section is triggered at the same times each day. Different hours indicated different tortures such as blood rain, acid <b>fog,</b> <b>killer</b> monkeys, and so on. As they formulate a plan to kill the remaining tributes, Wiress is killed and Katniss is attacked by Johanna. Once Katniss regains consciousness she realizes that Beetee had designed a way to destroy the force field surrounding the arena. She triggers it and destroys the field, setting off a chain of events. A rebel-controlled hovercraft arrives and rescues Katniss, Finnick, and Beetee. However, Peeta, Johanna and Enobaria have been captured by the Capitol. Finnick, Beetee, Haymitch, Johanna and a few other tributes were part of a plan to safely retrieve Katniss and Peeta from the arena with hopes that they would take on roles to start a revolution against the Capitol. Knowing that the Head Gamemaker, Plutarch Heavensbee, is secretly leading the revolution, Katniss goes to District 13, long believed to have been razed decades ago. Gale explains that after Katniss destroyed the arena, President Snow had District 12 firebombed.|$|R
40|$|In an {{environmental}} disaster, a disaster causes environmental harm, or {{an environmental}} change causes an acute risk to humans, {{or a combination}} of both takes place. Examples include the BP oil spill, the London <b>killer</b> <b>fog</b> of 1952, the 2003 European heat wave, and the 2011 Japanese tsunami. Climate change will intensify the connection between disaster issues and the environment. Given the interwoven nature of disasters and the environment, we should consider what environmental law and disaster law can learn from each other. Environmental law has the most to teach disaster law about risk management and prevention. Disaster law, in contrast, directs attention to issues of unequal risk exposure and to compensation as a supplement to risk mitigation...|$|E
