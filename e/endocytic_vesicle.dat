This difference was also apparent during cellular insulin exposure and after insulin removal. Endocytosis of insulin and IGF (insulin-like growth factor) II was also examined. In sucrose gradients, IGF II-containing vesicles were less dense than those containing internalized insulin. Receptor-mediated <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicles</b> were distinct from fluid-phase <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicles,</b> but overlapped with the GT-containing vesicles.

ResultsThe Schizosaccharomyces pombe WISH/DIP/SPIN 90 ortholog dip 1 p is an actin-patch protein that regulates the temporal sequence of endocytic events. dip 1 Δ mutants exhibit a novel phenotype in which early events such as WASp localization occur normally but arrival of Arp 2 / 3, actin polymerization, and subsequent steps are delayed and occur with apparently random timing. In studying this mutant, we demonstrate that positive feedback loops of WASp, rapid actin assembly, and Arp 2 / 3 contribute to switch-like behavior that initiates actin polymerization.

This reversibility indicates that the vesicles themselves contain a mechanism for acidification. The increase in vesicle pH due to these treatments can be observed visually using an SIT video camera. Using this method, it is shown that endocytic vesicles become acidic at very early times (i. e., within 5 - 7 min of continuous uptake at 37 degrees C) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Treatment of {{short-term}} monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes with the proton ionophore, monensin, abolishes asialoglycoprotein degradation, despite little {{effect of the}} drug on either surface binding of ligand or internalization of prebound ligand. Centrifuging cell homogenates on Percoll density gradients indicates that, {{as a result of}} monensin treatment, ligand does not enter lysosomes but sediments instead in a lower density subcellular fraction that is likely an <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicle.</b> Analyzing the degree of receptor association of intracellular ligand revealed that monensin prevents the dissociation of the receptor-ligand complex that normally occurs subsequent to endocytosis. The weak base, chloroquine, also blocks this intracellular dissociation. Evidence from sequential substitution experiments is presented, indicating that monensin and chloroquine act at the same point in the sequence of events leading to ligand dissociation. These data are discussed in terms of a pHmediated dissociation of the receptor-ligand complex within a prelysosomal <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicle.</b> Streptomyces cinnamonensis produces a carboxylic acid ionophore called monensin that can mediate proton exchange for monovalent cations, preferably sodium (1). Monensin, when added to eucaryotic cells, has been shown to have a variety o...|$|E
40|$|Clathrin-mediated {{endocytosis}} {{is a major}} pathway for uptake of lipid {{and protein}} cargo at the plasma membrane. The lattices of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles are comprised of triskelions, each consisting of three oligomerized heavy chains (HC) bound by a light chain (LC). In addition to binding HC, LC interacts {{with members of the}} Hip 1 /R family of endocytic proteins, including the budding yeast homologue, Sla 2 p. Here, using in vivo analysis in yeast, we provide novel insight into the role of this interaction. We find that overexpression of LC partially restores endocytosis to cells lacking clathrin HC. This suppression is dependent on the Sla 2 p binding region of LC. Using live cell imaging techniques to visualize <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicle</b> formation, we find that the N-terminal Sla 2 p binding region of LC promotes the progression of arrested Sla 2 p patches that form in the absence of HC. We propose that LC binding to Sla 2 p positively regulates Sla 2 p for efficient <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicle</b> formation...|$|E
40|$|Since reticulocytes have a {{high demand}} for iron, which is {{required}} for heme biosynthesis, these cells are highly specialized in the endocytosis of the iron carrier transferrin (Tf). From the resulting <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicles</b> (EVs), iron is released and the vesicles rapidly return to the cell membrane where they fuse, causing {{the release of the}} apotransferrin. Due to a lack of other intracellular compartments, the <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicles</b> can be readily isolated. In this study, we have investigated the fusogenic properties of EVs, using liposomes as target membranes. Membrane fusion was monitored by a lipid mixing assay based on the relief of fluorescence self-quenching, using octadecylrhodamine B-chloride (R 18). Application of this procedure was verified and solidified by analysis of the fusion event by an independent lipid mixing assay, after in situ labeling of EVs, and by determination of the mixing of aqueous contents. We demonstrate that the <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicles</b> are particularly prone to fuse with target membranes that contain dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). Relative to DOPE, bilayers composed of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylcholine show a reduced fusion activity with EV. The specific and strong inhibition of fusion by cyclosporin A and a peptide known to interfere with the propensity of DOPE to adopt the hexagonal HII phase suggests that the mechanism of fusion involves the ability of this lipid to readily adopt non-bilayer phases. ATP, GTP, and/or cytosol are not necessary to obtain fusion. However, trypsin treatment of the <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicles</b> inhibits fusion, indicating the involvement of (a) protein(s) in the fusion event...|$|R

40|$|The {{biological}} function of receptors {{is determined by}} their appropriate trafficking through the endosomal pathway. Following internalization, the transferrin (Tf) receptor quantitatively recycles to the plasma membrane, whereas the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor undergoes degradation. To determine how Tf and EGF engage these two different pathways we imaged their binding and early endocytic pathway in live cells using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-M). We find that EGF and Tf bind to distinct plasma membrane regions and are incorporated into different <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicles.</b> After internalization, both EGF-enriched and Tf-enriched vesicles interact with endosomes containing early endosome antigen 1 (EEA 1). EGF is incorporated and retained in these endosomes, while Tf-containing vesicles rapidly dissociate and move to a juxtanuclear compartment. <b>Endocytic</b> <b>vesicles</b> carrying EGF recruit more Rab 5 GTPase than those carrying Tf, which, by strengthening their association with EEA 1 -enriched endosomes, may provide a mechanism for the observed cargo-specific sorting. These results reveal pre-endocytic sorting of Tf and EGF, a specialized role for EEA 1 -enriched endosomes in EGF trafficking, and a potential mechanism for cargo-specified sorting of <b>endocytic</b> <b>vesicles</b> by these endosomes...|$|R
