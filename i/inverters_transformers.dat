In order to plan far into the future and keep pace with load growth, a load flow power system analysis approach must be developed and utilized. This method is a well known energy assessment and management tool that is widely used throughout the Electrical Power Utility Industry.

40|$|Being {{driven by}} natural commutating inverter, {{induction}} motor frequently self-excites due to peculiar circuit formation of inverter. Then {{in this paper}} we proposed the checking method of self-excitation of induction motor by controlling the DC excitation of <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer,</b> and proved its availability. It is shown in chapter 3 that self-excitation of induction motor is expressed as functions of circuit constants of inverter and degree of DC excitation of <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer.</b> From these facts we set up the relation between the bounds of induction motor and DC excitation of <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer,</b> and proved that self-excitation of induction motor could be checked by controlling the DC excitation of <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer.</b> In chapter 4, we calculated this theoretical results using the constants of 6 KW inverter, compered this calculated values with experimental ones, and verified the theoretical results.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to analyze the characteristics of <b>inverter</b> which <b>transformer</b> is asymmetrically magnetized, because magnetizing characteristics of <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer</b> are nonlinear and input current to DC winding of <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer</b> is interrupted one. Then we tried to linearize these nonlinear elements in this paper. To the former we adopted the equivalent admittance {{as a function of}} the asymmetrical magnetization and to the latter we expressed the interrupted current as the sum of step current with a constant lag time. As the results of these linearizations, it is possible to use the law of superposition instead of step by step method and allalysis becomes simple. Next we calculated the output voltage waveforms of inverter at steady state using linearized method and compared these with expermental ones of 10 KW inverter.

40|$|A {{document}} {{discusses the}} changes {{made to a}} standard push-pull inverter circuit to avoid saturation effects in the main inverter power supply. Typically, in a standard push-pull arrangement, the unsymmetrical primary excitation causes variations in the volt second integral of each half of the excitation cycle {{that could lead to}} the establishment of DC flux density in the magnetic core, which could eventually cause saturation of the main <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer.</b> The relocation of the filter reactor normally placed across the output of the power supply solves this problem. The filter reactor was placed in series with the primary circuit of the main <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer,</b> and is presented as impedance against the sudden changes on the input current. The reactor averaged the input current in the primary circuit, avoiding saturation of the main <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer.</b> Since the implementation of the described change, the above problem has not reoccurred, and failures in the main power transistors have been avoided...|$|R

40|$|Because natural commutating {{inverter}} builts up AC {{output voltage}} following to circuit condition and valve action of inverter, AC output voltage and leading angle of inverter vary widely with change of load and disturbance. In order to operate this inverter stably, AC output voltage and leading angle of inverter must be controlled at constant value even if load changes. Then several steps {{have been taken}} for these purposes. But these {{can be done by}} controlling of DC excitation of <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer.</b> Constant control of AC output voltage by this method has been reported, so we discuss the constant control of leading angle by adjusting DC excitation of <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer</b> in this paper. It is proved theoretically in chapter 2 that the leading angle is controlled by DC excitation of <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer.</b> And this fact is proved experimentally by 6 KW inverter in chapter 4. In chapter 4 we expressed the leading angle control system of invetter with block diagram also, and obitained the transient response of the system to reference input, load resistance and capacitance changes. From these steady state and transient responses, it has been pointed out thatï¼š (1) controllable domain of leading angle is determined by construction of inverter circuit, (2) the response speed of leading angle is determined by the time constant of DC source circuit of inverter, and (3) construction of the control system discussed here is easier than others...|$|R

40|$|Inverters have {{traditionally}} been used mostly in standalone systems (non-grid connected), Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) and, more recently, in distributed generated systems (DGs). DG systems are based on grid connected inverters and are increasingly being connected to utility grids to convert renewable energy sources to the utility grids. Such sources {{are likely to have}} a significant impact in the future in meeting the electricity demands of industry and domestic consumption. Common DGs utilize DC power sources such as fuel cells, batteries, photovoltaic (solar) power, and wind power. Most of power supplies in domestic and industries are AC power consumers and, for this reason, the DC power has to be converted to meet the requirement. Two main causes of DC current in <b>inverter</b> power <b>transformer</b> are: 1) Non-linearity and asymmetry in its switching mechanism which may result in undesired DC current at its input. This DC current introduced into an <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer</b> results in the transformer's magnetic flux distortion and in some cases magnetic saturation. This, in turn, results in asymmetrical primary currents in the <b>transformer</b> (<b>inverter</b> side). This is due to the non linear characteristics of the transformer magnetic flux. 2) The same effects can be produced by the connection of asymmetrical loads (e. g. asymmetrical rectifier) to the inverter output. The result in both cases is an asymmetrical magnetic flux in the transformer. This is manifested as even and odd current harmonics as well as an increase in the reactive power requirement from the inverter. vi To remedy this situation, it is, therefore, necessary to incorporate into the inverter's control system a mechanism of cancelling the DC magnetic motive force (mmf) that causes the magnetic flux distortion. This Thesis presents a method of introducing a DC voltage component in the inverter's voltage output so as to inject the necessary DC current into the primary side of the <b>inverter's</b> <b>transformer</b> so as to cancel the total DC mmf that the transformer is subjected to (supply and load side). This project consists of three main parts namely: Modeling, Simulation and Laboratory Experiment. Activities undertaken under Modeling and Simulation were as follows: Determining the effects of DC current on a power transformer. Investigating the likely occurrence of saturation of the power <b>transformer</b> incorporated in <b>inverter</b> systems. Mitigating the effects that can be caused by the presence of a DC component in the windings of a power transformer. After understanding the literature on the subject of interest, MATLAB SIMULINK and MATLAB m-files were used to simulate the behavior of the power transformer under three situations : The transformer under linear load. The transformer subjected to asymmetrical loading. The inverter system that has a power transformer on its output were designed in MATLAB and used to simulate the situation for each case. To validate the theory and simulation results, experimental work was carried out as follows: vii Investigation of the effects that DC (current) injection can have on a 6 kVA power transformer. Investigation of the performance of a 6 kVA power transformer under linear loading. Investigation of the performance of a 6 kVA power transformer under non-linear loads. Investigation of the likely occurrence of DC offset in inverter system. Mitigation of the effect of DC bias on power transformer using extra windings. Mitigation of the effects of DC offset in power <b>inverter</b> <b>transformer</b> by using the second harmonic content of the primary current as a feedback signal. Results obtained showed a successful implementation of the proposed method. However limitations of the controller performances were experienced and will require future work.
