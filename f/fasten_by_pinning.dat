5000|$|The shamshir is a one-handed, curved sword {{featuring}} a slim blade that has almost no taper {{until the very}} tip. Instead of being worn upright (hilt-high), it is worn horizontally, with the hilt and tip pointing up. It was normally used for slashing unarmored opponents either on foot or mounted; while the tip {{could be used for}} thrusting, the drastic curvature of blade made accuracy more difficult. It has an offset pommel, and its two lengthy quillons form a simple crossguard. The tang of the blade is covered by slabs of bone, ivory, wood, or other material <b>fastened</b> <b>by</b> <b>pins</b> or rivets to form the grip. Many of the older Persian shamshir blades are made from high quality crucible wootz steel, and are noted for the fine [...] "watering" [...] on the blades.|$|R
50|$|The Harris Street Bridge {{is located}} {{southeast}} of the junction of Dean Street (United States Route 44) and River Street in eastern Taunton. Dean Street parallels the Taunton River. When the bridge was built in 1887, it crossed on Harris Street, which is now dead-ended on the south {{bank of the river}} to the east. The bridge is a single-span Pratt truss 100 ft long, 35 ft wide, and 35 ft tall, with a span of 95 ft. The truss elements are wrought iron and are <b>fastened</b> together <b>by</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R

60|$|The beggar {{said that}} Ulysses wore a double mantle of purple, clasped {{with a gold}} brooch <b>fastened</b> <b>by</b> two safety <b>pins</b> (for these were used at that time), and {{on the face of}} the brooch was a figure of a hound holding a {{struggling}} fawn in his forepaws. (Many such brooches have been found in the graves in Greece). Beneath his mantle Ulysses wore a shining smock, smooth and glittering like the skin of an onion. Probably it was made of silk: women greatly admired it. With him was a squire named Eurybates, a brown, round-shouldered man.|$|R
500|$|It is {{uncertain}} when the Halifax Gibbet was first introduced, {{but it may}} not have been until some time in the 16th century; before then decapitation would have been carried out by an executioner using an axe or a sword. The device, which seems to have been unique in England, consisted of two [...] tall parallel beams of wood joined at the top by a transverse beam. Running in grooves within the beams was a square wooden block [...] in length, into the bottom of which was fitted an axe head weighing [...] The whole structure sat on a platform of stone blocks, [...] square and [...] high, which was ascended by a flight of steps. A rope attached to the top of the wooden block holding the axe ran over a pulley at the top of the structure, allowing the block to be raised. The rope was then <b>fastened</b> <b>by</b> a <b>pin</b> to the structure's stone base.|$|R

50|$|The {{key to the}} Grip Pod is {{the button}} {{near the top of}} the grip. This button connects to a {{spring-loaded}} sliding piston in the grip, that sits atop the bi-pod legs. When the button is pressed, the spring is released and decompressed, which pushes the piston down. This action expands the two housed legs out of the grip and into their locked and spread position. The legs are connected to each other by a joint that is <b>fastened</b> <b>by</b> a <b>pin</b> with threading on one end, called a pivot pin. A torsion spring, similar to those used in mousetraps, allows the legs the tension to expand outward, assuming their locked position. A rubber O-ring is in place at the bottom of the grip to catch a ledge at the top of the bi-pod leg mechanism. This prevents the legs from over-extending or leaving the grip completely. The grips are mainly made from reinforced polymer, while the legs are stainless steel covered by polymer. Each Grip Pod is 5.75 inches long with the legs concealed, and 7.25 inches long with the legs deployed. The Grip Pod mounts to a weapon using the Picatinny Rail system.|$|R
2500|$|The dress {{itself was}} put {{together}} by Linton and Curtis of Albemarle Street. The front of the dress was made of white satin, featuring three small flounces old Honiton lace which had been used on the wedding dress of her mother. The bodice, cut at the throat, was long and pointed and was made of Silver's white and silver brocade, also featuring {{a small amount of}} her mother's Honiton lace near the top and on {{the upper part of the}} sleeve. The rich satin manteau de cour fell from her shoulders.The train was long and plain (although The Times reported there was none) and the veil of her mother's which she wore was also made of Honiton lace, <b>fastened</b> <b>by</b> diamond <b>pins</b> given as a gift from [...] Queen Victoria. Matching the orange blossom elements to the dress, small wreaths were placed all the way around the bust and on the hair. [...] Princess Mary completed the wedding outfit with a diamond tiara from Queen Victoria; diamond rivière necklace [...] from the Prince and Princess of Wales and diamond earrings and anchor brooch, a wedding gift from Prince George. Out of all of the wedding toilette, the veil was reportedly the only piece that was not worn again after the wedding.|$|R
60|$|Strange and unnatural {{as was the}} {{whitening}} of the hair, it {{was effective}} in enhancing the beauty of Aurelia's dark arched brows, the soft brilliance of her large velvety brown eyes, and the exquisite carnation and white of her colouring. Her features were delicately chiselled, and her face had that peculiar fresh, innocent, soft, untouched bloom and undisturbed repose which form the special charm and glory of the first dawn of womanhood. Her little head was well poised on a slender neck, just now curving a little to one side with the fatigue of the hours during which it had sustained her headgear. This consisted of a tiny flat hat, <b>fastened</b> on <b>by</b> long <b>pins,</b> and adorned <b>by</b> a cluster of campanulas like those on her dress, with a similar blue butterfly on an invisible wire above them, the dainty handiwork of Harriet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{has a unique}} shape which {{has been described as}} [...] "half a silkworm's cocoon, cut in half the long way." [...] It is 1,175 feet (358.14 m) long, 325 feet (99.06 m) wide, and 211 feet (64.31 m) high, supported by 13 steel arches. There is 364,000 square feet (34 000 m²) of unobstructed floor space, or an area larger than 8 football fields side-by-side. The Airdock has a volume of 55 million cubic feet (or about 1.5 million cubic meters). At the northeast end of the building a control tower and radio aerial are on top of the airdock. At each end of the building are two huge semi-spherical doors that each weigh 600 tons (544 000 kg). At the top, the doors are <b>fastened</b> <b>by</b> hollow forged <b>pins</b> 17 inches (43 cm) in diameter and six feet (1.83 m) long. The doors roll on forty wheels on specially-designed curved railroad tracks, powered by an individual power plant each, which can open the doors in about 5 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} built of hand-hewn timbers from the hearts of virgin pine forests that {{surrounded}} the property at the time. The heavy framework {{of the house was}} pinned together with wooden pegs. The weatherboards siding were heavy pine panel <b>fastened</b> <b>by</b> smaller wooden <b>pins.</b> No nails as we know them today were available. The full 1 1/2" [...] thick weatherboards, twelve inches wide were hand beveled on all four sides and then crossed beveled at twelve inch intervals to resemble blocks of masonry. The weatherboards were then painted like a white wash. an application of sand was applied to the wet paint, and then after drying a second coat of paint was affixed. This gave the exterior an appearance of unpolished limestone or granite rather than wood. The moldings, doors and trim were made on site by skilled craftsmen and indentured labor. Glass for windows and doors, hardware and other miscellaneous items had to be transported from Mobile. Bricks for the chimney were made from native clay and burned on the homestead.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an early}} {{contemporary}} account of 1586 Raphael Holinshed {{attests to the}} efficiency of the gibbet, and adds some detail about the participation of the onlookers: In the nether end of the sliding block is an axe keyed or fastened with an iron into the wood, which being drawn {{up to the top of}} the frame is there <b>fastened</b> <b>by</b> a wooden <b>pin</b> ... unto the middest of which pin also there is a long rope fastened that cometh down among the people, so that when the offender hath made his confession, and hath laid his neck over the nethermost block, every man there present doth either take hold of the rope (or putteth forth his arm so near to the same as he can get, in token that he is willing to see true justice executed) and pulling out the pin in this manner, the head block wherein the axe is fastened doth fall down with such violence, that if the neck of the transgressor were so big as that of a bull, it should be cut in sunder at a stroke, and roll from the body by an huge distance.|$|R

A motor omnibus (a one-horse hospital cart in less progressive days) stands waiting for passengers; and, {{on our way to the}} Cherry Tree Inn, we remark two nurses, one in charge of a child with a plasticine head. The landlord of the inn is a small grotesque figure of plaster; his sign is <b>fastened</b> on <b>by</b> a <b>pin.</b> No doubt the refreshment supplied here has an enviable reputation, to judge by the alacrity with which a number of riflemen move to-wards the door. The inn, by the by, like the station and some private houses, is roofed with stiff paper.|$|R
60|$|Deerslayer {{had some}} {{theoretical}} knowledge of frontier warfare, {{though he had}} never yet been called on to raise his hand in anger against a fellow-creature. He saw that Hurry did not overrate {{the strength of this}} position in a military point of view, since it would not be easy to attack it without exposing the assailants to the fire of the besieged. A good deal of art had also been manifested in the disposition of the timber of which the building was constructed and which afforded a protection much greater than was usual to the ordinary log-cabins of the frontier. The sides and ends were composed of the trunks of large pines, cut about nine feet long, and placed upright, instead of being laid horizontally, as was the practice of the country. These logs were squared on three sides, and had large tenons on each end. Massive sills were secured on the heads of the piles, with suitable grooves dug out of their upper surfaces, which had been squared for the purpose, and the lower tenons of the upright pieces were placed in these grooves, giving them secure fastening below. Plates had been laid on the upper ends of the upright logs, and were kept in their places by a similar contrivance; the several corners of the structure being well <b>fastened</b> <b>by</b> scarfing and <b>pinning</b> the sills and plates. The doors were made of smaller logs, similarly squared, and the roof was composed of light poles, firmly united, and well covered with bark.|$|R
