40|$|Abstract. The syntheses of tetradeuterated analogs of the estrogenic steroids {{equilenin}} and <b>equilin</b> are described. The ∆ 7 olefin of <b>equilin</b> {{prevented the}} direct introduction {{of more than}} two deuteriums into this molecule, because of its sensitivity under the acidic conditions needed. Therefore conditions were developed for the tetradeuteration of equilenin, which was then converted to tetradeuterated <b>equilin</b> by a Birch reduction sequence. This chemistry provides both molecules deuterated at carbons 4, 6 and 16 (steroid nomenclature). Deuterium incorporation in the β-naphthol system of equilenin was shown to favor introduction at C. 4 and C. 6, without substitution at C. 2. The use of stable isotopic substrates as reference compounds for pharmaceutical products has aided in the development of mass spectrometry analysis to its current status as a powerful tool in determination of trace levels of drug substances and corresponding degradation or metabolic products in test samples. The accuracy of this technique is increased proportional to larger mass difference between the unlabeled and labeled substrate, because normal isotopic abundances in the unlabeled substrate will generate trace signals of higher isotopic peaks in its mass spectrum. For this reason, an internal standard is preferred which provides data lying outside the normal "background " of the substrate to be measured. As part of an ongoing program to develop standards for drug research purposes, we needed to consider the preparation of a tetradeuterated derivative of the estrogen <b>equilin.</b> Although it was quickly clear from probe experiments that the hydrogens at C. 16 could be rapidly exchanged wit...|$|E
40|$|Excess 17 β-estradiol (E 2), {{the most}} potent of human estrogens, is known {{to act as a}} {{stimulus}} for the growth of breast tumors. Human estrogenic 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17 β-HSD 1), which catalyzes the reduction of inactive estrone (E 1) to the active 17 β-estradiol in breast tissues, is a key enzyme responsible for elevated levels of E 2 in breast tumor tissues. We present here the structure of the ternary complex of 17 β-HSD 1 with the cofactor NADP+ and 3 -hydroxyestra- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetraen- 17 -one (<b>equilin),</b> an equine estrogen used in estrogen replacement therapy. The ternary complex has been crystallized with a homodimer, the active form of the enzyme, in the asymmetric unit. Structural and kinetic data presented here show that the 17 β-HSD 1 -catalyzed reduction of E 1 to E 2 in vitro is specifically inhibited by <b>equilin.</b> The crystal structure determined at 3. 0 -Å resolution reveals that the <b>equilin</b> molecule is bound at the active site in a mode similar to the binding of substrate. The orientation of the 17 -keto group with respect to the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ and catalytic residues Tyr- 155 and Ser- 142 is different from that of E 2 in the 17 β-HSD 1 –E 2 complex. The ligand and substrate-entry loop densities are well defined in one subunit. The substrate-entry loop adopts a closed conformation in this subunit. The result demonstrates that binding of <b>equilin</b> at the active site of 17 β-HSD 1 is the basis for inhibition of E 1 -to-E 2 reduction by this equine estrogen in vitro.

40|$|The rabbit {{normally}} excretes scarcely detectable {{quantities of}} estrogenic material (Pincus, Wheeler, Young, and Zahl (1936)), but injected estrin may be recovered {{in the urine}} (Smith and Smith (1931)). Smith and Smith have in fact shown that 600 - 700 r. u. (rat units) of theelin injected into non-pregnant rabbits results in the excretion of about 30 r. u. {{over a period of}} 4 days after injection, whereas the simultaneous injection of 600 - 700 r. u. of theelin plus progestin into an ovariectomized rabbit doe results in the recovery of about 500 r. u. of estrogenic material in the urine. This difference {{may be due to the}} transformation of theelin (estrone) into a more active estrogen in the progestin-treated animal, or to a greater destruction of the estrone in the non-pregnant animal with no change in its chemical constitution. Estrone might conceivably be converted into four native estrogenic compounds in the organism, estradiol, estriol, <b>equilin</b> (and its isomer hippulin), and equilenin (Fieser (1936)). Of these, by ordinary test, estradiol is more active than estrone, estriol and equilenin less active, <b>equilin</b> and hippulin about as active. Since estradiol is the ovarian hormone and estrone a urine component it seems likely that the latter is an excretion product and not normally converted to the former; furthermore, estradiol has been recovered from the urine of mares in small amount only (Wintersteiner, Schwenk, and Whitman (1935)) while estrone is obtained in large amount. The equilinic compounds have been obtained from members of the horse family only, so that it seems unlikely that rabbits would produce them.

The studies so far available indicate that repeated estrogen administrations are necessary to short bleeding time in uremia in a dose range of 95 to 325 mg. With the present study we wanted to establish whether single or repeated doses are required to induce a significant shortening of bleeding time in uremia, and the minimum cumulative dose of conjugated estrogens necessary to control bleeding time for a prolonged period of time, and to check whether the prolonged effect of estrogens on bleeding time in uremia is due to an accumulation of the drug or its metabolites in the blood. Fifteen uremics on chronic hemodialysis were studied. A pilot study carried out in five uremic patients indicated that single or repeated estrogen infusions of 0. 3 mg/kg did not significantly influence bleeding time values. Therefore the subsequent studies {{have been carried out}} using daily infusion of 0. 6 mg/kg. A single estrogen infusion of 0. 6 mg/kg shortened bleeding time in all patients.

40|$|The {{disposition}} of oestradiol, oestrone and oestriol is considered together, {{because there is}} interconversion between oestradiol and oestrone in vivo in both humans and other mammals, and the latter is converted to oestriol (Figure 4).

The absorption of these oestradiol preparations differs, while the route of exposure remains the same. For example, crystalline oestradiol applied dermally in a cream diffuses more readily through the skin to the systemic circulation than esterified oestradiol, because oestradiol is more lipophilic than its ester derivative.

40|$|Abstract Background Results of the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) raised {{concerns}} regarding {{the timing and}} formulation of hormone interventions. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), used as the estrogen therapy in the WHIMS trial, is a complex formulation containing multiple estrogens, including several not secreted by human ovaries, {{as well as other}} biologically active steroids. Although the full spectrum of estrogenic components present in CEE has not yet been resolved, 10 estrogens have been identified. In the present study, we sought to determine which estrogenic components, at concentrations commensurate with their plasma levels achieved following a single oral dose of 0. 625 mg CEE (the dose used in the WHIMS trial) in women, are neuroprotective and whether combinations of those neuroprotective estrogens provide added benefit. Further, we sought, through computer-aided modeling analyses, to investigate the potential correlation of the molecular mechanisms that conferred estrogen neuroprotection with estrogen interactions with the estrogen receptor (ER). Results Cultured basal forebrain neurons were exposed to either β-amyloid 25 – 35 or excitotoxic glutamate with or without pretreatment with estrogens followed by neuroprotection analyses. Three indicators of neuroprotection that rely on different aspects of neuronal damage and viability, LDH release, intracellular ATP level and MTT formazan formation, were used to assess neuroprotective efficacy. Results of these analyses indicate that the estrogens, 17 α-estradiol, 17 β-estradiol, <b>equilin,</b> 17 α-dihydroequilin, equilinen, 17 α-dihydroequilenin, 17 β-dihydroequilenin, and Δ 8, 9 -dehydroestrone were each significantly neuroprotective in reducing neuronal plasma membrane damage induced by glutamate excitotoxicity. Of these estrogens, 17 β-estradiol and Δ 8, 9 -dehydroestrone were effective in protecting neurons against β-amyloid 25 – 35 -induced intracellular ATP decline. Coadministration of two out of three neuroprotective estrogens, 17 β-estradiol, <b>equilin</b> and Δ 8, 9 -dehydroestrone, exerted greater neuroprotective efficacy than individual estrogens. Computer-aided analyses to determine structure/function relationships between the estrogenic structures and their neuroprotective activity revealed that the predicted intermolecular interactions of estrogen analogues with ER correlate to their overall neuroprotective efficacy. Conclusion The present study provides the first documentation of the neuroprotective profile of individual estrogens contained within the complex formulation of CEE at concentrations commensurate with their plasma levels achieved after an oral administration of 0. 625 mg CEE in women. Our analyses demonstrate that select estrogens within the complex formulation of CEE contribute to its neuroprotective efficacy. Moreover, our data predict that the magnitude of neuroprotection induced by individual estrogens at relatively low concentrations may be clinically undetectable and ineffective, whereas, a combination of select neuroprotective estrogens could provide an increased and clinically meaningful efficacy. More importantly, these data suggest a strategy for determining neurological efficacy and rational design and development of a composition of estrogen therapy to alleviate climacteric symptoms, promote neurological health, and prevent age-related neurodegeneration, such as AD, in postmenopausal women. </p...|$|E
40|$|Although hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) is used by post-menopausal women for the relief of menopausal symptoms and the potential reduction of osteoporosis, HRT also increases their risk of Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. Since {{the majority of these}} effects are associated primarily with estrogen binding to only one of the estrogen receptors (ER), new assays are needed that can more efficiently evaluate ER-binding and identify ligands selective for ER-α and ER-β. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was combined with ultrafiltration as a new method to investigate the relative binding of compounds to the ERs and to evaluate the structures of these estrogens. Mixtures of estradiol and six equine estrogens, including <b>equilin,</b> equilenin, 8, 9 -dehydroestrone, and their 17 β-hydroxyl derivatives, were assayed simultaneously to determine their relative binding to human ER-α and ER-β. Estrogens containing a 17 β-OH group were found to have higher relative affinities for the estrogen receptors than their ketone analogs. In addition, 17 β-EN showed selectivity for binding to ER-β over ER-α. The results were compared to the IC 50 values obtained by using a conventional radiolabled estradiol competitive binding assay. Finally, the utility of negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry for the unambiguous identification of these estrogen isomers was investigated. Several characteristic recyclization pathways during tandem mass spectrometry were identified, which might be useful for distinguishing related estrogens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The estrogenic {{efficacy}} of topical vaginal application of Pueraria mirifica extract (PM) on {{the restoration of}} vaginal atrophy, {{and the presence of}} any systemic side effects, were investigated in postmenopausal cynomolgus macaques. Twelve postmenopausal cynomolgus macaques, with complete cessation of menstruation for at least 5 years before start of this experiment, were divided into three groups. They received a topical vaginal application daily of 0. 1 or 1 % (w/w) PM cream or a conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) cream (a mixture of estrone, <b>equilin,</b> 17 β-dihydroequilin, 17 α-estradiol and 17 α-dihydroequilin at 0. 625 mg total estrogen/g cream) for 28 days. Estrogenic efficacy was assessed weekly by vaginal cytology assay and vaginal pH measurement, whilst the plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex skin coloration levels were determined {{at the end of each}} treatment period to evaluate the systemic side effects. PM significantly increased the proportion of superficial cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a similar efficacy between 1 % (w/w) PM and CEE. Together with increased vaginal maturation, PM decreased the vaginal pH to acidic levels, as observed in the CEE group. PM induced no detected systemic side effects, whilst CEE decreased the plasma LH level and increased the reddish color of the sex skin during the posttreatment period. Topical vaginal treatment with PM stimulated the maturation of the vaginal epithelium without causing systemic side effects in postmenopausal monkeys. The implication is that PM could be a safer alternative t...|$|E
40|$|Available {{epidemiologic}} {{data suggest}} {{the possibility that}} the use of oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0. 625 mg/day as a first-choice dose could be associated with a very limited (if any) breast cancer risk increase. Some biological peculiarities of oral CEE back the possi-bility of a limited detrimental effect on breast tissue, due to either direct or indirect actions. Direct actions. Some experimental findings suggest that the 17 a-dihydroderivatives of equilenin and <b>equilin</b> (15 % of the CEE components) have a non-estrogenic or even an anti-estrogenic effect on breast tissue. This could partially counterbalance the stimulatory action of the other CEE components. Indirect actions. Oral estrogens, through their meta-bolic and hepatocellular effects (emphasized by the first liver passage) cause a sharp increase in sex hormone bind-ing globulin (SHBG) level which is followed by a lower quantity of both estrogen and androgen in the free, bioavailable, form. More importantly, they cause a decrease in circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) activity, due to both a reduction in IGF-I synthesis by the liver and an increase in IGF-binding protein- 1 level. A strong relationship between breast cancer risk and the con-centration of circulating IGF-I in premenopausal women has been recently found. Actually, estrogens and IGF-I have a synergistic effect on cell proliferation, and IGF-I is necessary for maximum estrogen-receptor activation in breast cancer cell lines. The possibility does exist that the SHBG level increase and the IGF-I bioavailability decrease, caused by oral CEE, balance the increased estrogen stimulation on breast tissue...|$|E
