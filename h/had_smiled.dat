Ter-Ghevondyan graduated from the university's department of philology [...] of Oriental languages in 1954. Pursuing higher studies, he was accepted to the Oriental Studies Department at Leningrad State University. There, he met the renowned Armenian scholars Hrachia Acharian and Joseph Orbeli. He was especially fond of the guidance and advice Orbeli provided him with, as he repeatedly remarked after he had completed his studies, [...] "Once more, fortune <b>had</b> <b>smiled</b> upon me, [...] my adviser was Academician Hovsep [...] Orbeli." [...] He defended his dissertation, The Emirate of Dvin from the Ninth to Eleventh Centuries, and was awarded his kandidat nauk in 1958.|$|E
2500|$|A Mandarin {{announces the}} law of the land (Aria – Popolo di Pechino! – [...] "People of Peking!"). The Prince of Persia has failed to answer the three riddles, and he is to be {{beheaded}} at the next moonrising. As the crowd surges towards the gates of the palace, the imperial guards brutally repulse them, causing a blind old man to be knocked to the ground. The old man's slave-girl, Liù, cries out for help. A young man hears her cry and recognizes that the old man is his long-lost father, Timur, the deposed king of Tartary. The young Prince of Tartary is overjoyed at seeing Timur alive, but still urges Timur to not speak his name because he is afraid that the Chinese rulers, who have conquered Tartary, may kill or harm them. Timur then tells his son that, of all his servants, only Liù has remained faithful to him. When the Prince asks her why, she tells him that once, long ago in the palace, the Prince <b>had</b> <b>smiled</b> at her (Trio with chorus – The crowd, Liù, Prince of Tartary, Timur: Indietro, cani! – [...] "Back, dogs!").|$|E
