40|$|A dirt {{separator}} and excluder for removing entrained debris from gas turbine shaft seals is described. A helical <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> is constructed on {{the rotating shaft}} with the pumping pattern such that it tends to pump seal pressurizing gas toward the gas turbine seal. A second helical <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> is provided on the stationary housing or counter rotating member coaxial with the shaft, and this pattern {{is designed to provide}} pumping in the direction opposite from that of the <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> on the shaft. Gas with entrained debris entering this grooved area will be subjected to high centrifugal forces due to the swirl motion induced by the <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> and the rotation of the shaft. This debris is centrifuged outwardly into the outer <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> on the housing or counter rotating member. Because the outer <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> has a pumping direction opposite from that of the seal, dirt is pumped away from the seal and can be collected in a suitable debris trap remote from the seal location...|$|R

A fracture model containing three stages such as fracture on Al alloy surface, inside the adhesive and along the vertical surface of the groove, is proposed and proved credible through studying the fracture morphology by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The fracture modes for the three stages in T- Peel test are peel (interfacial + cohesive), peel (cohesive) and shear (interfacial + cohesive) respectively, which reasonably explains the enhancement mechanism of <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> on adhesion strength in T-Peel test...|$|R

While EDM and ECM process has been widely used to engrave the precision pattern which generates dynamic pressure on FDBs, micro forming process is newly proposed in this study to increase the productivity and to reduce the product costs. At first, desktop forming system is designed for spiral <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> forming. FE simulations are followed in order to evaluate the feasibility of micro-forming.

The present study aims {{to study the}} number {{of a number of}} cusps in the first and second mandibular molar and to assess the frequency and expression of different types of occlusal <b>groove</b> <b>pattern.</b> The cross-sectional study is carried out. One hundred patients attending the Outpatient Department of the hospital were recruited for the study based on exclusion and inclusion criteria. Clinical examination was done, and the morphological details of the crown (the number of cusps) were recorded. Dental casts of the mandibular teeth were made. The occlusal grooves were highlighted by using Indian ink and observed under the 2 × magnification for the <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> (+ or y type). Descriptive statistics were carried out for the study. In the case of mandibular first molar, the 5 cusp form was the most frequent occlusal configuration (82 %) followed by 6 cusp variety (12 %) and 4 cusp variety (4 %) bilaterally. The predominant occlusal <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> seen in mandibular first molar was “y” shape (65 %) followed by “+” pattern (28 %). Hence, the most frequent occlusal surface configuration in case of first mandibular molar was “y 5 ” form. In the case of mandibular second molar, the 4 cusp form was the most frequent occlusal configuration (86 %), followed by 5 cusp type (12 %) bilaterally. The predominant occlusal <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> seen in mandibular second molar was a “+” shape (85 %) followed by “y” pattern (11 %).

40|$|Abstract—Grooves are {{embedded}} in the pavement along the shoulders of many interstate highways in the United States to alert straying drivers with a rumbling sound. Using specially encoded grooves, speech can be annunciated instead. A <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> was devised that resembles a recorded phrase of human speech. The original recording was filtered to remove high frequency noise and then dynamically compressed into an equal amplitude square wave with variable pulse width. Before committing significant funding to build and test the encoded strip, the phenomenon was empirically modeled using system identification on {{the sound of an}} automobile being driven over existing rumble strips. The input was a simple periodic square wave pattern. Then, several phrases from different speakers were encoded into strip signals and used as inputs for the model. A subjective evaluation was performed to determine the most intelligible case. The selected strip was constructed by milling the <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> into sheets of aluminum.

40|$|International audienceLogging while {{drilling}} (LWD) acoustic measurement provides timely {{analysis for}} borehole stability and drilling optimization in the oilfield. An LWD acoustic tool {{is composed of}} a drill collar (thick steel pipe) equipped with an acoustic source and receivers to probe rocks surrounding the borehole. The drill collar area is favorable for tool wave propagation from the transmitter to the receiver section of the tool. Minimizing such arrival is critical to avoid unwanted interference with formation signal. In order to decrease such interferences, multiple grooves of different sizes are machined inside the drill collar. Non-homogeneity of the structure constructs a solid filter similar to a solid rod loaded with heavy masses. The stop-band and attenuation of the tool propagation largely depend on the distribution {{and size of the}} grooves machined into the collar. Their characteristics as an acoustic filter are also subject to properties of borehole fluid, where the drill collar is immersed. Therefore, the <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> has to be designed by modeling with consideration to many factors within given constraints. A method to optimize the <b>groove</b> <b>pattern</b> for given acoustic characteristics is discussed in this paper. The application to real data will illustrate the effectiveness of this methodology...|$|R

Analysis of gratings <b>groove</b> <b>patterns</b> can be useful in determining cause of poor imaging of the diffracted light, but requires investigation of small changes of the groove frequency over the entire clear aperture of the grating. A diffraction grating that is small enough to be measured by a general purpose six inch aperture interferometer is measured by both this interferometer and the LTP, so that results for two different instruments may be compared. The height profile of the substrate light (m = 0) measurement is subtracted from the height profile of the diffracted light (m = 1) measurement, and the result is the effect of only the diffraction f rom the grooves along the entire surface. This procedure is also used for a diffraction grating that is too long to be measured by the general purpose interferometer, but is easily measured by the LTP...|$|R

Above a steady forward vehicle speed of 40 km/h this is the dominant noise source of a modern car in good working condition, and is a significant contributor to the overall radiated noise during acceleration. In order to determine the noise produced by a <b>patterned</b> <b>tyre</b> rolling on a rough road surface, the vibration characteristics of the tyre must be known. A method has been presented by O'Boy and Dowling [Tyre/road interaction noise: a 3 d viscoelastic multilayer model of a tyre belt, Journal of Sound and Vibration, volume 322, issues 4 - 5, 22 May 2009, pages 829 - 850] which provides these vibration characteristics for a tyre belt composed of multiple viscoclastic layers, each layer having a different thickness and material properties. In this paper, we use this model of the tyre belt to determine the parameters of an equivalent simple bending plate model which can be adapted to yield the response of a tyre which includes sidewalls.
