5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the <b>Idea</b> <b>or</b> Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, <b>idea,</b> <b>or</b> situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} <b>idea</b> <b>or</b> set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E

5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an <b>idea</b> <b>or</b> a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E

25|$|The {{attribute}} of thought is how substance {{can be understood}} to be composed of thoughts, i.e., thinking things. When we understand a particular thing in the universe through the {{attribute of}} thought, we are understanding the mode as an idea of something (either another <b>idea,</b> <b>or</b> an object).|$|E
25|$|Stallard had {{the most}} {{abrasive}} nature that I have ever met. He could never believe {{that he could have}} a bad <b>idea</b> <b>or</b> make a bad decision. And sometimes he'd go berserk with those who disagreed with him. He didn't have, let us say, the delicacies of negotiation.|$|E
25|$|Chief Judge Rader and Circuit Judges Linn, Moore, and O'Malley {{filed an}} opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.

They would have held Alice's system claims patent eligible because they were limited to a computer-implemented application.|$|E

25|$|An {{examination}} {{of the rest of}} experience, especially such phenomena as instinct, voluntary motion, sexual love, artistic production and the like, makes it evident that Will and Idea, unconscious but teleological, are everywhere operative, and that the underlying force is one and not many. This thing-in-itself may be called the Unconscious. It has two equally original attributes, namely, Will and <b>Idea</b> (<b>or</b> Reason).|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{started his}} {{experiments}} in 1857 and published his findings in 1858 (April issue of Comptes Rendus Chimie, Béchamp's paper appeared in January issue). Béchamp noted that Pasteur {{did not bring}} any novel <b>idea</b> <b>or</b> experiments. On the other hand, Béchamp was probably aware of Pasteur's 1857 preliminary works. With both scientists claiming priority on the discovery, a dispute, extending to several areas, lasted throughout their lives.|$|E
25|$|Art for propaganda, or commercialism. Art {{is often}} {{utilized}} {{as a form}} of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular <b>idea</b> <b>or</b> object.|$|E

25|$|This means, essentially, that {{substance}} is just whatever {{can be thought}} of without relating it to any other <b>idea</b> <b>or</b> thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of {{it as a kind of}} thing, e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing (because it isn't a particular thing at all).|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{unhappiness}} of aimless desire, the Will realizes the ideas already potentially {{present and the}} Unconscious becomes actual. The existence {{of the universe is}} the result, then, of the illogical Will, but its characteristics and laws are all due to the <b>Idea</b> <b>or</b> Reason and are, therefore, logical. It is {{the best of all possible}} worlds, which contains the promise of the redemption of the Unconscious from actual existence by the exercise of Reason in partnership with the Will in the consciousness of the enlightened pessimist.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} pre-modern societies, {{traditional}} Malay culture {{did not contain}} the <b>idea</b> <b>or</b> {{the figure of the}} modern gay individual. However, Malay society did acknowledge the reality and existence of alternatives to heterosexual practices. ‘Third gender’ or transgender individuals, who are called mak nyah, were socially recognised, tolerated and even incorporated into community life. They occupied a stable, albeit arguably marginalised position within society. The mak nyah are similar in many ways to the hijra in India or the fa'afafine or Mahu in Polynesia. Unfortunately, there is limited scholarly knowledge about homosexuality in traditional Malay culture.|$|E
