5|$|Though Obama {{indicated}} in January 2010 that a consensus {{had not been}} made about whether she would campaign, speculation of her involvement came from <b>her</b> <b>large</b> approval rating as well as reports {{that she had been}} invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, she {{was created}} a Dame, and in 1936 {{became the first}} woman elected to full {{membership}} of the Royal Academy since its foundation in 1768. <b>Her</b> <b>large</b> retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1965 was the first for a woman. Knight was known for painting amidst the world of the theatre and ballet in London, and for being a war artist during the Second World War. She was also greatly interested in, and inspired by, marginalised communities and individuals, including Gypsies and circus performers.|$|E
5|$|Not all ants {{have the}} same kind of societies. The Australian bulldog ants are among the biggest and most basal of ants. Like {{virtually}} all ants, they are eusocial, but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species.

5|$|Ryloth is a zerg broodmother, {{and leader}} of the Ryloth Brood. During the Second Great War she kept <b>her</b> <b>large</b> brood out of harm's way until Sarah Kerrigan {{returned}} from Zerus. When she asked to rejoin the Swarm, Kerrigan ordered her to destroy Jontur II, a Dominion shipbuilding world. Her brood on Marek V was almost exterminated by Prometheus Company, but was saved by Kerrigan's brood.|$|E
5|$|Sakura {{has become}} the series' female lead, although, she was not {{immediately}} intended for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty drawing her character resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including <b>her</b> <b>large</b> forehead. In {{order to make the}} character more appealing {{in the second part of}} the series, Kishimoto designed her costume to make her look more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest and recovery, Zita found herself {{regularly}} going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided {{to move back to}} the continent full-time, in 1952, to Luxembourg, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia {{died at the age of}} 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from <b>her</b> <b>large</b> family and a nearby chapel (a necessity for the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war Rodd {{returned}} home, but {{the marriage}} was essentially over; although remaining on friendly terms, the couple led separate lives. Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with <b>her</b> <b>large</b> cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further on paper than she could have done through normal social intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Delacroix, who was of French origin, met {{the king}} in Paris {{as a young}} girl, {{when she was only}} 16 and he was 65. At that time, she earned her living as a prostitute. They soon {{embarked}} upon a relationship that was to last until his death in 1909. Leopold lavished upon <b>her</b> <b>large</b> sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. Because of these presents, Caroline was deeply unpopular both among the Belgian people and internationally, as Leopold became increasingly criticized for his greed-induced actions in the Congo Free State, his own personal colony. As Caroline largely profited off the income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo (“the Queen of Congo”).|$|E
5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for <b>her</b> <b>large</b> {{painting}} of children in bright sunlight. The Beach was shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein. Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E

5|$|The Countess {{was left}} rich under Leicester's will; yet the {{discharge}} of his overwhelming debts diminished her wealth. In 1604–1605 she successfully defended her widow's rights in court when her possessions and her good name were threatened by the Earl's illegitimate son, Robert Dudley, who claimed that he was his father's legitimate heir, thus implicitly declaring her marriage bigamous. Lettice Knollys was always close to <b>her</b> <b>large</b> family circle. Helpless at the political eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both him and her third husband to the executioner in 1601. From the 1590s she lived chiefly in the Staffordshire countryside, where, in reasonably good health until the end, she died at age 91 on Christmas Day 1634.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood and youth, {{reminding}} him {{of a time when}} he was more innocent. The boyhood scenes portray Scrooge's lonely childhood, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig, who treated Scrooge like a son. They also portray Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle, who ends their relationship after she realises that Scrooge will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with <b>her</b> <b>large,</b> happy family on a recent Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Isabella used Castle Rising {{as one of}} {{her main}} residences until her death in 1358. Isabella was a wealthy woman, as the King granted her a yearly income of £3,000, which by 1337 had {{increased}} to £4,000. She enjoyed a regal lifestyle in Norfolk, maintaining minstrels, huntsmen and grooms, and received visits from Edward and the royal household on at least four occasions. Despite <b>her</b> <b>large</b> income, Isabella ran up long-standing debts with the local merchants near the castle. Around the time that she took over the castle, a new set of buildings were constructed in the central bailey, including a west range containing a residential suite, a new private chapel, and a south range linking to various service buildings; the existing kitchen was reused. The great hall was reroofed, although Isabella lived in the west range, using the keep only for formal occasions or as accommodation for very senior guests. A brick wall around the outside of the inner bailey may have been built around this time to provide additional security.|$|E

5|$|In San Blas, {{strong winds}} from the {{hurricane}} {{damaged or destroyed}} 95% of the homes, with 1,540houses damaged and 8,800people affected. There, large commercial shrimp boats were swept up to 900feet (275m) inland from their docks. An elderly woman died in the city when the wall of her house collapsed on <b>her.</b> <b>Large</b> portions of the city were covered with building debris and sand washed from the ocean. Elsewhere in Nayarit, flying debris killed a person in Santiago Escuintla. There, two elderly men drowned, one by falling into a river. Both were {{believed to have been}} killed during the storm as they fled their homes. In Santiago Ixcuintla, the hurricane damaged 3,770homes, and throughout Nayarit, strong winds from the hurricane destroyed the roofs of hundreds of houses. Federal authorities lost communications with at least 30Indian villages due to the high winds of the hurricane. Kenna destroyed the entire banana, tobacco, and tomato crops in the rural areas of San Blas, Tecuala, and Acaponeta, leaving more than 700subsistence farmers and their families in need of water and food.|$|E
