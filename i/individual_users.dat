However, considering the well acknowledged recurring queries and repetitive clicks among users, it is still an open issue whether using <b>individual</b> <b>user</b> information is a proper direction of efforts in improving the web search. In this paper, we first quantitatively demonstrate that <b>individual</b> <b>user</b> information is more beneficial than common user information. Then we statistically compare the benefit of <b>individual</b> and common <b>user</b> information through Kappa statistic. Finally, we calculate potential for personalization to present an overview of what queries can benefit more from <b>individual</b> <b>user</b> information. All these analyses are conducted on both English AOL log and Chinese Sogou log, and a bilingual perspective statistics consistently confirms our findings. ...|$|R

25|$|One notable {{difference}} between a BBS or web forum and Usenet {{is the absence of}} a central server and dedicated administrator. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing conglomeration of servers that store and forward messages to one another in so-called news feeds. <b>Individual</b> <b>users</b> may read messages from and post messages to a local server operated by a commercial usenet provider, their Internet service provider, university, employer, or their own server.|$|E

The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and <b>individual</b> <b>users.</b> Zuckerberg and Facebook {{failed to respond to}} the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook, taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{using data from}} the social bookmarking website Delicious, has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics. Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of <b>individual</b> <b>users,</b> the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, examining the correlations between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtained a form of community or shared vocabularies. Such vocabularies {{can be seen as a}} form of collective intelligence, emerging from the decentralised actions of a community of users. The Wall-it Project is also an example of social bookmarking.|$|E

25|$|In {{part because}} of such long {{retention}} times, as well as growing Internet upload speeds, Usenet is also used by <b>individual</b> <b>users</b> to store backup data in a practice called Usenet backup, or uBackup. While commercial providers offer more easy to use online backup services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader {{does not have any}} control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, so there will be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Dell did not {{emphasize}} the consumer market, {{due to the}} higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch. While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for <b>individual</b> <b>users.</b>|$|E
25|$|BlackBerry {{smartphones}} can {{be integrated}} into an organization's email system through a software package called BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) through version 5, and BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES) as of version 10. (There were no versions 6 through 9.). Versions of BES are available for Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino, Novell GroupWise and Google Apps. While <b>individual</b> <b>users</b> {{may be able to}} use a wireless provider's email services without having to install BES themselves, organizations with multiple users usually run BES on their own network. BlackBerry devices running BlackBerry OS 10 or later can also be managed directly by a Microsoft Exchange Server, using Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) polices, {{in the same way that}} an iOS or Android device can. (EAS supports fewer management controls than BES does.) Some third-party companies provide hosted BES solutions. Every BlackBerry has a unique ID called a BlackBerry PIN, which is used to identify the device to the BES. BlackBerry at one time provided a free BES software called BES Express (BESX).|$|E

25|$|Bell Canada usage-based billing: On October 28, 2010, the CRTC {{handed down}} its final {{decision}} on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners. Under the plan which starts within 90 days, Bell {{will be able to}} charge wholesale service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network, and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has. Beyond that set limit, <b>individual</b> <b>users</b> will be charged per gigabyte, depending on the speed of their connections. Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second, for example, will have a monthly allotment of 60 GB, beyond which Bell will charge $1.12 per GB to a maximum of $22.50. If a customer uses more than 300 GB a month, Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of 75 cents per gigabyte. In May 2010, the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage-based billing system until all of its own retail customers had been moved off older, unlimited downloading plans. The requirement would have meant that Bell would have to move its oldest and most loyal customers. The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers. Bell appealed both requirements, citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive rate regulation by the CRTC, which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven. In Thursday's decision, the CRTC rescinded both requirements, thereby giving Bell the go-ahead to implement usage-based billing. This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market. This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed. According to a tweet by Industry Minister Tony Clement, unless the CRTC reverses this decision, the government will use its override power to reverse the decision.|$|E
