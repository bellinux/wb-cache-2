40|$|Analysis of {{the shape}} and {{location}} of abrasive <b>grain</b> <b>tips</b> {{as well as their}} changes during the grinding process, is the basis for forecasting the machining process results. This paper presents a methodology of using the watershed segmentation in identifying abrasive grains on the abrasive tool active surface. Some abrasive <b>grain</b> <b>tips</b> were selected to minimize the errors of detecting many tips on a single abrasive grain. The abrasive grains, singled out {{as a result of the}} watershed segmentation, were then analyzed to determine their geometric parameters. Moreover, the statistical parameters describing their locations on the abrasive tool active surface and the parameters characterizing intergranular spaces were determined...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a new {{technique}} of in-process evaluation of a grinding wheel surface is proposed. Some specific wheel surfaces are prepared as references by the appropriate truing and/or dressing procedure, and grinding sounds generated by these wheels are discriminated by analyzing the dynamic frequency spectrum by a neural network technique. In {{the case of a}} conventional vitrified-bonded alumina wheel, the grinding sound can be identified in the optimum network configuration. Therefore, this system can instantaneously recognize differences in the wheel surface with a good degree of accuracy insofar as the wheel conditions are relatively widely changed. In addition, the network can perceive wheel wear because the <b>grain</b> <b>tips</b> are flattened as grinding proceeds and the grinding sound becomes similar to that of a wheel generated with lower dressing feed. The resinoid-bonded cubic boron nitride (CBN) wheel is also discriminable when a grinding sound in a higher frequency range is analyzed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{post-process}} measurement of the grinding wheel topography {{by means of a}} newly improved image processing system. In this system, grinding wheel is driven by the high-power electric servomotor with a built-in rotary encoder so that both grinding operation and consecutive measurement of the individual abrasive grains by the accurate wheel positioning are possible. The contraction/expansion process is useful for the separation of adjacent grains. The dark field microscopy is effective in order to extract monochromatic CBN grains from the lustrous metal bond. This system is applicable to the practical grinding operation with resinoid and metal bonded superabrasive wheels with a good degree of accuracy and efficiency. In grinding normally sintered silicon nitride with the resinoid-bonded diamond wheel at a given grinding condi-tion, this system reveals that cutting-edge ratio decreases rapidly due to the micro-fracture of <b>grain</b> <b>tips</b> at the transient stage just after truing/dressing, and it increases slightly with the promotion of attritious wear under the successive steady state. This phenomena are {{explained by the fact that}} abrasive grains are damaged during truing/dressing operation...|$|R
50|$|Mechanically-powered shaft-hoisting {{equipment}} replaced whips and whims in {{the larger}} mines. The rope from a steam winding-engine (generally housed in a simple building nearby) passed over a pulley {{on top of the}} headframe and carried a hook on the end to which a cage, bucket, or other item could be attached for raising or lowering in the shaft. The brace provided a platform for handling both mullock and ore, the mullock being trammed to the mullock heap and the ore being <b>tipped</b> into <b>bins</b> for gravity-loading into either tramway trucks or horse- drawn drays.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of chopper harvesters solved the loading problem. These harvesters chop the cane stalks into short lengths or billets. The billets are {{ejected from the}} harvester directly into bins towed by motor vehicle alongside the harvester. The bins are towed to the rail siding where they are transferred onto tram or rail wagons. Alternatively, the billets are <b>tipped</b> into <b>bins</b> on the wagons. By the mid-1960s, chopper harvesters had almost completely superseded whole stalk harvesters. The extant cane lifts probably all predate this time and some could date to the late 19th century.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{productivity}} of technological operation, accuracy, and surface finish {{depend on the}} patterns of tool wear {{and the state of}} its working surface. It was established that the prediction of the wear of tool is only possible based on modeling the regularities of work of single abrasive grains. The wear of abrasive <b>grains</b> <b>tips</b> as well as a tool, occurs in the contact zone arising when approaching the tool and the workpiece and is determined by the relative wear and length of the path of cutting. The length of the cutting path is not equal to the length of the path of movement of grain in a contact zone. The length of the cutting is calculated taking into account the probability of contact of the top of the abrasive grains with the material being processed at any point of contact area, which determines the probability that the material at the point is not removed. The analysis of the sequence of contacts of the tool surface with a workpiece surface allowed obtaining a differential equation that links the wear tool with the wear of single abrasive grains. The proposed probabilistic approach provides an opportunity to estimate {{the current state of the}} working surface of the tool, as well as analyze the impact of certain parameters on the processing on the rate of wear...|$|R

5|$|Australian ravens are {{intelligent}} birds, {{and like}} many other corvids have innovative methods of seeking out food. Foraging {{takes place in the}} early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead, or by walking along and looking. However, they occasionally feed in trees—Australian ravens forage eucalypt foliage for Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus), and devote a substantial amount of time to look for nests and eggs to eat. They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs. Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over, or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to store it. They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue. Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas, such as school playgrounds, rubbish <b>tips,</b> <b>bins</b> outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards. In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers. Australian ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.|$|R

40|$|FIM and PFDMS {{are used}} for {{studying}} particles that mimic catalytic <b>grains.</b> Exposing <b>tips</b> to reactive gas mixtures allows following in-situ catalytic reactions on the nanometer scale. These techniques appear as unique tools to approach simultaneously the behavior of each plane of small crystallites in terms of surface reconstruction, adsorption and catalytic activity. They are complementary to environmental transmission and scanning electron microscopies. Most of the catalysts used in industry or in automotive pollution control are conditioned as a dispersion of small catalytic particles on a support of high specific area. Assuming a similar bulk composition, the extremity of a sharp metallic tip can mimic one of these catalytic particles. Field ion microscopy (FIM) is used to characterise these surfaces at the atomic scale at cryogenic temperatures and subsequently to image catalytic surface reactions at temperatures where they usually occur. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Electroplated cubic {{boron nitride}} (CBN) wheels are {{manufactured}} {{with a single}} layer of CBN superabrasive grains held on the wheel hub by an electroplated nickel bond. Unlike other conventional and superabrasive wheels, these wheels are not periodically trued or dressed. Consequently, their performance during grinding varies significantly as the wheel wears down and its topography changes. ^ An investigation was undertaken of the grinding process with electroplated CBN wheels. The topography of unused wheels of various different grain sizes was characterized in terms of areal grain density and protrusion height distribution of the <b>grain</b> <b>tips.</b> Internal cylindrical and straight surface grinding tests were then conducted to investigate the wheel wear {{and its effect on}} the wheel topography and grinding performance. Grinding tests were performed mostly on hardened AISI 52100 steel over a wide range of operating conditions. Measurements were made of the forces, grinding power, surface roughness, radial wheel wear, and wheel topography. ^ The overall radial wheel wear in each case was found to consist of an initial transient followed by a steady state regime. With continued grinding, a progressive increase in power and a decrease in surface roughness were observed. Wheel failure tended to occur by stripping of the abrasive layer when the radial wear reached about 70 – 80 % of the grain dimension. ^ Wheel wear was found to occur by attrition, grain fracture, and grain pullout. Attritious wear increases the active grain density and causes wheel dulling which lead to a smoother workpiece and higher forces. The effects of attritious wear are offset {{to a greater or lesser}} degree by grain fracture and grain pullout. Grain fracture which dominates in the steady state is shown to be related to the uncut chip thickness taken by an individual cutting point. The initial transient wear at the start of grinding is mainly due to pullout of loosely held grains, although grain fracture also contributes to the transient. ^ The results of this work provide the technological basis for predicting grinding behavior, design of grinding cycles, and optimal utilization of the process with electroplated CBN wheels. ...|$|R
