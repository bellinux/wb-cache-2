5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side, and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E
5|$|Kenny Baker as R2-D2, an astromech droid {{that saves}} Queen Amidala's ship when other droids fail. Before the film's {{production}} started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would remain. Baker {{is used for}} scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side. Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} at its roosting site, {{an angry}} barn owl lowers {{its head and}} sways it <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. A defensive attitude involves lying {{flat on the ground}} or crouching with wings spread out.|$|E

5|$|When tufted males clap, females look {{towards them}} and display {{a greater number}} of tap {{displays}} to them than to the gray morph. Females also respond to tufted morphs' clapping more often by settling than for gray males. However, after the females look towards the males, gray males approach the female more often than the tufted male. Females often tip their abdomens <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above {{the top of the}} flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E
5|$|Despite Arsenal being {{reduced to}} 10 men, the scores {{remained}} {{level as the}} game went into its final minute, when Diego Forl√°n went to ground in the penalty area under a challenge from Arsenal defender Martin Keown while trying to reach a Gary Neville cross. The referee deemed this a foul and awarded a penalty. Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take the penalty, despite having missed his previous two penalties for Manchester United. Lehmann tried to put him off by moving <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side along the goal line, and it appeared to work: the shot hit the bar and rebounded back into play, and the Dutchman was immediately confronted by Keown. Within a minute, the final whistle blew and the match finished as a goalless draw.|$|E

5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{that live}} in or visit water have adaptations that improve their {{swimming}} abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases {{the area of the}} foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet. Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E

5|$|In frogs the {{pelvic girdle}} is robust and the hind legs are much longer and {{stronger}} than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or {{in contact with the}} ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E
5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side.|$|E

5|$|Limited by {{poor quality}} {{locomotives}} and ungraded, cheaply laid track which followed {{the contours of}} the hills, and stopping at four intermediate stations between Wood Siding and Quainton Road to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly. In 1887 trains took between 15 and 20 minutes to travel approximately one mile <b>from</b> Wood <b>Siding</b> <b>to</b> Brill, and a little over 1hour20minutes <b>from</b> Wood <b>Siding</b> <b>to</b> the junction station with the main line at Quainton Road. Improvements to the line carried out {{at the time of the}} transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time <b>from</b> Wood <b>Siding</b> <b>to</b> Quainton Road to about 30 minutes.|$|R

5|$|The {{first half}} of the game is set on a whaler {{in the middle of a}} storm, and the {{conditions}} on the deck affect the degree of control the player has over Hansen. As the ship sways continuously <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side, aiming is made more difficult, although Hansen can grab onto a ledge to steady himself, if one is available. In some instances, the ship can sway to such a degree that Hansen will slide towards the edge and potentially fall overboard. There are also numerous environmental hazards on the deck which react to the motion of the ship, such as swinging electrical wires and crates hooked up to ropes. If any of these items hit Hansen, he will lose health. Waves crashing on to the ship's deck can also cause Hansen damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey to}} the waterhole is {{undertaken}} at around dawn when the air is cool. Later in the day, when the air temperature may reach over 50¬∞C, the birds are inactive and {{have the ability to}} increase their thermal insulation when the air temperature exceeds their body temperatures. At very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and gaping to cool themselves. At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far away from any vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and the birds are safe.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included bilge keels, but with keels they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung <b>from</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E
