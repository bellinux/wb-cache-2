Since secondary memory technologies are much slower than main memory, {{it is challenging to}} match memory speed to the processor. Usually, hard disk drives include semiconductor caches to improve their performance. A hit in the disk cache eliminates the mechanical seek time and rotational latency. To further improve performance a <b>divided</b> <b>disk</b> cache, subdivided between metadata and data, has been proposed previously.

40|$|The {{retrieval}} process of a continuous media is {{considered as a}} periodic request which each subrequest retrieves a block of data. The next data block has to be ready before the display of the current data block is completed.

This implies that to reduce access time, it can either decrease the required buffer size and/or increase the number of {{retrieval process}}es. This paper addresses the issue of reducing access time from data placement perspective.

5000|$|File {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} <b>divided</b> the <b>disk</b> into equally sized blocks to simplify their design {{and limit the}} worst-case fragmentation.

But as file sizes are often not multiples of the file system block size, this design inherently results in the last blocks of files (called tails) occupying only a part of the block, resulting in what is called internal fragmentation (not to be confused with external fragmentation). This waste of space can be significant if the file system stores many small files and can become critical when attempting to use higher block sizes to improve performance.

As part of the proof apparatus, we obtain new results on the number of large splitting events of self-similar fragmentations. The second part concerns growth-fragmentation processes, which describe particle systems in which each particle grows and splits randomly and independently of the others. We prove that the law of a self-similar growth-fragmentation is determined by a cumulant function and its index of self-similarity.

40|$|Abridged) We here {{study the}} {{structure}} of a hyperaccretion disk around a neutron star. We consider a steady-state hyperaccretion disk around a neutron star, and as a reasonable approximation, <b>divide</b> the <b>disk</b> into two regions, which are called inner and outer disks. The outer disk {{is similar to that of}} a black hole and the inner disk has a self-similar structure. In order to study physical properties of the entire disk clearly, we first adopt a simple model, in which some microphysical processes in the disk are simplified, following Popham et al. and Narayan et al. Based on these simplifications, we analytically and numerically investigate the size of the inner disk, the efficiency of neutrino cooling, and the radial distributions of the disk density, temperature and pressure. We see that, compared with the black-hole disk, the neutron star disk can cool more efficiently and produce a much higher neutrino luminosity. Finally, we consider an elaborate model with more physical considerations about the thermodynamics and microphysics in the neutron star disk (as recently developed in studying the neutrino-cooled disk of a black hole), and compare this elaborate model with our simple model. We find that most of the results from these two models are basically consistent with each other.
