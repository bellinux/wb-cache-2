Based on previous results for tetraploidy induction in salmon embryos using hydrostatic pressure shock, the survival rate was reported to be lower than the survival rate by the induction of diploids or triploids (Yamazaki and Goodier 1993). In addition, the longer the shock (when the treatment initiation time after fertilization was the same), the lower the <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> rates of each experimental group. Furthermore, increased hydrostatic pressure led to lower <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> rates (Tables  1, 2). Similar to the results of this study, it was reported that increasing the pressure intensity or duration would increase the tetraploid rate; however, this would decrease the survival and {{hatching rate}}s (Jun et al. 2007). Yamazaki and Goodier (1993) showed that embryogenesis involved both morphological abnormalities and mortality in salmon embryos treated with tetraploids.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} the chitin {{synthesis}} inhibitor lufenuron on the various developmental stages of red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum was determined by exposing them to different sub-lethal concentrations (LC 10, LC 20 and LC 40) of lufenuron through diet for 24 hrs. There was a dose dependent effect on the larval weight, time taken for pupation, and adult emergence, percentage pupation and percentage adult emergence. When two day old larvae were fed on sublethal concentrations through diet {{a small proportion of}} pupal –adult intermediates were observed at LC 20 and LC 40. Adults emerging from the larvae fed on diet containing LC 10, LC 20 and LC 40 of lufenuron did not show any variation in the fecundity and hatchability of eggs from that of control. The fecundity of adults fed with sub-lethal concentration of lufenuron (obtained against two day old larvae through diet) was not affected, however, percentage <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> was affected. Interestingly there was a reversal of the effect within ten days of treatment with respect to percentage <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival.</b> When eggs were exposed to treated diet hatching was not affected.

40|$|Abstract. — Recruitment {{success of}} larval fishes can {{determine}} subsequent effects of older life stages on ecosystem structure and function. Because size and abundance of juvenile gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum determines, in large part, {{their effects on}} zooplankton abundance and sport-fish recruitment, we investigated recruitment of larval gizzard shad to the juvenile stage. We hypothesized that larval survival would correlate positively with availability of small (< 0. 40 mm) zooplankton and reservoir productivity and would dictate abundance of individuals reaching the juvenile stage. In downstream and upstream areas of four Ohio reservoirs ranging from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic, we evaluated larval gizzard shad success by comparing <b>hatch,</b> growth, <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> of weekly cohorts of larvae with availability of small zooplankton, and then we determined whether larval success could predict juvenile gizzard shad size and abundance. Total larval hatch abundance increased with reservoir productivity and was higher upstream than downstream. Weekly cohorts that produced abundant survivors reflected not only high hatch but also high survival in upstream areas during periods of abundant small zooplankton. Overall, larval <b>hatch</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> predicted juvenile abundance but not juvenile size. Juvenile abundance increased with reservoir productivity, particularly in upstream areas, whereas juvenile size reflected the combined influence of juvenile abundance and reservoir productivity. Across mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions, juvenile gizzard shad size decreased with increasing abundance; but across eutrophic to hypereutrophic conditions, juvenile gizzard shad siz...|$|R

The lethal and sublethal effects of spirotetramat were compared to those of chlorpyriphos and pyriproxyfen, two insecticides commonly used in Spanish citrus. Spirotetramat resulted harmless: (1) when directly applied on larvae and adults of C. montrouzieri, since it did not affect survival, longevity, fecundity, egg <b>hatching,</b> <b>and</b> offspring <b>survival.</b> In contrast, chlorpyriphos was classified as moderately toxic for adults due to its effects on fecundity, egg <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> offspring <b>survival.</b> Pyriproxyfen was classified as harmful for larvae due to the acute effect on pupal mortality. When larvae and adults of C. montrouzieri were fed with treated prey, spirotetramat was also classified as harmless.

It has recently been suggested that ROS play a role in lifespan and resource allocation. However, only a few authors have attempted to explore the relationships between temperature, resource allocation and oxidative balance in ectotherms. Here, we measured the effect of temperature on growth, reproductive effort, offspring quantity and quality, <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> rates, and the associated proximal costs, which were evaluated through the quantification of oxidative balance elements. We reared adult fish (Oryzias latipes) at two non-stressful temperatures (20 and 30 degrees C) during a relatively long period (4 months, approximately the entire adult life). The results show a trade-off between reproduction and maintenance because investment toward growth could be neglected at the adult stage (confirmed by our results). Intriguingly, ROS-dependent damages did not differ between the two groups, probably because of the higher rate of activation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase for warm-acclimated fish. The allocation toward antioxidant defences is associated with an earlier reproduction and a lower quality of offspring.

Using global climate indices that are known to impact the Southern Ocean ecosystem (the El Niño Southern Oscillation and Antarctic Oscillation Indices) we assessed their efficacy to predict variation in the demographic parameters of Antarctic seabirds. First, we used a long-term dataset on adult survival (estimated from capture–mark–recapture data) and reproduction of Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, from the largest known breeding colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land) and examined whether large-scale oceanographic fluctuations impact survival and reproduction. Second, we conducted an exhaustive literature review to determine whether the effects of large-scale environmental variability on Antarctic seabirds have a coherent fingerprint across the Antarctic continent and nearby islands. We found that most of the variation in both reproductive success, timing of <b>hatching,</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> of Antarctic petrels can be accurately modeled using the two modes of large-scale climate variability in Antarctica. The literature review, combined with the results from our field study, suggests that while the anticipated trends in the global patterns of climatic variability will generally have detrimental effects on populations of top predators in the Southwest Atlantic, these conclusions cannot be extrapolated to all seabird populations in Antarctica without additional data...|$|E
40|$|I studied {{effects of}} UV-B {{radiation}} on egg and larval golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) in Castle Lake, California, USA. To compare egg <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> <b>survival</b> of larval golden shiner, I exposed eggs and larval fish to three different UV-B treatments, low UV-B (4 % UV-B), high UV-B (92 % UV-B), and ambient (100 % UV-B). The egg experiment {{was conducted in}} lake and pond water, whereas proto- and mesolarval stage experiments were conducted in lake water only. High and ambient UV-B radiation affected the hatching rate of golden shiner eggs. The mean hatching rate was 13 % lower in high UV-B, and 9 % lower in ambient UV-B compared to the low UV-B treatments. The hatching rate, however, was not significantly different between lake and pond treatments. The survival of egg to hatched larval stage was reduced under high and ambient UV- 8 radiation compared to low UV- 8 treatment in the lake water experiment. In the pond water experiment, however, the survival of newly hatched larvae was not different among UV- 8 treatments. During the experimental periods, no survival difference among treatments was observed for larval stages of golden shiners. Mean amount of UV- 8 radiation penetrating an oligo-mesotrophic lake differed from that in an adjoining pond {{during the summer of}} 1997. UV- 8 radiation in pond water was highly absorbed compared to absorbency in lake water. High concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in pond water were likely responsible for the difference in absorbency of UV- 8 radiation...|$|E
40|$|Gull colonies world-wide {{have been}} {{harvested}} for their eggs for centuries with minimal {{knowledge of the}} impacts on breeding. Although most Laridae can replace lost eggs, they have comparatively high energetic demands for egg production. In this paper we assess the impacts of a licensed egg harvest on the breeding success of black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus, which nest colonially in an EU Special Protection Area in Hampshire, Southern England. We compared egg volume, <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> chick <b>survival</b> from harvested <b>and</b> un-harvested nests in central and fringe positions within colonies of various sizes, including colonies with no harvesting activity. Eggs from various laying stages were collected from harvested and un-harvested colonies of similar pre-harvest intrinsic quality, for comparison of their volumes, yolk-to-albumen ratios and eggshell thickness. Egg volume and the yolk-to-albumen ratio depended on laying time and location, with the largest eggs laid during the peak period by birds breeding in central positions on large colonies. Eggs produced by these peak layers also had the largest yolk-to-albumen ratios. Harvested sites were characterised by reductions in egg volume, yolk-to-albumen ratio and eggshell thickness, which translated to poorer <b>hatching</b> success <b>and</b> chick <b>survival.</b> Harvested sites also had {{a higher proportion of}} abnormal eggs, particularly taking the forms of small yolkless eggs and unpigmented eggs. The reduced breeding success on harvested colonies is likely to be linked to depletion of the female's endogenous reserves which can also reduce future <b>survival</b> <b>and</b> breeding propensity...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} culture filtrates of Fusarium oxysporum and Sclerotium rolfsii on egg <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> {{juvenile}} <b>survival</b> of Meloidogyne incognita in vitro {{and impact of}} these filtrates on infectivity of M. incognita were investigated on soybean seedlings. Five- and 10 -day-old filtrates of F. oxysporum caused 65 and 54 % egg-hatching inhibition, while that of S. rolfsii caused 61 and 49 % inhibition, respectively. Juveniles of M. incognita died within 6 days when incubated in 5 -day-old filtrate of F. oxysporum, while the similar filtrate of S. rolfsii caused 100 % juvenile mortality on the fifth day. Filtrates reduced root galling, egg population, number of adult females in soybean plants at harvest and also soil population. Culture filtrates {{could be used as}} source of biological nematicides...|$|R
40|$|A {{bioassay}} test using Artemia Salina egg and larvae is conducted {{to evaluate the}} aquatic toxicity treated refine 7 effluents. The brine shrimp (Artemia salina) has gained popularity as test organism for short-term toxicity testing because of its ease of culture, short generation time, cosmopolitan distribution and its commercial availability as dormant eggs. One year study {{has been carried out}} to assess toxicity of effluent samples collected from an oil refinery at Mangalore, (India) on the egg <b>hatching</b> <b>and</b> larval <b>survival</b> rate of A. salina. The chemical quality of the refinery effluent collected during Oct 2002 - Sep 2003 was found to be within the prescribed permissible limits. The mean EC 50 for egg hatching rate using the effluent collected during the dry and wet seasons was 40. 6...|$|R
