5000|$|The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> is a {{particular}} aspect of contracts of carriage of goods by sea. A deviation is {{a departure from the}} [...] "agreed route" [...] or the [...] "usual route", and it can amount to a serious a breach of contract. The consequences of unjustified deviation are very grave for the carrier, who is thereby prevented from relying upon any exclusion clause which limits his liability.|$|E
50|$|The law of {{fundamental}} breach was historically {{treated as an}} extension of the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation.</b> The development of this doctrine can be traced down to the first half of the 19th century, when Tindal C.J. stated in Davis v. Garrett that deviation made by the carrier from the agreed voyage route brings the latter outside of contract and therefore outside of exceptions or limitation clauses provided by such a contract. This harsh attitude to deviation cases originated from the earlier marine insurance practice when cargo insurance policy was lost in case of deviation. Thereby strict obligations imposed to the carrier were designed to afford protection to the cargo owner.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to critically assess the current status of the legal regime governing the international carriage of goods by sea, with the main focus being on the implied terms which form the foundation of international shipping law in general, and on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> in particular. This will include a critical review of the rule against unjustified deviation in contracts of affreightment by posing the following questions: (i) Is the rule against unjustified deviation still relevant in the modern context of international carriage of goods by sea? In light of: The development of transport vessels, liberty clauses, different types of charterparties, and held cover clauses? (ii) Should the rule against unjustified deviation be treated any differently from other implied shipping terms? Is the rule against deviation an absolute obligation? Should unjustified deviation amount to fundamental breach of a contract? Should there not be some degree of flexibility in the judicial approach to the law on deviation? (iii) Do we need harmonisation, unification and interpretation of deviation rules? It is hoped that in attempting to answer these questions some light may be shed on this important area of shipping law...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is the {{liability}} of the sea carrier in the international carriage of goods by sea. Chapter One: discuses the nature of liability of the sea carrier under the Hague/Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules. The Hague/Visby Rules define the term “Carrier” as including the owner or the charterer who enters into contract of carriage with the shipper, while Hamburg Rules widen the definition to include any person by whom or on whose name contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a shipper. The Hague/Visby scheme of liability is built on specific obligations by which the carrier is bound, i. e. the obligation to issue a bill of lading, obligation to exercise due diligence, to provide a seaworthy ship and the obligation of care of cargo. The failure of the carrier in the fulfillment of the obligations will expose him to cargo claims by shippers or cargo owners in cases of loss or damage to cargo. He will be held as liable for damages unless he proves that he is exempted form liability by virtue {{of one of the}} seventeen exceptions provided for in Article IV. The most significant of them are: fire; perils of the sea; force majeure, nautical fault; acts and omissions of the shipper. Hamburg Rules introduce a relatively simple scheme of liability based on the “presumed fault” by the carrier his agents or servants. Thus in cases of loss or damage to cargo the carrier is held to be liable unless he proves that he, his servants and agents were not at fault. Chapter Two: considers the scope of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules. They cover bills of lading which are issued in contracting state or which incorporate the Rules by paramount clause. They cover the international outward carriage only. While under Hamburg Rules it is immaterial whether or not a bill of lading has been issued. The Rules cover contract of carriage concluded in a contracting state or if the port of loading or port of discharge is in a contracting state. Moreover if the optional port of discharge is in a contracting state. Similarly, it can be incorporated by paramount clause in the bill of lading. Hamburg Rules cover the inward and outward international carriage. The period of application under the Hague/Visby Rules is limited from the time of loading till the time of discharge, i. e. “tackle to tackle” period, while Hamburg Rules cover the entire voyage until the goods are handed over or put in disposal of the cargo owner. The Hague/Visby Rules do not provide for liability in cases of delay in delivery. They exclude the live animals and deck cargo from the definition of goods. While Hamburg Rules provide for liability of carrier in cases of delay in delivery. They bring all cargoes under their umbrella. Thus they provide for liability of the carrier in cases of live animals and deck cargo. Both conventions provide for liability for shipment of dangerous cargoes. The well known <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> under the common law is still in use under the Hague/Visby Rules. It operates to hold the carrier as in a fundamental breach of contract unless he proves that he deviates to save life or property at sea. Hamburg Rules do not recognize the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation.</b> Chapter Three: considers the limits of liability and limits of actions. The same system of calculating the limit of liability is valid under both conventions, i. e. the dual system of per package, per kilo. The former is for goods with high value compared to their weight, while the latter is suitable for bulk cargoes. Although the Hague/Visby Rules introduce a provision for calculating limit of liability in containerized goods, i. e. according to the items enumerated on the bill of lading, the position is still ambiguous. The unit of account is Poincare franc which is replaced by the additional Protocol ١٩٧٩ by the Special Drawing Right (SDR) and so forth under Hamburg Rules. The limits should be broken when the carrier is in default of negligence, recklessness or intentional acts. Moreover, the carrier cannot be benefited by the limits of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules if he is in default i. e. in cases of fundamental breach of contract such as deviations or stowage on deck without shippers consent...|$|E
40|$|Deviation {{occurring}} {{in the course of}} a maritime voyage and its effect on the carrier's liability is a controversial issue whether under the Hague/Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules or under the COGSA of the United Kingdom and the United States. The thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter one is aimed at defining the concept of `lq deviation and clarifying the classification of `lq deviation. Any attempt to classify the terminology of deviation into reasonable and unreasonable is considered an essential factor in deciding whether the deviation {{occurring in}} the course of the maritime voyage is a deviatory breach of contractual obligations or not. Chapter two is divided into two sections. The first one is devoted to explaining the main principles of the carrier's liability concerning the seaworthiness and the proper care of the goods by loading, handling, and stowing the goods carried. I also discussed the degree of the seriousness of the carrier's fault or his servant or agent and the effect of serious fault on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> which might displace the carriage contract when such deviation occurs deliberately. Whereas, the immunities of the carrier, whether under the International Convention, i. e. The Hague/Visby Rules and The Hamburg Rules or, in the national laws and the immunities which are based on a contractual basis, are the subject of section two. I have however reached the conclusion, in this chapter, that the carrier's liability, under the Hague/Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules, is based on the principles of presumed fault or neglect. On the other hand, I have adopted the risk approach as the best theory for introducing an explanation for holding a deviating carrier liable providing that the deviation is wrongful and increasing the risk of loss beyond that permitted by the contract and endeavours to prevent the carrier from creating unauthorized risks. Chapter three deals with the effect of deviation on the contract of carriage and its characteristics as a serious breach of the contractual obligations. I have therefore divided the chapter into two sections. Section one is concerned with the characterization of the breach of contract of carriage by explaining the distinction between the conditions and warranties under the general principles of the contract law, and the breach of fundamental term or the fundamental breach, while section two is devoted to explaining the effect of unreasonable deviation on the obligations of the contracting parties. I have however tried in this chapter to find a legal characterization for unreasonable deviation. I believe that such a serious breach is considered a breach of the substantive rules and therefore the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>deviation</b> has still the same effects on the contractual obligations as it had under the pre-Hague Rules regime. I also endeavoured to base such a breach in the carriage contract on the test of reasonableness which determines whether or not a breach of contract is fundamental or material. Thus, any exaggeration in the drastic effect of an unreasonable deviation should be isolated from the carrier's duties to provide a seaworthy ship and to load, stow, and discharge the cargo properly and carefully. The innocent party has merely a right to compensation for such loss of or damage to the cargo. Recovery of losses and damages resulting from an unreasonable deviation is the subject of chapter four. This chapter is divided into three sections which deal with the compensatory nature of losses and damages and whether the innocent party is entitled to recover the physical and the economic loss by establishing the causal relationship between the unreasonable deviation and the loss of or damage to the cargo which could be shown by adopting two doctrines, i. e. remoteness and mitigation of damage, which have tried to limit the damages. The court is however entitled to have a special method to estimate such loss of or damage to the cargo. Unless the nature and the value of the goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading, the cargo-owner is entitled to recovery for full damages caused to the cargo which may exceed the statutory limitation. Chapter five is concerned with the procedures of action for lost or damaged cargo. This chapter is divided into four sections. These sections are concentrated on the principles of notice of loss, damage and delay in delivery, time limitation for suit, jurisdiction clauses, and the burden of proof under the International Conventions and COGSA. These four points are, however, classified into formal and substantive conditions. The first three conditions are formal conditions which the court must enquire as a matter of form that these conditions have been instituted before hearing the case. The last condition is a substantive condition when the court must show who bears the burden of proof at a particular point in the litigation. Finally chapter six is devoted to describing and analyzing the main principles of the Iraqi and Egyptian legal systems concerning the liability of the carrier. Iraq and Egypt have broadened their horizons by adopting the principles of the International Conventions, i. e. Egypt ratified the Hague Rules since May 29 th 1944, whereas, the Iraqi Draftsman embodied the principles of the Hamburg Rules in the Iraqi Transport Law in 1983. That indicates that both apply the international rules in order to establish a joint understanding for the principles of carriage of goods by sea and to obtain some benefit of the precedents and experience of the United Kingdom and the United States in the field of maritime law...|$|E

The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John.
