5|$|Strategic management: Due to the {{increasing}} importance of design as a differentiator and its supporting role in brand equity, design management deals with strategic design issues and supports the strategic direction of the business or enterprise. The debate on <b>design</b> <b>thinking</b> suggests the integration of <b>design</b> <b>thinking</b> into strategic management. <b>Design</b> <b>thinking</b> and strategic thinking have some commonalities in their characteristics, both are synthetic, adductive, hypothesis-driven, opportunistic, dialectical, enquiring and value-driven.|$|E
5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating <b>design</b> <b>thinking</b> into management. In organisation and management theory, <b>design</b> <b>thinking</b> forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of <b>design</b> <b>thinking</b> principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Design {{management}} {{has taken a}} more strategic role within business since 2000, and more academic programs for design management have been established. Design {{management has}} been recognized (and subsidized) throughout the European Union as a function for corporate advantage of both companies and nations. The main issues and debates included the topics of <b>design</b> <b>thinking,</b> strategic design management, design leadership, and product service systems. Design management {{was influenced by the}} following design trends: sustainable design, inclusive design, interactive design, design probes, product clinics, and co-design. It was also influenced by the later management trends of open innovation and <b>design</b> <b>thinking.</b>|$|E

Business Schools (such as the Rotman School of Management, Wharton University of Pennsylvania and MIT Sloan Executive Education) have acted on this interest and developed new academic curricula.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, design {{management}} {{was seen as}} limited to the management of design projects, but over time, it evolved to include other aspects of an organization at the functional and strategic level. A more recent debate concerns the integration of <b>design</b> <b>thinking</b> into strategic management as a cross-disciplinary and human-centered approach to management. This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an abductive mode of inference, compared to practices associated with the more traditional management paradigm.|$|E

5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, <b>design</b> <b>thinking</b> becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E

25|$|Aesthetically and aerodynamically the T51 was {{a natural}} {{development}} of the T43 and T45 cars that had given Cooper their first two wins. The Coopers continued their practice of building spaceframe chassis that ignored orthodox <b>design</b> <b>thinking</b> in having several curved links and the rear-engine layout meant weight savings and aerodynamic advantages over the front-engined cars, which typically had separate gearbox and differential cases, and had to find room for propshafts to the rear wheels. Also {{the location of the}} fuel tanks {{on either side of the}} cockpit rather than at the rear meant the car handled more consistently with different fuel loads, a vital factor during races which lasted up to three hours. One notable throwback, however, was the car's leaf spring rear suspension, although it used a more modern coil spring and wishbone setup at the front.|$|E

One focus of criticism was the [...] "nakedness" [...] of the structure, in comparison to other luxurious pavilions such as that by Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann. Alexander Rodchenko designed a worker's club, and the furniture that the Wood and Metal Working Faculty (Дерметфак) contributed was an international success. The student work won several prizes, and Melnikov's pavilion won the Grand Prix.

2500|$|Critics of deconstructivism {{see it as}} {{a purely}} formal {{exercise}} with little social significance. Kenneth Frampton finds it [...] "elitist and detached". Nikos Salingaros calls deconstructivism a [...] "viral expression" [...] that invades <b>design</b> <b>thinking</b> in order to build destroyed forms; while curiously similar to both Derrida's and Philip Johnson's descriptions, this is meant as a harsh condemnation of the entire movement. Other criticisms {{are similar to those of}} deconstructivist philosophy—that since the act of deconstructivism is not an empirical process, it can result in whatever an architect wishes, and it thus suffers from a lack of consistency. Today there is a sense that the philosophical underpinnings of the beginning of the movement have been lost, and all that is left is the aesthetic of deconstructivism. Other criticisms reject the premise that architecture is a language capable of being the subject of linguistic philosophy, or, if it was a language in the past, critics claim it is no longer. Others question the wisdom and impact on future generations of an architecture that rejects the past and presents no clear values as replacements and which often pursues strategies that are intentionally aggressive to human senses.|$|E

In this paper, using reference to the theory on creative <b>design</b> practice, <b>thinking</b> habits, styles, motivation, psychology and behaviour, I suggest that design educators should consider six factors before formulating their creativity training. They are: (1) identifying <b>design</b> students' <b>thinking</b> habits; (2) developing students' intrinsic motivation by fun; (3) developing students' positive and forward thinking; (4) enhancing students' self-determination; (5) managing students' emotions; and (6) removing students' obstacles to creativity.
