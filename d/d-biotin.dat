50|$|The Streptamer {{technique}} {{enables a}} reversible identification and purification of antigen specific T cell population at 4 °C, thus {{it does not}} affect the functional status of the cells.The addition of a Strep-tag competitor, <b>d-biotin,</b> results in the rapid disassembly of MHC multimers. Subsequently, the dissociation of monomeric MHC-peptide molecules from the T cell surface takes place. Therefore, this method comprises the advantages of conventional MHC multimer staining procedures, but it further allows removal of the staining reagents before negative effects of ligand-binding can begin to take place. The Streptamer technology is not only especially suited for clinical applications because of the reversibility of the TCR-MHC interaction, furthermore two other requirements are fulfilled. First, <b>d-biotin</b> (also known as vitamin H) is non-toxic for T-cells in low concentrations, which are used for Streptamer disassembly. Second, the amount of <b>d-biotin</b> that might be transferred with Streptamer isolated T-cells are far lower than <b>d-biotin</b> concentrationsfound in conventional vitamin supplementations, thus, unlikely to be harmful.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{molecule}} <b>d-biotin</b> {{has a much}} higher affinity to Strep-Tactin than Strep-tag, it can effectively compete for the binding site. Therefore, a MHC multimer based on the interaction of Strep-tag with Strep-Tactin is easily disrupted {{in the presence of}} relatively low concentrations of <b>d-biotin.</b> Without the Strep-Tactin backbone, the single MHC-Strep-tag fusion proteins spontaneously distatch from the TCR of the T cell, because of weak binding affinities(monomeric MHC-epitope complexes cannot provide stable binding, see above).|$|E

The list of cases where the typical Sonogashira reaction using aryl halides has been employed is large, and choosing illustrative examples is difficult. A recent use of this methodology is shown below for the coupling of iodinated phenylalanine with a terminal alkyne derived from <b>d-biotin</b> using an in situ generated Pd(0) species as catalyst, which allowed the preparation of alkynelinked phenylalanine derivative for bioanalytical applications.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the level of <b>d-biotin</b> in the growth medium of Lactobacillus plantarum regulates the synthesis of apoacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase; high levels cause repression, and deficient levels effect derepression. In this study, evidence has been obtained which suggests that coenzyme repression by biotin is an indirect effect; i. e., biotin regulates the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids which are the true repressors of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This was observed in an experiment in which long-chain unsaturated fatty acids were added to media containing deficient, sufficient, or excess levels of <b>d-biotin.</b> In every case, independently of the biotin concentration for growth, the unsaturated fatty acids caused a severe repression of the carboxylase. Saturated fatty acids were without effect. The level of oleic acid required to give maximal repression was 50 μg/ml. The free fatty acids had no adverse effect on the activity of the cell-free extracts nor on the permeation of <b>d-biotin</b> into the cell. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids decreased the rate of holocarboxylase formation from <b>d-biotin</b> and the apoacetyl-CoA carboxylase in the extracts. It is concluded that {{there are at least three}} mechanisms that control the acetyl-CoA carboxylase in this organism: (i) indirect coenzyme repression by <b>d-biotin,</b> (ii) repression by unsaturated fatty acids, and (iii) regulation of the activity of the holocarboxylase synthetase by both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids...|$|E

40|$|Pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaf acetyl-coenzyme A {{carboxylase}} (ACCase) {{exists as}} two structurally different forms: a major, chloroplastic, dissociable form and a minor, multifunctional enzyme form {{located in the}} leaf epidermis. The dissociable form is able to carboxylate free <b>D-biotin</b> as an alternate substrate {{in place of the}} natural substrate, biotin carboxyl carrier protein. Here we report the purification of the biotin carboxylase component of the chloroplastic pea leaf ACCase. The purified enzyme, free from carboxyltransferase activity, is composed of two firmly bound polypeptides, one of which (38 kD) is biotinylated. In contrast to bacterial biotin carboxylase, which retains full activity upon removal of the biotin carboxyl carrier component, attempts to dissociate the two subunits of the plant complex led to a complete loss of biotin carboxylase activity. Steady-state kinetic studies of the biotin carboxylase reaction reveal that addition of all substrates on the enzyme is sequential and that no product release is possible until all three substrates (MgATP, <b>D-biotin,</b> bicarbonate) are bound to the enzyme and all chemical processes at the active site are completed. In agreement with this mechanism, bicarbonate-dependent ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme is found to be strictly dependent on the presence of exogenous <b>D-biotin</b> in the reaction medium...|$|E
40|$|An {{essential}} protein {{component of}} acetyl CoA carboxylase, isolated and extensively purified from cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, {{has been identified}} as malonyl CoA: <b>d-biotin</b> carboxyl transferase.

40|$|Use of a yeast-lactobacillus {{differential}} microbiological assay permitted {{investigation into}} the synthesis of biotin vitamers {{by a variety of}} bacteria. A major portion of the biotin activity was found extracellularly. The level of total biotin (assayable with yeast) greatly exceeded the level of true biotin (assayed with lactobacillus). Values for intracellular biotin generally showed good agreement between the assays, suggesting the presence of only true biotin within the cells. Bioautographic analysis of the medium after growth of each organism revealed the presence of large amounts of a vitamer which corresponded to dl-desthiobiotin on the basis of Rf value and biological activity. Biotin, when detected at all, was at very low concentrations. Also, an avidin-uncombinable vitamer was synthesized by a majority of the bacteria. Addition of <b>d-biotin</b> to the growth medium prevented completely the synthesis of both vitamers of biotin. d-Biotin-d-sulfoxide had no effect on the synthesis of desthiobiotin or the avidin-uncombinable vitamer. Addition of dl-desthiobiotin did not prevent its own synthesis nor that of the other vitamer. Control of vitamer synthesis is therefore highly specific for <b>d-biotin.</b> The avidin-uncombinable vitamer was produced only at repressed levels in the presence of high concentrations of both <b>d-biotin</b> and dl-desthiobiotin, which suggested {{that it is not a}} degradation product of these substances.

The use of these organisms for differential assay permitted investigation into possible conversion of <b>d-biotin</b> to vitamers of biotin by cells of L. arabinosus. Cells were grown in modified Wright-Skeggs medium containing several levels of biotin. No differences were detected between the assays for free intracellular or bound biotin up to 48 hr of growth. However, at 15 to 16 hr, in media containing an excess of biotin, the lactobacillus assay value for menstruum biotin dropped markedly, whereas the yeast assay showed no change. This suggested that biotin was converted to vitamers not active for L. arabinosus. The biotin-converting system appears to have characteristics of an enzyme system, i. e., a temperature optimum at 37 C, a broad pH optimum of 4. 3 to 6. 5, and requirements for Mg and Mn ions. Experiments suggest that increasing hydrogen ion concentration is a major physiological mechanism controlling the formation of this system.

A useful fluorescent labeling agent should include NIR emission, a large Stoke's shift, and good labeling ability without interfering with the pharmacological profile of the labeled compound. Thus, we planned to develop an M-AMF-DOTA(Nd) derivative composed of an NIR fluorescent moiety and a maleimide conjugating moiety as a new NIR fluorescent labeling agent which fulfills these requirements. M-AMF-DOTA(Nd) was synthesized from 4 -amino-fluorescein and was conjugated with an avidin molecule (Avidin-AMF-DOTA(Nd)) through Lys-side chains by reaction with 2 -iminothiolane. The fluorescent features of M-AMF-DOTA(Nd) and Avidin-AMF-DOTA(Nd) were comparatively evaluated. A binding assay of Avidin-AMF-DOTA(Nd) with <b>D-biotin</b> and a tumor cell-uptake study were performed to estimate the effects of conjugation on the biological and physicochemical features of the protein. M-AMF-DOTA(Nd) was obtained in 22 % overall yield. M-AMF-DOTA(Nd) had a typical NIR fluorescence from the Nd ion (880 nm and 900 nm from 488 nm excitation). Avidin-AMF-DOTA(Nd) was easily synthesized and also had typical NIR fluorescence from the Nd ion without loss of fluorescent intensity.

40|$|Background and aims: The {{extremely}} high affinity of (strep) avidin towards biotin (Kd≈ 10 - 15 - 10 - 16) and stability enables {{its use in}} a variety of applications; for example, in targeted drug therapy, affinity chromatography and {{in a variety of}} analytical methods. The rapidly developing technologies require biotin binding proteins with novel characteristics that are not found among naturally occurring proteins. The main aim {{of the study was to}} characterize biophysically four novel biotin binding proteins created with DNA shuffling and phage display from avidin (AVD) and avidin related protein 2 (AVR 2). Methods: Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study <b>d-biotin</b> binding affinity. Surface plasmon resonance was used to study binding kinetics towards 2 -iminobiotin, ssDNA and cysteine. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to study thermal stability of the mutants and also their ligand binding affinities. Homology models were built with MODELLER. Results: All the mutants studied have a lowered affinity towards <b>d-biotin</b> and distorted biotin binding site when compared to wtAVDs. The DNA binding abilities varied with wtAVDs bound irreversibly to DNA whereas mutant with neutral pI had no affinity towards DNA. Mutants with higher local charge around biotin binding pocket seemed to have a lower affinity towards 2 -iminobiotin. Mutants having wtAVD charge distribution around biotin binding pocket were less affected. Mutant with neutral pI was not able to bind 2 -iminobiotin. Thermal stability of the mutants was enhanced by the S 16 Y mutation. A novel activity among biotin binding proteins was found. A mutant with S 16 Y mutation was able to bind L- cysteine. The S 16 Y mutation alone was not able to induce this binding activity. Conclusions: A biophysical characterization of studied proteins was successful. It seems that charge distribution in the proximity of biotin binding pocket is important for 2 -iminobiotin binding with pI having a smaller effect. In DNA binding, pI is a more important parameter: only biotin binding proteins having a total positive charge seem able to bind DNA.   Asiasanat:Avidin, DNA shuffling, phage display, <b>d-biotin,</b> 2 -iminobiotin, DNA binding proteins, avidin, avidin related protein 2 (AVR 2), Biotin binding protein...|$|E

Results Here, we expand the repertoire of known macromolecular biotin binders by reporting a novel biotin-binding protein A (BBP-A) from chicken. The BBP-A recombinant protein was expressed using two different expression systems and purified with affinity chromatography, biochemically characterized and two X-ray structures were solved – in complex with <b>D-biotin</b> (BTN) and in complex with <b>D-biotin</b> D-sulfoxide (BSO). The BBP-A protein binds free biotin with high, "streptavidin-like" affinity (K d ~ 10 - 13 M), which is about 50 times {{lower than that of}} chicken avidin.

40|$|Abstract Background The chicken avidin {{gene family}} {{consists}} of avidin and several avidin related genes (AVR s). Of these gene products, avidin {{is the best}} characterized and {{is known for its}} extremely high affinity for <b>D-biotin,</b> a property that is utilized in numerous modern life science applications. Recently, the AVR genes have been expressed as recombinant proteins, which have shown different biotin-binding properties as compared to avidin. Results In the present study, we have employed multiple biochemical methods to better understand the structure-function relationship of AVR proteins focusing on AVR 2. Firstly, we have solved the high-resolution crystal structure of AVR 2 in complex with a bound ligand, <b>D-biotin.</b> The AVR 2 structure reveals an overall fold similar to the previously determined structures of avidin and AVR 4. Major differences are seen, especially at the 1 – 3 subunit interface, which is stabilized mainly by polar interactions in the case of AVR 2 but by hydrophobic interactions in the case of AVR 4 and avidin, and {{in the vicinity of the}} biotin binding pocket. Secondly, mutagenesis, competitive dissociation analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used to compare and study the biotin-binding properties as well as the thermal stability of AVRs and avidin. These analyses pinpointed the importance of residue 109 for biotin binding and stability of AVRs. The I 109 K mutation increased the biotin-binding affinity of AVR 2, whereas the K 109 I mutation decreased the biotin-binding affinity of AVR 4. Furthermore, the thermal stability of AVR 2 (I 109 K) increased in comparison to the wild-type protein and the K 109 I mutation led to a decrease in the thermal stability of AVR 4. Conclusion Altogether, this study broadens our understanding of the structural features determining the ligand-binding affinities and stability as well as the molecular evolution within the protein family. This novel information can be applied to further develop and improve the tools already widely used in avidin-biotin technology. </p...|$|E

In this paper, we describe the development of building blocks for nanobiotechnology, which are based on the fusion of streptavidin to a crystalline bacterial cell surface layer (S-layer) protein with the inherent ability to self-assemble into a monomolecular protein lattice. The fusion proteins and streptavidin were produced independently in Escherichia coli, isolated, and mixed to refold and purify heterotetramers of 1 : 3 stoichiometry. Self-assembled chimeric S-layers could be formed in suspension, on liposomes, on silicon wafers, and on accessory cell wall polymer containing cell wall fragments. The two-dimensional protein crystals displayed streptavidin in defined repetitive spacing, and they were capable of binding <b>d-biotin</b> and biotinylated proteins. Therefore, the chimeric S-layer {{can be used as}} a self-assembling nanopatterned molecular affinity matrix to arrange biotinylated compounds on a surface. In addition, it has application potential as a functional coat of liposomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to improve the L-lysine production by Corynebacterium glutamicum. For this purpose culture conditions for the lysine fermentation by the bacteria were optimized. In this regard the role of various physical and nutritional parameters was examined. The culture was incubated in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask in a rotatory shaking incubator at 200 rpm. The appropriate conditions were obtained only when 50 ml medium was charged for fermentation at 30 o C, pH 7. 5 and at 10 % inoculum size. The finally selected medium per 100 ml distilled water formulated was 10 g glucose, 2. 5 g ammonium sulfate, 2. 0 g calcium carbonate, 0. 5 g bactocasamino acid, 20 �g thiamine hydrochlorid, 5 �g <b>D-biotin,</b> 0. 1 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0. 05 g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0. 2 mg ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and 0. 2 mg manganese chloride tetrahydrate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} has been to identify commonplace, inexpensive substances that {{might be used to}} link radioisotopes to antibodies. It was found that a high molecular weight component of bovine skim milk binds bismuth ion and might be used as a carrier of short-lived bismuth isotopes in radioimmunotherapy applications. The bismuth-binding material may be complexed with 207 Bi (as the Bi 3 + cation) and biotinylated using the reagent N-hydroxysuccinimido-D-biotin. Avidin on agarose columns sequestered 69 % of the applied biotinylated product (S. D. 12 %), whereas only 19 % of the bismuth activity adhered to avidin columns that had been pre-blocked with <b>D-biotin</b> (S. D. 7 %). Complexed with the short-lived alpha emitter 212 Bi, the biotinylated product might be used in pre-targeting modes of radioimmunotherapy without modification. The bismuth-binding agent could be casein micelles, with Bi 3 + exchanging into Ca 2 + sites, but this has not been proven. © 1999 Oklahoma Academy of Scienc...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} approach {{was taken to}} establish a rapidly growing suspension culture of Curcuma mangga (C. mangga). Various responses were obtained from shoot bud explants cultured on MS basal medium supplemented with different concentrations of 2, 4 -D, NAA and IAA either alone or in combinations. Different levels of sucrose were also tested. Rapid growing friable callus obtained from shoot explants cultured on MS basal medium supplemented with 1 mg l- 1 2, 4 -D, 30 g l- 1 sucrose and 2 g l- 1 gelrite were selected for the initiation of suspension cultures based on histological morphology. From various media screened, rapid growing suspension cultures were established by using MS liquid medium supplemented with 0. 3 mg l- 1 2, 4 -D, 0. 1 mg l- 1 NAA, 30 g l- 1 sucrose, 0. 1 g l- 1 malt extract, 0. 5 mg l- 1 <b>d-Biotin,</b> 100 mg l- 1 glutamine, 5 mg l- 1 ascorbic acid and citric acid respectively.

40|$|Nanoscale {{superstructures}} {{made from}} CdTe nanowires (NWs) and metal nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared via bioconjugation reactions. Prototypical biomolecules, such as <b>D-biotin</b> and streptavidin pair, were utilized to connect NPs and NWs in solution. It {{was found that}} Au NPs form a dense shell around a CdTe NW. The superstructure demonstrated unusual optical effects related to the long-distance interaction of the semiconductor and noble metal nanocolloids. The NW−NP complex showed 5 -fold enhancement of luminescence intensity and a blue shift of the emission peak as compared to unconjugated NW. The system was theoretically examined in a simple model of CdTe NW coaxially surrounded by an Au shell, which gives excellent agreement with experimental data. The combination of time-resolved luminescence and calculations demonstrated that increase of fluorescence intensity occurs due to stimulation of photon emission by an electromagnetic field generated around the Au NP. The process is reminiscent of SERS, although displaying smaller enhancement factors. Importantly, the luminescence enhancement {{should be treated as}} a collective response of Au−NPs, rather than a result of isolated NP−NW interactions. 1. Introduction. Hybri...|$|E
40|$|Purpose] : We {{aimed to}} {{establish}} a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol for the sensitive and specific imaging of functional molecules with a pre-targeting strategy utilizing the streptavidin–biotin interaction. Membrane type- 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT 1 -MMP) {{was selected as the}} target molecule. [Procedures] : The biotinylated polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) -based contrast agent (Bt-PAMAM-DTPA(Gd)) was prepared, and its proton relaxivity (r 1) and affinity to streptavidin were evaluated. Tumor-bearing mice were pre-targeted with streptavidin-conjugated anti-MT 1 -MMP monoclonal antibody (mAb), streptavidin-conjugated negative control IgG, or saline and 3 days later were injected with Bt-PAMAM-DTPA(Gd) followed immediately by MRI for a period of 3 h. [Results] : High r 1 (15. 5 L mmol[− 1] s[− 1]) and 1. 9 -fold higher affinity than <b>D-biotin</b> were obtained. Significantly higher relative tumor signals were observed in mice pre-targeted with streptavidin-conjugated anti-MT 1 -MMP mAb (165 % at 3 h vs. pre-administration) than with saline or streptavidin-conjugated negative control IgG (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001). [Conclusions] : This pre-targeting approach can accomplish sensitive and specific in vivo MRI of functional molecules...|$|E
40|$|The avidin protein {{family members}} are well known for their high {{affinity}} towards <b>D-biotin</b> and high structural stability. These properties make avidins valuable tools {{for a wide range}} of biotechnology applications. We have identified a new member of the avidin family in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome, hereafter called zebavidin. The protein is highly expressed in the gonads of both male and female zebrafish and in the gills of male fish, but our data suggest that zebavidin is not crucial for the developing embryo. Biophysical and structural characterisation of zebavidin revealed distinct properties not found in any previously characterised avidins. Gel filtration chromatography and native mass spectrometry suggest that the protein forms dimers in the absence of biotin at low ionic strength, but assembles into tetramers upon binding biotin. Ligand binding was analysed using radioactive and fluorescently labelled biotin and isothermal titration calorimetry. Moreover, the crystal structure of zebavidin in complex with biotin was solved at 2. 4 Å resolution and unveiled unique ligand binding and subunit interface architectures; the atomic...|$|E
