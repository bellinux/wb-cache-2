By 1973, Friskies was one of five companies that controlled two-thirds of the $1.75 billion pet food market. At the time Carnation was known for dry milk products, but also had operations processing animal feed for farms. It experimented with dry <b>food</b> <b>products</b> for 3.5 years at Carnation Farms, initially with stray dogs in improvised cages, and later with pure-breds in a formal kennel.

40|$|Objective: Patients {{reported}} that a <b>food</b> <b>product</b> containing lactic acid improved their memory and thought processes. The ingredients of the tested <b>food</b> <b>product</b> are compound substances and smooth muscle fibre, the appropriate medium in which to analyse their effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used to treat memory loss and failing thought performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effects of the lactic acid <b>food</b> <b>product</b> with the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Methods: In this in vitro study the effects of the <b>food</b> <b>product</b> containing lactic acid on smooth muscle fibres of guinea pig stomach were investigated. Results: The results show that the lactic acid <b>food</b> <b>product</b> contains substances that can inhibit the activity of both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. This inhibitory effect was compared to the inhibitory effects of galantamine (Nivalin&# 174;), pyridostigmine bromide (Kalymin&# 174;) and donepezil hydrochloride (Donepezil&# 174;), which are clinically used for the pharmacological treatment of dementia. We observed a 5 % to 20 % less potency factor difference with the lactic acid <b>food</b> <b>product</b> compared to that of the pharmaceutical drugs. Conclusions: This proves that the lactic acid <b>food</b> <b>product</b> can also have an impact on memory and thought performance and that these results should promote clinical trials to test efficacy.

50|$|The {{product of}} the {{marketing}} mix refers to the goods and/or services that the organisation will offer to the consumer. An organisation can achieve this by either creating a new <b>food</b> <b>product,</b> or by modifying or improving an existing <b>food</b> <b>product.</b> For example, an organic almond yoghurt drink {{would be considered a}} new product, whereas a chocolate flavoured milk drink would be an extension of an existing product (Helm & Gritsch, 2014). The three steps to develop and extend a <b>food</b> <b>product</b> include generating ideas, analysing the ideas for feasibility and testing ideas for demand.
