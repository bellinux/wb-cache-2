5|$|Current definition: The mole <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{substance}} {{of a system}} that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon-12.

5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on a fork in the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E

5|$|Draft <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> slope or taper {{given to}} cores or {{other parts of}} the die cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from the die. All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from the die. Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} affinity of an atom <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy released when an electron {{is added to}} a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although {{electron affinity}} varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so {{they may or may}} not have slightly negative values.|$|E
5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{light and}} other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E

30|$|Gosling et al. [21] also {{compared}} {{a single}} lateral locked plate to dual plating with a lateral and anteromedial anti-glide plate. They {{looked at the}} plastic (non reversible) and elastic (reversible) deformation at four different loads (400, 800, 1, 200 and 1, 600  N). <b>The</b> plastic deformation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> subsidence present after <b>the</b> load <b>was</b> removed from <b>the</b> specimen while <b>the</b> elastic deformation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> subsidence with <b>the</b> load in place.|$|R
5|$|Another {{major issue}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{radiation}} {{to which a}} space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed {{to pass through the}} radiation belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
5|$|Sauvignon blanc can {{be greatly}} {{influenced}} by decisions in the winemaking process. One decision <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> contact that the must has with the skins of the grape. In {{the early years of}} the New Zealand wine industry, there were no wineries on the South Island which meant that freshly harvested grapes had to be trucked and then ferried to the North Island, often all the way up to Auckland. This allowed for prolonged exposure of the skins and juice which sharpened the intensity and pungency of the wine. Some winemakers, like the Loire, intentionally leave a small amount of must to spend some time in contact with the skin for later blending purposes. Other winemakers, like in California, generally avoid any contact with the skin due to the reduced aging ability of the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy that is released through fusion, which {{is dependent on}} the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher rate of reaction than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
