I went out, I got a ‘My Buddy’ doll, I got a Raggedy Ann, a Raggedy Andy and I got one of those life-size baby infants. And I still have it out back. They are the creepiest things in the world. And what I told designer Kevin Yagher was, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> Buddy, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> Raggedy Andy coloring - those button overalls, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> freckles and all that.

And <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, looking right at you. Betsy Ross did the best she could with what she had.

[...] Moon later said in a talk to church members: [...] "Why did we put so much effort into the movie Inchon? No matter what the result the motivation was {{for people to understand}} about MacArthur. I wanted to show how MacArthur loved God and loved people.

500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think if I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not quite sure if that's how <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work."

[...] The song's producer, Polow da Don, stated in his interview with MTV News that Rihanna's vocal performance was [...] "unique", as well as saying how Brown delivers his rap with a high amount of energy and conviction.

There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E

In response to the general acclaim from critics, Roberts wished that the track would be well received amongst her peers, saying [...] "I haven't seen one bad review from the single or album samplers – it seems {{too good to be}} true.

500|$|Grande came up {{with the}} idea of the music video and {{contacted}} Max Landis, known for his 2012 film Chronicle.

500|$|Bookends {{contains}} many of Paul Simon's major themes, including [...] "youth, alienation, life, love, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality". Simon's work on Bookends is loosely autobiographical, designed {{to function as}} both a personal and artistic statement. Simon, [...] "feeling especially auteurist in the Dylan style of the day", had planned out the album's concept before he began writing, telling Garfunkel [...] "I'm going to start writing a whole side of an album—a cycle of songs. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> early ones to be about youth and the last song to be about old age, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> feel of each song to fit." [...] Bookends, originally released primarily as a vinyl LP, opens and closes side one of the disc with the [...] "Bookends Theme", a brief acoustic piece (once compared to English rock band the Moody Blues) that evokes [...] "a time of innocence". [...] "Save the Life of My Child" [...] is a dramatic story involving drugs, violence and a mother and child relationship. According to James Bennighof, the song [...] "deals with individual crises in crowded urban settings, along with references to larger societal forces {{and at least a}} hint of some transcendent perspective". The song crossfades into [...] "America", which follows two young lovers—"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance"—as they board a Greyhound bus [...] "to look for America". It is a protest song that [...] "creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals". [...] "Overs" [...] includes themes regarding the disintegration of love and marriage. [...] "Old Friends" [...] paints a portrait of two old men reminiscing on the years of their youth. The two men [...] "sit on a park bench like bookends", and ponder how strange it feels to be nearing their lifetime. The song is joined with the [...] "Bookends Theme", this time with vocal accompaniment from the duo. The piece closes the entire suite with the [...] "resigned admonition" [...] to [...] "Preserve your memories / They're all that's left you".|$|E

500|$|At {{the next}} court session on July 15, {{prosecutors}} submitted evidence that V.

Brown then took the stand but refused to answer questions as to why his initial statements to Japanese police were different from what Takaesu later stated in court had actually happened on the night in question. The prosecutor asked Brown, [...] "Your original statement that she made sexual advances was false?" [...] Brown replied, [...] "I am not going to answer that." [...] When asked why he would not answer, Brown replied, [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> opportunity for this court to see publicly the type of corruption and distortion of evidence by the police and the prosecutor." [...] Takaesu later said that another reason for Brown's refusal to answer most of the questions was because his answers could be used by the USMC in separate military justice actions against Brown.|$|E

Hall aimed to make an emotionally gripping, cinematic experience from the beginning: [...] "I want this game to answer the question, 'Can a computer make you cry?' I {{want to make the}} characters so warm and friendly and lovable and identifiable... I want to start them off in fun situations, but as the game goes on, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere to get darker and darker. Friends betray the lead character, other friends die, and you will feel some of what they feel because you have been with these people for 50 hours, and in a sense, lived part of their lives with them." [...] Hall remarked that the characters were facets of his childhood. He later compared the name Anachronox (meaning poison from the past) and the internal struggles of each character, caused by turbulent events in their pasts and [...] "psychic poison." [...] Hall aimed to feature high-quality direction and camera-work in Anachronox, reminiscent of epic cinematic themes in role-playing video games like the Final Fantasy franchise. Hall enlisted producer Jake Hughes to direct cut scenes; Hughes had previously worked on several short independent films. Developers used real-time game cutscenes instead of live-action cinematics to avoid [...] " [...] players out of the game." [...] Hall remarked, [...] "All these games switch to cutscenes that look five hundred times better than the game. The secret is not to let the cutscenes kick the game's ass." ...|$|E
