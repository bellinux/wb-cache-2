Steps in this process include segmenting the relief from the background, and describing it as an offset height field relative to the underlying surface.

After making an initial estimate of <b>relief</b> <b>offset</b> height everywhere within the patch, we use a support vector machine to refine the segmentation. Tests demonstrate that this approach can accurately model the background surface where it underlies the relief, providing more accurate segmentation, as well as relief height field estimation. In particular, this approach provides significant improvements for relief concavities with narrow mouths and can segment reliefs with small internal holes...|$|R

40|$|Improvements to the {{automated}} co-registration and change detection software package, AFIDS (Automatic Fusion of Image Data System) has recently completed development for and validation by NGA/GIAT. The improvements involve {{the integration of}} the AFIDS ultra-fine gridding technique for horizontal displacement compensation with the recently evolved use of Rational Polynomial Functions/ Coefficients (RPFs/RPCs) for image raster pixel position to Latitude/Longitude indexing. Mapping and orthorectification (correction for elevation effects) of satellite imagery defies exact projective solutions because the data are not obtained from a single point (like a camera), but as a continuous process from the orbital path. Standard image processing techniques can apply approximate solutions, but advances in the state-of-the-art had to be made for precision change-detection and time-series applications where <b>relief</b> <b>offsets</b> become a controlling factor. The earlier AFIDS procedure required the availability of a camera model and knowledge of the satellite platform ephemeredes. The recent design advances connect the spacecraft sensor Rational Polynomial Function, a deductively developed model, with the AFIDS ultrafine grid, an inductively developed representation of the relationship raster pixel position to latitude /longitude. As a result, RPCs can be updated by AFIDS, a situation often necessary due to the accuracy limits of spacecraft navigation systems. An example of precision change detection will be presented from Quickbird...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Precise change {{detection}} {{and analysis of}} low (e. g. 1 - 4 km weather satellite) and moderate (e. g. 30 m Landsat) resolution space sensors involves the application of techniques that assure sub-pixel co-registration and ortho-rectification of satellite imagery. The procedure is “automatic ” {{in the sense that}} human-initiated tiepoint selection is not required, but rather the ephemeris information associated with an image is relied upon to initiate the co-registration process. The methodology employs the additive composition of all pertinent dependent and independent parameters contributing to image-to-image tiepoint misregistration within a satellite scene. Mapping and orthorectification (correction for elevation effects) of satellite imagery defies exact projective solutions because the data are not obtained from a single point (like a camera) but as a continuous process from the orbital path. Standard image processing techniques can apply approximate solutions with sufficient accuracy, but some advances in the state-of-the-art had to be made for precision change-{{detection and}} time-series applications where <b>relief</b> <b>offsets</b> become a controlling factor. The basic technique first involves correlation and warping of raw satellite data points to an orthorectified Landsat data base to give an approximate mapping. Then digital elevation models are used to correct perspective shifts due to height and view-angle of the imaging platform. To avoid degradation of the data by multiple resampling, each warp is represented by an ultra-fine grid of tiepoints. For successive warps, the grids can be composed mathematically into a single grid such that only one re-sampling occurs after all relevant calculations are complete. Ultra-fine grids can currently be up to 1000 x 1000, or one million points...|$|R

40|$|Successional {{changes of}} pine forests were studied in outwash areas characterised by {{topography}} with ridges and depressions. The spatial series of pine forests of different stand ages {{and those that}} have not experienced the impact of human activities were analyzed. Pine forests in outwash areas form two successional series depending on the different ecotopes. The following successional series occurs at the tops of ridges: boreal green moss pine forest à boreal green moss – dwarf shrub forests à boreo-nemoral pine forest with admixture of birch, oak, spruce à nemoral polydominant spruce broad-leaved forest. Another successional series is formed on gentle ridge slopes: boreal polytric pine forest à boreal bilberry-polytric pine forest à boreo-nemoral pine forest with admixture of birch, oak, spruce à nemoral polydominant spruce broad-leaved forest. We show that ecotope has the {{leading role in the}} organisation of cenoses at the early stages of succession: green moss pine forests are formed at high and relatively <b>dry</b> <b>relief</b> sites (ridges) and polytric pine forests are formed on relatively wet ridge slopes. The ecotopic mosaic is complicated by the vegetation pattern created by animals (e. g., seed hawkers) at the intermediate stages of succession. Zoochoric species appear in the community: Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Convallaria majalis, Sorbus aucuparia and Quercus robur more often take root at the top of ridges; Vaccinium myrtillus, Frangula alnus and Picea abies grow on the slopes. The mosaic created by trees is imposed on a mosaic caused by ecotopes and animals at the final stages of succession: tree-fall gaps appear in the place of old dead trees with tree undergrowth. As a result, a heterogeneous community with a number of asynchronously developing gaps is formed in place of homogeneous pine fores...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{technique}} of longitudinal V-shaped excision of the ventral pancreas for small duct chronic pancreatitis is presented and its efficacy {{in terms of}} pain relief and improvement of {{quality of life is}} evaluated. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Small duct chronic pancreatitis has been regarded as a classical indication for more or less extensive resection, in which the therapeutic success of pain <b>relief</b> is <b>offset</b> by the considerable risk of significant perioperative mortality and morbidity and the burden of substantial loss of pancreatic function. METHODS: Thirteen patients with severe pain who were diagnosed with small duct pancreatitis (defined as maximal Wirsungian ductal diameter of 2 mm) underwent longitudinal V-shaped excision of the ventral pancreas. In addition to routine pancreatic workup, a multidimensional psychometric quality-of-life questionnaire and a pain score were used. Assessment of exocrine and endocrine function included fecal chymotrypsin and the pancreolauryl test as well as oral glucose tolerance, serum concentrations of insulin, C-peptide, and hemoglobin A 1 c. The interval between symptoms and surgery ranged from 12 months to 10 years (mean, 5. 4 years). Median follow-up was 30 months (range, 12 - 48 months). RESULTS: There were no deaths. Overall morbidity was 15. 4 %. In 92 % of patients, complete relief of symptoms was obtained. Median pain score decreased by 95 %. Physical status, working ability, and emotional and social functioning scores improved by 40 %, 50 %, 67 %,, and 75 %, respectively. Global quality-of-life index increased by 67 %. Occupational rehabilitation was achieved in 69 % of patients. Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function was well preserved. CONCLUSIONS: In small duct chronic pancreatitis, longitudinal V-shaped excision of the ventral pancreas is a safe and effective alternative to resection procedures. The new technique provides pain relief and improvement of quality of life, thus offering the benefit of a resection procedure without its burden...|$|R

6000|$|Mounted on a stout pony, I enjoyed my scamper {{of sixteen}} miles over the wooded plains and undulating gravelly {{slopes of the}} Terai, {{intervening}} between {{the foot of the}} mountains and Siligoree bungalow, where I rested for an hour.

This state of the air is very curious, and has met with various attempts at explanation,* [Dr. M'Lelland ("Calcutta Journal of Natural History," [...] vol. i, p. 52), attributes the haze of the atmosphere during the north-west winds of this season, wholly to suspended earthy particles. But the haze is present even in the calmest weather, and extreme dryness is in all parts of the world usually accompanied by an obscure horizon. Captain Campbell ("Calcutta Journal of Natural History," [...] vol. ii, p. 44.) also objects to Dr. M'Clelland's theory, citing those parts of Southern India which are least likely to be visited by dust-storms, as possessing an equally hazy atmosphere; and further denies its being influenced by the hygrometric state of the atmosphere.] all unsatisfactory to me: it accompanies great heat, dryness, and elasticity of the suspended vapours, and is not affected by wind.

My little dog had run thirty miles the day before, exclusive of all the detours he had made for his own enjoyment, and he flagged so much after twenty more this day, that I had to take him on my saddle-bow, where, after licking his hot swollen feet, he fell fast asleep, in spite of the motion.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of tourism in the Adriatic region of Yugoslavia brings about, inter alia, considerable sociodemographic changes and causes {{before all the}} transfer of population from agricultural to other activities. Taking into account the economical possibilities brought about by tourism, as "well as plans {{for the development of}} shipbuilding, aluminium and other industries, the author of this article undertook an analysis of influences of such changes on agricultural production and social structure of population. At the beginning the Adriatic region was defined. It is a karst region situated between the coast line and Dinar’s mountain system. There is not much arrable land in it and the climate is rather <b>dry.</b> The <b>relief</b> and the climate of the Region caused a peculiar spatial arrangements of the population and its settlements. From old times the existence of people in this region has been depending on sea and transport between the coast and the inland. Nevertheless up to our century the population depended mostly on work in agriculture, especially on growing grape, olive, vegetable, tobacco and breeding sheep, goats and cattle. Nowdays too, peasants grow cereals quite often, but vields per hectare are very low. The annual deficit of wheat amounts up to 180, 000 tons. The author suggests to exclude cereals from agriculture in this region. Social agricultural enterprises in 1963. owned 23, 700 hectares of land or 5, 3 % of the total hectrage of arrable land in this region. The rest of land is being cultivated by private landowners. Their landestates are very small, for instance even 46, 8 % private landestates in Dalmatia and Hrvatsko Primorje are under 2 hectares. Is should be add that every landestate is divided, on the average, on 12, 6 plats each covering about 881 m 2. In such conditions socialistic agricultural enterprises and cooperatives really can not find their account in buying off such small parcels of land scattered about the stony relief. But {{they will be able to}} gain qualitative land when drainage works of many karst fields get completed. The main author’s attention is directed to the analysis of agricultural population. He explicates the following data: in 1961. 544, 000 persons were engaded in agriculture while the whole population numbered 1. 558, 000. During the period 1953. — 1961. the number of active agricultural population decreased from 315, 000 to 257, 000. In the commune Rijeka there is even only 1, 4 % of agricultural population while at the same time in the hinterland this percentage rise up to 70. On the Adriatic islands there is about 55 % of agricultural population on the average. As a matter of fact 33, 4 % of the total population in Adriatic region earns their living in agriculture, 24 % only in agriculture and 42, 6 % only in nonagricultural activities. Today 26, 9 % of labour power in agriculture is employed in industry, tourism and other nonfarm activities. In other words nonagriculturists (industrial and other workers, clarks and tradesmen) run 1 / 4 of the total number of privately owned landestates. Traditionally the Adriatic region was known as an emigratory region. At the beginning of this century quite a lot of people emigrated to both American continents and to many European countries too. Today these three migratory directions are significant: from the Adriatic region to the inland of Yugoslavia, from villages to towns within the Region itself and to foreign countries. From 1953. till 1961. population of Adriatic towns increased for 21, 4 % while population of Adriatic villages in the same period recorded the population growth of only 0, 6 %. As a matter of fact 104, 000 persons had left 3, 668 villages or 10 % of the present number of population in all Adriatic villages. Every day about 70, 000 persons travel to work from villages to towns and industrial centers. About 50 % of present rural inhabitants are not engaged in agriculture any more. Particularly interesting are the demographic processes on Adriatic islands. They had in 1961. only 8, 8 % more population then in 1857. Today on the largest Adriatic island Krk there is 24 % persons in the age over 60. As the main reason for depopulation tendencies on Adriatic islands, the author pointed out the agrarian crises which has started in 1910. At the end the author proposes some measures for the betterment and improvement of the situation on Adriatic islands...|$|R
