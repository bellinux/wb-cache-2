Materials used for experiments consist of samples brought over from Sewage Disposal Plant at Sunamachi, Tokyo, where night-soil removed from households are collected. The following results were obtained : 1. <b>Air</b> <b>supply</b> of 1. 4 to 1. 6 1 /mim at 25 ℃ to 30 ℃ produced a supernatant fluid of low concentration and good quality in a short time after <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> had been cut. 2.

40|$|A well-functioning {{ventilation}} system is significant in achieving a healthy indoor environment. The <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rate {{is one of}} the important factors in reducing the pollutant levels indoors. A study of the indoor environment has been made in new built apartments with modern energy-efficient mechanical supply and exhaust {{ventilation system}}s. Several parameters have been measured including the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates, and the performance of the ventilation system. Interviews with the residents have also been made. This paper focuses on the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates with the objective of examining these. The results show that the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates are not fulfilling the building regulations in several apartments. Several reasons for the insufficient <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates have been identified; not only has the performance of the ventilation system itself but also the resident/user interaction with the ventilation system negatively impacted on the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates. The experience of the residents including perception of noise has also lead to reduced <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates. The results illustrate the importance of including the interaction of the residents.

40|$|Abstract: By using {{numerical}} simulation method,the {{three-dimensional flow field}} of <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder using for displacement ventilation in industrial plant is analyzed. The internal structure, effective wind sent area and the shape of wind outlet small hole which affected the air outlet wind speed of <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder are researched. While compared with the simulated and measured result of the outlet velocity of the wind outlet small hole, the best feature parameters of wind speed in <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder has been gained. The result shows that: by changing the internal structure and decreasing the effective <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> area of the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder, the wind speed from the air-outlet on the small hole can be more reasonably distributed; although by increasing the effective <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> area and changing the shape of outlet hole on <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder will make the air outlet be more effectively distributed, its value is unreasonable. Foreword In the 1970 s, as an emerging technology, the displacement ventilation was used in industrial workshop in order to solve the ventilation problem in the industrial plants. In recent years, displacement ventilation has been vigorously promoted in the industrial and civil buildings due to its good ventilation performance.
