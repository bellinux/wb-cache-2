Metallurgy {{industry}} {{is an important}} part of national economy, thereinto, steel enterprise is the most important part, and it has become a significant symbol of comprehensive national strength. According to the analysis, in the Large and medium-sized Steel enterprise the effect of energy saving and emission reduction is obvious, But the process equipment behind of small and medium-sized enterprises, high energy consumption and discharge many pollutants. In order to reach require, <b>Electrical</b> <b>precipitator</b> has been widely used. In this text, we make comprehensive narrative for metallurgy industry characteristics of flue gas, and analyze the affect of flue gas to <b>electrical</b> <b>precipitator,</b> finally, we put forward some constructive measures and suggests...|$|E
40|$|Ionic wind {{occurs in}} the corona {{discharging}} field because {{of the flow of}} many ions. It acts in complicated manner in the collecting field of the <b>electrical</b> <b>precipitator.</b> The purpose of the experiment is to find the influences of the ionic wind on the collecting forces in the corona discharging field of the <b>electrical</b> <b>precipitator.</b> The first step of sudies is to investigate the natures of the ionic wind in the corona discharging field in atmospheric air. Generally the negative corona is used in the electrical precipitation, therefore in this experiment only the negative corona is used. The 1 -needle, the 7 -needles or the cylinder electrode are used as the dischargnig electrode, and the wire net or the plate as the collecting electrode. The experimental considerations are on the comparison between the distribution of ionic wind velocity and that of corona current density, and the relation between ionic wind velocity and applied voltage. The results of experiments show the behavior of the ionic wind qualitatively well, and are useful to consider its effect on the collecting forces...|$|E

By {{using the}} finite element {{analysis}} software ANSYS, this article presented the structure stress and displacement of a type of electrical dust precipitator {{on a variety of}} loads effect, after the main steel structures of the model was built according to the frontal solution method, optimization design of model's main steel structures had been done. The modeling and the computational Method has been proved the reasonableness of precision, and can be further used for structure analysis and so it has reference value for optimization design of other <b>electrical</b> <b>precipitator</b> steel structures...|$|E
40|$|It is commonplace {{these days}} to hear that some <b>electrical</b> <b>precipitators</b> are {{operated}} with unsatisfactory states. The minor enterprisers {{say that it is}} difficult to estabrish the precipitator easily for its high initial cost. The plan of an electric precipitator equipment is to be discussed safficientry. As result on the experiments the author suggests author's point of view for the relation between collecting phenomena in various industry equipment and the economical cost of an electric precipitator. 1) The collection efficiency η_w relating mass collected and η_s relating covering power of the exhaust smoke of an electric precipitator should be handled with different meaning as for fume or mist nature and cleaning condition. 2) At an electric precipitator design the higher all day efficiency can be given with little increase in equipment cost. 3) The gas cleaning cost (Y/Q) may be a little higher for minor enterprises, but minor enterprisers must study the utilization of collected substances for economical plant operation. Where, Y : Economical cost for E. P. installation and running Q : Gross gas volume to be handle...|$|R
40|$|The {{discharging}} electrode for an electrostatic precipitator is vibrated by various forces. They are the external {{force and the}} internal forces. The former {{is due to the}} shock with hammer-blowing to remove the adhering dust on the {{discharging electrode}}, and the latter the action of gas flow or the electrical forces. The spark over which causes by the large vibration of the discharging electrode decreases the collection efficiency of the <b>electrical</b> <b>precipitator,</b> and so it is desirable to prevent the vibratian of the discharging electrode. The vibration of the discharging electrode for the cylindertype electrostatic precipitator (dia. 10. 5 cm, length 200 cm) was tested in atmospheric air. The vibrational characteristics and the brief analysis of the electrical forces which act on the discharging electrode were considered. The experimental results are summarized as follows. 1) The vibrational amplitude increases with rising applied voltage and diminishing tention of the discharging electrode. 2) The vibrational frequency of the discharging electrode corresponds to the calculated natural frequency of it. 3) The vibrational mode varies according to change of the discharging condition. 4) In the analysis of the electrical forces, six kinds of them are considered, but each force is not treated of its quantity...|$|E
40|$|A {{negative}} corona discharging {{field was}} constructed {{with a positive}} plate-electrode and a negative multi needle-electrode and a model partiele was suspended in this field. Within the sufficient field strength for the model particle to attach on the plate-electrode, the low conductivity model particle sticked on these and the high conductivity model particle was attracted there keeping some gap of spark discharge with slight vibration. The same behavior as for the high ccnductivity model particle was observed when the plate-electrode surface was covered with thin water film. The amplitude and period of the discharge current waveforms through the probe electrode when a glass ball was suspended within the corona discharging field were little than that for a steel ball. At later case, the discharge gap between the plate-electrode and a steel ball are investigated by the spark discharge. The authors called the force which gave the discharge gap as ”discharge pressure”. It is expected that the discharge pressure may come to appear at the field strength about 6 kv/cm the steel ball of which diameter is larger than 367 μ, and that it may come to appear {{as far as the}} steel ball of larger diameter within less field strength. Those experimental results are interested in studying the phenomena of difficulty for <b>electrical</b> <b>precipitator</b> of coagulated high conductivity particle...|$|E
40|$|The {{finite element}} method is now well {{established}} among engineers as being an extremely useful tool {{in the analysis of}} problems with complicated boundary conditions. One aim of this thesis has been to produce a set of computer algorithms capable of efficiently analysing complex three dimensional structures. This set of algorithms has been designed to permit much versatility. Provisions {{such as the use of}} only those parts of the system which are relevant to a given analysis and the facility to extend the system by the addition of new elements are incorporate. Five element types have been programmed, these are, prismatic members, rectangular plates, triangular plates and curved plates. The 'in and out of plane' stiffness matrices for a curved plate element are derived using the finite element technique. The performance of this type of element is compared with two other theoretical solutions as well as with a set of independent experimental observations. Additional experimental work was then carried out by the author to further evaluate the acceptability of this element. Finally the analysis of two large civil engineering structures, the shell of an <b>electrical</b> <b>precipitator</b> and a concrete bridge, are presented to investigate the performance of the algorithms. Comparisons are made between the computer time, core store requirements and the accuracy of the analysis, for the proposed system and those of another program...|$|E
