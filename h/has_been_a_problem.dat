5|$|Erosion <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{along the}} Scarborough Bluffs. Properties {{located near the}} brink have been abandoned, and houses condemned, as the brink wears {{back away from the}} lake. Since the 1980s, large areas of beach {{at the base of the}} Bluffs have been {{reinforced}} with limestone breakwaters and construction rubble infilling.|$|E
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a circle changeup. The slider is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for him, though, and his fastball is easy to hit when thrown over the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
5|$|The {{association}} {{is a registered}} charity and though fundraising <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> the centre is the sole beneficiary of the 'Lee Adamson Memorial Fund'; a fundraising trust set up when Adamson, a Deckham resident and volunteer at the centre, died of meningitis in 1998. By 2011, the fund had raised around £15,000 and a plaque was installed in his honour at the centre.|$|E

50|$|Afterwards, Murray said {{making the}} weight limit <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> His {{comments}} came just days after, Frankie Gavin, Britain's world lightweight champion, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> pulled out after officials feared for his health if he carried {{on trying to}} beat the scales.|$|R
50|$|Despite these limits, Korea had {{extensive}} trade with Mongolia, Northern Asia, China, and Japan. However, at times, trade with Japan {{was limited to}} missions appointed by the king {{in order to prevent}} piracy and maintain orderly trade, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> even in the Goryeo period.|$|R
5|$|From the 1980s {{the company}} has experimented with Broadway shows, {{including}} Pacific Overtures (1987), Street Scene (1898), On the Town (2005), Kismet (2007), and Candide (2008). In many of ENO's lighter shows, {{the size of the}} Coliseum <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> both in putting across pieces written for much more intimate theatres and in selling enough tickets. In 2015 a new business plan for ENO included making money from a West End musical partnership with the impresarios Michael Grade and Michael Linnit.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the Puerto Rican amazon {{include the}} red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), the broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus). The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, specially designed deep nests {{were prepared for}} the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders. Introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera), the related Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), black rats (Rattus rattus) and Indian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{throws a}} fastball that travels about ninety-one mph for his main pitch, though it {{sometimes}} {{can go up}} to ninety-five mph. His other pitches (slurve and change-up) travel in the low eighties. Wildness <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for Sánchez; he has walked 10% – 15% of major-league batters faced each season. However, he also strikes {{out a lot of}} batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all qualifying MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is among the best in the majors.|$|E
50|$|Faulty {{capacitors}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> since capacitors' initial development, but {{the first}} flawed capacitors linked to Taiwanese raw material problems were reported by the specialist magazine Passive Component Industry in September 2002. Shortly thereafter, two mainstream electronics journals reported the discovery of widespread prematurely failing capacitors, from Taiwanese manufacturers, in motherboards.|$|R
2500|$|Lack {{of access}} to markets, limited export capacity, and {{oversupply}} in the US market <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for oil sands producers in recent years. They have caused lower prices to Canadian oil sands producers and reduced royalty and tax revenues to Canadian governments. The pipeline companies have moved forward {{with a number of}} solutions to the transportation problems: ...|$|R
5|$|Bautista throws three pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. His fastball {{travels in}} the high 90mph range. His curve can break down sharply, and he learned the changeup from Pedro Martínez. Wildness <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for Bautista {{throughout}} his career. He has trouble controlling his fastball and walks {{a great deal of}} hitters, which has often contributed to his departure from teams.|$|R
5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.|$|E
25|$|China banned {{expanded}} polystyrene takeout/takeaway containers and tableware around 1999. However, compliance <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> and, in 2013, the Chinese plastics industry is actively lobbying {{to get the}} ban repealed.|$|E
25|$|In the post-independence era, {{overcrowding}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> {{at least}} in British and aid organisations' eyes. In 1988, an announcement was made that 4,700 residents of the main island group would be resettled onto less-populated islands.|$|E
50|$|Drought <b>has</b> always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for grape growers, though today drip {{irrigation}} is permitted by the Regulatory Council of the DO.|$|R
50|$|Any one {{of these}} would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> surmountable <b>problem,</b> but {{combined}} they brought about the swift decline of the company.|$|R
25|$|Annual baiting {{programs}} are conducted {{to reduce the}} number of dingoes and foxes. Uncontrolled domestic dogs also regularly menace and kill sheep. Occasionally wedge-tailed eagles will kill young sheep up to and including hogget size sheep. In contrast, New Zealand has no remaining large carnivores. The only wild animal known to attack sheep in New Zealand is the rare, unusual kea parrot endemic to the country's South Island. Also, feral dogs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2016, for {{the first}} time in the whole history of the Belarusian ruble, coins were {{introduced}} due to the redenomination. Previously, Belarus was one of the few countries in the world never to have issued coins; this is largely due to the rampant inflation which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> since independence.|$|E
25|$|Blowing sand <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for its solar panels, so Masdar {{has been}} working with other {{companies}} to engineer surfaces with pores smaller than sand particles to stop them from sticking on the panels. Scientists at the Masdar Institute are also working on coatings that repel sand and bacteria for use on solar panels and in other applications.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, Comcast {{was able}} to meet an {{agreement}} with the NFL Network, in which the NFL Network agreed to lower its asking price per subscriber. The higher asking price <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with being carried with other cable networks. Roger Goodell was looking at resolving differences with other cable providers, to include Charter Communications, to allow carriage of this channel.|$|E
50|$|Funding <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{continuing}} <b>problem.</b> Since there <b>is</b> not <b>an</b> adequate {{management plan}} for the reserve, {{it continues to be}} so.|$|R
25|$|Vandalism <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> Crosses of Sacrifice <b>have</b> <b>been</b> smashed or {{the bronze}} swords stolen, with the {{vandalism}} being particularly {{bad in the}} 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Letter to Andrew Inglis Clark, Tasmania from Joseph G. Witton, Melbourne, Victoria thanking A I Clark {{specifically}} for paying {{the money to}} get his family at home out of financial difficulty. Money matters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> lately and Dave <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> of any help. He requests that the repayment be held over. alter Gill's wife presented him with <b>a</b> baby daughter, <b>was</b> hurt that Clark had not seen him during his recent visits. C 4 /C 370...|$|R
25|$|China's {{limited space}} for farming <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{throughout}} its history, leading to chronic food shortage and famine. While the production efficiency of farmland has grown over time, efforts to expand {{to the west}} and the north have met with limited success, as such land is generally colder and drier than traditional farmlands to the east. Since the 1950s, farm space has also been pressured by the increasing land needs of industry and cities.|$|E
25|$|Government {{corruption}} in Madagascar <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{for more than}} a decade. Transparency International has rated the country between a 1.7 and a 3.4 on its 10-point Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), with a score less than 3.0 indicating rampant corruption. With the political disturbance in 2009, Madagascar fell from a 3.4 to a 3.0, and suffered a slide in rank from 85 out of 180 countries to a rank of 99.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the conflict, ethnic identity is now of much greater social importance in Bosnia than it was prior to 1992. From the 1960s until the beginning of the war, nearly twelve percent of marriages were mixed (between members of different communities), and young citizens would often refer to themselves as Bosnians rather than identifying their ethnicity. After the conflict it has been effectively mandatory to be identified as either Bosniak, Serb or Croat and this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the children of rape victims as they come of age.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|R
50|$|At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2009, {{the first}} {{prototype}} devices from LG and other manufacturers were demonstrated, including receivers for cars from Kenwood, Visteon and Delphi. It {{was announced that}} 63 stations in 22 markets would debut the service in 2009. Gannett Broadcasting president David Lougee pointed out {{that many of those}} attending the inauguration of Barack Obama would likely hear him but not see him; had the new technology been in place, this would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|R
25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to ozone cracking. Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked fuel lines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|R
25|$|Ever {{since the}} palace {{was built in}} the 18th century, the {{weathering}} of the sandstone <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> and this has accelerated since the oil paint was removed from the stone during the renovation in the 1890s. In the spring of 2008, the Property Board started a comprehensive study on order to make a long term plan for maintenance of the palace during the next 50 years. The study showed that the Gotlandic sandstone was in worse condition than expected. A number of stones were cracked and loose.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the craft}} has been waning {{and may be}} in danger of extinction. On Comonfort Street in Metepec {{there are dozens of}} pottery {{workshops}} but only two of these remain making the trees. One major reason for this is cheap imitations, mostly imported from Asia. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for many Mexican crafts, with the federal government stepping in to develop trademarks and “denomination of origin” for traditional crafts. In 2009, the Tree of Life was trademarked for artisans from Metepec and neighboring Calimaya, befitting the approximately 300 families that dedicate themselves to making them. In addition to authenticity, there are plans to use the trademark to promote the product internationally.|$|E
25|$|The city {{is still}} the center of Zapotec culture in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and is the second largest in the region. The city {{is known for its}} women and their {{traditional}} dress, which was adopted by Frida Kahlo. Tehuantepec has a reputation for being a “matriarchal society.” Women do dominate the local markets and are known to taunt men. However, political power {{is still the}} domain of men. The city experienced a short economic boom in the early 20th century related to a rail line that was built linking the two oceans, but it was soon eclipsed by the Panama Canal. There have been plans to resurrect the line linking the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean but financing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
50|$|Homelessness, historically, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> major <b>problem</b> in {{the city}} and remains <b>a</b> growing <b>problem</b> in modern times. The {{homeless}} population is estimated to be 13,500 with 6,500 living on the streets.|$|R
25|$|Large {{countries}} like Argentina called for reforms {{to lessen the}} disparity of wealth {{between the rich and}} the poor, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> long <b>problem</b> in Latin America that stunted economic growth.|$|R
