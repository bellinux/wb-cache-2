5|$|In 2004, Kon {{released}} the 13-episode television series Paranoia Agent, in which Kon revisits {{the theme of}} the blending of imagination and reality, as well as working in additional social themes. The series was created from an abundance of unused ideas for stories and arrangements that Kon felt were good but did not fit <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his projects.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 allows {{players to}} start in a Band Lobby from where they can then launch <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the game's modes, add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game modes without having to leave the party or lobby, a {{significant}} change in response to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E

He {{also serves as a}} sub-boss of the game, appearing before Kintaro in the single player mode. As in the first game, he is able to morph <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the playable characters, retaining their moves (in some versions only the character against whom he is currently fighting).|$|E

5|$|The Canadian monarch, {{seen as the}} fount of honour, is at {{the apex}} of the Order of Canada as its Sovereign, {{followed}} by the governor general, who serves as the fellowship's Chancellor. Thereafter follow three grades, which are, in order of precedence: Companion, Officer, and Member, each having accordant post-nominal letters that members are entitled to use. Each incumbent governor general is also installed as the Principal Companion for the duration of his or her time in the viceregal post and continues as an extraordinary Companion thereafter. Additionally, any governor general, viceregal consort, former governor general, former viceregal consort, or member of the Canadian Royal Family may be appointed as an extraordinary Companion, Officer, or Member. Promotions in grade are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment, and a maximum of five honorary appointments <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the three grades may be made by the governor general each year. , there have been 21 honorary appointments.|$|E
5|$|The game {{provides}} {{several options}} for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the security systems and turrets. The player can hack <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to Pipe Mania where the player must connect two points {{on opposite sides}} of a grid with a limited set of piping within a fixed amount of time, with failure to complete in time costing health and potentially sounding alarms. Early in the game, the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain knowledge about the individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.|$|E
