5|$|In recent decades, <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> other Islamic {{movements}} {{sought to}} increase {{the use of the}} hijab ("headscarf") among Gazan women, especially urban and educated women, and the hijab styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity.|$|E
5|$|Willis' {{name was}} in an {{advertisement}} in the Los Angeles Times on August 17, 2006, that condemned <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.|$|E
5|$|During {{factional}} clashes {{across the}} Gaza Strip in June 2007 which ended with Hamas gaining control over that territory, {{at least four}} paramilitaries from <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> Fatah were killed in Deir al-Balah. On 2 January 2009, Deir al-Balah was shelled by the Israeli Army {{as part of its}} month-long offensive Operation Cast Lead.|$|E

5000|$|According to the Israeli {{scholars}} Tomer Mozes and Gabriel Weimann, the Palestine Information Center is {{the leading}} gateway site in Hamas' online propaganda network of twenty websites. They argue that the PIC's content and news coverage is primarily oriented towards <b>Hamas's</b> ideology <b>and</b> history.|$|R
5000|$|Iran has {{increasingly}} encouraged and supported—with money, training, and weapons—terrorist {{groups such as}} Hizballah, <b>HAMAS,</b> the PIJ, <b>and</b> Ahmed Jibril's PFLP-GC.|$|R
5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations was perhaps tested {{by the rise of}} the <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel. These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties. In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{bas-relief}} inscriptions of Jewish {{religious symbols}} were allegedly chiseled away intentionally at some stage between 1987 and 1993. During the Battle of Gaza between the Palestinian organizations of <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> Fatah, the mosque's pro-Hamas imam Mohammed al-Rafati {{was shot dead}} by Fatah gunmen on June 12, 2007, {{in retaliation for the}} killing of an official of Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard by Hamas earlier that day. The mosque is still active and serves as an emotional and physical support base for Gaza's residents and a focal point of Palestinian pride.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was {{throwing}} stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating {{large sums of money}} in house-to-house raids. As the Intifada came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E
5000|$|More in general, in 2014 al-Arouri was {{in charge}} of several Hamas {{military}} cells both in the West Bank and in Jordan. The US Treasury claimed that by then, he had [...] "facilitated the transfer {{of hundreds of thousands of}} dollars to Hamas, including to the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, for the purchase of arms and storage facilities for weapons." [...] Al-Arouri succeeded in establishing solid ties between the West bank cells <b>and</b> <b>Hamas’s</b> U.S.-based financiers. In this connection, terror finance expert Matthew Levitt claimed that al-Arouri [...] "played a critical intermediary role between otherwise compartmented elements of <b>Hamas’s</b> external leadership <b>and</b> on-the-ground operatives." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2009, The United States Institute of Peace {{published}} a controversial study co-authored by Abu Irshaid and Paul Scham called “Hamas: Ideological Rigidity and Political Flexibility”. The {{study suggests that}} Hamas has undergone political and ideological shifts over time that {{make it possible for}} it to coexist with Israel without violence. The report analyzes <b>Hamas’s</b> statements <b>and</b> actions from an Islamic point of view, using the framework of Sharia law, on which Hamas is based, to define which actions it can and cannot take.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Hamas, a Salafist movement {{began to appear}} about 2005 in Gaza, characterized by [...] "a strict lifestyle based on that of the earliest followers of Islam". , there {{are estimated to be}} only [...] "hundreds or perhaps a few thousand" [...] Salafists in Gaza. However, the failure of Hamas to lift the Israeli blockade of Gaza despite thousands of casualties and much destruction during 2008-9 and 2014 wars has weakened <b>Hamas's</b> support <b>and</b> led some in Hamas {{to be concerned about the}} possibility of defections to the Salafist [...] "Islamic State".|$|R
5|$|The report, {{released}} on 15 September 2009, concluded {{that both sides}} had committed violations {{of the laws of}} war. It stated that Israel had used disproportionate force, targeted Palestinian civilians, used them as human shields and destroyed civilian infrastructure. <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> other armed Palestinian groups were found to have deliberately targeted Israeli civilians and sought to spread terror in southern Israel by mounting indiscriminate rocket attacks. The report's conclusions were endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{two primary}} {{political}} parties in the municipal council are <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> Fatah. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining {{the majority of the}} municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the Palestinian People's Party and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E
25|$|Rantisi was <b>Hamas's</b> {{political}} leader <b>and</b> spokesman in the Gaza Strip following the Israeli killing of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in March 2004. Rantisi opposed compromise with Israel {{and called for}} the creation of a Palestinian state (including the whole of the State of Israel) through military action against the Jewish state.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{according}} to the The Jerusalem Post, Rayan became an important leader in Hamas, in particular a spiritual leader of <b>Hamas's</b> military wing, <b>and</b> he regularly went on patrol with Hamas militia after delivering lectures at the Islamic University. He arguably became Hamas's leading clerical authority after an Israeli airstrike killed Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 2004.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{years of}} {{uprising}} and Israeli military actions, siege of West Bank cities and President Arafat's de facto house arrest, {{it was hard}} to imagine the situation getting worse for Palestinians. It has. On all fronts [...] Palestinian/Palestinian, Palestinian/Israeli and Palestinian/ international [...] prevailing dynamics are leading to a dangerous breakdown. Subjected to the cumulative effects of a military occupation in its 40 th year and now what is effectively an international sanctions regime, the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority (PA) government cannot pay salaries or deliver basic services. Diplomacy is frozen, with scant prospect of thaw [...] and none at all of breakthrough. <b>And</b> <b>Hamas's</b> electoral victory <b>and</b> the reactions it provoked among Fatah loyalists have intensified chaos and brought the nation near civil war. There is an urgent need for all relevant players to pragmatically reassess their positions. This report is also available in Arabic at [URL]...|$|R
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. He made this decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO. Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization's rival <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> Islamic Jihad {{denied any}} {{link with the}} attacks. An {{anonymous}} Jordanian political source assessed that the attack was perpetrated by Tawhid al-Jihad, a radical Muslim group which opposes <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> collaborates with Sinai Bedouin who {{are at odds with}} the Egyptian authorities.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, which began with the Hezbollah terror group's attack across the {{international}} border, Harper defended publicly Israel's [...] "right to defend itself," [...] and described the Israeli response as [...] "measured". Harper stated that Hezbollah <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> release of Israeli prisoners (Hezbollah held the bodies of two dead Israeli soldiers who were killed in the initial attack) would {{bring an end to the}} conflict.|$|R
50|$|During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, Sawant unsuccessfully {{urged the}} Seattle City Council to condemn both Israel's attacks on Gaza <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> attacks on Israel, {{and called on}} President Obama and Congress to {{denounce}} the Israeli blockade of Gaza and to cut off all military assistance to Israel. Sawant's call to condemn Israel's actions prompted a response from Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer, calling for Sawant to retract the statement.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the background to}} the Palestinian elections and highlights {{the fact that they}} are the first democratic elections since 1996. It {{discusses the}} reasons for <b>Hamas's</b> participation <b>and</b> the problems it faced. It also examines what issues the electoral candidates needed to touch on in order to win the election. The paper highlights the fact that Fatah's days are over because of widespread corruption. It touches on how Hamas now needs to deal with the international community and how it can compromise with Israel. The paper emphasises that Hamas is the people's choice and that, because it has many obstacles ahead of it, the international community needs to allow it time and to monitor its progress, watching how it deals with being in the real political realm. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> Fatah, who {{controlled}} Gaza {{before the last}} election, have accepted an invitation from Egypt to hold separate talks in Cairo on the border crisis. All sides hoped to create a plan to keep the border between Egypt and Gaza open. A Hamas delegation also met with Saudi Prince Saud al-Faisal who has acted as a mediator between <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> Fatah.|$|E

50|$|After the {{election}} of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, Rabbi Froman stepped up his efforts to organize meetings between Israeli and Palestinian religious leaders. He met and conducted negotiations with current Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, Sheikh Mahmoud Abu Tir, with the goal of drafting a ceasefire agreement that will end the killings in Gaza and the West Bank and lift the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip.|$|R
5000|$|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu {{stated that}} Hamas killed the teenagers. But {{opinions}} were divided within Israel's security services {{as to whether}} or not the two suspects had direct ties to Hamas. On 26 June, the Israel Security Agency identified two Hamas members as key suspects in the kidnapping, whom Palestinian police noted, had gone missing since the night of the kidnapping. High-ranking members of Hamas denied that the group had any involvement or foreknowledge of the incident. The two named suspects hail from the Qawasameh clan, notorious for consistently acting against <b>Hamas's</b> policies <b>and</b> its attempts to reach an entente [...] with Israel. Hamas political chief Khaled Meshal said he could neither confirm nor deny the kidnapping of the three Israelis, and he congratulated the abductors, because [...] "our prisoners must be freed from the prisons of the occupation".|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Hamas {{proposed}} government programme, which {{stated that}} [...] "the question of recognizing Israel {{is not the}} jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people." [...] However many remain sceptical of <b>Hamas's</b> new stance, <b>and</b> {{view it as a}} ploy to hide its true agenda, [...] "but it is equally true that the “new” discourse of diluted religious content—to say nothing of the movement’s increasing pragmatism and flexibility in the political domain—reflects genuine and cumulative changes within Hamas." ...|$|R

25|$|A fragile six-month truce between <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> Israel expired on December 19, 2008. <b>Hamas</b> <b>and</b> Israel {{could not}} agree on {{conditions}} to extend the truce. Hamas blamed Israel for not lifting the Gaza Strip blockade, and for an Israeli raid on a purported tunnel, crossing the border into the Gaza Strip from Israel on November 4, which it held constituted a serious breach of the truce. Israel accuses Hamas of violating the truce citing the frequent rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli cities.|$|E
50|$|In August 2006, Sieradski and two fellow yeshiva {{students}} {{organized a}} benefit concert in Jerusalem attended by 80 people, that {{raised more than}} NIS4,500 or around $1,000, for Israeli and Lebanese victims of that summer's war between Israel and Hezbollah. In January 2009, Sieradski led a similar effort to express empathy for victims {{on both sides of}} the Arab-Israeli conflict. Responding to the renewed violence in Gaza, he organized a demonstration in New York City, attended by fewer than 50 people, condemning both Israel's <b>and</b> <b>Hamas's</b> attacks on civilians.|$|R
5000|$|Alternately, {{another source}} found {{that at least}} in one country (Lebanon from 1983-1999) it was Islamists who {{influenced}} secular nationalists—their use of suicide attack spreading to the secular groups. Five Lebanese groups [...] "espousing a non-religious nationalist ideology" [...] followed the lead of Islamist groups in attacking by suicide, [...] "impressed by the effectiveness of Hezbollah's attacks in precipitating {{the withdrawal of the}} 'foreigners' from Lebanon". (In Israel suicide attacks by Islamist Islamic Jihad <b>and</b> <b>HAMAS</b> also preceded those of the secular PFLP and the Al-Fatah-linked Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Abu Shanab {{represented}} the <b>Hamas’s</b> more moderate <b>and</b> pragmatic side, {{although he was}} subject to Yassin’s leadership and committed to Hamas ideology. Unlike Yassin, he supported a long-term ceasefire with Israel and a two-state solution. On the other hand, he argued that group decision is better than individual decision, even though the individual is right. Although he did not advocated suicide bombing attacks, he stated {{that it was a}} primitive weapon and added [...] "But, it’s all we have and it’s less harmful than F-16s loaded with tons of explosives." ...|$|R
