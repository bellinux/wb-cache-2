A framework rooted on the phenomenon of crack propagation in rock particles induced by stress corrosion mechanisms is adopted to explain macroscopic observations. A model of crack propagation in loaded disc-shaped particles has been developed in order to explain the nature of particle breakage and its relationshipwith time, macroscopic stress and total suction. Experimental observations such as the existence of threshold stresses that mark the onset of delayed deformations are explained by the model.

Based on the classic Burger-MC rheological model, a Burger-Deterioration rheological model is proposed in this paper and is implemented in the numerical codes FLAC 3 D. A deterioration threshold and two deterioration ratios are introduced in this model to consider the time-dependent strength deterioration aspect of the rock mass. The proposed model is applied to an engineering instance (Ureshino Tunnel Line I, Nagasaki, Japan) to account for the <b>delayed</b> <b>deformations</b> that occurred after its completion since Nov. 1992. The delayed crown settlement and invert upheaval computed from simulations are featured by an exponential characteristic and a stair-typed characteristic, respectively, which agree well with the in-site monitoring data qualitatively.

40|$|The Petroleum Safety Authority of Norway (PSA) has now {{acknowledged}} {{the use of}} shale as an annular barrier for permanent plug and abandonment (PP&A) operations in the oil industry. Shale can exhibit a natural self-sealing effect; a result from <b>delayed</b> <b>deformation</b> of the rock. It is believed that creep in combination with consolidation plays important roles in the process when shale closes in and forms a tight barrier around a well. For using shale as a permanent annular barrier {{it is important to}} comprehend how these time-dependent mechanisms are affected by externally induced parameters, like stress, temperature and chemical alterations of the pore fluid. The purpose of this master thesis is to investigate creep characteristics and consolidation effects in Pierre shale. Two literature studies have been completed and several laboratory experiments have been carried out on small size core plugs drilled normal to the bedding plane. Axial strain-time curves have been obtained by performing uniaxial compression tests with step loading at a temperature around 30 oC. The main objectives have been to identify how the creep and consolidation processes are affected by different stress levels and variations in the pore fluid pH. Eventually, the laboratory work resulted in four successful creep experiments. The obtained data showed that Pierre shale exhibits considerable time-dependent deformation in response to applied stress. Changing the stress conditions affected the amount of deformation in periods with constant stress and it appeared like the shale demonstrated different creep behavior before and after a certain test dependent stress level. It was also seen that the temperature variation increased with extended test time for the conducted experiments and the experimental results implied that p-wave velocities are related to strain as well as stress. In addition, the creep tests indicated a correlation between p-wave velocities and temperature. Finally, {{it was found that the}} pH value of the pore fluid had an impact on consolidation and creep properties. A lower pH value reduced the overall stiffness and strength of the samples, resulting in more consolidation. More creep deformation and increased creep rates were seen compared to a near-neutral pH environment...|$|E

The problem, governed {{by a set of}} sixth-order integrodifferential equations, is solved in a general way recurring to a numerical algorithm carried out by the writers. A significant case study is finally worked out, allowing us to point out the most important prerequisites of the deferred behavior of composite steel-concrete curved bridges, in particular the interaction between the different components of internal actions due both to the curved geometry of the beam and to the <b>delayed</b> <b>deformations</b> of the concrete slab induced by creep...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{three-dimensional}} drop deformation is {{studied in}} dilute emulsions for large capillary numbers, corresponding to strong-flow or low-interfacial-tension conditions. Steady, planar linear flows are considered, {{described by the}} dimensionless vorticity orthogonal to the plane of flow. For drop-to-matrix viscosity ratios less than 1, drops widen along the vorticity direction due to the compressional component of the imposed flow. The drops are strongly elongated by the flow, and thus assume flat lamellar configurations, leading to remarkable interfacial area generation. We analyze the limit of capillary number infinite first, and present analytic results demonstrating {{that in this case}} drop deformation is described by a universal function of the viscosity ratio, independent of the vorticity. Rigid-body rotation merely affects the time-evolution, i. e., with increasing vorticity, drops are more rotated away from the extensional direction of the flow thereby <b>delaying</b> <b>deformation.</b> We provide an exact solution that describes drop deformation far from the initial conditions.

40|$|The {{impressive}} {{scope of}} using shale {{as a permanent}} well barrier for plug and abandonment (P&A) operations has lately gained much attention in the petroleum industry. Shale is observed to have a natural self-sealing effect {{as a result of}} <b>delayed</b> <b>deformation</b> of the rock. This effect is most likely related to creep. Creep tests in the laboratory are normally done on standard core plugs, but these tests are very time-consuming due to ion and temperature diffusion. This thesis will therefore use small mm-size samples to study the creep properties in shale, utilizing a technology developed by SINTEF Petroleum Research. As the use of small samples involves pure shear failure, the effect of pore pressure is minimized. The objective of this Master s thesis is to investigate the applicability of small scale tests of creep in Pierre shale, through a study on how chemical properties of the pore fluid affect the creep process, primarily pH and chemical activity. The experiments are performed with a shale puncher tool on 3 mm samples, saturated with either marcol oil, brine or hydrochloric acid. The testing procedure involves applying an axial force on the puncher tool, preferably in displacement control, while measuring the axial displacement and force. Creep experiments are conducted in order to study the creep development under constant load, while strain-rate tests are run with various rates of deformation to examine the resulting effect. The P-wave velocity of the samples is also measured through continuous wave technique (CWT) in order to quantify the sample heterogeneity. The proposed study revealed that Pierre shale undergoes an extensive time-dependent deformation in response to applied axial force. In the creep tests, it is observed that the maximum axial force required to punch the sample is dependent on the loading path and the duration of each loading. In the strain-rate tests, it is found that the weakest sample is the one with fastest displacement rate, indicating that there may exist a pore pressure effect. A time-dependent effect is also observed in response to fluid exposure; an increase in P-wave velocity for the oil-saturated samples, and conversely a decrease for the brine-rich samples. Brine is used to alter the chemical properties of the pore fluid, while a change of pH is obtained by the use of hydrochloric acid. The effect of fluid exposure is shown to be of significance, as a considerably weakening in rock strength of the samples is seen. The experimental results proved the possibility in obtaining some information about creep behaviour using the puncher technology. However, further investigation and improvements are required before any applicable conclusions can be drawn...|$|E

The final study population consisted of 61 healthy volunteers (16 - 35 yr, n = 25; 36 - 55 yr, n = 23; 56 - 75 yr, n = 13; 31 men).

Heat release, strength evolutions, autogenous and thermal strains, time of setting, elastic and <b>delayed</b> <b>deformations</b> have to be taken into account. Among these properties, the Poisson's ratio is scarcely evaluated. Measurements are tricky even on hardened materials. At early age, accurate determinations are even more delicate.

In this paper a comparison is achieved between these two techniques applied to an ordinary concrete (CEM I, w/c: 0. 5). The comparison between static and dynamic Poisson's ratio show a linear relationship. Static and dynamic Young's modulus evolutions are also compared. Classically, on hardened concrete, it is reported that dynamic values are greater than static values. It is naturally confirmed here and it is observed that the Edyn/Estat ratio decreases during the hardening process of the material.

During construction stages and service life, the interaction between internal forces can be of fundamental importance in establishing the actual degree of structural safety and, for this reason, a different philosophy for performing checks in segmental bridges is proposed in this paper, plotting N-M and M-V interaction domains for cracking, construction stages, and serviceability (elastic domains) as well as M-V interaction domains for ultimate limit states (failure domains). <b>Delayed</b> <b>deformations</b> {{as a result of}} creep are considered, as are bonded and unbonded prestressing.

The load and stress paths in the construction stages are highlighted by considering the effects of creep in concrete, whereas bending-shear interaction is evaluated in the two cases of fully bonded prestressing and partially unbonded prestressing.

30|$|The {{theory is}} in nature {{analogous}} {{to the concept of}} consolidation in soil mechanics, in which reduction in volume takes place by expulsion of water under long-term static loads. It roughly treats C–S–H as a composite filled with free liquid (i.e. not physically/chemically bonded) and solid (i.e. C–S–H solid sheets with bonded water). The external load is distributed between the bulk liquid and the solid phases, where compressed water diffuses from high to low pressure areas and, consequently, a gradual transfer of the load from the water to the solid phase takes place. Hence, the stress in the solid gradually increases causing, in turn, a gradual volumetric reduction, i.e. creep.

The shear-thinning behaviour of bubbly liquids is shown {{to be dependent on}} the previous shearing history.

These properties are also found in polymer fluids commonly used as analogue materials for lava such as gum rosin. We show that, when materials with this rheology are accelerated in channels, they may be fragmented, and when they flow through a narrowing conduit, pulsating flow can develop as a consequence of a transition from slip to non-slip conditions at the conduit wall.

Of the considerable work that has been done to remove these impediments, the two developments that stand out most are the real-time fringe display systems such as Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) and its relatives, and phase-step interferometers...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the effect of <b>deformation</b> <b>delayed</b> creep and {{shrinkage}} of the concrete on the seismic response of shear walls reinforced concrete strengthened with composite materials having a sinusoidal distribution of fibers. The lateral stiffness of shear walls RC, adhesives and composite material {{taking into account the}} phenomenon of creep and shrinkage of concrete described by the Eurocode 2, and widthwise varying fiber volume fraction of the composite plate has been determined by a finite element model. Large earthquakes recorded in Algeria (El-Asnam and Boumerdes) have been tested to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. Numerical results obtained are discussed and the factors influencing the seismic response of reinforced concrete shear walls strengthened taking account the effects of the delay mechanism creep and shrinkage of concrete are highlighted. Prospects are being studie...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{behaviors}} of polymer melt composed of short chains with ten beads between parallel plates are simulated {{by using a}} hybrid method of molecular dynamics and computational fluid dynamics. Three problems are solved: creep motion under a constant shear stress and its recovery motion after removing the stress, pressure-driven flows, and the flows in rapidly oscillating plates. In the creep/recovery problem, the <b>delayed</b> elastic <b>deformation</b> in the creep motion and evident elastic behavior in the recovery motion are demonstrated. The velocity profiles of the melt in pressure-driven flows are quite {{different from those of}} Newtonian fluid due to shear thinning. Velocity gradients of the melt become steeper near the plates and flatter at the middle between the plates as the pressure gradient increases and the temperature decreases. In the rapidly oscillating plates, the viscous boundary layer of the melt is much thinner than that of Newtonian fluid due to the shear thinning of the melt. Three different rheological regimes, i. e., the viscous fluid, visco-elastic liquid, and visco-elastic solid regimes, form over the oscillating plate according to the local Deborah numbers. The melt behaves as a viscous fluid in a region for ωτ^R≲ 1, and the crossover between the liquid-like and solid-like regime takes place around ωτ^α≃ 1 (where ω is the angular frequency of the plate and τ^R and τ^α are Rouse and α relaxation time, respectively).

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the changes in the muscle mechanics for the flexo-extension of the knee joint and extension of the ankle joint from a sample of 14 high-performance male gymnasts (mean ± SD: age 20. 71 ± 3. 12 years; body mass 67. 59 ± 6. 10 kg, height 1. 73 ± 0. 05 cm). An acrobatic training protocol in three different elastic platforms: gymnastics floor, tumbling track, and trampolining, and its recovery times were compared. The contraction time, <b>delay</b> time, <b>deformation</b> of the muscle belly were evaluated and muscular response speed was calculated by Tensiomyography. The results showed different types of propensity to fatigue according to the muscle group involved (p< 0. 05). The greater the stiffness of the surface, the greater the muscle enhancement and the shorter post-effort recovery time. In trampolining fatigue level was higher in all muscle groups (p< 0. 05) and they needed more time to retrieve the baseline. The decrease of the delay and contraction time in vastus medialis (p< 0. 001) reflected the instability experienced in performing jumps when the training surface was changed from high to low elasticity in a short period of time. Tensiomyography allowed us to estimate the different levels of activation-enhancement at which the muscle reaches levels of fatigue, which enables training on different drive surfaces to be adapted and to evaluate the optimal recovery time for preventing joint instability...|$|R
40|$|Tilt {{measurements}} {{have been}} taken in the underground gallery at Talaya Seismological Station for almost three decades, from March 1985 till 2014. Based on such data, deformation curves were constructed and analysed {{in the frame of}} elastic and viscous-elastic models of the geological medium. From estimated annual deformation rates, it became possible to reveal deformation cycles ranging from 3 to 18 years with amplitudes up to 5 arc-seconds (2 · 10 – 5). For the bedrock in the Talaya stream valley, the elastic modulus was estimated at 20 GPa. In frame of the Kelvin viscoelastic model, the apparent viscosity of the medium was estimated at 1019 Pa·sec by <b>deformation</b> <b>delay</b> curve for 1989 – 2014 epoch. Observed vertical rates were used to estimate the size of the studied area (from 0. 1 km to 6. 0 km). The values estimated in our experimental investigation are used {{in a wide range of}} geophysical studies: modelling tectonic, co-seismic and post-seismic processes. </span...|$|R
