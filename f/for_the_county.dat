5|$|Fothergill {{began his}} career as a club {{professional}} in the north east of England. He joined Somerset as one of their first professionals in 1880, but was forced to miss most of 1881 while he qualified <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county.</b> He was the most productive bowler <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county</b> in their first two years of first-class cricket, but the emergence of E. W. Bastard, and later Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods, limited his opportunities with the club. He joined the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1882, and played for the MCC until 1892, also appearing at Lord's for representative sides.|$|E

5|$|In their {{seventeen}} List A matches, 69 {{players have}} represented Cornwall. Gary Thomas has appeared the most times <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county,</b> playing in twelve matches, closely followed by Jonathan Kent, who made eleven appearances. Kent recorded {{the highest score in}} List A cricket for Cornwall, scoring 80 runs against Somerset Cricket Board in 2002. Steven Pope, who played 109 first-class matches {{in his native}} South Africa is Cornwall's leading run-scorer, having scored 294 runs in his eight appearances <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county.</b> Justin Stephens's thirteen wickets <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county</b> is the most by any player, but Charlie Shreck has the best bowling figures, having taken five wickets against Worcestershire in 2002. Gavin Edwards, who appeared for Cornwall on seven occasions, has claimed the most dismissals as wicket-keeper, taking five catches and making two stumpings. Only three non-English players have appeared for Cornwall; Jersey's Ryan Driver, Pakistan's Naeem Akhtar and South Africa's Steven Pope.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} Ivy Lane club, he married Sidney Storer, heir to a 20,000 pound fortune with Hawkins {{receiving}} an addition 10,000 pound dowry, in 1753 {{and his career}} started to quickly pick up: he bought a home on the Thames at Twickenham near Horace Walpole; he published Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler in 1760; he was appointed as a magistrate in 1761; in 1765 became Chairman of the Quarter Sessions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>County</b> of Middlesex; and wrote a A General History of the Science and Practice of Musicin 1776. He was knighted in 1772, and served as Chairman of the Quarter Session.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Fothergill played occasionally for the MCC, and three further times for Somerset, but with little merit. He made his final appearance for Somerset in 1889, against Staffordshire; he took 157 wickets <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county</b> in total, of which 57 came in first-class matches. His last {{match for the}} MCC was three years later, against Llandudno Cricket Club. In his obituary, Wisden suggest that he returned to Tyneside {{at the end of}} his professional cricket career. He died in Sunderland on 1 August 1932.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} toss, Northamptonshire captain Jim Watts opted to bowl first. Somerset scored 269 runs off their full {{allocation}} of 60 overs, during which West Indian batsman Viv Richards top-scored <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county,</b> totalling 117 runs. In their response, Northamptonshire lost early wickets, but a partnership of 113 between Geoff Cook and Allan Lamb {{kept them in}} the game. Six wickets from Joel Garner helped Somerset bowl their opponents out for 224 with 3.3 overs remaining, earning the county the first trophy in their 104-year history.|$|E
5|$|Bajana {{appeared}} {{less frequently}} for Somerset in 1913, playing ten matches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county.</b> He only scored one half-century, accruing 78 runs against Derbyshire. His batting average of 19.75 in 1913 placed him {{fourth in the}} Somerset batting averages. He did not play for Somerset in 1914, and {{the outbreak of the}} First World War suspended county cricket until 1919. During the war Bajana played, and captained, a number of matches for the Indian Gymkhana Cricket Club, and scored a century for the team against a New Zealand APS side in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Brian Langford {{holds the}} record for the {{greatest}} number of first-class appearances for Somerset. Between 1953 and 1974 the right-arm off break bowler played 504 times for the club. Only three other players have made more than 400 appearances for Somerset, and no-one has reached the milestone since Langford. Jack White, one of the three, is the club's leading wicket-taker in first-class cricket, claiming 2,165 dismissals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county</b> between 1909 and 1937. Harold Gimblett's tally of 21,142 first-class runs is the most by a Somerset cricketer, over 2,000 more than the next, Marcus Trescothick.|$|E

5|$|Burns {{started his}} cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990. He {{struggled}} {{to break into}} the first team with his new county, and {{spent most of his time}} with the club playing in the second team. As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited by the presence of Keith Piper, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county</b> in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.|$|E

The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the new road a financial burden <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county.</b> To make things worse, the new road did not bring the immediate influx of business that was advertised and was looking early on as a giant mistake {{on the part of the}} county and towns.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} in the House of Burgesses, White served {{alongside}} James Mercer, {{who was also}} representing Hampshire County.

5|$|During the {{following}} season, Fothergill only appeared once for Somerset, in a match against Kent {{early in the}} season. He took four for 87 in the match, which was his final first-class appearance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county.</b> Fothergill was again selected {{to play for the}} South against the North, but bowled just three overs in the match, without taking a wicket. The remainder of his notable appearances that season were made for the MCC, though few were considered first-class. He performed well in matches against Wiltshire and Leicestershire, taking eleven wickets in each match, including seven for 62 in the second innings against Leicestershire, but neither match had first-class status. In 1885, he enjoyed his best match for the South, taking four wickets in each innings as the North were defeated by nine wickets. The majority of his cricket from 1884 until 1886 was made for the MCC, although he did appear four times in 1886 for Somerset, which had been stripped of its first-class status. In contrast, in 1887 and 1888, he played almost exclusively <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>county,</b> appearing just three times for the MCC. Somerset, who had relied on the bowling of Fothergill in the early 1880s, were spearheaded by E. W. Bastard, Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods in the late 1880s, and Fothergill was rarely needed to bowl many overs. Despite this, he was presented with a bat during 1888, a reward usually given to batsmen who had scored a century.|$|E
