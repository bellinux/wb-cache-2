5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> by {{football}} researchers {{that the}} playing of intercollegiate football began in November 1869, when a player at Rutgers University challenged another player {{at the nearby}} College of New Jersey (now Princeton).

The game developed slowly; the first rules were drafted in October 1873, and only consisted of twelve guidelines. Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased, the game was still effectively controlled by the College of New Jersey, who claimed eight national championships in ten years. Only Yale presented any form of challenge, claiming four national championships {{in the same time}} period.|$|E

The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, {{they are capable of}} changing strength {{in a way that is}} controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.|$|E
