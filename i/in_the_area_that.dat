5|$|Prior to European settlement, {{there were}} several Native American groups living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> was to become Gladstone.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{was born}} and raised in Leaside, Toronto, the first of three sons of Margaret (née Johnston) and Joseph Harris Harper, an {{accountant}} at Imperial Oil. The Harper family traces its ancestry back to Yorkshire, England, with Christopher Harper emigrating from Yorkshire to Nova Scotia in 1784, where he later served as justice of the peace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> is now New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, European-Americans settled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> is now Omak {{and built}} houses and inaugurated mining, logging and {{agricultural}} activities. As more white settlers arrived, a dispute about land ownership arose {{between them and}} the Native Americans.|$|E
50|$|Another {{branch of}} the Banu Ka'b settled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> are now Oman and the United Arab Emirates.|$|R
50|$|Drimylus and Dionysius, two Greek {{employees}} under Zeno, {{were known}} for their involvement in selling women as sex-slaves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> Zeno was visiting.|$|R
25|$|Countries {{affected}} by <b>the</b> tsunami <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> were hit are American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga (Niuatoputapu) {{where more than}} 189 people were killed, especially children, {{most of them in}} Samoa.|$|R
5|$|Jereboam Beauchamp {{was born}} September 6, 1802, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> is now Simpson County, Kentucky. He {{was the second}} son of Thomas and Sally (Smithers) Beauchamp. Both parents were devout Christians. He was named after a {{paternal}} uncle, Jereboam O. Beauchamp, a state senator from Washington County.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> used old Indian trails that skirted the lava flows. This alternative route was later named Goodale's Cutoff {{and part of}} it is {{in the northern part of}} the monument. The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks, which today is memorialized in Idaho's Massacre Rocks State Park.|$|E
5|$|Prairie Avenue {{once served}} as an Indian trail linking Fort Dearborn to Fort Wayne in Indiana and thus derived {{its name from the}} vast midwestern prairie land between the two endpoints. In 1812, the Battle of Fort Dearborn {{occurred}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> is now the northern section of the street, in {{what is known as the}} Near South Side community area. Casualties of the battle, such as William Wells and George Ronan, were struck down here.|$|E
50|$|According to the {{official}} German census of 1910, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> became Polish after 1918, 42 percent of the populace were ethnic German in 1910 (including German military, civil clerks, and settlers).|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} Jews in Saudi Arabia refers to <b>the</b> Jewish history <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> are now within the {{territory}} of Saudi Arabia. It is a history {{that goes back to}} Biblical times.|$|R
30|$|I {{thought it}} would be {{appropriate}} to end this paper with two open questions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> interested Kato. One dates from 1971 when Kato was still active and the other from 2000, the year after he died.|$|R
5|$|The Neolithic stone {{implements}} of celts were found. Axes found {{were made}} of quartzite, basalt and granite. The finds included nine types of microliths. Waste flakes found in the area indicate prevalence {{of the process of}} manufacture in a well established microlithic industry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> included chert, chalcedony, agate and jasper, derived from the dry river bed of the Son river. The final products in the collection are stone discs in long, cylindrical and triangular shapes.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} to Golders Green {{would take the}} railway out of the urban and suburban areas and into open farmland. While this provided a convenient site for the CCE's depot {{it is believed that}} underlying the decision was Yerkes' plan to profit from the sale of development land previously purchased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> would rise in value when the railway opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper part}} of the Syrian Euphrates valley has been intensively {{occupied}} at least since the Late Natufian period (10,800–9500 BC). Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European travellers had already noted the presence of numerous archaeological sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> would be flooded by the new reservoir. In order to preserve or at least document as many of these remains as possible, an extensive archaeological rescue programme was initiated during which more than 25 sites were excavated.|$|E
50|$|From 1683 to 1715 most of <b>the</b> {{settlers}} <b>in</b> Dutchess County were Dutch. Many {{of these}} moved in from Albany and Ulster Counties. They settled along the Fishkill Creek and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> are now Poughkeepsie and Rhinebeck.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological remains found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> suggest <b>that</b> Duston has {{roots in}} Prehistoric and Roman settlements. However, {{development}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> has meant <b>that</b> {{it is now}} difficult to find further remains.|$|R
50|$|After {{six months}} of {{research}} which included both qualitative and quantitative findings, {{it was determined that}} AroundYou was indeed having a positive social impact as indicated by increasing rates of community participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> were subjected to the research.|$|R
5|$|When Europeans first {{contacted}} Native Americans, some bows, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> became California, {{already had}} sinew backing. After the reintroduction of horses, newly mounted groups rapidly developed shorter bows, which were often given sinew backing. The full three-layer composite bow with horn, wood, and sinew {{does not seem}} to be recorded in the Americas, and horn bows with sinew backing are not recorded before European contact.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{residents}} {{were allowed to}} return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> were not ready for the return of civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E
5|$|At {{first two}} groups {{established}} themselves on fertile grounds in Silesia: One {{on the left}} bank of the Oder River south of Wrocław, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> included Mount Ślęża, and one around the Głubczyce highlands; both stayed in their respective regions during the 400–120 BC period. Burial and other significant Celtic sites in Głubczyce County were investigated in Kietrz and nearby Nowa Cerekiew. The Ślęża group disintegrated eventually within the local population, while the one at Głubczyce Upland apparently migrated out in the southern direction. More recent discoveries include Celtic settlements in Wrocław County, where in Wojkowice a well-preserved 3rd century BC grave {{of a woman with}} bronze and iron bracelets, brooches, rings and chains was found.|$|E
30|$|Under the standards, teacher {{preparation}} programs offer educational opportunities for teacher candidates {{to gain a better}} understanding of the professional knowledge, skills, and attitudes and to demonstrate competence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> are necessary to work with young children and their families.|$|R
50|$|Even {{real estate}} in Ecuador is much less than its {{tropical}} counterparts. However, {{as more and more}} North Americans are discovering Ecuador's potential, property prices are beginning to rise from where they were a decade ago, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> are popular among expats and tourists.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> war <b>in</b> Donbass continued, <b>the</b> first post-revolutionary {{parliamentary}} elections in Ukraine were held on 26 October 2014. Once again, separatists stymied voting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>that</b> they controlled. They held their own elections, internationally unrecognised and <b>in</b> violation of <b>the</b> Minsk Protocol peace process, on 2 November 2014.|$|R
5|$|At the time, Momchil was {{approached}} by agents of Kantakouzenos' opponents, the Constantinopolitan regency, and persuaded to turn against him. Thinking that Kantakouzenos and his Turkish allies from the Emirate of Aydin were far away in eastern Thrace, he attacked a Turkish fleet of 15 ships near Portolagos and sank three of them. He then overcame another Turkish force that arrived to exact retribution near the fortress of Peritheorion (also known as Burugrad), and plundered several cities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> refused to surrender. Afterwards, Momchil along with 1,000 horsemen attacked Kantakouzenos, who had set camp near Komotini with only 60 horsemen to protect him. The Byzantines were thoroughly routed: Kantakouzenos' horse was killed and he received a powerful hit to the head, which he survived thanks to his helmet. Momchil captured many of Kantakouzenos' men, but the claimant to the throne himself managed to escape in the turmoil.|$|E
5|$|Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and {{the forced}} {{migration}} of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants {{settled in the}} central Susquehanna Valley, including <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, {{as part of the}} first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses.|$|E
5|$|From about 10,000 BCE, Paleo-Indians {{and later}} Archaic-Indians lived as {{communities}} of hunter-gatherers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> covers the modern day southern United States. Approximately 800 CE to 1600 CE, the Mississippi River Delta was populated by tribes of the Mississippian culture, a mound-building Native American {{people that had}} developed in the late Woodland Indian period. The Tipton Phase people were a local expression of the Mississippian culture. They inhabited the region of modern-day Tipton County {{during the time of}} first contact with Europeans, at the arrival of the de Soto Expedition. By the end of the Mississippian period the land was claimed and populated by the Chickasaw tribe. The exact origins of the Chickasaw are uncertain. Several prehistoric Indian settlements were located in the vicinity of what would later become Randolph.|$|E

5|$|On 24 August 1975, Catholic civilians Colm McCartney and Sean Farmer {{were stopped}} {{in their car}} at another fake British Army {{checkpoint}} at Altnamachin (near Newtownhamilton). They were driving home from a Gaelic football match in Dublin. The two men were found shot dead nearby. Earlier that night, three RUC officers in an unmarked car had been stopped at the same checkpoint but allowed through. However, the officers suspected that the checkpoint was fake. After receiving radio confirmation {{that there were no}} authorised checkpoints <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> night, they reported the incident and requested help from the British Army to investigate it, but no action was taken. RUC officer John Weir claims that UDR corporal Robert McConnell was involved in the attack.|$|E
5|$|The exposed geology of the Death Valley area {{presents}} a diverse and {{complex set of}} at least 23 formations of sedimentary units, two major gaps in the geologic record called unconformities, {{and at least one}} distinct set of related formations geologists call a group. The oldest rocks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> now includes Death Valley National Park are extensively metamorphosed by intense heat and pressure and are at least 1700 million years old. These rocks were intruded by a mass of granite 1400 Ma (million years ago) and later uplifted and exposed to nearly 500 million years of erosion.|$|E
5|$|The notice {{specified}} that only women {{were invited to}} the first day's meetings on July 19, but {{both women and men}} could attend on the second day to hear Lucretia Mott speak, among others. On July 11, the announcement first appeared, giving readers just eight days' notice until the first day of convention. Other papers such as Douglass's North Star picked up the notice, printing it on July 14. The meeting place was to be the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel in Seneca Falls. Built by a congregation of abolitionists and financed in part by Richard Hunt, the chapel had been the scene of many reform lectures, and was considered the only large building <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>that</b> would open its doors to a women's rights convention.|$|E
