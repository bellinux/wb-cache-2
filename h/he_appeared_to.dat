5|$|His serious remarks {{could get}} him in trouble as well. Some of his public utterances in 1913, in which <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> {{advocate}} radical ideas {{in regard to the}} inheritance of property, caused much criticism.|$|E
5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight, especially {{in his left}} eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have been near-sighted, yet he did not use eyeglasses. His eyesight became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite legible.|$|E

5|$|President Reagan {{appeared}} before the Tower Commission on December 2, 1986, to answer questions regarding {{his involvement in the}} affair. When asked about his role in authorizing the arms deals, he first stated that he had; later, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> contradict himself by stating that he had no recollection of doing so. In his 1990 autobiography, An American Life, Reagan acknowledges authorizing the shipments to Israel.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be an {{unlikely}} candidate {{on account of}} his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea were {{expected}} to line up in a 4–4–2 formation, with Essien in central defence. They had doubts about the fitness of captain John Terry going into the final. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have damaged his ankle ligaments during {{the first leg of}} Chelsea's Champions League tie with Porto, though passed a fitness test just days after. Arsenal {{were expected}} to line up in a similar formation, with Baptista and Aliadière up front.|$|E

5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|Goldstein {{appeared}} as himself in several television series, contributed mixes to and portrayed a playable {{character in the}} video game DJ Hero, and filmed a cameo appearance for Iron Man 2. Goldstein hosted the 2009 MTV drug intervention series Gone Too Far, and <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be struggling with his addiction during filming. On August 28, 2009, he {{was found dead in}} his New York City apartment from a drug overdose. The DJ AM Memorial Fund, an organization designed to help people struggling with drug addiction, was launched in his memory by his sister, and Iron Man 2, which was released in 2010, was dedicated to him.|$|E
5|$|In March 1923, Lenin {{suffered}} a third stroke {{and lost his}} ability to speak; that month, he experienced partial paralysis on his right side and began exhibiting sensory aphasia. By May, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be making a slow recovery, regaining some of his mobility, speech, and writing skills. In October, he made a final visit to the Moscow Kremlin. In his final weeks, Lenin was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, with the latter visiting him at his Gorki mansion {{on the day of}} his death. On 21 January 1924, Lenin fell into a coma and died later that day. His official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|Swiss riders {{dominated}} the 1990s; Tony Rominger won a record three Vueltas in succession from 1992 to 1994. Laurent Jalabert was victorious in 1995, he {{also won the}} points and mountain classification becoming only the third person to win all these classifications in a single Grand Tour. Alex Zülle won two Vueltas in succession in 1996 and 1999. German Jan Ullrich was the victor in 1999. Roberto Heras won his first Vuelta in 2000; he won a further two in 2003 and 2004. In 2005 <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have won a record fourth Vuelta, however he was later stripped of his title after failing a drug-control test. Second place Denis Menchov became the victor.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a {{standard}} match between Bret Hart and Hakushi (managed by Shinja). Bret announced before the contest {{that he was}} dedicating his performances to his mother because it was Mother's Day. Jerry Lawler, who faced Bret later in the pay-per-view, watched the match backstage on a monitor. Bret won the contest, when he rolled-up Hakushi to gain a pinfall and end Hakushi's six-month-long undefeated streak. As Hart jumped to the arena floor after the contest, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> legitimately injure his knee.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} were further magnified in late 2006, when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs {{in the first}} two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia. Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies, Pathan was dropped {{for the rest of the}} tournament. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches.|$|E

5|$|Barnes was {{selected}} for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937–38 season against Queensland making 68 in a rain-affected match. Against the touring New Zealanders, Barnes fell just short of his maiden first-class century, scoring 97. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have reached the landmark when scoring 127not out against Western Australia, but the New South Wales Cricket Association retrospectively deemed the match to be not of first-class status, angering Barnes. He finally scored his maiden first-class century (110) against Victoria in {{the final game of}} the season, completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by Ernie McCormick. As a result of his performances over the season (scoring over 800 runs, averaging 50.56), Barnes {{was selected}} as the youngest member of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{completed}} A Short History of the Confederate States of America in October 1889. On November 6, he left Beauvoir {{to visit}} his plantation at Brierfield. While in New Orleans, he {{was caught in a}} sleety rain, and on the steamboat trip upriver, he had a severe cold; on November 13 he left Brierfield to return to New Orleans. Varina Davis, who had taken another boat to Brierfield, met him on the river, and he finally received some medical care; two doctors came aboard further south and found he had acute bronchitis complicated by malaria. They arrived in New Orleans three days later, and he was taken to the home of Charles Erasmus Fenner, an Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Davis remained in bed but was stable for the next two weeks; however, he took {{a turn for the worse}} in early December. Just when <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be improving, he lost consciousness on the evening of December 5 and died at 12:45a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, in the presence of several friends and with his hand in Varina's.|$|E
5|$|During the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, Elizabeth's serene public {{behaviour}} was broken, exceptionally, {{when she}} {{rose from the}} royal car to strike an admirer with her umbrella because she had mistaken his enthusiasm for hostility. The 1948 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed because of the King's declining health. In March 1949, he had a successful operation to improve the circulation in his right leg. In summer 1951, Queen Elizabeth and her daughters fulfilled the King's public engagements in his place. In September, {{he was diagnosed with}} lung cancer. After a lung resection, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> recover, but the delayed trip to Australia and New Zealand was altered so that Princess Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, went in the King and Queen's place, in January 1952. The King died while Princess Elizabeth and the Duke were in Kenya en route to the southern hemisphere, and they returned immediately to London. They would not finally visit Australia and New Zealand until 1954.|$|E

5|$|Fearing a {{surrender}} to the Germans, Marcel-Henri Jaspar, a junior minister, left France for London where, together with Camille Huysmans, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> form a rebel government or Belgian National Committee (Comité national belge) condemned by the official government. De Vleeschauwer arrived in London, where he was joined by Camille Gutt, the Minister of Finances, {{to deal with the}} threat. Pierlot remained in France. De Vleeschauwer travelled to neutral Spain where, at Le Perthus on the French-Spanish border, he met with Pierlot and Paul-Henri Spaak, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to attempt to persuade them to join him in London. Pierlot refused. Continued negotiations with the new Vichy government of Philippe Pétain proved fruitless. In August 1940, under pressure from the Germans, the French broke off diplomatic relations with the Belgian government and ordered it to disband. On 22 August, Pierlot and Spaak received the permission of the government to leave for London {{while the rest of the}} government remained in France.|$|E
5|$|His first call-up to {{the senior}} {{national}} squad came in October 2004, for World Cup qualifiers against Belgium and Lithuania, {{as a replacement for}} Juanito who dropped out of the original selection because of injury. Carlos Marchena and Carles Puyol were the centre-back pairing in possession, and Pablo remained on the bench for both games. He made his international debut on 17 November 2004 in a friendly against England in Madrid. He entered the game as a half-time substitute for Marchena, with Spain leading 1–0; with 20 minutes left, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> foul Alan Smith in the act of shooting, but no penalty was awarded, and Spain had no difficulty retaining their lead. Pablo replaced Iván Helguera, who had previously been a regular selection, in the squad for Spain's next match, a World Cup qualifier at home to San Marino in February 2005, but did not play.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Asashōryū {{posted a}} 14–1 record, his fourth {{straight}} championship since returning from injury, {{and became the}} fifth man to win twenty career championships. In March, he dropped his first two bouts but then won thirteen in a row for a 13–2 score. However, this {{was not enough to}} win the title—he lost a playoff {{for the first time in}} his career, to fellow Mongolian Hakuhō. In May he turned in a below par 10–5 record, losing to all four ōzeki and maegashira Aminishiki (although <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be carrying an injury). Hakuhō won this tournament as well and was promoted to yokozuna immediately afterwards. Asashōryū had been the sole yokozuna for a total of 21 tournaments since the retirement of Musashimaru in November 2003 – the longest period of time in sumo history. In July he lost to Aminishiki once again on the opening day but rallied to win the next fourteen bouts, taking his 21st title with a 14–1 record. He was suspended by the Sumo Association from the next two tournaments (see below).|$|E
