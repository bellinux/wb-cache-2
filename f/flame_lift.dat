In particular, a numerical simulation tool has been developed in order to predict the onset of two flame instabilities which may deteriorate the performances of the burner: the flame back and <b>flame</b> <b>lift.</b> The numerical model has been firstly validated by comparing the simulated flow field with a data set of experimental measurements. A prediction criterion for the flame back instability has been formulated based on isothermal simulations without involving the combustion modelization. This analysis has been verified by a Design Of Experiments investigation performed on different burner prototype geometries. On the contrary, the formulation of a prediction criterion regarding the <b>flame</b> <b>lift</b> instability has required the use of a combustion model in the numerical code.

40|$|Progress {{variable}} approaches {{permit the}} efficient large eddy simulation (LES) of complex industrial combustion systems, where assumed shape filtered density functions (ß-FDFs) {{are widely used}} to account for subgrid scale effects. In this study a new modelling approach for the LES of partially premixed combustion is introduced, {{which is based on}} top-hat filtered premixed flamelet-generated manifolds (TH-PFGM) which are consistent with the LES methodology. Due to the top-hat filtering the resulting lookup tables require fewer dimensions than conventional ß-integrated tables, permitting a low-storage representation. In the present paper TH-PFGM is applied to a lifted swirl flame in a model gas turbine combustor. The paper presents the underlying TH-PFGM modelling theory, its extension to any number of dimensions, and simulation results from the LES of the model combustor. Results show that TH-PFGM accurately captures the <b>flame</b> <b>lift</b> off dynamics governed by a low frequency penetration of the flame into the fuel supply, which leads to fluid expansion and in turn <b>flame</b> <b>lift</b> off.

Especially for the case with two <b>lifted</b> <b>flames,</b> such configuration could be suitable in studying interaction between two tribrachial flames. In the present study, the flame characteristics have been investigated numerically by adopting a reduced kinetic mechanism in the triple-port burner. Four different types of flame configurations, including two attached flames, inner lifted/outer attached <b>flames,</b> inner attached/outer <b>lifted</b> <b>flames,</b> and twin <b>lifted</b> <b>flames,</b> were successfully simulated depending on the flow conditions. The representative edge propagation speed of a single <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> or an upstream <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> {{in the case of}} twin <b>lifted</b> <b>flames</b> increased as the liftoff height became higher. In the twin <b>lifted</b> <b>flames,</b> the inner <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> was affected appreciably when the other flame was located further upstream such that the <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> located further downstream encountered the axial velocity acceleration induced by the gas expansion from the <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> located upstream, while thermal effects were not observed since the temperature of the incoming flow toward the <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> was not affected. A unique flip-flop behavior between the inner and outer flames, observed experimentally previously, was successfully captured in the simulation such that the inner <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> became attached to the nozzle as the liftoff height of the outer <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> grew higher with an increase in the outer air velocity...|$|R

For the non-autoignited <b>lifted</b> <b>flames</b> at relatively low temperature, the existence of <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> depended on the Schmidt number of fuel, such that only the fuels with Sc > 1 exhibited stationary <b>lifted</b> <b>flames.</b> The balance mechanism between the propagation speed of tribrachial flame and local flow velocity stabilized the <b>lifted</b> <b>flames.</b> At relatively high initial temperatures, either autoignited <b>lifted</b> <b>flames</b> having tribrachial edge or autoignited <b>lifted</b> <b>flames</b> with mild combustion existed regardless of the Schmidt number of fuel. The adiabatic ignition delay time {{played a crucial role}} for the stabilization of autoignited flames.

These tests were performed in situ {{at a gas}} generation plant associated with a landfill facility in Madrid (Spain) and following the standard UNE-EN 30 - 2 - 1 (1999). The jets of a domestic cooker commonly used for natural gas (NG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were modified to operate with the biogases produced at the facility.

In this study, different designs of fin deck, {{which is one of}} the major components of the lamella burner, are experimentally analyzed and optimized. After the optimization process, a numerical analysis was used for verification. Emissions are the most important properties for the gas fired boilers and directly related with the design of the burner parts where the combustion occurs. In the lamella burner, fin deck is the most related part with combustion. Combustion occurs on the fin deck surface hence, current fin deck design analysis and optimization is based on the emission rates in order to keep the lamella burner as low-emission (both NOx and CO) burner. This study mainly consists: summary of main parameters regarding combustion and fin deck, experimental analysis, and verification of optimized fin deck model with numerical simulation. Firstly, gas combustion and lamella burner are investigated. Physical conditions and combustion characteristics for fin deck are analyzed and layout parameters for fin deck are deducted. Afterwards, four new fin deck designs are introduced as alternatives for the current design. In the experimental part, emission, light back, <b>flame</b> <b>lift,</b> temperature and pressure drop tests are performed for serial and each new sample in the BOSCH Product Development Laboratories, Manisa. According to the test results, the most preferred sample is defined as optimized one. Test results are discussed to explain whether the fin deck samples are preferable or not. In the combustion curve performance test, CO values are measured. The comparison between the combustion curve test results show that CO formation is related to the fin deck geometry. Geometry affects flame stability because of the differences in mixture velocity distributions. The unburned gas in exhaust is one of the causes of the CO formation and influenced from the flame stability. Therefore,unburned gas mass fractions in exhaust are different for the samples with different geometries. This result is also numerically verified in combustion simulations of two different fin deck models, which one of them is considered as optimized sample...|$|E

40|$|Natural gas plays a {{major role}} in the energy supply of the Netherlands. The use of fossil fuels is scien-tifically linked to climate change. Therefore, ‘green gas’ could have {{potential}} for the future in the Netherlands as a renewable energy source. Green gas is bio-based gas upgraded to natural gas quality. Green gas can be produced from biogas and from gasified biomass. Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion of manure, optionally with co-products from agriculture and industry and landscape sectors. Additionally, it is produced by anaerobic digestion at sewage water treatment plants. Biogas is also produced in landfills. The gas produced by gasification of woody biomass is called SNG. For the Netherlands, targets on emissions and renewable energy sources on the one hand, and an ex-pected decline in natural gas from the large Groningen-gas-field on the other hand, create an increas-ing opportunity for green gas. However, a lack of development of a green gas infrastructure is a cur-rent limitation. Therefore, this research raised the following problem statement: What is the Dutch biomass potential for gas production up to 2030, and which type of natural gas grid should be used to deliver this potential to the natural gas system? In this research, natural gas refers to the natural gas quality of Groningen-gas. First, the potential of biomass available for green gas production is determined. The determination takes into account the current use of biomass as well as the current biogas production. It is assumed that manure from cows and pigs in sheds is available for biogas production. This will not interfere with its current use as a fertilizer, because the residue of digestion can be used as such. Furthermore, the energy requirements for agriculture and biomass transport are included in the calculation, as well as the gas yields of the different biomass flows. Then, the energy requirements throughout the green gas chain are determined. The steps include the aforementioned energy requirements for biomass, pre-treatment of biomass, gas production, gas up-grading and injection into the natural gas infrastructure. Upgrading is necessary, since the produced biogas and/or SNG have their own specific gas composi-tion, and differ from Groningen-gas. The main components that are not in accordance are CO 2, H 2 S, NH 3, Nitrogen and siloxanes. Furthermore, for SNG dust and tar removal is essential to meet the qual-ity requirements. The gas composition is important, since differences have consequences on the com-bustion process at end users, like incomplete combustion, <b>flame</b> <b>lift,</b> light back, and soot. The green gas produced can be delivered to the natural gas system by injection into three different grid-types: the High Pressure Grid (67 bar), to which natural gas fields, storages and industries are connected, the Regional Grid (40 bar), and the Distribution Grid (8 bar), to which the households are connected. From this research the following conclusions are drawn. The Dutch potential for biogas production (45 PJ/a in 2010; 41 PJ/a in 2030) is about double the potential of SNG (26 PJ/a in 2010; 17 PJ/a in 2030), but both potentials are limited in relation to the current Dutch natural gas consumption of Groningen quality (~ 950 PJ/a). This potential is not limited by the natural gas infrastructure, firstly because up-grading of biogas and/or SNG cannot be avoided if it is to be used in household gas appliances, and secondly because the energy required for grid injection has only a minor share of the total energy re-quirements in the green gas chain. To be able to deliver green gas to the natural gas system, it should be injected into the High Pressure Grid. Although this requires slightly more energy than injection into the other grids, the advantage is the use of the supply and demand balancing system. This characteris-tic fits perfectly to the contrasting patterns of green gas production (somewhat higher during summer than in the winter) and natural gas demand (significant lower during summer than in the winter). This research did not include green gas production based on biomass imports, nor did it investigate the economics of green gas. Including those factors could result in a different outcome. Furthermore, legal issues limit green gas injection into the natural gas system. Also, this research did not address the sus-tainability of green gas. Further research is recommended on these aspects. ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{nominally}} 15, and 30 kW Helmholtz-type pulsed combustors {{were designed}} and constructed. These were bench mounted {{with the heat}} exchangers (i. e. combustion chamber and tailpipe) immersed in the water bath. Their design was based upon {{the design of a}} nominally 7. 5 kW pulsed unit previously developed at Middlesex University. The design enabled the lengths of the combustion chambers to be varied so that various combustion chamber volumes could be achieved. This provided a new dimension to the study of pulsed combustors which is lacking in many reported works. It was found that the required input rates could be achieved by scaling up or down each combustion chamber dimensions linearly by a factor of 1. 5, while maintaining the geometry identical. Tests showed that the present design of pulsed combustors can operate successfully at various input rates of mains natural gas (93 % methane) with a maximum turn-down ratio of 1. 8 : 1. Results indicated that the three developed combustors would generally operate in the fuel-lean condition. Interestingly, these tests revealed that the amount of excess air reduced as the combustion chamber volume (CCV) was increased. Systematic investigation on the three developed combustors showed that the temperature within the combustor was principally controlled by the air-to-fuel ratio (A/F). Analysis of the average measured NOx concentrations at various operating conditions indicated that NOx emission in this type of pulsed combustor is principally controlled by combustion temperature with no significant influence of combustion chamber volume, tailpipe length or scale of the combustors except in so far as these influenced the A/F and hence the temperature within the combustor. The dominant role of temperature on NOx production from these combustors become more evident when nitrogen or argon was injected into the system resulting in reduced NOx emissions at a given A/F. Systematic analysis of data indicated that as the amount of diluent increased, the temperature within the combustor decreased. Almost all the NOx values recorded were in the form of NO which is believed to be {{as a result of the}} high flame temperature (typically above 1850 K). The minimum recorded NOx value was 5 ppm at the upper limiting value of excess air ratio, λ; importantly it was round that at these high A/F values there was no significant reduction in overall efficiency of the pulsed units, showing calculated values above 90 %. Analysis of data indicated that combustion temperature is also a primary factor controlling CO emissions from the present design of pulsed combustors. CO concentrations exhibited U-shaped characteristics when plotted vs λ, showing maximum values at the lowest and highest λ values. By changing water bath temperature (WBT) and hence modifying heat losses to the combustion chamber wall, it was shown that the quenching of the combustion reactions and incomplete mixing of air and gas prior to combustion are contributing factors to CO formation in this type of pulsed combustor. The developed pulsed combustors were operated successfully with standard test gases. The composition and flame stability of these test gases were similar to the standard test gases G 21 (incomplete combustion gas), G 222 (light back gas) and G 23 (<b>flame</b> <b>lift</b> gas). Analysis of the exhaust gas composition showed similar trends to those obtained when burning mains natural gas; as the heat input was increased, O 2 levels decreased while CO 2 and NOx emission levels increased. Similarly, CO concentrations showed U-shaped characteristics when plotted against firing rate. Measurements of peak pulsing pressure and frequency were used as a guide to operation and stability performance of the pulsed units. It was found that the operating frequency was a function of configuration of the combustors and temperature of the internal gases. Frequency of operation showed a reciprocal correlation with volume of combustion chamber and tailpipe length and increased as the heat input was increased. Pulsing pressure amplitude also was influenced by change of configuration of the combustors, increasing as the CCV and tailpipe length were decreased. Analysis of experimental data obtained at fixed configuration of the combustors showed that the peak pulsing pressure was a strong function of the heat release per cycle in the present design of pulsed combustors. A major drawback of the use of pulsating combustors is the high noise level which is associated with their operation. It was found that it is possible to reduce overall noise levels of the pulsed burners to acceptable values by configuring the system appropriately. This included the use of expansion chambers at the inlet and the exhaust outlet which reduced the overall noise levels to a minimum value of 65 dBA...|$|E

The autoignited <b>lifted</b> <b>flames</b> exhibited either tribrachial edge structures or Mild combustion behaviors depending on the level of fuel dilution. For the iso-octane and n-heptane fuels, two distinct transition behaviors were observed in the autoignition regime from a nozzle-attached <b>flame</b> to a <b>lifted</b> tribrachial-edge <b>flame</b> and then a sudden transition to lifted Mild combustion as the jet velocity increased at a certain fuel dilution level. The liftoff data of the autoignited flames with tribrachial edges were analyzed based on calculated ignition delay times for the pre-vaporized fuels. Analysis of the experimental data suggested that ignition delay time may be much less sensitive to initial temperature under atmospheric pressure conditions as compared with predictions. For the gasoline fuels for advanced combustion engines (FACEs), and primary reference fuels (PRFs), autoignited liftoff data were correlated with Research Octane Number and Cetane Number. For the DME fuel, planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of formaldehyde (CH 2 O) and CH* chemiluminescence were visualized qualitatively. In the autoignition regime for both tribrachial structure and mild combustion, formaldehyde were found mainly between the fuel nozzle and the <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> edge.

As flow rate increases, the <b>flame</b> <b>lifts</b> off from a nozzle attached diffusion flame and a stationary <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> can be stabilized. The liftoff height increases nearly linearly with the average velocity at the nozzle exit. The <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> has a tribrachial flame structure, which consists of a rich premixed flame, a lean premixed flame, and a diffusion flame, all extending from a single location. As flow rate further increases, periodically oscillating flames are observed inside the confined tube. Once flame oscillation occurs, the flame undergoes relatively stable oscillation such that it has nearly constant oscillation amplitude and frequency. The criteria of flame oscillation are mapped as functions of nozzle diameter, the distance between nozzle and tube, and jet velocity. This type of flame oscillation can be characterized by Strouhal number in terms of flame oscillation amplitude, frequency, and jet velocity. Buoyancy driven flame oscillation {{which is one of the}} viable mechanism for flame oscillation is modeled and the results agrees qualitatively with experimental results, suggesting that the oscillation is due to periodic blowoff and flashback under the influence of buoyancy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{experiment}} on gas jet flame extinguishing with water mist in open space {{was conducted in}} this paper. On the basis of experimental result, {{the process of the}} flame extinguishment can be classified into two categories: 1) when fuel flow rate is small, the gas jet flame can be suppressed and extinguished quickly; 2) When fuel flow is large, the <b>flame</b> <b>lifts</b> from the attached position at the burner exit after suppressed by the water mist. FLUENT is used to simulate the interaction of water mist with gas jet flame. The Eddy-dissipation model (EDM) is used for combustion of flame. the water mist is simulated by Discrete Phase Model (DPM). The simulated results agree well with the experimental results. To some extent, EDM is suitable for simulating the interaction of water mist with a turbulent gas jet flame...|$|R
40|$|Autoignited <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> {{behavior}} in laminar jets of methane/hydrogen mixture fuels {{has been investigated}} experimentally in heated coflow air. Three regimes of autoignited <b>lifted</b> <b>flames</b> were identified depending on initial temperature and hydrogen to methane ratio. At relatively high initial temperature, addition of {{a small amount of}} hydrogen to methane improved ignition appreciably such that the liftoff height decreased significantly. In this hydrogen-assisted autoignition regime, the liftoff height increased with jet velocity, and the characteristic flow time - defined as the ratio of liftoff height to jet velocity - correlated well with the square of the adiabatic ignition delay time. At lower temperature, the autoignited <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> demonstrated a unique feature in that the liftoff height decreased with increasing jet velocity. Such behavior has never been observed in lifted laminar and turbulent jet flames. A transition regime existed between these two regimes at intermediate temperature. © 2011 The Combustion Institute...|$|R
40|$|One {{option for}} {{combustion}} in zero-emission Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plants is non-premixed combustion of nitrogen-diluted hydrogen in air. An important aspect to non-premixed combustion is flame stability or anchoring, though {{only a few}} fundamental stability studies of these flames have taken place to date. The following paper {{presents the results of}} experiments investigating the effects of nitrogen diluent fraction, jet diameter, and exit velocity on the static stability limits of a turbulent hydrogen jet flame issuing from a thin-lipped tube into a quiescent atmosphere. Four different stability limits are observed: detachment from the burner lip, reattachment to the burner lip, transition from a laminar <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> base to blowout or to a turbulent <b>lifted</b> <b>flame,</b> and transition from a turbulent <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> to blowout. The applicability of existing theories and correlations to the stability results is discussed. These results are an important step in assessing the viability of a non-premixed combustion approach using hydrogen diluted with nitrogen as a fuel...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{stability}} and dynamics of an axisymmetric <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> are studied {{by means of}} direct numerical simulation (DNS) and linear stability analysis of the reacting low-Mach-number equations. For light fuels (such as non-premixed methane/air flames), the non-reacting premixing zone upstream of the <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> base contains a pocket of absolute instability supporting self-sustaining oscillations, causing flame flicker {{even in the absence}} of gravity. The liftoff heights of the unsteady flames are lower than their steady counterparts (obtained by the method of selective frequency damping (SFD)), owing to premixed flame propagation during a portion of each cycle. From local stability analysis, the <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> is found to have a significant stabilizing influence at and just upstream of the flame base, which can truncate the pocket of absolute instability. For sufficiently low liftoff heights, the truncated pocket of absolute instability can no longer support self-sustaining oscillations, and the flow is rendered globally stable. © 2008 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|The boundary-layer {{approximation}} is used {{to describe}} the frozen mixing process taking place when a fuel jet of radius a discharges into stagnant air. The results are applicable to the calculation of <b>lifted</b> <b>flames</b> stabilized in round laminar jets with relatively large Reynolds numbers, Re, for which the proposed formulation provides a detailed description for the velocity and composition fields encountered by the propagating triple flame formed {{at the base of the}} <b>lifted</b> <b>flame.</b> The problem is integrated for relevant values of the flow parameters, including values of the stoichiometric air-to-fuel mass ratio S of order unity, when the <b>lifted</b> <b>flame</b> is located in the region of jet development, corresponding to distances from the injector of order Re a. Further attention is given to the relevant case S » l, corresponding to typical conditions of undilute hydrocarbon-air flames, for which the resulting <b>lifted</b> <b>flames</b> are stabilized at relatively large distances from the injector, of order S Re a. It is seen that Schlichting asymptotic solution, which corresponds to a point source of momentum, is then applicable to describe the mixing process upstream from the <b>lifted</b> <b>flame.</b> Improved accuracy is sought by introducing expansions for the velocity components and for the reactant mass fractions in powers of 5 _ 1. The resulting development shows in particular that the first-order correction to the leading-order solution is equivalent to the introduction of a virtual origin for the axial coordinate. It is shown that the magnitude of the required translation, which is equal for the velocity and composition fields, must be determined from continuity considerations. As an illustrative example, the resulting description {{is used to}} calculate flame fronts with S S> 1 in the thermal-diffusive approximation. •...|$|R

Then something--something struggling violently--was lifted high against the sky, a black, vague enigma against the starlight; and as this black object came down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was a man. For an instant he was clearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before, he must have been walking the world, a man of considerable consequence. I could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain. He vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented for the flow, temperature, and concentration {{fields in the}} region of attachment of fuel jet diffusion flames, near the wake of the fuel injector, where upstream heat conduction and diffusion are important. The characteristic scales for the size and velocity in this region are identified as lN = √ν 0 /A and UN = √ν 0 A, in terms of the kinematic viscosity of the fuel and the wall value of the fuel velocity gradient. The parameters that characterize the structure of the flame attachment region are identified, and some representative cases are numerically analyzed. There are cases with large activation energy, for which the flame will be attached if the Karlovitz number, ν 0 A/UL 2, or non-dimensional velocity gradient, is smaller than a critical value; for larger values, the <b>flame</b> <b>lifts</b> off far from the rim of the injector.
