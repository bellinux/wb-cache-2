50|$|In {{the area}} of Amselholz on Lotterberg, close to Amselhof, there is a horse's grave. The romantic grave made of red {{sandstone}} has a decoration of two horse's heads. Engraved in the stone are the words, Hier ruhen Bella und Rosa, den 15ten Juni 1868 (Here lie Bella and Rosa, 15 June 1856). The horses buried here, are not, as was thought for a long time, from the Isabellen - a <b>harnessed</b> <b>team</b> of six belonging to the last Hessian Prince-elector, Friedrich Wilhelm I. Nevertheless, there are still two different stories about how the graves came to be.|$|E

40|$|Few {{businesses}} are more volatile than the internet; few markets as fiercely contested as the still-emerging, passion-inducing and fast-paced world of digital music. What better opportunity, therefore, to apply agile principles {{as a means}} of delivering maximum value to a mass market while embracing chaotic change? Yet the elements that made Yahoo! Music cry out for an agile approach also presented major stumbling blocks – not least the challenge of <b>harnessing</b> <b>teams</b> and technology obtained by serial acquisition, with competing passions, perspectives and technical expertise. Ultimately the team was able to face and overcome these challenges by unifying around an increasingly agile business philosophy that addresses not only software development, but the entire Music organization. In this experience report, the lessons of agile adoption at Yahoo! Music are considered, applied and finally distilled into a set of general principles that we hope might inspire other teams to get their agile freak on! 1 1...|$|R

50|$|During the Pit Stop, all {{teams were}} moved to Kun Iam Ecumenical Centre to begin this leg of the race. The Detour was a choice between Make Your Bed or Ride a Sled. In Make Your Bed, teams have to grab 2 heavy backpacks, and then head to the campsite, to find a locked chest, and a key inside a block of ice in the cooler. Then, they have to empty their backpacks, {{properly}} built a tent, {{and set up a}} campfire which is needed to melt the block the ice to retrieve the key. Teams will then open the chest, do inspection with a wilderness expert and receive their next clue. In Ride A Sled, teams first select 3 dogs from a board at the ranch, then they have to run 1.5 km on a trail to a frozen lake. Then, they have to search through a number of dog harnesses that matches 3 dogs they selected. Once found the <b>harnesses,</b> <b>teams</b> will have to correctly put it on the dog, and attach the dogs to the sled. Each team member will have to complete 3 laps around the frozen lake to receive their next clue.|$|R

40|$|An entrepreneur’s primary {{incentive}} is {{ownership of}} a substantial share of the enterprise that commercializes the entrepreneur’s ideas. An inescapable consequence of this incentive is the entrepreneur’s exposure to the idiosyncratic risk of the enterprise. Diversification or insurance to ameliorate the risk would necessarily weaken the incentives for success. We study this issue {{in the case of}} startup companies backed by venture capital. These startups are mainly in information technology and biotechnology. They <b>harness</b> <b>teams</b> comprising entre-preneurs (scientists, engineers, and executives), venture capitalists (general partners of venture funds), and the suppliers of capital (the limited partners of venture funds). During the startup process, entrepreneurs collect only submarket salaries. The compensation that attracts them to startups is the share they receive of the value of a company if it goes public or is acquired. We make use of a rich body of data, which covers close to the universe of companies receiving venture funding from 1987 to 2008, though some information is missing for many companies. We use a method for imputing missing data that takes account of selection bias. Our most important finding is that the reward to the entrepreneurs who provide the ideas and long hours of hard work in these startups is zero in almost three quarters of the outcomes, an...|$|R
