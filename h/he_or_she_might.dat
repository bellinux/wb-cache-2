5|$|Though {{the witches}} do not {{deliberately}} tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, {{they use a}} subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him {{on the path to}} his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination: the Devil was believed to be a thought in a person's mind, which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> either indulge or reject. Macbeth indulges the temptation, while Banquo rejects it.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and Christie set up {{separate}} departments {{for practical}} sciences, such as mathematics, natural history, agriculture, and medicine; literature, such as poetry, drama, and romance; and finally, politics and religion, which encompassed government, theology, philosophy, morality, law, and trade. For each department, {{there was a}} chief reviewer, although <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> engage others. Although the reviewers' names were not known to the public, Johnson and Christie managed to acquire several luminaries: the poet William Cowper; the popular moralist William Enfield; the writer and physician John Aikin; the poet, essayist, and children's author Anna Laetitia Barbauld; the Unitarian minister William Turner; the physician and literary critic James Currie; the artist Henry Fuseli; the writer Mary Hays; the scholar Alexander Geddes; and the theologian Joshua Toulmin. The reviewers were all paid, however scholars {{have been unable to}} discover their rates. Christie was often absent after the founding of the Analytical Review, leaving the day-to-day operations of the journal up to Johnson. In 1790 he went to Paris for six months, during which he met with revolutionary leaders and started a business; in 1792 he returned to help the French translate their constitution and to dissolve his business. He left for Surinam in 1796 to collect money owed to him, and died there.|$|E

40|$|The {{explanatory}} gap {{about the}} subjective nature of conscious {{experience is the}} gap in explanation between conscious experience, and available scientific explanations of conscious experience. The explanatory gap is, as Joseph Levine states, the problem that physicalism (or the physical sciences) has in describing mental terms and experiences. 7 Thomas Nagel also describes the explanatory gap problem as the problem of explaining the subjective in objective terms. He states that the subjective viewpoint of the individual is inherently at odds with an objective, or physical explanation. 8 Describing someone’s experience of the redness of red, for example, by describing the neural mechanisms that fire when <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> sees red <b>might</b> seem to leave out the phenomenal aspect of experience in explanation. This {{is an example of}} what might {{be thought of as a}} gap in explanation between what the physical sciences say about mental properties, and what introspection reveals about mental properties. Describing mental events as identical with brain events is normally called materialism, which stands in opposition to a dualist, or non-reductivist treatment of the psychological nature of mental phenomena...|$|R
25|$|The study The Evolution of the Human Breast (2001) {{proposed}} that the rounded shape of a woman's breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat; that is, because of the human infant's small jaw, which did not project from the face to reach the nipple, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> block the nostrils against the mother's breast if it were of a flatter form (cf. chimpanzee). Theoretically, as the human jaw receded into the face, the woman's body compensated with round breasts.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not need to know much about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs {{in order to be}} an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, interpersonal skills (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).|$|E
25|$|In operant conditioning, {{the type}} and {{frequency}} of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behavior, {{in the presence of}} a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a reinforcer), the emitted behavior will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a punisher), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment). For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future (positive reinforcement); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> seem less motivated to do school work in the future (negative punishment). If a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention (positive punishment), that behavior would decrease in the future. The student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention (negative reinforcement).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} an evolutionary linguistic approach in the study of language change in a series of case studies. The main purpose of this exercise is to get a better insight in the mechanisms that {{have played a role in}} the respective cases of change. Human language can be considered an evolutionary system. Speakers transmit linguistic utterances in communication and these utterances can be subject to both mutation and selection. As such, a person’s linguistic knowledge, based on the set of linguistic utterances <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has encountered, <b>might</b> gradually change over time. In the case studies, computer models are used to simulate and investigate patterns in change, such as the tendency for words to change from lexical to functional meaning instead of vice versa and the one form-one meaning tendency. Another investigated pattern is the development of the Dutch verb ‘krijgen’, which shows a commonly found change from agentive to non-agentive meaning. Finally, a case study is presented in which the historic development of the verb ‘krijgen’ is reconstructed on the basis of synchronic variation in the use of the verb, using phylogenetic reconstruction methods.

60|$|And {{now comes}} the most {{extraordinary}} {{part of the history}} of this Prince. When he had turned out those servants, of course he wanted others. What was his astonishment to find that in all his dominions, which contained no less than twenty-seven millions of people, there were not above five-and-twenty servants altogether! They were so lofty about it, too, that instead of discussing whether they should hire themselves as servants to Prince Bull, they turned things topsy-turvy, and considered whether as a favour they should hire Prince Bull to be their master! While they were arguing this point among themselves quite at their leisure, the wicked old red Fairy was incessantly going up and down, knocking at the doors of twelve of the oldest of the five-and-twenty, who were the oldest inhabitants in all that country, and whose united ages amounted to one thousand, saying, 'Will YOU hire Prince Bull for your master? - Will YOU hire Prince Bull for your master?' To which one answered, 'I will if next door will;' and another, 'I won't if over the way does;' and another, 'I can't if <b>he,</b> <b>she,</b> <b>or</b> they, <b>might,</b> could, would, or should.' And all this time Prince Bull's affairs were going to rack and ruin.|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims {{to provide}} an {{empirical}} study ofan attempt to introduce an Action Learning Set at departmental level within the organizational context of a College of Higher Education. The starting-point for the study {{is the notion that}} an academic leader introducing action learning to a department for which <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is responsible <b>might</b> reduce the dissonance often experienced in educational organizations when institutional management paradigms conflict with the educational values and pedagogical principles underpiIming the institution. A range ofliterature is examined, from that on leadership, organizational culture and change management, to a number of specific texts on higher education management. The use of action learning is considered within and beyond higher education, particularly in its use as a means of strategic leadership. A discussion on methodological issues focuses on specific research questions which were revised over the course ofthe study, and considers ethical and. / practical issues which underline the study. The thesis presents a case study narrative based on the experience ofthe Action Learning Set over a sequence of six set meetings, and the resultant analysis of data gathered. The data is supplemented by post-experience interviews. The period ofthe study coincided with a time of considerable turbulence in the higher education sector {{in the wake of the}} 2003 White Paper, including the introduction of top-up fees in September 2006. This made a significant impact on the specific institution and the department in which the research was based, and this is evident in the data gathered and analysed. The research concludes that the success of action learning, particularly in a setting where professional education is practised, depends not only on the interplay ofprofessional knowledge, questioning and reflection, identified originally by Revans (1980) as P, Q and R, but also on appropriate tension between affective factors and those concerning the organizational politics of the institution where action learning is situated. A number ofpoints are identified for potential action by future researchers, including the need to investigate the transferability from the team learning in an action learning set to the development of collective capacity for leadership development across an institution ofhigher education. It is also suggested that it would be valuable to conduct empirical research on the use ofaction learning in other settings in higher education, including those of senior management teams.

2500|$|In {{mathematical}} psychology, antimatroids {{have been}} used to describe feasible states of knowledge of a human learner. Each element of the antimatroid represents a concept that is to be understood by the learner, or a class of problems that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be able to solve correctly, and the sets of elements that form the antimatroid represent possible sets of concepts that could be understood by a single person. The axioms defining an antimatroid may be phrased informally as stating that learning one concept can never prevent the learner from learning another concept, and that any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning a single concept at a time. The task of a knowledge assessment system is to infer the set of concepts known by a given learner by analyzing his or her responses to a small and well-chosen set of problems. In this context antimatroids have also been called [...] "learning spaces" [...] and [...] "well-graded knowledge spaces".|$|E
