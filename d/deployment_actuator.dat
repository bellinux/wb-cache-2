40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to develop and refine a shape memory alloy (SMA) modeling approach, the martensite twin reorientation (MTR) subroutine, to predict the transient response of a spaceborne membrane optic SMA <b>deployment</b> <b>actuator</b> spine system. In concert with a commercial finite element solver, this application supports multi-dimensional, temperature-displacement transient predictions of the shape memory effect (SME) exhibited by SMAs through implementation of a phenomenological constitutive law. The scope {{of this study was}} to model the relation of input power magnitude and waveform to stress fields, reaction forces, and thermal fields for the figure acquisition of a gossamer reflector. Of particular interest is the stress and thermal field history of the polymeric membrane concentrator through the deployment to prevent mechanical and thermal failure as limited experimental or modeling analysis results exists for SMA deployment schemes. Thermal authority over the concentrator was found locally limited to the spine interface. Upon aperture engagement, the integrated model’s first excursion cycle frequency excited by all three loading regimes was non-unique, regardless of the preceding temporal character of the spine’s response. This tendency suggests a coupling between the structural dynami...|$|E
40|$|Many {{applications}} require deployable {{structures to}} meet operational objectives such as satellites that unfurl antenna arrays. Typically, most deployment efforts involve {{the use of}} explosive and non-explosive actuators (EAs and NEAs respectively) that have implementation drawbacks such as the expense associated with special handling and the bulk encountered with mounting the devices. To mitigate EA and NEA drawbacks, the integration of shape memory alloys (SMA) as a <b>deployment</b> <b>actuator</b> was investigated. SMA specimens were heated and pulled to failure developing an environmental and structural operating envelope for application as deployment mechanisms. A Finite Element Model (FEM) was also created to model the response behavior induced during specimen testing so that modeled performance {{could be used in}} lieu of testing when integrating SMA actuators into deployment systems. Experimental results verified that SMAs can be implemented as deployment actuators. Recorded data showed that SMA fracture is possible over a wide range of temperatures and strains, filling a material performance gap not found in the literature. The obtained information allows design engineers to appropriately size SMAs given design requirements achieving the desired deployment effects. The Finite Element Model was partially successful, capable of emulating strained ambient material behavior up to approximately 6. 1 %. The limited response is due to lack of experimentally derived large stress and strain available for model emulation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{treatment}} of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using a transpedicular approach and cement injection has grown significantly {{over the last}} two decades. METHODS: The aim was to study the deployment of an implant dedicated to the vertebral augmentation by percutaneous approach (kyphoplasty). Its kinematics and the related forces have been investigated. A theoretical model of deployment has been proposed and the ancillary was instrumented with strain gauges and Hall effect sensors to measure kinematics and force in the <b>deployment</b> <b>actuator</b> (tensile rod). The methodology was first evaluated ex-vivo in a test-bench with boundary conditions monitored by a tensile machine. Then, a cadaver study was carried out in three lumbar and thoracic vertebral segments of normal and osteoporotic spines. FINDINGS: The relationships between ancillary internal forces, deployment, and cranio-caudal pushing force have been obtained. The test-bench experiment showed quasi-proportional relationship between force distribution and kinematics during the deployment. Ex-vivo cranio-caudal pushing forces were measured. Cadaver studies showed cranio-caudal pushing forces comprised between 100 N and 200 N. These forces were dependent upon the implant location in the vertebral body and bone stock. INTERPRETATION: The methodology was related to the analysis of load distribution and kinematics of a deployable implant for vertebral augmentation. The ancillary instrumentation contributed to the objective quantification of the surgical technique. The cadaver study in normal and osteoporotic spines exhibited the role of bone properties and implant location in implant deployment. This pilot study showed a methodology to improve the kyphoplasty surgery and patient comfort in clinical routine...|$|E

40|$|Tape springs are straight, {{thin-walled}} strips with {{a curved}} cross-section. Following recent proposals for large deployable structures exploiting the structural simplicity and robustness of such springs as <b>deployment</b> <b>actuators,</b> the paper investigates the dynamic deployment of a tape spring that is either coiled around a circular hub, or folded into a zig-zag pattern. It is shown that {{in both cases}} the spring deforms by forming an elastically deformed region with zero transverse curvature and uniform longitudinal curvature. The process of formation and growth of a fold belongs to a wide class of propagating instabilities. It is characterized by a high peak moment and a lower propagation moment. A compact characterization of the moment{rotation relationship for an elastic fold is presented. A key feature is that the bending moment on either side of a fold moving along a uniform tape spring, away from any end sup-ports, is constant, whereas this moment increases near a support. Compact and accu-rate two-dimensional theories are developed to simulate the self-actuated deployment of tape springs. It is shown that conservative energy formulations are appropriate for coiled springs, where the velocity eld is smooth, but not for springs with localized folds. To simulate the motion of such localized folds a non-conservative impulse-momentum formulation is proposed, and it is found that this model can accurately predict both the steady motion of the folds along the tape spring and their rebound against the end supports...|$|R

The primary source of skin friction drag during flight is the boundary layer separation. This is the layer of air moving smoothly in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft.

40|$|Because {{the linear}} boom {{actuator}} {{is to be}} used on a flight spacecraft, as opposed to a ground based application, there is a comprehensive set of requirements. First, of course, the actuator must be capable of positioning and holding the load. Initially the load as predicted to be 4448 N (1000 lb) but with subsequent spacecraft configuration changes the load has been greatly reduced to a constant tensile pull of 1477 N (332 lb) due to centrifugal force. Lesser compressive loads of 1317 N (296 centrifugal lb) may be experienced during launch and <b>deployment.</b> This <b>actuator</b> must have the maximum redundancy possible. Life requirements were defined by the 10. 16 to 15. 24 cm (4 to 6 in.) total liner travel expected during the five-year flight duration.

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{recognised}} that SMA materials have a significant potential for <b>deployment</b> <b>actuators,</b> the number of applications of SMA-based actuators {{to the present day}} is still quite small, since {{a deeper understanding of the}} thermomechanical behaviour of SMA and how it might be exploited in the design of working actuators is necessary. In order to get a complete picture of the thermomechanical behaviour of Nitinol, one type of SMA, two kinds of experiment, purely thermal tests and thermomechanical tests, were carried out on Nitinol wires with diameters of 1 mm and 0. 5 mm, and on Nitinol bars with diameter of 6. 5 mm. In the purely thermal tests, a Differential Scanning Calorimeter was used to determine the phase transformation/ temperature relation of Nitinol wire with diameter of 1 mm and Nitinol bar. The thermomechanical tests, including tension tests at different temperatures, tension tests under different strain rates, response to suddenly applied loads, thermal cycling under different loads and thermal cycling with fixed length were carried out on Nitinol wire. Torsional tests, thermal cycling under different torques, and normal tension and thermal cycling tests were carried out on Nitinol bars with diameter of 6. 5 mm. We have developed a thermo-micromechanical model based on complementary free energy and micromechanical transformation system to investigate the behaviour of shape memory under uniaxial load cycling and thermal cycling. Experimentally observed phenomena, such as V-shape of critical stress, non-symmetrical behaviour in tension and compression, transformation front behaviour, and multiphase transformation, were explained by this model. We present a phenomenological model which is based on the tension test, carried out at different constant temperatures, and a thermal cycling test under different constant loads. We have shown that our model can reproduce accurately the stress-strain-temperature relationship for all the quasi-static tests we have carried out on Nitinol wires. This model has no difficulty in dealing with incomplete loading or thermal cycling. This model has been used to simulate thermal cycling behaviour with fixed length, strain rate effects, and phase transformation front behaviour. Three Nitinol wire-based rotatory actuators, a one-way actuator, a biased actuator, and a two-way actuator, have been designed and tested. The behaviour of these actuators has been simulated by using the phenomenological model that we have developed. The power consumption to operate all actuators was measured. Two simple approaches were proposed to estimate the average power requirements. A preliminary study of a torsional actuator has been made. The general design procedure for Nitinol-based actuators is summarised. The broad aim of this dissertation is also to provide a user's guide to the design of SMA-based actuators.

40|$|International audienceThe {{success of}} the large scale <b>deployment</b> of sensor <b>actuator</b> devices lies in their plug&play capabilities: they should be {{automatically}} discovered and ready to be used when they join to an environment. Self-description and discovery gain therefore a particular importance. Nevertheless, there is currently no largely adopted energy efficient device description and discovery standard. Existing protocols use proprietary device description models and discovery mechanisms that are incompatible between the two. This paper presents LRD 2 (Low Resource Device Description), a generic description model capable of describing different kinds of device information. LRD 2 implements a compression algorithm {{to reduce the size}} of description documents, thus saving energy by reducing the number of messages sent in the network. Experimental results about the performance of LRD 2 are also presented...|$|R
30|$|According to {{reliability}} {{and quantity of}} connected machines, the project METIS divides M 2 M applications into two categories: mMTC and uMTC [24]. mMTC refers to massive MTC and provides connectivity for {{a large number of}} cost and energy-constrained devices. Sensor and <b>actuator</b> <b>deployments</b> can be in a wide area for surveillance and area covering measurements, but also co-located with human users, as in body-area networks. The main attribute of this service is the massive number of connected devices, where the required rates decrease as the number of devices grows significantly. uMTC addresses the needs for ultra-reliable, time-critical services, e.g., V 2 X (vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure) applications and industrial control applications. Both examples require reliable communication, and V 2 X additionally requires fast discovery and communication establishment. The main attribute is high reliability, while the number of devices and the required data rates are relatively low.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of active}} {{controls}} has {{shown to be}} of substantial help in supporting the increasing size of wind turbines by reducing peak stresses and fatigue loads. In this respect, this paper proposes the use of intuitive frequency-based control strategies for reducing loads in wind turbine blades equipped with multi-input multi-output (MIMO) active flow controllers. For that purpose, a loop-shaping approach is considered for analysing the dynamic of actively controlled wind turbine blades. Preliminary aeroelastic simulations are carried out to validate the results. It is shown that the MIMO vibration control problem can effectively be decomposed {{into a number of}} decoupled single-input single-output control problems because of the strong correlation between the dominant aeroelastic blade dynamics and <b>actuator</b> <b>deployments.</b> As a result, it is demonstrated that classical single-input single-output control systems can perform as efficiently as MIMO controllers for damping the aeroelastic dynamics of wind turbine blades...|$|R

40|$|Future {{missions}} to the planets and moons in our Solar System may require new technology. Missions with surface or atmospheric mobility or sample acquisition requirements will need advanced actuation technology {{to operate in}} the extreme environments found in the Solar System. Depending on the specific mission this technology may be required to withstand 10 ’s of Kelvin environments or temperatures exceeding that of Venus (460 o C). In addition the technology may have to withstand high radiation and corrosive environments and pressures ranging from high vacuum to 100 ’s of MPa. These challenging mission requirements push the limit in performance even under terrestrial conditions. Motors for mobility platforms, <b>deployment</b> devices or <b>actuators</b> for sampling tools are required that can operate reliably and deliver substantial torque and power. These devices must be lightweight, compact and operate effectively under extreme conditions.

40|$|The {{performance}} specifications of any actuator are quantified {{in terms of}} an exhaustive list of parameters such as bandwidth, output control authority, etc. Flow-control applications benefit from a known actuator frequency response function that relates the input voltage to the output property of interest (e. g., maximum velocity, volumetric flow rate, momentum flux, etc.). Clearly, the required performance metrics are application specific, and methods are needed to achieve the optimal design of these devices. Design and optimization studies have been conducted for piezoelectric cantilever-type flow control actuators, but the modeling issues are simpler compared to synthetic jets. Here, lumped element modeling (LEM) is combined with equivalent circuit representations to estimate the nonlinear dynamic response of a synthetic jet as a function of device dimensions, material properties, and external flow conditions. These models provide reasonable agreement between predicted and measured frequency response functions and thus are suitable for use as design tools. In this work, we have developed a Matlab-based design optimization tool for piezoelectric synthetic jet actuators based on the lumped element models mentioned above. Significant improvements were achieved by optimizing the piezoceramic diaphragm dimensions. Synthetic-jet actuators were fabricated and benchtop tested to fully document their behavior and validate a companion optimization effort. It is hoped that the tool developed from this investigation will assist in the design and <b>deployment</b> of these <b>actuators...</b>|$|R
40|$|Deep {{drilling}} technologies use MWD (Measuring While Drilling) and LWD (Logging While Drilling) systems {{near the}} drill bit {{in order to}} gather large amounts of directional and geological information. The data are mostly processed downhole. To transmit the main results to the surface in nearly real time a high speed data communication system with more than 100 bit/s is highly advantageous. The most commonly usedprocessfor data transmission in boreholes is the so called mud pulse telemetry. However, mud pulse telemetry systems cannot transmit such high data rates. A significant improvement is expected {{through the use of}} acoustic waves along the drill string for data transmission. In the 1980 s and 1990 s there were some attempts to transmit the downhole data by means of acoustic signals along the metallic drill string to the surface. However, these trials were not much of a success, because the acoustic transmission channel of a real drill string was too complex for the applied modulation schemes. In details, a drill string channel configuration consisting {{of a large number of}} drill pipes and tooljoints with different diameters causes multiple signal reflections and depending on the superimposing of all reflections with the original signal, pass- and stop bands will be created. This limits the achievable data rate, because only thepassbands are suitable for use by data transmission. Moreover, the characteristics of the pass- and stop bands vary with each change in the drill string configuration. Because of such challenging issues, the acoustic transmission process is significantly complex. However, the <b>deployment</b> of new <b>actuators</b> in combination with latest state of the art techniques from mobile communications can overcome the mentioned difficulties. Such techniques enable for instance an adaptive bi-directional communication to be applied, whereby the data transmission can continuously be adapted to the changing channel characteristics. As a first step for the application of the acoustic communication system on a real drill string a prototype systemfor unidirectional communication (uplink transmission) was developed and built up. Due to their relatively large sizes (outer diameter: 11 1 / 4 "), the current prototype components cannot be used in standard deep bottom hole assemblies. However, suitable drill strings for such prototype sizes are found in mining drilling operations, for example with raise bore drilling. Thus, the initial prototype components were designed to be integrated into a raise bore drill string. The highly robust communication concept was developed to allow initial data rates of up to 30 bit/s. The prototype transmitting system consists of two units. The first one is located downhole. It includes a generator, a battery and a transmitter-sub. Furthermore there is the surface unit, which includes a receiver module, a WLAN access point and a terminal computer. The downhole batteiy can be recharged by a downhole alternator, which is driven by the drilling mud. The receiver module is attached to the uppermost drill string element and connected via a WiFi module to the terminal computer. At the surface unit the received data will be decoded and evaluated. The communication system is ready to be tested on a real well to transmit different types of data to the surface and to decode them there. The data to be transmitted during the initial field test will include information about the battery status, the temperature of the downhole unit in addition to dynamic and directional drilling data. In order to test the application limits as well as the robustness of the novel acoustic data transmission system, the influence of different interferences and noise sources on the data transmission quality were to he investigated. Unfortunately, the field trial was delaved several times and in the end cancelled in the scope of this project. But results from laboratory tests are available. During these investigations with the new acoustic communication telemetry system several interfering signals were generated to simulate real operation. Water waspumped through the system and the mechanical interaction between the drill string and the borehole wall was reproduced by rubbing on the drill string with sandpaper and applying hammer scales as well as combinations thereof Although the induced interferences reduced the quality of the data stream, the data transmission along the drill string was still possible in the presence of any kind of interference. The next development step would be the implementation of an adaptive, bi-directional communication system. This already has been built up and tested in the laboratory setup. The bi-directional communication system will significantly increase the transmission rate...|$|R
