2500|$|This stork was {{formerly}} placed {{in its own}} genus Euxenura, but was later reclassified as belonging to Ciconia because of its large morphological and ethological similarity to other storks of this genus. However, the maguari stork most closely resembles both the <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> and the Oriental <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> in morphology and behaviour; and is especially similar to the <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> in its manner of performing the up-down greeting display. Plumage pattern and soft part colourations are also highly similar between these three stork species. Further, phylogenetic analyses based on {{a portion of the}} cytochrome b oxidase gene have suggested that the maguari stork is evolutionarily paired with the <b>white</b> stork-Oriental <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> sister group; although the morphological similarity between the maguari <b>stork</b> and oriental <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> has been considered to be greater than between the <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> and the Oriental <b>white</b> <b>stork.</b> [...] Incidentally, the maguari stork also shares the prominent forkedness of its tail with the woolly-necked stork.|$|R
50|$|The diet of non-{{breeding}} birds {{is similar}} to that of breeding birds, but food items are more often taken from dry areas. <b>White</b> <b>storks</b> wintering in western India have been observed to follow blackbuck to capture insects disturbed by them. Wintering <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> in India sometimes forage along with the woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus). Food piracy has been recorded in India with a rodent captured by a western marsh harrier appropriated by a <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> while Montagu's harrier is known to harass <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> foraging for voles in some parts of Poland.|$|R

40|$|As {{with many}} {{farmland}} bird species, the house sparrow Passer domesticus is declining in Europe, mainly due to intensification of agriculture reducing nest sites and food supplies. During 2002 – 2005, we studied the population size and nest site characteristics of house sparrows breeding within <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> Ciconia ciconia nests {{in a large}} area of agricultural landscape within western Poland. To explain sparrow density within stork nests, we examined characteristics of <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> nests (position, age, productivity) and the farm type around the nest. House sparrow density was greatest in the longest established (and hence larger) <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> nests located on traditionally managed farms. Two recent changes appear to have adverse effects on house sparrows. The first is the intensification of farming {{and the second is}} active management of <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> nests on electric poles to reduce nest size and thus avoid both disruption to the electrical supply and electrocution of <b>white</b> <b>storks.</b> Because the <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> has such a high profile in Poland, there are numerous schemes to conserve and enhance this species. In conclusion, we clearly show that protecting one species can have valuable, although unplanned, benefits to another species of conservation interest, the house sparrow...|$|R
50|$|The <b>white</b> <b>stork's</b> {{preferred}} feeding grounds are grassy meadows, farmland {{and shallow}} wetlands. It avoids areas overgrown with tall grass and shrubs. In the Chernobyl area of northern Ukraine, <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> populations declined after the 1986 nuclear accident there as farmland was succeeded by tall grass shrubs. In parts of Poland, poor natural foraging grounds have forced birds to seek food at rubbish dumps since 1999. <b>White</b> <b>storks</b> {{have also been}} reported foraging in rubbish dumps in the Middle East, North Africa and South Africa.|$|R
40|$|Capsule Accessing extra {{food from}} waste dumps {{increases}} egg volume and hatching mass in <b>White</b> <b>Storks.</b> Aim To test how <b>White</b> <b>Storks</b> vary their investment in egg size, especially in last laid eggs, {{in relation to}} food availability, and to improve {{our understanding of the}} importance of extra feeding on intra-clutch variation. Methods The study was carried out in three <b>White</b> <b>Stork</b> breeding colonies in northern Algeria. Breeding performance was recorded in 70 nests over three years. <b>White</b> <b>Stork</b> colonies situated close to chicken farms were considered {{to be part of a}} ‘pseudo experiment’ where parents had access to extra food. Egg volume, laying order, hatching order and hatching weight were recorded. Results Egg volume and hatching mass in <b>White</b> <b>Storks</b> was significantly greater when they had access to extra food. The reproductive value of last laid eggs (fourth and fifth) doubled when females had access to extra food. Conclusion Laying smaller last eggs within a clutch provides a mechanism to facilitate early brood reduction in the <b>White</b> <b>Stork,</b> and so should be advantageous when food is scarce. On the contrary, when females had access to extra food, last laid eggs were as big as first eggs which suggests egg size variation is adaptable to local conditions.

40|$|Capsule: Although the <b>White</b> <b>Stork</b> avoids {{adverse weather}} {{conditions}} by modifying its arrival and breeding, it cannot avoid extreme weather events during the breeding season. Aims: To show how extreme weather conditions can influence breeding attempts of a large, long-lived species, the <b>White</b> <b>Stork.</b> Methods: We analysed data on arrivals of <b>White</b> <b>Storks</b> in Western Poland from 2005 to 2013 and detailed breeding biology parameters from 2009 to 2013 in relation to weather conditions. We analysed breeding success and breeding failure rate from 1974 to 2013. Results: In years with a cold March <b>White</b> <b>Storks</b> arrived later than when March was warmer. Frost during incubation negatively influenced the hatching success. Extreme weather events caused high late mortality even for nestlings older than 30 days. Data from 27 breeding seasons showed {{a significant increase in}} mean breeding success but also {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of pairs which lost broods in the nestling stage. Conclusion: The <b>White</b> <b>Stork</b> can modify its arrival in response to current weather conditions on the breeding grounds but it cannot respond to extreme weather events. Due to increasing frequency of extreme weather events caused by climate change, <b>White</b> <b>Stork</b> breeding success may decrease in the future...|$|R

40|$|Mating {{calls of}} animals are often {{detected}} by unintended receivers which use sexual signals {{to obtain information}} about the signaller. We investigated whether <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> Ciconia ciconia can eavesdrop mating calls of moor frogs Rana arvalis. <b>White</b> <b>storks</b> are dependent on moor frog abundance in early breeding season. Interspecific eavesdropping by predators is common and well documented in tropical anurans, whereas it is less known in temperate zone. We compared the frequency of approaches of <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> to loudspeakers when frog calls and the song thrush Turdus philomelos songs were simultaneously played back using the later as controls. The loudspeaker broadcasting the calls of male moor frogs clearly attracted <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> at 22 out of 84 nests. The bird songs attracted <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> in only one case. In 19 cases birds left the nest for unknown reasons which were considered as potential foraging movements. The results of this field experiment report a new case of eavesdropping on acoustic signals showing that advertisement calls of temperate moor frogs are an important stimulus for <b>white</b> <b>storks.</b> Communication usually involves the provision of informa-tion by a sender to a receiver. The provision of information is not accidental but occurs only because it benefits the sender (Marler 1977). However, animals can also produce stimuli that are used by other animals to the sender’...|$|R

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 1 st International <b>White</b> <b>Stork</b> Conference celebrado en Zielona Góra (Poland) del 4 al 6 de septiembre de 2014. Recent {{studies by}} our group {{have shown that}} the habitat used by adult storks to forage and the habitat of the colony have an {{influence}} on body condition and at least bacterial pathogen carriage in <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> nestlings. Ring recoveries and satellite transmitter data of juvenile Spanish <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> have shown that regardless of the colony of origin, most juvenile <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> will use landfill sites as food source. Thus we hypothesize that this exposure changes the physical condition and pathogen carriage in these juvenile <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> and that samples taken from injured juvenile storks upon admission to rehabilitation centers will reflect the exposure to these food items. We tested prevalence of avian influenza virus (AIV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Salmonella and Escherichia coli carrying antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and for antibodies against AIV, WNV and NDV in 90 (9 adults and 81 nestlings) free-living individuals from four different colonies with a gradient of exposure to human residues from none to 100...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> is a [...] bird; {{flocks of}} {{thousands}} of individuals have been recorded on migration routes and at wintering areas in Africa. Non-breeding birds gather in groups of 40 or 50 during the breeding season. The smaller dark-plumaged Abdim's stork is often encountered with <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> flocks in southern Africa. Breeding pairs of <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> may gather in small groups to hunt, and colony nesting has been recorded in some areas. However, groups among <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> colonies vary widely in size and the social structure is loosely defined; young breeding storks are often restricted to peripheral nests, while older storks attain higher breeding success while occupying the better quality nests toward the centres of breeding colonies. Social structure and group cohesion is maintained by altruistic behaviours such as allopreening. <b>White</b> <b>storks</b> exhibit this behaviour exclusively at the nest site. Standing birds preen the heads of sitting birds, sometimes these are parents grooming juveniles, and sometimes juveniles preen each other. Unlike most storks, it never adopts a spread-winged posture, though it is known to droop its wings (holding them away from its body with the primary feathers pointing downwards) when its plumage is wet.|$|R

The <b>White</b> <b>Stork</b> in {{its western}} European {{population}} is a colonial species that {{has increased its}} population in Spain considerably due to the availability of rubbish dumps as a continuous reliable food source. We studied four colonies of <b>white</b> <b>storks,</b> situated at (1) a functioning rubbish dump, (2) a closed rubbish dump, (3) a sheep farm, and (4) in a National Park. Faecal samples of 70 storks were collected at the nest, and body condition, blood samples and cloacal swabs were obtained from 103 nestlings at ringing. Nestlings from colonies at rubbish dumps had a significantly better body condition than nestlings from more natural colonies. In contrast methaemoglobulin concentration {{in the blood of}} nestlings from natural colonies was significantly lower in natural populations, indicating exposure to substances causing oxidative stress at rubbish dumps. Further analysis revealed an apparent upregulation of oxidative stress response mechanisms in <b>White</b> <b>Stork</b> nestlings exposed to human residues.
