5000|$|The Justice Department {{launched}} {{a series of}} raids on January 2, 1920, with follow-up operations {{over the next few}} days. Smaller raids extended over the next six weeks. At least 3,000 were arrested, and many others were held for various lengths of time. The entire enterprise replicated the November action on a larger scale, including arrests and seizures without search warrants, as well as detention in overcrowded and unsanitary holding facilities. Hoover later admitted [...] "clear cases of brutality". Some cases in Boston included torture, where detainees were placed in a ‘hot box’ above a furnace and given one glass of water and a slice of bread a day, and kept there for 50 hours. The raids covered more than 30 cities and towns in 23 states, but those west of the Mississippi and south of the Ohio were [...] "publicity gestures" [...] designed to make the effort appear nationwide in scope. Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents arrested everyone found in organization meeting halls, not only arresting non-radical organization members but also visitors who did not belong to a target organization, and sometimes American citizens not eligible for arrest and deportation. In a few weeks, after changes in personnel at the Department of Labor, Palmer faced a new and very independent-minded Acting Secretary of Labor in Assistant Secretary of Labor Louis Freeland Post, who canceled more than 2,000 warrants as being illegal. Of the 10,000 arrested, 3,500 were held by authorities in detention; 556 resident aliens were eventually deported under the Immigration Act of 1918.At a Cabinet meeting in April 1920, Palmer called on Secretary of Labor Wilson to <b>fire</b> <b>Post,</b> but Secretary Wilson defended him.

30|$|The clutter-adapted MYSE, a {{gleaning}} species, {{displayed a}} positive response to prescribed fire. Immediate effects of a single <b>fire,</b> <b>post</b> suppression, include mortality of understory vegetation and small trees (although dependent on fire severity and slope position), and prolific basal sprouting shortly post fire (Elliott et al. 1999). In the absence of midstory clutter, basal sprouts may provide additional substrate for gleaning insects (Ratcliffe 2003). Indeed, Silvis and Gehrt (2016 a); Silvis and Perry (2016 b) found that Myotis were positively related to low-strata vegetative clutter. Several studies also have documented positive fire effects on MYSE roosting habitat (Johnson et al. 2009; Lacki et al. 2009; Ford et al. 2016 a). In all burn conditions, activity had a slightly positive relationship with increased elevation. Because burn intensity is greater on upper slopes (Mladenoff 1999), reductions in clutter that improve foraging condition may have negated previously negative relationships with bat activity and increasing elevation in the central Appalachians at elevations where oak-dominated types are replaced by northern hardwood to the west on the Allegheny Plareau (Ford et al. 2005; Ford et al. 2016 b).|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} the potential for combined cycle generating applications in existing commercial power cycles. By the capture of "waste heat" and application to the hot side of the Stirling engine, thermal energy may be converted to electrical energy, hence increasing through cogeneration the overall output and efficiency of the power generating system. The Rankine and Brayton cycles were analyzed and nodes identified as candidates to insert a Stirling engine as a secondary process. In all cases, {{it was determined that}} the available thermal energy was of such a low grade that it was not feasible to apply Stirling technology to the system without some form of supplemental firing. Comparing additional thermal energy required and added to operate the Stirling system at its highest efficiency, the best candidate for an application of this technology is supplemental firing, post exhaust combustor, adapted to the Brayton cycle. After analysis, it has been determined that "waste" heat recovery from commercial power generating operations is not a viable application of Stirling technology. However, the Stirling system does deserve consideration for smaller scale, scalable or commercial applications, including flue gas recovery and direct <b>fire,</b> <b>post</b> combustor in the Brayton cycle, where temperatures are such that replacing the stack with a Stirling secondary cycle is feasible...|$|E
