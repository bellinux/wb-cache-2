40|$|Both glycosylated and unglycosylated polyproteins coded by the <b>gag</b> gene are {{produced}} in cells infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus.

However, infectivity assays showed that monoubiquitination of HIV- 1 p 6 <b>Gag</b> or MuLV p 12 <b>Gag</b> is not required for viral replication in vitro. Pulse-chase radiolabeling of HIV- 1 -producing cells revealed that monoubiquitination of p 6 <b>Gag</b> does not affect the short-term release of virus from the cell, the maturation of Pr 55 <b>Gag,</b> or the sensitivity of these processes to proteasome inhibitors. Experiments with protease-deficient HIV- 1 showed that Pr 55 <b>Gag</b> can be monoubiquitinated, suggesting that p 6 <b>Gag</b> is first modified as a domain within <b>Gag.</b> Examination of the proteins inside an HIV- 1 mutant found that free ubiquitin was incorporated into the virions in the absence of the lysines in p 6 <b>Gag,</b> showing that the ubiquitin inside the virus is not initially brought in as a p 6 <b>Gag</b> conjugate.

Particle budding was observed at the surfaces of cells expressing SIVagm and SIVmnd <b>Gags,</b> but cells expressing HIV- 2 and SIVmac <b>Gags</b> showed only membrane-ruffling structures, although they were accompanied with electron-dense submembrane layers, suggesting arrest at an early stage of particle budding.

40|$|Myristoylation {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) <b>Gag</b> protein is essential for membrane targeting of <b>Gag</b> and production of viral particles. We show here that coexpression of wild-type and nonmyristoylated forms of HIV <b>Gag</b> resulted in severe inhibition of viral particle production, indicating that the nonmyristoylated counterpart had a dominant negative effect on particle release. When coexpressed, the nonmyristoylated <b>Gag</b> partially incorporated into membrane and lipid raft fractions, likely through coassembly with the wild-type <b>Gag.</b> The membrane and raft associations of the wild-type <b>Gag</b> appeared unaffected, and yet particle production was severely impaired. When viral particles produced from the coexpressing cells were analyzed, the wild-type <b>Gag</b> was more abundant than the nonmyristoylated <b>Gag.</b> Confocal microscopy showed that both forms of <b>Gag</b> were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of coexpressing cells but that {{a portion of the}} wild-type <b>Gag</b> population was accumulated in EEA 1 - and CD 63 -positive endosomes.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>Gag</b> capsid (CA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} conserved {{proteins}} in highly-diversified human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV). Understanding the limitations imposed on amino acid sequences in CA could provide valuable information for vaccine immunogen design or anti-HIV drug development. Here, by comparing two pathogenic SIV strains, SIVmac 239 and SIVsmE 543 - 3, we found critical amino acid residues for functional interaction between the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains in CA. Results We first examined the impact of <b>Gag</b> residue 205, aspartate (<b>Gag</b> 205 D) in SIVmac 239 and glutamate (<b>Gag</b> 205 E) in SIVsmE 543 - 3, on viral replication; due to this difference, <b>Gag</b> 206 - 216 (IINEEAADWDL) epitope-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were previously shown to respond to SIVmac 239 but not SIVsmE 543 - 3 infection. A mutant SIVmac 239, SIVmac 239 <b>Gag</b> 205 E, whose <b>Gag</b> 205 D is replaced with <b>Gag</b> 205 E showed lower replicative ability. Interestingly, however, SIVmac 239 <b>Gag</b> 205 E passaged in macaque T cell culture often resulted in selection of an additional mutation at <b>Gag</b> residue 340, a change from SIVmac 239 valine (<b>Gag</b> 340 V) to SIVsmE 543 - 3 methionine (<b>Gag</b> 340 M), with recovery of viral fitness. Structural modeling analysis suggested possible intermolecular interaction between the <b>Gag</b> 205 residue in the N-terminal domain and <b>Gag</b> 340 in the C-terminal in CA hexamers. The <b>Gag</b> 205 D-to-Gag 205 E substitution in SIVmac 239 resulted in loss of in vitro core stability, which was recovered by additional <b>Gag</b> 340 V-to-Gag 340 M substitution. Finally, selection of <b>Gag</b> 205 E plus <b>Gag</b> 340 M mutations, but not <b>Gag</b> 205 E alone was observed in a chronically SIVmac 239 -infected rhesus macaque eliciting <b>Gag</b> 206 - 216 -specific CTL responses. Conclusions These results present in vitro and in vivo evidence implicating the interaction between <b>Gag</b> residues 205 in CA NTD and 340 in CA CTD in SIV replication. Thus, this study indicates a structural constraint for functional interaction between SIV CA NTD and CTD, providing insight into immunogen design to limit viral escape options. </p...|$|R

This glycoprotein, termed gP 45 <b>gag,</b> was also shown to contain a single tryptic peptide also present in gPr 80 <b>gag</b> and its unglycosylated apoprotein precursor Pr 75 <b>gag,</b> but lacking in Pr 65 <b>gag</b> or Pr 40 <b>gag.</b> The presence of this peptide only in viral precursor proteins containing the so-called leader (L) sequence strongly suggests that gPr 45 <b>gag</b> is an N-terminal fragment of larger glycosylated <b>gag</b> polyproteins, composed of L sequences in addition to p 15 and p 12. The kinetics of appearance of radiolabeled gPr 45 <b>gag</b> and its disappearance during chase-incubation is suggestive of a precursor-like role for this intermediate gene product. An observed 27, 000 -Mr glycosylated polypeptide, termed gP 27 <b>gag</b> and containing p 15 but not p 12, p 30, or p 10 antigenic determinants, is a candidate cleavage product derived from gPr 45 <b>gag.</b> These observations suggest that gPr 45 <b>gag</b> and its putative cleavage product gP 27 <b>gag</b> represent an authentic pathway for intracellular processing of glycosylated core proteins...|$|R
