2500|$|Wang Daliang, a China Youth University for Political Sciences {{linguistics}} scholar, {{said that}} [...] "Using obscure names to avoid <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> {{or to be}} unique is not good. Now {{a lot of people}} are perplexed by their names. The computer cannot even recognize them and people cannot read them. This has become an obstacle in communication." [...] Zhou Youyong, the dean of the Southeast University law school, argued that the ability to choose the name of one's children is a fundamental right, so the PRC government should be careful when making new naming laws.|$|E
50|$|Corinth is an unincorporated {{community}} and coal town in Preston County, West Virginia, United States. Corinth was originally called Spencer but was changed in 1890 to avoid <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> in the state. It {{is named after}} the ancient Greek city of Corinth.|$|E
5000|$|Also under USATF is the Masters Hall of Fame, {{created in}} 1996 and the Officials Hall of Fame created in 2007. The {{membership}} {{of those two}} halls are selected by separate committees of those divisions of USATF for separate achievements in those divisions. [...] As such, there is some <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> Those members currently exist as a list of honored names, but have no physical representation at the hall in New York City.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species was}} called by the common name Alabama heelsplitter in the {{standard}} reference, Turgeon, 1998. Because another species Lasmigona alabamensis was also given that same name in that publication, this <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>name</b> caused some confusion. Therefore the common <b>name</b> <b>of</b> this species was subsequently changed to [...] "inflated heelsplitter".|$|R
5000|$|A common {{argument}} for the metric system is that it avoids <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> and the associated confusion. The most commonly cited example is pound (force) vs pound (mass), which have the same symbol and are both commonly written simply as [...] "pounds", {{which can lead to}} costly and dangerous shipping and engineering errors. Opponents of metrication point out that this issue only occurs due to misuse; when used 'properly', there is no cause for confusion.|$|R
50|$|North Haven {{originally}} {{started as}} a private sub-division in Section 769 in the cadastral unit of Hundred of Port Adelaide. Its creation in 1976 was originally opposed by the Postmaster General of Australia due to “size & <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>name</b> else in Australia.” Its boundaries have been altered as follows since 1976 - boundary with the suburb of Outer Harbor, addition of land from the suburb of Osborne and other ‘unnamed land’, {{and the addition of}} a ‘portion of Outer Harbor’ in February 2007.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{originally}} planned {{to name the}} station after the village. However, the operating company also had a station at Newbiggin, Temple Sowerby, {{only a few miles}} away, and it was thought that the <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> would cause confusion with ticketing and operational matters. Accordingly, the station was named Blencow (without a final ‘e.') It {{was one of the first}} on the line to be illuminated by [...] "modern" [...] acetylene lights.|$|E
5000|$|At {{about the}} same time, the {{commander}} of Cantonment Reno asked his superiors that his Cantonment be renamed [...] "Cantonment or Camp McKinney." [...] This was because mail for Cantonment Reno was being mixed up with mail directed to Fort Reno (Oklahoma). On August 30, 1877, the War Department officially renamed Cantonment Reno as Fort McKinney. This <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> has led to endless confusion over the years between Fort McKinney 1 (Cantonment Reno) and Fort McKinney 2, Fort McKinney (Wyoming).|$|E
5000|$|Samuel Moss Solomon (c. 1769 - 13 May 1842) was {{an early}} Jewish settler in Australia, amongst whose {{descendants}} many achieved a degree of notability. The relationship between these descendants is complicated by three factors: the <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>names,</b> not only within a family line but across lines; the number of intra-family marriages; and marriages to people with the same surname but not closely related. This list is not exhaustive but includes most family members {{likely to be found}} in Wikipedia and Australian newspapers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{appearance}} of [...] "Haida Heritage Site" [...] {{in both the}} <b>names</b> <b>of</b> the national park reserve and the marine reserve is a <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>name,</b> but not <b>of</b> reference. As {{part of the national}} park reserve name, it refers to the terrestrial portion of the site. As part of the marine reserve name, it refers to the marine portion of the site. Still, there are areas of the heritage site - both land and sea - which are outside both federal reserves. These are all in the northernmost parts of the site.|$|R
50|$|The land {{occupying the}} extent of the Alton Downs {{pastoral}} lease was gazetted as a locality in April 2013 under the name 'Alton Downs Station' with the word ‘Station’ being added to avoid <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> a locality in Queensland.|$|R
50|$|This {{prompted}} the Danish philologist and historian Gudmund Schütte {{to assume that}} Ziridava and Zurobara {{are one and the}} same. This idea is deemed erroneous alongside many other assumed <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> <b>names,</b> by the Romanian historian and archaeologist Vasile Pârvan in his work Getica. Pârvan reviewed all localities mentioned in Ptolemy's Geographia, analyzing and verifying all data available to him at the time. He points out that Ziri and Zuro (meaning water) are the roots of two different Geto-Dacian words. Additionally, Ptolemy provided different coordinates for the two towns, some medieval maps created based on his Geographia depict two distinct towns.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the winter}} of 1813-1814, Wolfe was rearmed, with her {{original}} medley of guns being replaced by seven long 24-pounder and eighteen long 18-pounder guns. In January 1814, the Royal Navy formally took over ownership of the Great Lakes squadron from the British Army, and all the vessels {{were added to the}} Navy List. To avoid <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> already on the list, several of the vessels were renamed. Wolfe was renamed Montreal on 22 January 1814. Upon entering Royal Navy service, the vessel was reclassified a sixth rate. As the British had also completed two frigates during the winter, Montreal ceased to be the British flagship and command of the vessel passed to Commander Francis Spilsbury.|$|E
5000|$|Harrison Point {{is a point}} {{marked by}} a string of off-lying rocks, lying 1.5 nmi km west of Busen Point {{on the south side}} of Stromness Bay, South Georgia. It was charted in 1927 by Discovery Investigations (DI) {{personnel}} and named [...] "Matthews Point" [...] for L. Harrison Matthews, a British zoologist and member of the DI staff, 1924-35, who worked at South Georgia in 1924-27. In 1954, the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee recommended that this name be altered to Harrison Point to avoid duplication with Matthews Point (also named for L. Harrison Matthews), a better known feature in Undine Harbour, South Georgia. This change allows Matthews' name to be retained for this feature, while the confusing <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> is avoided.|$|E
50|$|The Danish philologist and {{historian}} Gudmund Schütte {{believed that the}} town with similar name Ziridava, also mentioned by Ptolemy and also missing from Tabula Peutingeriana, was the same with Zurobara. This idea is deemed erroneous alongside many other assumed <b>duplications</b> <b>of</b> <b>names,</b> by the Romanian historian and archaeologist Vasile Pârvan in his work Getica. Pârvan reviewed all localities mentioned in Ptolemy's Geographia, analyzing and verifying all data available {{to him at the}} time.

50|$|In 1911 the Postmaster General raised {{concern about}} the <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> town <b>names</b> in Australia, {{including}} Waverley. Alternative names such as Wongi (the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> a nearby soak) and Siberia. The locals preferred Siberia and the name was officially gazetted in 1914. The name comes from Siberia Tank, a water supply that {{is close to the}} town.|$|R
5000|$|Dorman Island is {{an island}} in the Johnstone Strait region of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, located between West and East Cracroft Islands {{on the north side of}} the isthmus that joins them at low tide. [...] Until 1940, this, with Farquharson Island, was one <b>of</b> a group <b>named</b> the Double Islands, being renamed to avoid <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>name</b> elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} roads like this {{throughout}} the area, leading to <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> in different counties. In Fulton, [...] "Roswell Road" [...] refers to Georgia 9 through northern Atlanta and across Sandy Springs, {{in addition to}} the above-mentioned use in Cobb, for example. Numeric street addressing is done by county as well, with the origin usually being at one corner of the town square in the county seat. The U.S. Postal Service ignores these actual and logical boundaries however, overlapping ZIP codes and their associated place names across counties. The Cumberland/Galleria area has Cobb's numbers and an [...] "SE" [...] suffix, but is called [...] "Atlanta" [...] by the USPS (despite being Vinings, which the USPS ironically calls [...] "unacceptable"), which can confuse visitors to think it is far away in southeast Atlanta.|$|E
5000|$|Sooty Rock (...) is a rock {{midway between}} Lumus Rock and Betheder Islands in Wilhelm Archipelago. Discovered and named [...] "Black Reef" [...] by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE), 1934-37. Resighted from HMS Endurance in February 1969 and {{described}} as a rock about 20 m high. The synonym Sooty was recommended by United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) to avoid <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>name</b> Black Rock.|$|R
50|$|The land {{occupying the}} extent of the Mount Victor {{pastoral}} lease was gazetted as a locality by the Government of South Australia on 26 April 2013 under the name 'Mount Victor Station'. The term 'station' was added to prevent <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> the locality <b>name</b> within Australia.|$|R
50|$|In {{general the}} reason for this lack of {{allowance}} for duplicate names through hierarchical directory placement, is that Microsoft primarily relies on the principles of NetBIOS, which is a flat-file method of network object management that for Microsoft software, goes {{all the way back to}} Windows NT 3.1 and MS-DOS LAN Manager. Allowing for <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> object <b>names</b> in the directory, or completely removing the use <b>of</b> NetBIOS <b>names,</b> would prevent backward compatibility with legacy software and equipment. However, disallowing duplicate object names in this way is a violation of the LDAP RFCs on which Active Directory is supposedly based.|$|R
5000|$|Trooz Glacier (...) is {{a glacier}} 1.5 {{nautical}} miles (2.8 km) wide at its mouth and some 15 nautical miles (28 km) long on Kiev Peninsula in Graham Land, flowing west {{into the north}} part of Collins Bay. Discovered by the French Antarctic Expedition, 1908-10. Named for J. de Trooz, Belgian Minister of the Interior and Public Instruction, who was instrumental in procuring funds for {{the publication of the}} scientific results of the Belgian Antarctic Expedition, 1897-99. This application was suggested by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic <b>Names</b> (US-ACAN) because <b>of</b> <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>name</b> Trooz for what is now known as Cape Perez.|$|R
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, the British {{government}} {{announced that the}} heavy cruiser [...] (a sister ship to Canberra, but of the London subclass) would {{be transferred to the}} RAN as a gift. Although King George VI had announced that the ship would be renamed Canberra, the <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> ship <b>names</b> with the United States Navy was against RAN policy. Although it was thought that Australia had a greater claim to the name, the Australian government decided to retain Shropshires old name after learning that the US offer had come directly from President Roosevelt. Many of the first Australian sailors posted to Shropshire in early 1943 were Canberra survivors.|$|R
50|$|Prior to January 30, 1922, Calvert {{was known}} as Caplin Bay, {{sometimes}} spelled Capelin Bay. It {{is said to have}} been named for the large number of capelin that were fished by its early settlers. As several other Newfoundland communities had similar names, and in light of the necessities of the postal service, the Newfoundland Nomenclature Board, in the early 20th century, made efforts to reduce <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> place <b>names.</b> It responded favourably to a 1922 petition collected by the parish priest of Ferryland, Father Alfred Maher to change the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the settlement in honour of Sir George Calvert, First Baron Baltimore, and founder, in the early seventeenth century, of the Colony of Avalon at what is now nearby Ferryland.|$|R
50|$|Alcock Island is {{an island}} lying west of Charles Point in Hughes Bay, off {{the west coast of}} Graham Land. The name Penguin Island was used for the feature by whalers {{operating}} in the area in 1922. Since this name has not been used on published maps and is a <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> an earlier <b>name,</b> it has been rejected and a new name substituted. Alcock Island is for Sir John W. Alcock (1892 - 1919), who, with Sir Arthur Whitten Brown, made the first nonstop trans-Atlantic flight on June 14 - 15, 1919.|$|R
5000|$|One {{interesting}} {{side effect}} {{of the fact that}} the Potteries' six towns and Smallthorne were administratively separate was the <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> many street <b>names.</b> This led to significant confusion after unification. Thus, in the early 1950s a large number of streets had to be renamed. In Smallthorne twenty streets were given new names, including Ford Green Road (formerly Leek Road), Coseley Street (formerly Edward Street) and Preston Street (formerly Wedgwood Street). The actual date for the name changes in Smallthorne can be found in several documents and is shown to be 27 August 1951 ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1923 both Clifton Hills {{and nearby}} Kanowana Station were still owned by G and E. A. Brooks. The {{holdings}} had a combined area of 7000000 acre and were stocked with approximately 20,000 head of shorthorn cattle. Hector Brooks owned {{the property in}} 1960 and {{were the first to}} sell cattle at Gepps Cross using the beef roads concept. The cattle, a consignment of 53 bullocks, were transported by truck down the Birdsville Track to the railhead at Marree. This was the first time road transport had been used along the track. The land occupying the extent of the Clifton Hills pastoral lease was gazetted as a locality in April 2013 under the name Clifton Hills Station with the word Station included to [...] "prevent <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> locality <b>name</b> within Australia.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> ship <b>names</b> {{with the}} United States Navy was against RAN policy, {{and it was}} {{initially}} felt that Australia had a greater claim to the name. Protests in favour of retaining Shropshires original name were received from the British elements of the ship's company, who felt that renaming a ship after one that had recently been sunk was inviting bad luck, and from citizens of the ship's namesake, which had adopted the cruiser in a Warship Week earlier that year, and thought that Shropshires history and links to the community were being discarded without thought. One letter proposed, that the ship be named [...] "HMAS Canberra (the gift of HMS) Shropshire" [...] in order to retain the old name. The Australian government decided to retain Shropshires old name after learning that the US offer had come directly from President Roosevelt.|$|R

50|$|The 5th USCC {{remained}} on duty {{for almost a}} year after the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House. On 16 March 1866, the 5th USCC held its final formation in Helena, Arkansas where the fifty missing soldiers from the first battle of Saltville were recognized. Although the likely location for the murdered black soldiers at Wiley Hall would be what is now the Holston Cemetery on Campus, this cannot be proven. Repetitious names from similar units, such as a John Willis of both the Federal and Confederate 5th Kentucky Regiment, bring some doubt as to the accuracy of the marking of the Confederate graves on the campus. This happens on several occasions, and may be due to <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> a <b>name,</b> or the mislabeling of a grave. Many soldiers of the 5th USCC, who were scraped together from former slaves, freedmen, and liberated slaves, paid the ultimate price for their long-fought freedom.|$|R
5000|$|Three Algonquin tribes - Potawatomi, Ojibwa, and Ottawa - met {{each year}} on the middle fork of the Rouge River {{at the site of}} Nankin Mills to {{establish}} hunting territories.

Bucklin Township included what are now the cities of Westland, Livonia, Garden City, Inkster, Wayne, Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Redford Township. In 1829, it was proposed that Bucklin Township be divided into Lima and Richland. Due to name conflicts under territorial law prohibiting <b>duplication</b> <b>of</b> post office <b>names,</b> the bill was amended; Lima was renamed Nankin Township, after the Chinese city Nanking, and Richland was renamed Pekin Township, after Peking.|$|R
