Full scale experiment is implemented and three fire sources are set in the nacelle away from front fire wall of 1 / 4 position, 1 / 2 position and 3 / 4 position, respectively.

40|$|As a {{suitable}} {{candidate for the}} next halon alternative gaseous fire-extinguishing agent, it is very meaningful to investigate how to improve the fire-extinguishing capacity of hot aerosol fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> for local fires. When fire breaks out, the actual fire location is unpredictable, and the extinguishing efficiency of hot aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> will be observably affected by the fire locations due to different flame patterns and intensities at different fire locations. In this work, {{the use of the}} hot aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> in suppressing oil fires at different locations, including open, partially open, and fully closed locations, has been investigated in order to obtain the regularity of the effectiveness of the hot aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> in suppressing a local fire. The results have shown that the hot aerosol <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> is more effective in suppressing an oil fire in a fully closed system than in an open system or partially open system. The shortest fire-extinguishing time was for the fire in the corner, followed by the one in the middle, and the fire against the wall took the longest time to extinguish for fire locations in a partially open system and a fully closed system, respectively. In addition, the fire extinguishing process involves varying degrees of flame enhancements. Sredstva za gašenje požara vrućim aerosolom moguća su zamjena za halone.

The agents studied were: bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301), pentafluoroethane (HFC 125), heptafluoropropane (HFC 227 ea) and dodecafluoro- 2 -methyl-pentane- 3 -one (C 6 F-ketone). In the tests, the studied agent was introduced into a propane flame in a diffusion flame burner. The combustion products were analysed using both conventional IR-techniques and FTIR. It could {{be concluded that}} for all four <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> that the <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> takes part in the combustion process resulting in production of CO and CO 2, which was also confirmed by the increase in smoke production with increasing amounts of agent introduced into the flame. Production of HF and COF 2 was found in experiments with all four <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents.</b> In experiments with Halon 1301, the production of HBr was also determined.

The recovery of fluorine as HF and COF 2 for the C 6 F-ketone is lower compared to HFC 227 ea and HFC 125.

40|$|With highly {{accelerated}} {{developments in}} computing and communications technology, society's overall dependence on this equipment {{is becoming increasingly}} acute. In areas such as critical electronic data processing centres and telecommunication hubs, {{one of the main}} protection objectives is to achieve minimum operational disruption, as downtime resulting from a fire condition could lead to huge financial losses. Minimising negative impact on an organization and the need for a sound basis in the decision making process are the fundamental reasons why companies implement fire risk management for their essential information technology systems. For many years a key element used to protect these critical assets was the installation of a fixed Halon 1301 gas extinguishing system. Often, the mere presence of a computer was sufficient justification to install such a system and little thought was given to any systematic fire risk assessment of the installation. This led to the use of Halon 1301 where other fire extinguishing systems and protection techniques could have been applied with equal effectiveness and at comparable costs. The cessation of production of halon {{as a result of the}} Montreal Protocol gave fresh impetus to the development of suitable alternative fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents.</b> It also offered fire protection engineers an opportunity to re-evaluate existing loss control techniques and to examine alternative fire protection strategies. However, it is argued in this study, that an appropriate level of automatic fire protection can only be determined by the use of a suitable quantitative risk assessment and a number of such methodologies are critically examined. There are a significant number of contributing factors that must be considered when deciding which fire suppression system to select for a new installation or whether to retrofit fire suppression on a legacy platform. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a methodology to quantify any fire suppression technology by its life cycle cost and then to apply informed technical opinion into this system. The results of this assessment procedure offer a number of possible fire engineering solutions including a quite diverse range of automatic fire extinguishing techniques and these are discussed and evaluated in detail. Inevitably, a high proportion of such critical risks will require the installation of an automatic fire suppression system. The main halocarbon and inert replacement <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> are therefore critically compared and contrasted for their suitability in protecting these facilities. A complete review of these <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> was conducted which focused on suppression mechanisms; quantification of their performance and qualities; interaction with a fire and potential damage to electrical equipment from the release of a given agent. It is shown that all the post-halon <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> are deficient in some important areas. Major issues such as the formation of thermal decomposition products, the protection of continuously energized electrical circuits and the adequacy of the specified design and extinguishing concentrations have generally not been adequately addressed. Unfortunately, some of these issues are not even resolved in the current <b>gaseous</b> fire <b>extinguishing</b> standards which offer minimal advice from either a design or installation standpoint. This study demonstrates that existing international design standards are deficient in some fundamental areas and that, in a number of circumstances, systems installed to these standards are inadequate to fully protect the hazard in question. A number of recommendations are presented to address some of these deficiencies. Finally, a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology for the selection of suitable <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agents</b> is proposed. Initially, this attempts to synthesize the results derived from the critical <b>extinguishing</b> <b>agent</b> review and then applies an application weighting factor based on expert consensus to provide a final score for a particular suppression mechanisms suitability to protect a given application...|$|R

Effects of the mixing phenomenon were investigated by considering two possible extremes using infinitely fast and infinitely slow mixing models. The heat loss variation was also studied under isothermal and adiabatic conditions.
