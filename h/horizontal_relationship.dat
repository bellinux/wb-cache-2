40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the issue of {{horizontal}} effect of human rights, i. e. whether and how they affect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals in private law relationships. With the development of society associated with expansion of the catalogue {{of human rights and}} with strengthening of their protection, we are witnessing infiltration of human rights into other legal areas than they were present in previously. This raises many questions about their application in such areas, especially questions about the holders of the obligations resulting from those rights. The thesis is divided into three chapters. In the introductory chapter the author describes the theoretical basis of human rights, the concept, development, and especially their specific nature and function compared to conventional legal norms, which is relevant for subsequent correct understanding of their application in <b>horizontal</b> <b>relationships,</b> which is the theme of the second chapter of the thesis. In the second chapter, the author focuses on the horizontal effect of human rights itself.

50|$|Most demoicracy {{scholarship}} is abstract, {{and very little}} {{has been done to}} flesh out what an actual demoicracy should look like. Yet there are few practical claims that seem shared by all of the commentators. The first is the reliance on networks as agents of democracy beyond the nation-state where discourses are not mediated by states or nationality. The second is the active participation of citizens in these networks so that they are involved in the decision-making, deliberations and contestation at every level. All demoicrats would emphasise the importance of horizontal relationships between citizens, organisations and institutions from the different demoi on issues of their collective governance or on the governance of other states. Rights and legitimate interests of citizens are not limited to their own demos/polity but are extended across the borders to what is usually considered internal affairs of the other polities and people. This <b>horizontal</b> <b>relationship</b> is what distinguishes a demoicracy from a federation where the internal affairs of a federal unit are insulated from external contestation at least horizontally.|$|E

Noisy environment {{is one of the}} physical issues and relationship between the management and employees is one of the non physical issues. The aforementioned issues signified that PT.

40|$|Abstract Background At present, the {{organization}} of system modules is typically limited to either a multilevel hierarchy that describes the "vertical" relationships between modules at different levels (e. g., module A at level two is included in module B at level one), or a single-level graph that represents the "horizontal" relationships among modules (e. g., genetic interactions between module A and module B). Both types of organizations fail to provide a broader and deeper view of the complex systems that arise from an integration of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>relationships.</b> Results We propose a complex network analysis tool, Pyramabs, which was developed to integrate vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>relationships</b> and extract information at various granularities to create a pyramid from a complex system of interacting objects. The pyramid depicts the nested structure implied in a complex system, and shows the vertical relationships between abstract networks at different levels. In addition, at each level the abstract network of modules, which are connected by weighted links, represents the modules' <b>horizontal</b> <b>relationships.</b> We first tested Pyramabs on hierarchical random networks to verify its ability to find the module organization pre-embedded in the networks. We later tested it on a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and a metabolic network. According to Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the vertical relationships identified from the PPI and metabolic pathways correctly characterized the inclusion (i. e., part-of) <b>relationship,</b> and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>relationships</b> provided a good indication of the functional closeness between modules. Our experiments with Pyramabs demonstrated its ability to perform knowledge mining in complex systems. Conclusions Networks are a flexible and convenient method of representing interactions in a complex system, and an increasing amount of information in real-world situations is described by complex networks. We considered the analysis of a complex network as an iterative process for extracting meaningful information at multiple granularities from a system of interacting objects. The quality of {{the interpretation of the}} networks depends on the completeness and expressiveness of the extracted knowledge representations. Pyramabs was designed to interpret a complex network through a disclosure of a pyramid of abstractions. The abstraction pyramid is a new knowledge representation that combines vertical and horizontal viewpoints at different degrees of abstraction. Interpretations in this form are more accurate and more meaningful than multilevel dendrograms or single-level graphs. Pyramabs can be accessed at [URL]. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{tree of life}} is the {{classical}} representation of the evolutionary relationships between existent species. A tree is appropriate to display the divergence of species through mutation, i. e. by vertical descent. However, lateral gene transfer (LGT) is excluded from such representations. When LGT contribution to genome evolution cannot be neglected (e. g. for prokaryotes and mobile genetic elements), the tree becomes misleading. Networks appear as an intuitive way to represent both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>relationships,</b> while overlapping groups within such graphs {{are more suitable for}} their classification. Here, we describe a method to represent both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>relationships.</b> We start with a set of genomes whose coded proteins have been grouped into families based on sequence similarity. Next, all pairs of genomes are compared, counting the number of proteins classified into the same family. From this comparison, we derive a weighted graph where genomes with a significant number of similar proteins are linked. Finally, we apply a two-step clustering of this graph to produce a classification where nodes can be assigned to multiple clusters. The procedure can be performed using the Network Analysis Tools (NeAT) website. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. SCOPUS: ar. kinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

When consumers face switching costs, firms have strong incentives to offer bargain prices {{to lock in}} consumers whom they can exploit in the future. A future merger reduces a firm’s incentive to gain current market share, however, because the firm anticipates sharing future profits. Focusing on near-term profit, it chooses pre-merger prices higher than prices absent a merger. This obtains for both horizontally related and unrelated merging partners. Mergers are profitable in both cases. Price dynamics depend on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>relationship.</b> These results have implications for empirical work on mergers...|$|E
