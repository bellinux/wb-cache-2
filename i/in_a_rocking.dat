25|$|Unlike {{the psychic}} Edgar Cayce, whose syntax when {{speaking}} in trance was antiquated and convoluted, Roberts' syntax and sentence structures were modern and clear when speaking as Seth. Roberts often sat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> chair during sessions, {{and she would}} occasionally smoke cigarettes and sip beer or wine. Afterwards, she claimed to not remember {{the contents of the}} session, and she would often read the transcript or ask what Seth had said.|$|E

In 2000, several workers installing a new organ left the church in rush after seeing an apparition in the sanctuary. It was believed by {{some members of the}} church to be the ghost of William McVickar.|$|E

25|$|Alice Mitchell, née Johnson — Dennis' stay-at-home mother Alice {{is usually}} the reassuring figure Dennis can run to when things get too overwhelming, ready to greet him with a warm hug. Although she grew up among animals on a chicken ranch, a running gag is that Alice Mitchell has a phobia of snakes. Another running gag {{involves}} Dennis's ever-changing parade of new babysitters: no one will take the job twice. Alice is also known for punishing Dennis's misbehavior by having him sit in the corner <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> chair for timeout, although {{a couple of times}} she has instituted tougher disciplinary measures such as spanking, where afterward Dennis is shown crying or grumbling about the adversity.|$|E
500|$|The soprano aria is a prayer, [...] "" [...] (Consider us with Your love)‘’ (‘Think of us {{with your}} love’) for [...] "God’s future providence", {{described}} by Hofmann as [...] "a musical display piece full of warmth and tenderness <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> siciliano rhythm. For long stretches in the vocal sections, Bach does without a continuo accompaniment (thus without the instrumental bass register) – a tactic that effectively contributes to creating a sonic impression of tenderness and charm".|$|E

500|$|Potter was {{an admirer}} of American author Joel Chandler Harris and created a series of plates in the 1890s for his Uncle Remus stories, {{possibly}} {{in an attempt to}} find career direction. So deep was her admiration, Lear speculates the scene of Miss Moppet wrapping her head in the duster comes from a similar scene in an Uncle Remus tale in which Br'er Fox [...] "feigns illness <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> chair, wrapped up with flannel". Potter was modeling her sketches from a young kitten and, wanting not to show cruelty, she wrote of the kitten: [...] "She should catch him by the tail / less unpleasant". Children's literature scholar Peter Hunt writes that Potter was careful to protect her young audience from graphic details and she refused to depict death in her stories.|$|E
500|$|The Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) {{was built}} in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman. The house was sold in 1767 to a wealthy widow, Cassandra Chew, who {{constructed}} a kitchen in the rear in 1767, and a second floor between 1767 and 1775, and a third floor in the 1790s. It remained in private hands for almost two centuries, used as a home and place of business, until the federal government purchased it in 1953 [...] An exceptionally large number of spirits, residents and visitors claim, inhabit the small house. These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase {{and also in the}} kitchen, a man with long blond hair and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing in the master bedroom, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair {{running up and down the}} staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman. The laughter of invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed. The Old Stone House may also contain one of Washington's only malevolent spirits, nicknamed [...] "George," [...] who has choked and pushed visitors and whose presence (often indicated by an extremely cold spot) leaves witnesses with an intense feeling of dread. The hauntings at the Old Stone House are so well known that they were mentioned in Sandi Wilson's short crime story, [...] "The Blonde in Black." ...|$|E

[...] "We don't propose to sit here <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> chair with our hands folded and let the Communist set up any government in the western hemisphere," [...] Johnson said.

Her tombstone, with Baskin's inscription, reads [...] "Through her writing she endeared herself {{to the people of}} the world." [...] Rawlings' reputation has managed to outlive those of many of her contemporaries. A posthumously-published children's book, The Secret River, won a Newbery Honor in 1956, and movies were made, long after her death, of her story [...] "Gal Young 'Un", and her semi-fictionalized memoir Cross Creek (Norton Baskin, then in his eighties, made a cameo appearance in the latter movie as a man sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> chair).|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{cover is}} {{a photo of}} Amos holding a large rifle, sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rocking</b> chair {{on the porch of}} an old wooden building. One of her legs is out of her pants and flung {{over the side of the}} chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch. The image is a nod to her song [...] "Me and a Gun," [...] which appears on the album Little Earthquakes and recounts a rape she sustained. [...] "Well, it's [...] a {{reference}} to Me and a Gun, a song I wrote that was on Little Earthquakes. And the idea that there's a dead cock on my right and alive snake on my left. And the idea is that death and life... creation... what it's taken me to get here with men, and I don't want to be angry anymore. And you turn it over and you put the gun down, but I'm not pretending what it's taken to get me here. But no more resentment." [...] It was taken by Cindy Palmano in October 1995 in New Orleans.|$|E
