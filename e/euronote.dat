50|$|Euro debt {{securities}} are securities issued internationally outside their domestic market in a denomination {{different from that}} of the issuer's domicile. They include eurobonds and euronotes. Eurobonds are characteristically underwritten, and not secured, and interest is paid gross. A <b>euronote</b> may take the form of euro-commercial paper (ECP) or euro-certificates of deposit.|$|E
40|$|Since early 1984, note {{issuance}} facilities (NIFs) have {{in considerable}} degree replaced syndicated Eurocurrency bank credits in international credit markets, especially for borrowers in industrial countries, because borrowers have found it cheaper to bypass bank syndications and obtain funds more directly by issuing <b>Euronotes.</b> Factors behind this include an increasing awareness of borrowing possibilities, more freedom for Japanese investors to buy foreign securities, {{a drop in the}} relative popularity of bank obligations with investors, and banks' desire to slow asset growth to improve capital ratios.; Measurement of the cost savings to borrowers on NIFs as compared with Eurocredits is difficult because of limited comparison possibilities. Most NIFs arranged so far have not been drawn on through issuance of notes, and few of the actual issuers have arranged LIBOR-priced Eurocredits recently. In the 12 cases, as of mid- 1985, where meaningful comparisons could be made, it appears that the cost savings to the borrowers ranged from about 10 to around 50 basis points. All of the savings were in the interest spread, where the NIFs appear to have been about 15 to 55 basis points cheaper. Fee costs were slightly higher on NIFs than on Eurocredits; although front-end fees are lower, the total fee costs for NIFs are higher because of the annual facility fee paid to banks that underwrite the NIF. ...|$|R
40|$|Very {{little has}} been written about the cost {{competitiveness}} of the market for Europaper (<b>Euronotes</b> and Eurocommercial paper) despite the extraordinarily rapid growth of this market over the past three years. This paper tries to compare costs to the borrower on 3 -month Europaper with similar costs in the U. S. commercial paper market. On the basis of weekly data in the period June-October, the conclusion is reached that the costs may have been lower in the Europaper market roughly one-third to one-half of the time. Rates paid to investors are, at most times and for most borrowers, lower in the U. S. market than in the Euromarket, but the higher remuneration to dealers in the U. S. market frequently means that all-in costs to the borrower are lower in the Euromarket. Because of the nature and limitations of the data, cost comparisons were limited to estimated rates paid in the two markets only by borrowers whose U. S. commercial paper is rated P- 1 or A- 1. U. S. market borrowing costs were estimated from published composite rates for double-A borrowers, with adjustments where the long-term debt rating of the borrower was not double-A, and from market reports about dealer fees. Europaper borrowing costs had to be inferred from secondary market quotations. Fluctuations in the relative rates suggest the frequent appearance and disappearance of "windows of opportunity" for borrowing in the market with the lower cost at the time.
