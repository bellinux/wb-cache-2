60|$|HARRY. I don't know. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me {{to guess}} what is {{at the back of}} a Chinese brain? She's hated me always.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Major, {{stand up}} {{straight}} and behave yourself! <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to sponge your vest when you're wriggling around in that way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, don't you see {{it would}} be impossible? The world couldn't go on. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> your {{children}} to live if you give this money away?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't go too far," [...] Sylvia warned him. [...] "But I'd better {{understand}} the situation. <b>How</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to be amiable to the man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} been living in your hole!" [...] Mrs. Luna exclaimed. [...] "Olive came home six weeks ago. <b>How</b> long <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> her to endure it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now that we've got {{possession}} of the goats, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> fellows <b>expect</b> to work this stunt?" [...] demanded Fred, as they brought the two goats down to a walk.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Will nothing {{make you}} {{stick to the}} subject?’ I cried; ‘you have the most {{irrelevant}} mind! <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to rise in your profession? The inn?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> {{a fellow}} {{to get over}} these rocks with his hands tied behind him?" [...] grumbled Link Merwell, after he had slipped several times.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good-morning," [...] said she. [...] "I suppose, {{from your}} {{carrying}} baggage, {{that you are}} starting off for your vacation. <b>How</b> far <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to go on your wheel, and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> travel alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED, tragically: [...] "Still! <b>How</b> soon <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to stop? I am {{here on the}} sofa, where I flung myself {{two hours}} ago, and I don't think I shall ever get up. There is no reason WHY I ever should." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Overwhelmed? Not {{a bit of}} it!' cried Lady Davenant, almost gaily. 'When did {{anything}} in the world overwhelm her and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> take her for? She'll only make some delightful odd speech. As for people knowing it,' she added, 'they'll know it whether he wants them or not. My poor child, <b>how</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to make believe?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Confound you, {{have you}} been rummaging round among my clothes, then?' said Dick. 'I put a {{sovereign}} in the tobacco-jar yesterday. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> a man to keep his accounts properly if you----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to get below, my {{innocent}} peddler? Do {{you think}} we hold the forts at King's Bridge to cover such peddling rascals as you, in your goings in and comings out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound you, {{have you}} been rummaging round among my clothes, then?" [...] said Dick. [...] "I put a {{sovereign}} in the tobacco-jar yesterday. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> a man to keep his accounts properly if you----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you want}} {{it so much that}} you won't even take it when it's pressed on <b>you.</b> <b>How</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> seriously <b>expect</b> me to bear it?" [...] Nick repeated.|$|R
5000|$|Driberg’s {{statement}} was echoed {{by one of}} the prisoners, who said: 'Under National Socialism I was told to believe all that I was told. I was promised lots of things but the promises were never kept. But in America I was promised that I was on my way back to Germany. That promise was also broken. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> now <b>expect</b> me to believe anything at all?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, {{your room}} is {{furnished}} as a sitting room also, madame, {{and you and}} your brother can talk over your affairs here. As to your meals, I could provide your cafe au lait in the morning, but I can't undertake to cook for you. But there are many good places, where you can obtain your meals at a cheap rate, in the neighbourhood. <b>How</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to remain in Paris?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to travel, monsieur? How {{you have}} got so far as this, I cannot make out; for at any tavern where you put up you might, of course, have been asked for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{the whole}} thing was illegal--and led by the sheriff! Precisely <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> these aliens to obey your law if the officer of the law teaches them to break it? Is it a new kind of logic?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, Silver, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> {{to carry}} us {{out if you}} eat and drink like that?" [...] Hare removed the saddle and {{tethered}} the gray {{to one of the}} cottonwoods. Wolf came trotting into camp proudly carrying a rabbit.|$|E
40|$|Another {{way to look}} at {{this talk}} is: if you {{dedicate}} 6 months of your PhD thesis to annotate carefully a set of genes, in this case a pathway I have been studying, <b>how</b> many errors <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to find in other databases, or what should you be careful at...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Julia, <b>how</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>expect</b> me {{to endure}} {{this kind of}} thing?" [...] Julia made him no answer; she only {{leaned back in her}} chair with her eyes upon his. He met her gaze a moment; then he turned round to the fire and for another moment looked into it. After this he faced his hostess again with the exclamation: [...] "It's so foolish--it's so damnably foolish!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Say, you!' she'd say. 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> call this--letter to a Hardware Merchant from His Nephew on Learning that His Aunt Has Nettlerash? You Eastern duffers know as {{much about}} writing love letters as a Kansas {{grasshopper}} does about tugboats. [...] "My dear Miss Blye!"--wouldn't that put pink icing and a little red sugar bird on your bridal cake? <b>How</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to hold an audience in a court-room {{with that kind of}} stuff? You want to get down to business, and call me [...] "Tweedlums Babe" [...] and [...] "Honeysuckle," [...] and sign yourself [...] "Mama's Own Big Bad Puggy Wuggy Boy" [...] if you want any limelight to concentrate upon your sparse gray hairs. Get sappy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never killed anything, willingly," [...] she sobbed. [...] "Even if I wanted to, {{how could}} I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible, cannot kill her yourself, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> {{me to do}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And d--d well time, too!" [...] the {{newcomer}} continued. [...] "You've {{had all the}} chance in the world. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to make a living, fiddling about here all day with pencil and paper, and talking Socialist rot at night? Leave that chair alone and be off, both of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Open another," [...] said Villon. [...] "How do {{you ever}} hope to fill that big hogshead, your body, with little things like bottles? And <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to get to heaven? How many angels, do you fancy, can be spared to carry up a single monk from Picardy? Or do you think {{yourself}} another Elias--and they'll send the coach for you?" ...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} checklist identifies {{factors that}} should be considered in preparing or evaluating an aquaculture business plan. Aquaculturists or fish farmers must evaluate their: 1) production management capabilities; 2) marketing management capabilities; 3) financial management capabilities; 4) available resources (i. e., land, water, capital, labor); 5) financial position of the business (i. e., profitability, solvency and liquidity); and 6) commitment to a new, high risk enterprise. Management Factors What are your goals and objectives for the aquaculture business? Which type(s) of aquaculture interest you? Species___ _ Production method___ Will your operation be a separate hatchery, nursery or grow-out operation or a combination of the individual operations? What level of management intensity (extensive, semi-intensive, intensive) and/or degree of integration with other products will the enterprise have? Is there a market potential, management, or cost efficiency reason for a particular size business? What experience <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have to manage the operation? Are you willing to provide the time and effort required to learn how to and/or to grow the product? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think that you will like the work and skills needed to produce the product? What skills and abilities will be needed to make the business successful? How will the business be organized? Sole proprietorship_ _ partnership__ _ corporation__ _ other____ How much money can you survive on? How much money can you afford to invest? How will the business affect your family? How will the new business affect your present job? Will the aquaculture operation require hired labor? Full-time_ _ part-time__ <b>How</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> for the business to become operational? <b>How</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> for the business to become profitable? Are you in an area where the production facility can be leased or sold if you decide to cease operation...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave {{me to be}} my own {{judge of}} what I ought to <b>do,</b> if <b>you</b> please, sir. If she had any feeling at all, what I told her {{yesterday}} would have kept her from all this. But some people have no feeling, and will go on being tomfools though the house is on fire." [...] As these words were spoken, Mrs. Broughton fainted more persistently than ever,--so that Dalrymple was convinced that whether she felt or not, at any rate she heard. He had now dragged her across the room, and laid her upon the sofa, and Clara {{had come to her}} assistance. [...] "I daresay you think me very hard because I speak plainly, but there are things much harder than plain speaking. <b>How</b> much <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to be paid, sir, for this picture of my girl?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{heard of}} the 1983 coup planning, told my GOC General Buhari who {{detained}} me for two weeks in Lagos. Instead of {{a pat on the}} back, I received a stab. <b>How</b> then <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to report this one? This trial marks the eclipse of my brilliant and unblemished career of 19 years. I fought in the civil war with the ability it pleased God to give me. It is unfortunate that I'm being convicted for something which I have had to stop on two occasions. This is not self adulation but a sincere summary of the qualities inherent in me. It is an irony of fate {{that the president of the}} tribunal who in 1964 felt that I was good enough to take training in the UK is now saddled with the duty of showing me the exit from the force and the world" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] I {{said with}} irritation. [...] "After {{you have just}} told me that your smoke vision was a mere conjurer's trick, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to believe in your blessed Child? Who is the Child? What is the Child, and--this is more important--what can it do? As your throat {{is going to be}} cut shortly you may as well tell me the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the great}} night; it was {{the night of the}} play. The two dressing-rooms were {{swirling}} with actors, panting, twitchy pale. Del Snafflin the barber, who was as much a professional as Ella, having once gone on in a mob scene at a stock-company performance in Minneapolis, was making them up, and showing his scorn for amateurs with, [...] "Stand still! For the love o' Mike, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to get your eyelids dark if you keep a-wigglin'?" [...] The actors were beseeching, [...] "Hey, Del, put some red in my nostrils--you put some in Rita's--gee, you didn't hardly do anything to my face." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. LUNN. There you go, {{like all}} the rest of them! I ask you, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> a woman to keep up what you call her {{sensibility}} when this sort of thing has happened to her about three times a week ever since she was seventeen? It used to upset me and terrify me at first. Then I got rather a taste for it. It came to a climax with Gregory: that was why I married him. Then it became a mild lark, hardly worth the trouble. After that I found it valuable once or twice as a spinal tonic when I was run down; but now it's an unmitigated bore. I don't mind your declaration: I daresay it gives you a certain pleasure to make it. I quite understand that you adore me; but (if you don't mind) I'd rather you didn't keep on saying so.|$|E
6000|$|Never {{knew that}} there was any battle of life? And yet you were christened, and signed with the sign of the Cross, in token that you should fight manfully under Christ's banner against sin, the world, and the devil, and {{continue}} Christ's faithful soldier and servant to your life's end. Did it never occur to you that those words might possibly mean something? And you used to sing hymns, too, on earth, about [...] "Soldiers of Christ, arise, And put your armour on." [...] What prophets, and apostles, and martyrs, and confessors meant by those words, you should know well enough. Did it never occur to you that they might possibly mean something to you? That as long as the world was no better than it is, there was still a battle of life; and that you too were sworn to fight in it? How many will answer--Yes--Yes--But I thought that these words only meant having my soul saved, and going to heaven when I died. And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to <b>do</b> that? By believing certain doctrines which you were told were true; and leading a tolerably respectable life, without which you would not have been received into society? Was that all which was needed to go to heaven? And was that all that was meant by fighting manfully under Christ's banner against sin, the world, and the devil? Why, Cyrus and his old Persians, 2,400 years ago, were nearer to the kingdom of God than that. They had a clearer notion of what the battle of life meant than that, when they said that not only the man who did a merciful or just deed, but the man who drained a swamp, tilled a field, made any little corner of the earth somewhat better than he found it, was fighting against Ahriman the evil spirit of darkness, on the side of Ormuzd the good god of light; and that as he had taken his part in Ormuzd's battle, he should share in Ormuzd's triumph.|$|R
5000|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{the coupon}} collector's problem describes the [...] "collect all coupons and win" [...] contests. It asks the following question: Suppose {{that there is}} an urn of n different coupons, from which coupons are being collected, equally likely, with replacement. What is the probability that more than t sample trials are needed to collect all n coupons? An alternative statement is: Given n coupons, <b>how</b> many coupons <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> need to draw with replacement before having drawn each coupon at least once? The mathematical analysis of the problem reveals that the expected number of trials needed grows as [...] For example, when n = 50 it takes about 225 trials on average to collect all 50 coupons.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, luckless being!' sighed the girl; 'how {{will you}} ever get through with it. The white horse, who is our master's grandmother, is always hungry: it takes twenty men always mowing {{to keep it in}} food for one day, and another twenty to clean out its stall. <b>How,</b> then, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to <b>do</b> it all by yourself? But listen to me, and do what I tell you. It is your only chance. When you have filled the manger as full as it will hold you must weave a strong plait of the rushes which grow among the meadow hay, and cut a thick peg of stout wood, and be sure that the horse sees what <b>you</b> are <b>doing.</b> Then it will ask you what it is for, and you will say, 'With this plait I intend to bind up your mouth so that you cannot eat any more, and with this peg I am going to keep you still in one spot, so that you cannot scatter your corn and water all over the place!' After these words the maiden went away as softly as she had come.|$|R
