5000|$|These retrometabolic design {{strategies}} were introduced by Nicholas Bodor, {{one of the}} first and most prominent advocates for the early integration of metabolism, pharmacokinetic and general physicochemical considerations in the drug design process. [...] These drug design concepts recognize the importance of design-controlled metabolism and directly focus not on the increase of activity alone but on the increase of the activity/toxicity ratio (therapeutic index) in order to deliver the maximum benefit while also reducing or eliminating unwanted side effects. The importance of this field is reviewed in a book dedicated to the subject (Bodor, N.; Buchwald, P.; Retrometabolic Drug Design and Targeting, 1st ed., Wiley & Sons, 2012), as well as by a full chapter of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Design, 7th ed. (2010) with close to 150 chemical structures and more than 450 references. [...] At the time of its introduction, the idea of designed-in metabolism represented a significant novelty and was against mainstream thinking then in place that instead focused on minimizing or entirely eliminating drug metabolism. Bodor's work on these design concepts developed during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and came to prominence during the mid-1990s. Loteprednol etabonate, a soft corticosteroid designed and patented by Bodor received final Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1998 as the active ingredient of two ophthalmic preparations (Lotemax and Alrex), currently the only corticosteroid approved by the FDA for use in all inflammatory and allergy-related ophthalmic disorders. Its safety for long-term use [...] further supports the soft drug concept, and in 2004, loteprednol etabonate [...] was also approved as part of a combination product (Zylet). A second generation of soft corticosteroids such as <b>etiprednol</b> <b>dicloacetate</b> is in development for a full spectrum of other possible applications such as nasal spray for rhinitis or inhalation products for asthma.|$|E

Most existing ophthalmic drugs were adapted from other therapeutic applications and were not specifically developed for the treatment of eye diseases; hence, they are not well suited to provide eye-specific effects without causing systemic side effects. A real breakthrough in the area of ophthalmic therapeutics can be achieved only by specifically designing new drugs for ophthalmic applications to incorporate the possibility of eye targeting into their chemical structure. Possibilities provided along these lines by designing chemical delivery systems (CDSs) and soft drugs within the framework of retrometabolic drug design are reviewed here. Both are general concept applicable in almost any therapeutic area. This review will concentrate on adrenergic agonists and anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, where clinical results obtained with new chemical entities, such as betaxoxime, adaprolol, loteprednol etabonate, and <b>etiprednol</b> <b>dicloacetate,</b> exist to support the advantages of such metabolism-focused, ophthalmic-specific drug design approaches...|$|E
