25|$|A simple example {{would be}} a GPU program that {{collects}} data about average lighting values as it renders some view from either a camera or a computer <b>graphics</b> <b>program</b> {{back to the main}} program on the CPU, so that the CPU can then make adjustments to the overall screen view. A more advanced example might use edge detection to return both numerical information and a processed image representing outlines to a computer vision program controlling, say, a mobile robot. Because the GPU has fast and local hardware access to every pixel or other picture element in an image, it can analyze and average it (for the first example) or apply a Sobel edge filter or other convolution filter (for the second) with much greater speed than a CPU, which typically must access slower random-access memory copies of the graphic in question.|$|E
25|$|Michaela Conlin as Angela Montenegro: A {{forensic}} {{artist at}} the Jeffersonian Institute and Brennan's best friend, Angela is Brennan's team specialist in forensic facial reconstruction—helping {{to identify the}} victims—and can generate holograms using her three-dimensional <b>graphics</b> <b>program</b> (The Angelator and later The Angelatron) to simulate various virtual scenarios of a crime to help determine cause of death. Angela and Dr. Brennan are best friends and rarely ever argue. She is open, friendly, and caring and constantly tries to draw Brennan out of the lab. Angela's very scary father is played by Billy Gibbons, guitarist of ZZ Top, guest-starring as a fictional version of himself. In season five, she marries co-worker Dr. Jack Hodgins, with whom {{she has a very}} on and off relationship starting from season 2, and gives birth to their son, Michael Vincent, in season six. Her birth name is Pookie Noodlin, as revealed in the tenth season.|$|E

500|$|PowerAnimator and Maya are {{high-end}} programs mainly {{used for}} 3D computer graphics, while co-producer and former animation director Eric Stough notes that PowerAnimator was initially chosen because its features helped animators retain the show's [...] "homemade" [...] look. PowerAnimator {{was also used}} for making some of the show's visual effects, which are now created using Motion, a newer <b>graphics</b> <b>program</b> created by Apple, Inc. for their Mac OS X operating system. The show's visual quality has improved in recent seasons, though several other techniques are used to intentionally preserve the cheap cutout animation look.|$|E
500|$|The Orphanage {{developed}} a multi-level freeway interchange {{for use in}} one of the film's final scenes by creating a digital environment and a [...] long spiral ramp that was built in front of a bluescreen. When a F-35 jet is chasing McClane on the freeway, a miniature model and a full-size prop were both built to assist in digitally adding the jet into the scene. The nine-foot model was constructed from November 2006 through February 2007. When the jet is shown hovering near the freeway, editors used the software 3D <b>graphics</b> <b>program</b> Maya to blur the background and create a heat ripple effect.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, James R. Von Ehr {{founded the}} Altsys Corporation to develop {{graphics}} applications for personal computers. Based in Plano, Texas, the company initially produced font editing and conversion software; Fontastic Plus, Metamorphosis, and the Art Importer. [...] Their premier PostScript font-design package, Fontographer, {{was released in}} 1986 {{and was the first}} such program on the market. With the PostScript background established with Fontographer, [...] Altsys also developed FreeHand (originally called Masterpiece) as a Macintosh Postscript-based illustration program that used Bézier curves for drawing and was similar to Adobe Illustrator. FreeHand was announced as “...a Macintosh <b>graphics</b> <b>program</b> described as having all the features of Adobe’s Illustrator plus drawing tools such as those in Mac Paint and Mac Draft and special effects similar to those in Cricket Draw.” Seattle’s Aldus Corporation acquired a licensing agreement with Altsys to release FreeHand along with their flagship product, Pagemaker, [...] and [...] Aldus FreeHand 1.0 was released in 1988. FreeHand’s product name used intercaps; the F and H were capitalized.|$|E
40|$|Traditional 3 D <b>graphics</b> <b>programming</b> using OpenGL in C or C++ often {{requires}} significant development time by expert graphics programmers. The time {{costs associated with}} learning to use OpenGL calls in the C or C++ environment and compiling, linking, and testing during application development are typically extensive. Therefore, new tools that reduce the development time associated with <b>graphics</b> <b>programming</b> or make <b>graphics</b> <b>programming</b> available to a broader spectrum of programmers paves the way towards speedier and more sophisticated graphical software development. An interpreted environment accommodates faster graphics application development by eliminating the need to frequently recompile code in order to observe the effects of OpenGL calls to the current graphics state. Utilizing the functional programming language J with appropriate OpenGL bindings, an interpreted approach provides an interactive environment suitable for less time consuming OpenGL-like <b>graphics</b> <b>programming.</b> This pape [...] ...|$|R
