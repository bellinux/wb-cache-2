40|$|Abstract in Undetermined <b>Edge</b> <b>sealing</b> {{is often}} used to assure {{one-dimensional}} moisture flow and a defined exposure area in moisture transport experiments. This paper deals with the performance of a number of <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> systems including wax-paraffin mix, epoxy adhesive, silicone and different tapes and films. The overall performance of the sealing systems includes vapor permeability and hygroscopicity, workability, thermal durability, flexibility, adhesion and risk of hydrophobation. The moisture-related properties are determined gravimetrically. The other properties are examined visually and qualitatively. Each of the properties of the <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> systems is rated and the overall performance is an assessment of all the single properties. This comparative study shows that the best overall performance among the studied <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> systems were seen in the tapes and films, the mixes demonstrate a higher risk of hydrophobation.

40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the disintegration mechanism of concrete due to the infiltration of the moisture to the milling overlay pavement and to come up with a method to minimize the disintegration as well as verifying the effectiveness of the <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and Fogseal method. METHODS: This study investigated the distress mechanism due to the infiltrated moisture remaining in the milling overlay pavement through chloride freezing test and verified the effectiveness of the sealing of the milling edge and fog seal methods, which have been devised to minimize the moisture infiltration, through laboratory water permeability test. Additionally, long-term pavement performance was compared for the effectiveness of the proposed method through under loading test, and field water permeability test was carried out to verify the field applicability of the proposed method. RESULTS: The result of the research confirmed that chloride deteriorates the concrete surface through disintegration and lowers its strength and that the laboratory moisture infiltration test verified the effectiveness of the milling <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and fog seal methods in the deterrence of moisture infiltration to the overlay pavement with excellent long-term performance of the pavement treated with the proposed method. Although the field water permeability test revealed some deterrence of moisture infiltration of the milling <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and fog seal methods to a certain extent, the difference was a little. CONCLUSIONS: The milling <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and fog seal methods are limited in their effectiveness for the cases of improvident compactio...|$|E

40|$|This poster aims at {{presenting}} {{an experimental}} investigations for the fabrication of vacuum glazing using a novel low-temperature <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> material, melts at around 200 C, {{as shown in}} figure 1. To date two materials indium and solder glass have been used for sealing the edges of the glass sheets in a vacuum glazing. Indium is a low temperature sealing material, melts at 157 C, but is very expensive. Solder glass is a high temperature sealing material, melts at around 450 C, but has limitation of using low-e coatings and a tempered glass. One of the main hindrance to the manufacture of vacuum glazing at the industrial level is the cost. In this poster presentation, a vacuum glazing system for production at a laboratory scale using a modified evacuation pump-out sealing technique is presented. A number of samples have been fabricated using a novel cost effective <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> material that achieves an evacuation pressure less than 0. 046 Pa in the cavity of the vacuum glazing samples. An experimental performance verification of samples using new cost effective sealing materials will be executed in a hot box calorimeter to measure thermal transmittance performance of the samples.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Vacuum glazing is a vital development in the move to more energy efficient buildings. In vacuum glazing, an evacuated cavity supresses gaseous conduction and convection to provide high thermal resistance. A high vacuum pressure (less than 0. 1 Pa) is required and must be maintained by a hermetic seal around the periphery, currently formed with either indium (i. e. low temperature sealing method) or solder glass (i. e. high temperature sealing method).

40|$|The {{development}} of vacuum glazing represents a significant advancement {{in the area}} of low heat loss glazing systems with the potential to substantially reduce building heating and cooling loads. Vacuum glazing consists of two or more glass panes hermetically sealed together around the edge with a vacuum gap between the panes. To avoid the glass panes from collapsing and touching each other under the influence of atmospheric pressure an array of support pillars is provided between the glass panes. A high level of thermal insulation is achieved by evacuating the spaces between the glass panes to a very low pressure which greatly reduces conduction and convection within the space; therefore heat transfer through this kind of glazing is significantly lower when compared with conventional insulating glazing. However, vacuum glazing is subject to inherent stresses due to atmospheric pressure and temperature differentials which can lead to fracture of the glass panes and failure of the <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> A flexible <b>edge</b> <b>seal</b> has been proposed to minimise the impact of these issues. In this paper, vacuum glazing system with rigid and flexible <b>edge</b> <b>seals</b> is theoretically studied and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed...|$|R

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil <b>edge</b> <b>sealing,</b> the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|E

These processes are applicable to a very broad range of module types, including those made with wafer-based and thin-film solar cells. No off-the-shelf automation was available for these processes prior to this program. Spire conducted a survey of PV module manufacturers to identify current industry practices and to determine the requirements for the automated systems being developed in this program. Spire also completed detailed mechanical and electrical designs and developed software for two prototype automation systems: a module buffer storage system, designated the SPI-BUFFER 350, and an integrated module testing system, designated the SPI-MODULE QA 350. Researchers fabricated, tested, and evaluated both systems with module components from several module manufacturers. A new size simulator, th e SPI-SUN SIMULATOR 350 i, was designed with a test area that can handle most production modules without consuming excessive floor space.
