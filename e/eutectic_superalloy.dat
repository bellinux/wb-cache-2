40|$|A {{report is}} {{presented}} {{of the current}} status of development of five materials which might be used in the design of components for advanced aircraft propulsion systems. Boron fiber/aluminum, boron fiber/titanium, and silicon carbide fiber/titanium composites are considered for lightweight compressor fan blades. Directionally solidified <b>eutectic</b> <b>superalloy</b> and tungsten wire/superalloy composites could possibly be used in the design of turbine blades for operational temperatures as high as 1100 C...|$|E
40|$|Protective {{coatings}} {{required for}} the Ni-Nb-Cr-Al directionally solidified <b>eutectic</b> <b>superalloy</b> were developed and evaluated {{on the basis of}} oxidation resistance, diffusional stability, thermal fatigue, and creep resistance. NiCrAlY+Pt and NiCrAlY physical vapor-deposition coating systems exhibited the best combination of properties. Burner-rig testing indicated that the useful life of a 127 -micron-thick NiCrAlY+Pt coating exceeds 1000 h at 1366 K. Eutectic-alloy creep lives at 1311 K and a stress of 151. 7 MN/sq m were greater for NiCrAlY+Pt-coated specimens than for uncoated specimens by a factor of two...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} high creep strength, directionally solidified gamma/gamma prime-delta (Ni- 19. 7 Cb- 6 Cr- 2. 5 Al) <b>eutectic</b> <b>superalloy</b> turbine blades requires {{the development of}} suitable coatings for airfoil, root and internal blade surfaces. In order to improve coatings for the gamma/gamma prime-delta alloy, the current investigation had the goals of (1) refining promising coating compositions for directionally solidified eutectics, (2) evaluating the effects of coating/ substrate interactions on the mechanical properties of the alloy, and (3) evaluating diffusion aluminide coatings for internal surfaces. Burner rig cyclic oxidation, furnace cyclic hot corrosion, ductility, and thermal fatigue tests indicated that NiCrAlY+Pt(63 to 127 micron Ni- 18 Cr- 12 Al- 0. 3 Y + 6 micron Pt) and NiCrAlY(63 to 127 micron Ni- 18 Cr- 12 Al- 0. 3 Y) coatings are capable of protecting high temperature gas path surfaces of eutectic alloy airfoils. Burner rig (Mach 0. 37) testing indicated that the useful coating life of the 127 micron thick coatings exceeded 1000 hours at 1366 K (2000 deg F). Isothermal fatigue and furnance hot corrosion tests indicated that 63 micron NiCrAlY, NiCrAlY + Pt and platinum modified diffusion aluminide (Pt + Al) coating systems are capable of protecting the relatively cooler surfaces of the blade root. Finally, a gas phase coating process was evaluated for diffusion aluminizing internal surfaces and cooling holes of air-cooled gamma/gamma prime-delta turbine blades...|$|E
40|$|Trends in the {{development}} of new aerospace metals and alloys are reviewed, and applications of these advanced materials in nonaerospace fields are indicated. Emphasis is placed on the light metals and the high-temperature alloys. Attention is given to the properties and uses of the high-strength aluminum alloy 7050, alpha and beta titanium alloys, dispersion strengthened <b>superalloys,</b> metal-metal composites, <b>eutectic</b> <b>superalloys,</b> and coated columbium alloys...|$|R
40|$|<b>Eutectic</b> <b>superalloys</b> {{are being}} {{developed}} at several laboratories for application as aircraft gas turbine airfoils. One such alloy gamma/gamma prime + delta was subjected to several heat treatments to determine if its mechanical properties could be improved. It was found that by partially dissolving the gamma prime at 1210 C and then aging at 900 C, the tensile strength can be increased about 12 per cent at temperatures up to 900 C. At 1040 C, no change in tensile strength was observed. Times to rupture were measured between 760 and 1040 C and were essentially the same or greater than for as-grown material. Tensile and rupture ductility of the alloy were reduced by heat treatment...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to produce airfoil shaped bars of three {{different}} <b>eutectic</b> <b>superalloys</b> by means of the edge-defined, film-fed growth (EFG) method. The alloys used were a gamma + delta Ni-Cb alloy, a gamma/gamma prime + delta Ni-Cb-Al alloy and a Co-TaC alloy containing Ni and Cr. The development of a new die material was essential in the investigation since these alloys are reactive toward known die materials. Tantalum carbide was selected as a die material because it exhibited spontaneous capillary rise and slow rate of degradation in the liquid metals. Eutectic bars up to 1 mm thick and 6 mm wide were grown from TaC dies {{in order to determine the}} growth characteristics and the thermal gradient. Large bars of the gamma/gamma prime + delta alloy were grown and tensile tested. A die with a blind central cavity was designed and several hollow, tear-shaped bars were grown...|$|R
40|$|A {{study program}} was {{conducted}} to identify those materials that will provide the greatest benefits as turbine blades for advanced liquid propellant rocket engine turbines and to prepare technology plans {{for the development of}} those materials for use in the 1990 through 1995 period. The candidate materials were selected from six classes of materials: single-crystal (SC) superalloys, oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS) superalloys, rapid solidification processed (RSP) <b>superalloys,</b> directionally solidified <b>eutectic</b> (DSE) <b>superalloys,</b> fiber-reinforced superalloy (FRS) composites, and ceramics. Properties of materials from the six classes were compiled and evaluated and property improvements were projected approximately 5 years into the future for advanced versions of materials in each of the six classes...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacture}} {{and performance of}} yttria partially stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings (TBC) on superalloys and on a <b>superalloy</b> <b>eutectic</b> were investigated. The TBCs were generated by electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD). Performance was studied in a hot gas burner rig. Failure modes result from individual stress distribution and microstructural evolution within the TBC. A controlled columnar structure within density-graded TBC is expected to enable the coating life to be prolonged...|$|R
40|$|The impact-sliding wear {{resistance}} of chill cast and aligned <b>eutectic</b> Fe-base <b>superalloys</b> against M 42 and 17 - 4 PH steel counterface materials is examined. The aligned material tests were run with carbide fibers {{perpendicular to the}} counterface contact surface and the characterization focused on fracture processes as observed in the subsurface microstructure of the worn materials. Metallographic analyses were performed on specimens exposed to various numbers of repetitive impact load cycles, and for comparison, two other aligned composites were tested with the same fiber orientation under identical test conditions against hardened M 42 tool steel. A strong improvement was found in {{wear resistance}} of an aligned eutectic structure {{as compared to the}} corresponding randomized chill cast structure. Experiments with the softer 17 - 4 counterface were characterized by transfer onto the Fe-base superalloy, and the cracks formed were oriented transverse to the relative sliding direction and occurred in a periodic fashion. Observations in subsurface regions of the worn materials indicated crack intergranularity with an occasional transgranular fracture of the M 7 C 3 carbide phase...|$|R
