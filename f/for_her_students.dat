2500|$|Linda Varvel is an English {{teacher who}} used Bless Me, Ultima <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>students.</b> Her {{essay on the}} {{censorship}} and the provoking aspects of the novel provide an opinion on why the novel caused issues within various school districts. She believes the novel should stay as a beneficial source of education to students. The book may utilize a critical lens of Catholicism, the overall theme of a child {{coming to terms with}} the world around him and forming opinions is a valuable story for all children and parents: [...] "The deeper message is one that many readers who would censor this novel must also believe: no one but God is all-powerful, and the mystery of life cannot be known entirely by human beings. This message might be the common ground to initiate any discussion around this kind of censorship challenge".|$|E
2500|$|According to Dewey, the {{successful}} classroom teacher occupies an indispensable passion for promoting the intellectual growth of young children. In addition, {{she knows that}} her career, in comparison to other professions, entails stressful situations, long hours and limited financial reward; {{all of which have}} the potential to overcome her genuine love and sympathy <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>students.</b> For Dewey, [...] "One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of care worn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners. While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others, and a tax which they do not bear up under very well. And in some schools, there are too many pupils to a teacher, too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way. Human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2101, p.35).|$|E
