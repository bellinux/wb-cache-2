5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the season}} Hornish drove in the Nextel Cup Series for Penske Racing South in <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 06 Dodge Charger, failing to qualify for his first six races. He {{qualified}} for the Checker Auto Parts 500 at Phoenix, starting in 26th place and finishing 30th (two laps behind). Hornish also qualified for the following race at Homestead-Miami, starting in 29th place. After crashing in turn three of lap 194 he finished 37th, thirteen laps behind.|$|E
5|$|For the January 2011 games, the Sugar Bowl {{selected}} first, {{followed by}} the Orange Bowl and Fiesta Bowl. The Sugar Bowl picked Ohio State, which left the Orange Bowl to decide between two teams contractually bound to appear in a BCS bowl game. These were Stanford, which was guaranteed a BCS bid by <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 4 national ranking, and Connecticut, champion of the Big East Conference. Favoring Stanford's potential to draw a large television audience, the Orange Bowl selected the Cardinal, leaving Connecticut to the Fiesta Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Both the United States and Australia {{cited the}} {{alliance}} as justification for involvement in Vietnam. U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with {{a rationale for}} a large-scale U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia. Other countries, such as the UK and key nations in Asia, accepted the rationale. In 1962, {{as part of its}} commitment to SEATO, the Royal Australian Air Force deployed CAC Sabres of <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 79 Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Sabres began {{to play a role in}} the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of USAF aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|He drove for Penske in the renamed Nationwide Series, {{failing to}} qualify for his first two races of the season. Hornish's best finish of the season was {{eleventh}} place in the Diamond Hill Plywood 200 at Darlington Raceway, where he started twelfth. In the Carquest Auto Parts 300 at Lowe's Motor Speedway he led his first laps of the series (eight), but a mid-race accident relegated him to 39th place. Late in the season, Hornish drove one race in the Craftsman Truck Series (the Kroger 200 at Martinsville Speedway) for Bobby Hamilton Racing in <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 4 Dodge Ram, starting 16th and finishing ninth.|$|E
5|$|Hornish began {{driving for}} Marlboro Team Penske during the 2004 IndyCar Series season in <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 6 Dallara IR03-Toyota Indy V8, winning {{the season opener}} at Homestead-Miami in his first race with the team. After {{qualifying}} in 11th place at the Indianapolis 500, he battled for the lead with Buddy Rice and Dan Wheldon and led for nine laps (the first laps Hornish led in his Indianapolis 500 career). On lap 105, entering the main straightaway out of the fourth turn, Hornish tried to pass Darren Manning and Greg Ray's lapped car. They collided, crashing into the pit lane; Hornish finished 26th, dropping to ninth place in the point standings. The rest of his season was sub-par, with two podium finishes. Hornish was seventh in the championship standings with 387 points, his worst finish since he placed 21st in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Hornish joined Penske {{again in}} 2010. At the season-opening Daytona 500, Hornish started 26th and was {{involved}} in an early accident on the race's ninth lap; he finished 37th, completing 160 of its 208 laps. His qualifying results improved slightly {{during the rest of}} the season, with three top-fives. Hornish's only top-ten finish of the season was tenth place at the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. He finished 29th in the standings, with 3,214 points. After the season Hornish's longtime sponsor, Mobil 1, left him and Penske for Tony Stewart and Stewart-Haas Racing. In the 2010 Nationwide Series he drove the season-ending race at Homestead-Miami for Brian Keselowski Motorsports (in conjunction with Penske) in <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 26 Dodge Avenger, starting twelfth and finishing 21st.|$|E
5|$|Oxendine {{accounted}} {{for the majority of}} Virginia Tech's 193 total rushing yards, but Nebraska had many more players run the ball than just Benning, who {{accounted for}} just over one-third of Nebraska's 279-yard rushing total. Scott Frost carried the ball nine times for 62 yards and two touchdowns for the Cornhuskers, and Ahman Green, despite being hampered by his injured foot, managed seven carries for 52 yards. All told, seven Nebraska players managed to carry the ball at least once. Virginia Tech, on the other hand, saw just four players carry the ball, and <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 2 rusher, Marcus Parker, had eight carries for 22 yards.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Audi installed low-downforce setups on <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 7 and 8 cars while their third entry used a version observed at the Silverstone race. The design was optimised to omit downforce, thereby reducing drag, for better preparation for competing on high-speed tracks. This was done by modifying the car's side pods and openings on the inside surface of its fenders. New cooling techniques were achieved by creating new suspension solutions to restrict spring displacement which also reduced underside turbulent airflow. Porsche chose to use high downforce configurations on all three of their 919 Hybrid cars as they did previously at Silverstone. The ByKolles CLM P1/01 was further developed and had a new front nose equipped after it completed a shakedown test on 24 April.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2011 season Penske {{sold the}} owners' points of <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 77 car to Rusty Wallace Racing, {{to be driven}} by owner Rusty Wallace's son (and team driver) Steve at the season-opening Daytona 500, for {{financial}} reasons. As a result, Penske moved Hornish to the Nationwide Series to drive the team's No. 12 Dodge Charger. He drove the 5-hour Energy 500 at Pocono Raceway in Front Row Motorsports' No.38 Ford Fusion, filling in for Travis Kvapil (who was driving in a Truck Series event at Texas). Hornish started in 26th place and finished 35th, 60 laps behind. He drove twelve races with the No. 12 team, moving to Penske's No. 22 for a 13th race at Iowa Speedway. At Iowa Hornish started in third place and led from laps 13 through 51, later dropping five laps behind to finish 24th. In the WYPALL* 200 Powered by Kimberly-Clark Professional at Phoenix International Raceway, he started in fifth place and led for the race's final 61 laps after passing Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (who led for a race-high 73 laps) for his first career victory in the series.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in cooler weather conditions, Sarrazin in the No. 6 Toyota, was fastest with a time of one minute and 58.566 seconds, which was set early in the 90-minute period. His team-mate Nakajima finished with the second-quickest time, with Mark Webber in the No. 1 Porsche ending up third-fastest. The second Audi vehicle did not take part because their mechanics were unable to repair a failed front axle drivetrain. Roberto Merhi achieved the only time under the two minute and eight second mark in LMP2 in the No. 45 Manor Oreca with a lap of two minutes and 7.865 seconds, eight-tenths of a second faster than the second G-Drive car of van der Garde. LMGTE Pro was led by James Calado in the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari with the Italian marque setting the fastest time in the LMGTE Am with <b>its</b> <b>No.</b> 83 vehicle being driven by Rui Águas. The session was ended prematurely with seven minutes remaining when Yutaka Yamagishi was reported to have run out of fuel in Larbre Compétition's No. 50 Chevrolet and then collided with the barriers at Stavelot corner.|$|E
