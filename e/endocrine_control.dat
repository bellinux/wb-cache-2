40|$|The mouse major urinary {{proteins}} (MUPs) are encoded by a {{gene family}} of about 35 to 40 members. MUPs are synthesized {{in at least}} six secretory tissues {{under a variety of}} developmental and <b>endocrine</b> <b>controls,</b> but the identities of the individual genes expressed in each tissue have not previously been established. In this article, we present the nucleotide sequences of five MUP mRNAs which we designate MUP I through V. MUPs I, II, and III are the most abundant MUP mRNA species in the liver, and MUPs IV and V are the most abundant MUP mRNA species in the lachrymal gland and the submaxillary gland, respectively. The sequence data show that each of the five mRNAs is encoded by a distinct member of the gene family. The structures of the MUP mRNA consist of interspersed segments of variable and conserved sequences. On the basis of the sequences of the variable segments, gene-specific panels of synthetic oligonucleotide probes were prepared. The gene-specific panels were used to identify cloned genes and, as described in the accompanying paper (K. Shahan, M. Denaro, M. Gilmartin, Y. Shi, and E. Derman, Mol. Cell.

40|$|Abstract. Enzymes, non-enzymatic {{proteins}} and other organic molecules are vital components in living cells. Their respective function depends on specific spatial configurations which {{are linked to}} intracellular conditions. Any fluctuation of these conditions, beyond certain threshold values, such as a disruption of ionic regulatory mechanisms, {{can lead to the}} destabilisation of a finely balanced intracellular dynamic physiological equilibrium or homeostasis. Hydromineral homeostasis in aquatic organisms is maintained by a complex <b>endocrine</b> <b>controlled</b> array of specialised cross-membrane ion transport systems and the regulation of membrane water permeability. Depending on how aquatic organisms maintain hydromineral homeostasis, they can be roughly divided into two groups: osmoconformers and osmoregulators; the former are mostly invertebrates with high water permeability, the latter include some invertebrates and most fish species, whose permeable external epithelia are usually restricted to the gills. Other important organs involved in hydromineral regulation include the intestine and the various phyla-specific organisational types of renal systems. Environmental concentrations of organotin compounds, such as tributyltin and triphenyltin, have been shown to interfere with the maintenance of hydromineral homeostasis by inhibiting ATPases and affecting membrane permeability for water. The present chapter reviews the impact of organotin exposure on fresh- and seawater organisms of various phyla by examining the histophathological, physiological and molecular interactions of organotin compounds with relevant enzymes, membranes, the endocrine system, and the consequential ramifications for individuals, populations and community structure in aquatic ecosystems...|$|R

50|$|J.W. Truman and L.M. Riddiford, in 1999, revitalized the {{precocious}} eclosion {{theory with}} a focus on <b>endocrine</b> <b>control</b> of metamorphosis. They postulated that hemimetabolan species hatch after three embryonic 'moults' into a nymphal form similar to the adult, whereas holometabolan species hatch after only two embryonic 'moults' into vermiform larvae that are very different from the adult. In 2005, however, B Konopova and J Zrzavý reported ultrastructural studies across a wide range of hemimetabolan and holometabolan species and showed that the embryo of all species in both groups produce three cuticular depositions. The only exception was the Diptera Cyclorrhapha (unranked taxon of ‘high’ Dipterans, within the infraorder Muscomorpha, which includes the highly studied D. melanogaster) which has two embryonic cuticles, most likely due to secondary loss of the third. Critics of the precocious eclosion theory also argue that the larval forms of holometabolans are very often more specialized than those of hemimetabolans. X. Bellés illustrates that the maggot of a fruitfly “cannot be envisaged as a vermiform and apodous (legless) creature that hatched in an early embryonic stage.” It is in fact extremely specialized: for example, the cardiostipes and dististipes of the mouth are fused, as in some mosquitoes, and these parts are also fused to the mandibles and thus form the typical mouth hooks of fly larvae. Maggots are also secondarily, and not primitively, apodous. They are more derived and specialized than the cockroach nymph, a comparable and characteristic hemimetabolan example.|$|E
40|$|Amino acid {{transporters}} at {{the surface}} of cells are in an ideal location to relay nutritional information, as well as nutrients themselves, to the cell interior. These transporters are able to modulate signaling downstream of intracellular amino acid receptors by regulating intracellular amino acid concentrations through processes of coupled transport. The concept of dual-function amino acid transporter/receptor (or “transceptor”) proteins is well established in primitive eukaryotes such as yeast, where detection of extracellular amino acid deficiency leads to upregulation of proteins involved in biosynthesis and transport of the deficient amino acid(s). The evolution of the “extracellular milieu” and nutrient-regulated <b>endocrine</b> <b>controls</b> in higher eukaryotes, alongside their frequent inability to synthesize all proteinaceous amino acids (and, hence, the requirement for indispensable amino acids in their diet), appears to have lessened the priority of extracellular amino acid sensing as a stimulus for metabolic signals. Nevertheless, recent studies of amino acid transporters in flies and mammalian cell lines have revealed perhaps unanticipated “echoes” of these transceptor functions, which are revealed by cellular stresses (notably starvation) or gene modification/silencing. APC-transporter superfamily members, including slimfast, path, and SNAT 2 all appear capable of sensing and signaling amino acid availability to the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway, possibly through PI 3 -kinase-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesize (by extrapolation from knowledge of the yeast Ssy 1 transceptor) that, at least for SNAT 2, the transceptor discriminates between extracellular and intracellular amino acid stimuli when evoking a signal...|$|R

In wellestablished hypertension, the major abnormality is a rise in total peripheral resistance due to abnormally reduced arteriolar diameter. J The exact cause of the arteriolar narrowing is unknown, although it is now thought that the tissue involved is most probably vascular smooth musc 1 e. That hypertension may be associated with alterations in cellular (and specifically vascular smooth-muscle) activity was suggested in 1952 when Tobian and Binion 5 reported increased sod ium content of renal arteries in postmortem examinations of hypertensive subjects compared with normotensive controls. Recent data suggest tbat the basic. cause of primary hypertension lies in widespread alterations of cell membrane function, altered regulation of free cytoplasmic calcium (Ca 2) and abnormal transmembrane cation transport. 6 Calcium is one of many fundamental regulators of cellular function. An understanding of the general principles of cellular Ca 2 regulation and its relation to vascular smooth-muscle contractility is pivotal to the pathophysiology of hypertension because many cells, tissues and organs use Ca 2 as a positive intracellular messenger...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{behavior}} can be usefully parsed into an appetitive and a consummatory component. Both appetitive and consummatory male-typical sexual behaviors (respectively, ASB and CSB) are activated in male Japanese quail by testosterone (T) acting in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM), but never observed in females. This sex difference {{is based on a}} demasculinization (= organizational effect) by estradiol during embryonic life for CSB, but a differential activation by T in adulthood for ASB. Males expressing rhythmic cloacal sphincter movements (RCSMs; a form of ASB) or allowed to copulate display increased Fos expression in POM. We investigated Fos brain responses in females exposed to behavioral tests after various endocrine treat- ments. T-treated females displayed RCSM, but never copulated when exposed to another female. Accordingly they showed an increased Fos expression in POM after ASB but not CSB tests. Females treated with the aromatase inhibitor Vorozole in ovo and T in adulthood displayed both male-typical ASB and CSB, and Fos expression in POM was increased after both types of tests. Thus, the neural circuit mediating ASB is present or can develop in both sexes, but is inactive in females unless they are exposed to exogenous T. In contrast, the neural mechanism mediating CSB is not normally present in females, but can be pre- served by blocking the embryonic production of estrogens. Overall these data confirm the difference in <b>endocrine</b> <b>controls</b> and probably neural mechanisms supporting ASB and CSB in quail, and highlight the complexity of mechanisms underlying sexual differentiation of behavior.

50|$|The {{pattern of}} prepotential or {{spontaneous}} depolarization, followed by rapid depolarization and repolarization just described, {{are seen in}} the SA node {{and a few other}} conductive cells in the heart. Since the SA node is the pacemaker, it reaches threshold faster than any other component of the conduction system. It will initiate the impulses spreading to the other conducting cells. The SA node, without nervous or <b>endocrine</b> <b>control,</b> would initiate a heart impulse approximately 80-100 times per minute. Although each component of the conduction system is capable of generating its own impulse, the rate progressively slows from the SA node to the Purkinje fibers. Without the SA node, the AV node would generate a heart rate of 40-60 beats per minute. If the AV node were blocked, the atrioventricular bundle would fire at a rate of approximately 30-40 impulses per minute. The bundle branches would have an inherent rate of 20-30 impulses per minute, and the Purkinje fibers would fire at 15-20 impulses per minute. While a few exceptionally trained aerobic athletes demonstrate resting heart rates in the range of 30-40 beats per minute (the lowest recorded figure is 28 beats per minute for Miguel Indurain, a cyclist)-for most individuals, rates lower than 50 beats per minute would indicate a condition called bradycardia. Depending upon the specific individual, as rates fall much below this level, the heart would be unable to maintain adequate flow of blood to vital tissues, initially resulting in decreasing loss of function across the systems, unconsciousness, and ultimately death.|$|E
