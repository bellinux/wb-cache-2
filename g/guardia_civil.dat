5|$|Parties in {{opposition}} to Alcalá-Zamora's government gained {{the support of the}} church and the military. The head of the church in Spain, Cardinal Pedro Segura, was particularly vocal in his disapproval. Until the 20th century, the Catholic Church had proved an essential part of Spain's character, although it had internal problems. Segura was expelled from Spain in June 1931. This prompted an outcry from the Catholic right, who cited oppression. A series of church-burning incidents occurred in major Spanish cities throughout May 1931. When the government refused to call out the <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil,</b> Minister for War Manuel Azaña came under heavy criticism from the rightist press. The military were opposed to reorganisation, including an increase in regional autonomy granted by the central government, and reforms to improve efficiency were seen as a direct attack. Officers were retired and a thousand had their promotions reviewed, including Francisco Franco, who served as director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza, which was closed by Manuel Azaña.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the Madrid bombings, Spain was well {{equipped}} with internal security structures that were for the most part effective in the fight against terrorism. It became evident that there were coordination issues between police forces as well as within each of them. The Interior Ministry focused on correcting these weaknesses. It was Spain’s goal to strengthen its police intelligence {{in order to deal with}} the risks and threats of international terrorism. This decision for the National Police and the <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil</b> to strengthen their counter-terrorism services, let to an increase in jobs aimed at preventing and fighting global terrorism. Counter-terrorism services increased its employment by nearly 35% during the legislature. Human resources in external information services, dealing with international terrorism, grew by 72% in the National Police force and 22% in the <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Mossos d'Esquadra {{received}} {{orders from}} the Mossos d'Esquadra Major Josep Lluís Trapero Álvarez to avoid using force and only warn people to vacate the facilities {{on the day of}} referendum and managed to close about 130 polling stations without using violence. They failed to execute the direct order issued by the High Court of Justice of Catalonia to close the voting centers before they opened and to confiscate voting materials. Due to this unexpected development the Spanish police and the <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil</b> decided to mount operations and try to execute those orders. They intervened and raided 92 polling stations, mostly in Barcelona, after they opened. The National Police and the <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil</b> accused the Mossos d'Esquadra of disobeying the orders to prevent the referendum and instead, complying with the directives of the politicians. This lack of coordination between the security corps provoked tensions between the agents.|$|E

One of them came across a river and saw a man pounding leaves. Curious, he asked the man, [...] "What will you do with it?" [...] The man answered [...] "Akong Tubajon ang suba aron sayon dakpon ang mga isda" [...] (I will poison the river with Tuba leaves so that the fishes could be easily caught). When the man returned to the group, he narrated everything he saw and heard from the native to his companions. From then on, the place was called Tubajon.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the {{uprising}} in Bacolod was attributed to the low morale of the local Spanish detachment, due to its defeat in Panay and Luzon and to the psychological warfare waged by Generals Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta. In 1897, a battle in Bacolod was fought at Matab-ang River. A year later, on November 5, 1898, the Negrense Revolucionarios (Negrense Revolutionary Army), armed with knives, bolos, spears, and rifle-like nipa palm stems, and pieces of sawali or amakan mounted on carts, captured the convento (convent), presently Palacio Episcopal (Bishop's Palace), where Coronel (Colonel) Isidro de Castro y Cisneros, well-armed cazadores (hunters) and platoons of <b>Guardias</b> Civiles (<b>Civil</b> Guards), surrendered.|$|R

The drivers, though, still were not convinced, but the race organizers threatened legal action if no race was run. This, and rumors that the <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil</b> would seize the cars which were in the paddock, which was at Montjuïc Stadium, forced the drivers to call off the strike.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{astonished}} spectators could react, Nava {{ran to the}} Augustinian church, {{claiming the}} right of sanctuary. When Governor Hurtado heard of the events, he ordered the church surrounded and searched, the murderer seized.

Corcuera, upon hearing this, rode his horse directly into the threshold and, with about a dozen emboldened <b>guardia</b> <b>civil,</b> seized Nava, who was summarily tried and sentenced to death.|$|E
25|$|As the Katipunan {{was busy}} {{preparing}} for the revolution, various denunciations regarding its existence reached the Spanish authorities.

Practice got underway again at 12:30 pm, this time consisting of all the teams with the exception of Renault, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Osella. Citing fear of further sanctions in other forms of motorsport should they take part in a race deemed illegal by FISA, these four teams withdrew from practice, although all remained at the circuit in case a compromise deal was brokered before the race.|$|E

The United States invaded and took possession of Puerto Rico in July 1898 {{as a result of the}} Spanish–American War and has controlled the island as a US territory since then. The Insular Police of Puerto Rico was created on February 21, 1899, under the command of Col. Frank Thacher (US Marine officer during the Spanish–American War), with an authorized strength of 313 sworn officers. As of 2009, the PRPD had over 17,292 officers.|$|E
25|$|A {{judge from}} Barcelona is {{currently}} investigating the accusations of police violence {{made by the}} Generalitat against the national police and the civil guard. According to the judge there were 218 persons injured on that day, 20 of which were agents. According to various sources previously reported figures for civilians and police may have been exaggerated. According to the Generalitat de Catalunya, 844 people requested the services of the Catalan emergency health service, this number includes people with irritation by gas and anxiety attacks. Of those injured, most were minor, but four people were hospitalised by the emergency health service and of those two were in serious condition, one due to impact from a rubber ball in the protests, the other for unrelated causes. According to the Ministry of the Interior 431 <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil</b> agents were injured, 39 of them required immediate medical treatment and the remaining 392 had injuries by bruises, scrapes, kicks and bites.|$|E
25|$|His life {{continued}} {{in this vein}} for some time. In 1910 executed a painting of the funeral of his friend the art critic and novelist Raimón Casellas, who had committed suicide the previous year shortly after Barcelona's semana trágica and, for Deering, painted a second version of La Carga, {{this time with the}} prominent foreground figure of a <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil</b> on foot rather than on horseback. Over the remaining years before World War I he traveled extensively in Spain and Europe, sometimes alone and sometimes with Deering, visiting Vienna, Budapest, Munich, Paris, the Netherlands, Madrid, and Galicia. He continued to have major exhibits in Spain and France. In 1913 he acquired an architecturally notable home in Barcelona, a tower on Carrer de San Gervasi (now Carrer de les Carolines) in the Sant Gervasi neighborhood; in 1915, he, Rusiñol, and Clarassó exhibited together in the Sala Parés, celebrating the 25th anniversary of their first joint exhibition there.|$|E
25|$|Overall, 893 {{civilians were}} injured {{according}} to the Catalan health ministry, and 431 members of the National Police Corps and the <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil</b> were injured {{according to the}} Spanish interior ministry. Civilians who requested the services of the Catalan emergency health service include people with irritation by gas and anxiety attacks. Of those injured, most were minor, but four people were hospitalized by the emergency health service and of those two were in serious condition: A 70 year old person {{suffered a heart attack}} and that {{was not part of the}} protests and another that did participate and was struck by a rubber ball on the eye. 39 agents required immediate medical treatment and the remaining 392 had injuries by bruises, scrapes, kicks and bites. The Catalan Ministry of Education calculated that the damage inflicted by the police raids to schools and hospitals, which were used as polling stations, will cost 314,000 euros to fix.|$|E
25|$|Despite the suspension, the Catalan {{referendum}} {{was held}} on 1 October 2017, as scheduled by the Generalitat. Over 12,000 officers from the National Police Corps and the Civil Guard were deployed throughout Catalonia {{in an effort to}} close off polling stations and seize all election material to prevent the vote from taking place. The Spanish government was forced to call off police raids after clashes with protesters resulted in two people seriously injured. 893 civilians and 431 agents of the Nacional Police and the Civil Guard were reported to have been injured initially, and a negligible effect on the electoral process. According to various sources these previously reported figures may have been exaggerated. According to the judge from Barcelona that is currently investigating the accusations of police violence there were 218 people injured that day, 20 of whom were agents. The final official numbers by the Catalan government show that 1066 civilians and 11 agents of the National Police and the <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil,</b> and 1 from the regional police the Mossos d'Esquadra were injured. Reports from the violence spread internationally, receiving a mostly negative response from the media and several national governments, with Spanish police forces criticised for their heavy-handed crackdown on the referendum. The events of 1 October sparked a public outcry in Catalonia, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets to protest Spanish police violence.|$|E
500|$|Castillo Armas {{encountered}} the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in January 1950, when a CIA officer found him attempting to get weapons from Anastasio Somoza García and Rafael Trujillo, the right-wing authoritarian rulers of Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, respectively. The CIA officer {{described him as}} [...] "a quiet, soft-spoken officer who {{does not seem to}} be given to exaggeration". Castillo Armas met with the CIA a few more times before November 1950. Speaking to the CIA, he stated that he had the support of the <b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil</b> (the Guatemalan Civil Guard), the army garrison at Quezaltenango, as well as the commander of Matamoros, the largest fortress in Guatemala City.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{proposal}} was not taken seriously at the time, US Colonel Cornelius Mara flew back to Nicaragua with Somoza to further explore the idea. Somoza persuaded Mara that the plan was feasible, and Mara returned to the US and gave Truman a favorable report. Smith also sent a Spanish-speaking engineer [...] under the codename [...] "Seekford" [...] to contact exiled Guatemalan army officer Carlos Castillo Armas and his fellow dissidents, who were in Honduras and Guatemala. Castillo Armas had been expelled from the country in 1949 following a failed coup attempt against Arévalo. Castillo Armas had been a protégé of Francisco Javier Arana, and had risen in the military to become {{the head of the}} military academy of Guatemala by 1949. Following the failed coup of 1949, Árbenz had him imprisoned under doubtful charges until December 1949, {{when he came to the}} attention of the CIA. A month later, a CIA officer found him attempting to get weapons from Somoza and Trujillo. He met with the CIA a few more times before November 1950, when he launched a brazen attack against Matamoros, the largest fortress in the capital, and was jailed for it before bribing his way out of prison. Castillo Armas told the CIA that he had the support of the Civil Guard (<b>Guardia</b> <b>Civil),</b> the garrison at Quezaltenango, and the commander of Matamoros. The engineer dispatched by the CIA also informed them that Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. Truman thereupon authorized Operation PBFORTUNE, but according to the historian Piero Gleijeses, did not inform the US State Department, or secretary of state Dean Acheson of the plan. Based upon an examination of declassified documents, however, the historian Nick Cullather has stated that the CIA did, in fact, seek State Department approval before authorizing the plan, and that undersecretary of state David K. E. Bruce provided explicit approval for it. CIA Deputy Director Allen Dulles had previously contacted State Department official Thomas Mann and the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Edward G. Miller, Jr.. Both these individuals had stated that they wanted a new government in Guatemala even if it involved the use of force, but did not explicitly tell Dulles to take any action to topple Árbenz.|$|E
