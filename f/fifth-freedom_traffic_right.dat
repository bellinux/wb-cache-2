Industrial structure is determined and evolved by the law of historical development and resources endowment, <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> opening {{can play an important}} role in regional industry optimization evolution because of its unique characteristics in the production elements and the product transfer. <b>Traffic</b> <b>Rights</b> Opening and Its Economic Implications <b>Traffic</b> <b>rights</b> refer to the rights of the international air transport. It first appeared in the 1944 Chicago International Conference on Civil Aviation and formed eight kinds of <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> so commonly used from the earliest five basic traffic rights[1]. Judging from the history of the development and usage of the <b>traffic</b> <b>rights,</b> it is a tool to protect the national aviation interests and national interests[2]. <b>Traffic</b> <b>rights</b> opening refers to a country open up its own <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> to the foreign airlines. The <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> is opened to specific city by governments, therefore, in a sense it’s the monopoly resources of the city, its utilization degree can influence the city’s international competitiveness[3].

50|$|Fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> are {{sought by}} {{airlines}} wishing {{to take up}} unserved or underserved routes, or by airlines whose flights already make technical stops at a location as allowed by the second freedom. Governments (e.g. Thailand) may sometimes encourage fifth freedom traffic {{as a way of}} promoting tourism, by increasing the number of seats available. In turn, though, there may be reactionary pressure to avoid liberalizing <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> too much in order to protect a flag carrier's commercial interests. By the 1990s, fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> stirred controversy in Asia because of loss-making services by airlines in the countries hosting them. Particularly in protest over US air carriers' service patterns in Asia, some nations have become less generous with regard to granting fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>rights,</b> while sixth freedom traffic has grown in importance for Asian airlines.|$|R

5000|$|The fifth freedom allows {{an airline}} to carry revenue traffic between foreign {{countries}} {{as a part}} of services connecting the airline's own country. [...] It is the right to carry passengers from one's own country to a second country, and from that country to a third country (and so on). An example of a fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>right</b> is an Emirates flight in 2004 from Dubai to Brisbane, Australia and onward to Auckland, New Zealand, where tickets can be sold on any sector. Fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> are intended to enhance the economic viability of an airline's long haul routes, but tend to be viewed by local airlines and governments as potentially unfair competition. The negotiations for fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> can be lengthy, because in practice the approval of at least three different nations is required.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{deals with}} the distribution of air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights.</b> Particular reference is made {{to the situation in}} the European Union and the changes that might occur {{in the aftermath of the}} "open-skies" decision of the European Court of Justice in November 2002. One major part of the thesis generally analyses different means of distributing limited public right, in order to determine an appropriate method for the allocation of air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights.</b> After a comparison with the telecommunication sector, it is concluded that the most appropriate approach is to conduct a Beauty Contest in the form of a Documentary Hearing. It is suggested that airlines submit their proposals and the regulatory agencies make their choice based on certain criteria. Subsequently, a glance is taken at the methods for allocating air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> that are currently applied in several countries. It can be seen that all these countries have chosen the same approach, a Beauty Contest, and that they all are facing the same difficulties, which are inconsistency and ambiguity of the distribution procedure. Furthermore, a short evaluation, whether the General Agreement on Trade in Services has an impact on the allocation of air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights,</b> is undertaken. However, this is denied. Based on the previous results an own proposal is presented, how air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> could be distributed in a Beauty Contest, while avoiding most of the difficulties encountered by other countries. This proposal concentrates on the situation in the European Union, but could be also applied in other countries...|$|R
