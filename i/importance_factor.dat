40|$|A multiobjective {{gradient}} based algorithm {{has been}} developed {{for the purpose of}} dose distribution optimization in external beam conformal radiotherapy. This algorithm is based on the concept to gather the values of all objectives in a single value. The weighting factors of the composite objective values are varied in different steps, allowing the reconstruction of the trade-off surfaces (three or more objectives) or curves (two objectives), which define the boundary between the feasible and non-feasible domain regions. The analysis of these curves allows the decision-maker to select the solution that best fits the clinical goals. In contrast to all the other algorithms, our method provides not a single solution but a sample of solutions representing all possible clinical <b>importance</b> <b>factors</b> (weights) for the used objectives. The application of this algorithm for two test cases shows that a correct selection of the <b>importance</b> <b>factors</b> to multiply the individual objectives in the global objective value is not trivial and that the location and shape of the boundary region between the feasible and non-feasible solution regions are case dependent. Provided that the individual objective functions are analytically differentiable and that the number of objectives is the range of 2 - 3, the computation times are acceptable for clinical use. Furthermore, the optimization for a unique combination of <b>importance</b> <b>factors</b> within the aggregate objective function is performed in less than one minute...|$|R

40|$|A new method, {{which is}} capable of {{reducing}} the number of evaluations required by conventional Genetic Algorithms in order to reach the optimum solution, is described. For this purpose, an inexact, low-cost, pre-evaluation phase is introduced. In the proposed method, the inexact pre-evaluation aims at distinguishing the most promising among the population members in each generation, which will only be re-evaluated through the exact, and thus costly, tool. To effect this low-cost screening, artificial neural networks are employed which, in the case of inverse design or optimization of aerodynamic shapes, serve as Computational Fluid Dynamics substitutes. Here, Radial Basis Function networks are used, after being trained on a number of input-output pairs; inputs stand for shapes, i. e., candidate solutions to the problem, whereas outputs are their payoff values. Additionally, this paper introduces the concept of locally trained networks and the autocatalytic use of new sensitivity measures, the so-called <b>importance</b> <b>factors.</b> During the networks' training, the role of <b>importance</b> <b>factors</b> is to distinguish and give priority to the most important among the design parameters.

40|$|Abstract – In San Francisco {{and other}} urban centers, {{developers}} are increasingly choosing con-crete ductile core designs {{for their new}} high-rise projects (most are more than 160 feet in height and many are upwards of 40 stories). Many of these new designs incorporate only a single system for resisting lateral seismic loading. is design approach {{has not yet been}} tested by a significant earthquake in the western United States. For instance, the August 24, 2014 Napa earthquake (M 6. 0) generated peak ground acceleration on the order of three percent gravity (or less) at ground zero for San Francisco’s relatively new concrete ductile core high-rises, nowhere near the level of ground acceleration expected in DBE or MCE earthquakes with epicenters inside 15 miles of ground zero. ASCE 7 provides guidance to the developer when threshold seismic performance tar-gets are selected, specifying appropriate “Risk Categories ” and “Importance Factors”. When the expected occupancy use is residential, most owners and structural designers use Risk Category II, with an <b>Importance</b> <b>Factor</b> of 1. 00. In contrast, when the structure is expected to be used as an office building, many owners and structural designers use Risk Category III, with an <b>Importance</b> <b>Factor</b> of 1. 25. Using Risk Category III and an <b>Importance</b> <b>Factor</b> of 1. 25 for new high-rise resi-dential projects employing the concrete ductile core design approach should increase the seismic resiliency and simultaneously reduce the owner’s legal risk profile because of expected improved seismic performance in DBE and MCE events.

Its application conforms to the principle of guaranteed result and provides constructive lines in obtaining harmonious solutions on the basis of analyzing associated maxmin problems. The use of the Bellman-Zadeh approach has served as a basis for solving a problem of multiobjective allocation of resources (or their shortages) and developing a corresponding adaptive interactive decision-making system (AIDMS 1). Its calculating kernel permits one to solve maxmin problems using an algorithm based on a nonlocal search (modification of the Gelfand's and Tsetlin's “long valley” method). The AIDMS 1 includes procedures for considering linguistic variables to reflect conditions that are difficult to formalize as well as procedures for constructing and correcting vectors of <b>importance</b> <b>factors</b> for goals.

In the present paper, we develop new methods by which to evaluate the rhythm and intonation of English sentences uttered by Japanese learners. The novel features of our study are as follows: (1) new prosodic features are added to traditional features, and (2) word importance factors are introduced in the calculation of intonation score. The word <b>importance</b> <b>factor</b> is automatically estimated using the ordinary least squares method and is optimized based on word clusters generated by a decision tree.

However, the word <b>importance</b> <b>factor</b> with decision tree clustering improved the correlation coefficient to 0. 45.

The five attribute mean estimates from the conditional logit regressions are the attribute importance parameters and represent the (internal) scaling factors that respondents use in transforming their case 2 BWS utilities into ones relevant in multi-profile decision-making. The principal hypothesis was that there were classes of respondents who used identical attribute importance weights. Rejection of this hypothesis prompted testing of secondary hypotheses that respondents placed lower importance on control (independence) and role (doing things that make you feel valued), those attributes thought to be most vulnerable to response shift. Results showed that 17 % of respondents never traded, in most cases illogically given their own ICECAP-O responses, and were dropped. Tests of parameter-equality suggested at least 30 % and possibly as many as 53 % of respondents for whom there is a single statistically significant attribute <b>importance</b> <b>factor</b> and 64 (21 %) of respondents for whom there is a single statistically non-significant attribute <b>importance</b> <b>factor.</b> The remaining 9 % of respondents had a moderate status-quo bias (preference for own life).

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{parameters}} utilized {{to obtain a}} more reasonable performance for structures under earthquake excitations in seismic provisions. General considered parameters in seismic provisions are: PGA, <b>importance</b> <b>factor</b> (I) and typical inherent overstrength and global ductility capacity (R). It is well recognized that the main characteristic of the design of structures under seismic excitation is probabilistic rather than deterministic; therefore, it should be determined if whether the probability of structural damage decreases when such parameters change {{in the design of}} structures. In this paper, fragility curves are developed in order to evaluate these parameters. Fragility curves are employed for various probability parameters. These diagrams are utilized to demonstrate when a coefficient or a number of parameters are used to improve the performance level of a structure. Moreover, it guarantees that the probability of exceedance of the damage limit state decreases, as expected. These diagrams can further illustrate the effect of uncertainty of design parameters. After introducing fragility curves and the application procedure, the effect of the uncertainty of the PGA is displayed and discussed. The results reveal that by increasing the global ductility capacity (R), the probability of damage exceedance is decreased; however, an increase in <b>importance</b> <b>factor</b> (I) for hospital buildings versus office buildings, cannot guarantee a decrease in the probability of damage exceedance. The PGA randomness results reveal that considering PGA uncertainty {{does not mean that the}} probability of damage exceedance will be increased in general cases...|$|E
