The greater reproductive success observed in exclosed nests is likely due to the increased protection from predators that the <b>exclosures</b> conferred; significantly fewer exclosed nests were depredated than nonexclosed nests. However, significantly more exclosed than nonexclosed nests were abandoned by adults, and they had significantly greater adult mortality.

40|$|The use of fences to {{segregate}} wildlife can change predator and prey behaviour. Predators {{can learn to}} incorporate fencing into their hunting strategies and prey can learn to avoid foraging near fences. A twelve-strand electric predator-proof fence surrounds our study site. There are also porous one-strand electric fences used to create <b>exclosures</b> where elephant (and giraffe) cannot enter {{in order to protect}} blocs of browse vegetation for two critically endangered species, the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and the Grevy’s zebra (Equus grevyi). The denser vegetation in these <b>exclosures</b> attracts both browsing prey and ambush predators. In this study we examined if lion predation patterns differed near the perimeter fencing and inside the elephant <b>exclosures</b> by mapping the location of kills. We used a spatial analysis to compare the predation patterns near the perimeter fencing and inside the <b>exclosures</b> to predation {{in the rest of the}} conservancy. Predation was not over-represented near the perimeter fence but the pattern of predation near the fence suggests that fences may be a contributing factor to predation success. Overall, we found that predation was over-represented inside and within 50 m of the <b>exclosures.</b> However, by examining individual <b>exclosures</b> in greater detail using a hot spot analysis, we found that only a few <b>exclosures</b> contained lion predation hot spots.

40|$|Communities in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, have {{established}} <b>exclosures</b> on formerly degraded grazing lands and {{other land uses}} to promote natural regeneration of plants. Village bylaws devised by communities govern the management of <b>exclosures.</b> We analysed the effectiveness of village bylaws {{that are used to}} manage <b>exclosures</b> in addressing forest degradation, resolving conflicts among users over natural resource use, and meeting high expectations of users to realise economic benefits from <b>exclosures</b> through enhancing revenue from sale of grass and dry wood. We collected data using qualitative methods during July and November 2008 in two villages of Tigray. The village bylaws mitigated forest degradation by facilitating users to have common goals in the management of <b>exclosures,</b> and resolved conflicts among users by using monetary sanctions including penalties. The village bylaws were not effective in meeting the high expectations of users to realise economic benefits from <b>exclosures.</b> In some cases, the enforcement of village bylaws was constrained by high social capital, which resulted in the negligence among users in exposing free riders. This indicates that high social capital does not always enhance communal resource management. Moreover, recurrent drought, shortage of fuel wood, and the growing number of landless youths in both villages constrained the effectiveness of village bylaws and further expansion of <b>exclosures.</b> Village committees should focus on addressing the low level of rule enforcement and minimise negligence among users of <b>exclosures</b> through developing a sense of responsibility among users rather than focusing on penalties...|$|R
30|$|The results {{obtained}} outside the “US” and “MM” <b>exclosures</b> showed that understory vegetation cover, biomass and species richness of this old-growth plantation increased over time after thinning, even under severe deer grazing pressure. These measurements were greater 10 or 11  years after thinning than before and just after thinning in these plots. However, understory biomass at 10  years after thinning outside the “US” and “MM” <b>exclosures</b> were approximately one-half and one-third of those within the <b>exclosures,</b> respectively indicating that heavy sika deer browsing can indeed have dramatic effects. Furthermore, understory vegetation outside the “US” and “MM” <b>exclosures</b> {{was dominated by}} perennial, annual, unpalatable, and grazing-tolerant species, whereas understory vegetation within the “US” and “MM” <b>exclosures</b> was dominated by woody plants (trees and shrubs) over time. Overall, these results demonstrate that thinning led to increased understory vegetation in this old-growth plantation heavily grazed by sika deer, and that most understory vegetation was composed of perennial, annual, unpalatable, and grazing-tolerant species.|$|R

Due to a sudden increase in adult mortality in 2006, the use of nest <b>exclosures</b> was abandoned. To assess the efficacy of nest <b>exclosures,</b> a mathematical model was constructed using a system of ordinary differential equations to calculate the change in the population. The model showed nest <b>exclosures</b> to be effective in increasing egg survival. The model also showed that an increase in adult mortality would counteract the increase in egg survival. A change in adult survival was shown to have approximately twice the effect on the population as an equal change in egg survival. Therefore, nest <b>exclosures,</b> under that condition, are not beneficial for the recovery of the population and should only be used with great caution...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Seventeen <b>exclosures</b> {{were built}} by the New Zealand Forest Service within Urewera forests over the period 1961 - 68 to exclude ungulates. Forest {{structure}} and species composition inside and outside these <b>exclosures</b> were compared in 1980 - 81. Some relatively shade tolerant species such as the fern Asplenium bulbiferum, the liane Ripogonum scandens, the sub-canopy shrubs Geniostoma ligustrifolium and Coprosma australis and the canopy species Beilschmiedia tawa were less abundant in certain tiers outside the <b>exclosures</b> than inside. By contrast, only a few species were more abundant outside then inside the <b>exclosures.</b> These included the unpalatable shrub Pseudowintera colorata, turf-forming Uncinia species and Cardamine debilis. Overall density and species richness for small diametered trees and for the sapling tier were lower outside the <b>exclosures</b> than inside. Despite the large reduction in ungulate numbers throughout Urewera forests these introduced browsing animals, particularly deer, still affect the structure and composition of most forest types...|$|R

50|$|To {{protect the}} nests from predators during incubation, many conservationists use exclosures, such as round turkey-wire cages with {{screened}} tops. These allow the adults {{to move in}} and out but stop predators from getting to the eggs. After the chicks hatch, many areas will put up snow fencing to restrict driving and pets {{for the safety of the}} chicks. Threats to nests include crows, cats, raccoons, and foxes, among others. Exclosures are not always used, as they occasionally draw more attention to the nest than would occur without the <b>exclosure.</b> Natural hazards to eggs or chicks include storms, high winds, and abnormal high tides; human disturbances can cause the abandonment of nests and chicks as well. It is best to stay away from any bird that appears distressed to prevent any unintended consequences.|$|E
50|$|The high species {{diversity}} found in shaded polycultures allows for relatively complex food webs to form. Birds and mammals alike play {{a large role}} in pest control by eating many herbivorous insects. In a study in Jamaica, birds were excluded from one coffee plantation and resulted in a 70% increase in the proportion of coffee fruits infected by the Coffee Berry Borer, an insect pest species. Biological control by birds acting as predators on the Coffee Berry Borer in Jamaica was calculated to be worth $75/hectare in 2005, averaging $1004/farm studied. This equals about 30% of the per capita gross national income for that time. Another study in Puerto Rico used <b>exclosure</b> plots to exclude lizards, found to be more abundant in shade-grown coffee than sun-grown coffee, showed that the exclusion of lizards led to an increase in leafminers, an insect that is a serious pest to coffee plants.|$|E
50|$|Cleanup of anthrax-contaminated {{areas on}} ranches {{and in the}} wild is much more problematic. Carcasses may be burned, though it often takes up to three days to burn a large carcass {{and this is not}} {{feasible}} in areas with little wood. Carcasses may also be buried, though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill spores, though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this, while environmentally destructive, causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses, thus allowing the putrefactive bacteria within the carcass to kill the vegetative B. anthracis cells and preventing sporulation. This method also has drawbacks, as scavengers such as hyenas are capable of infiltrating almost any <b>exclosure.</b>|$|E

Both <b>exclosures</b> also had significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.05) higher spore density than free grazing lands without SWC structure.

40|$|The {{influence}} of large predators on lower trophic levels in oligotrophic, structurally complex, and fre-quently disturbed aquatic environments is generally {{thought to be}} limited. We looked for effects of large predators in two semi-permanent, spikerush-dominated marshes by excluding large fish (> 12 mm body depth) and similarly sized herpetofauna from 1 m 2 cages (<b>exclosures)</b> for 2 weeks. The <b>exclosures</b> allowed for colonization by intermediate (in size and trophic position) consumers, such as small fish, shrimp, and crayfish. <b>Exclosures</b> were compared to control cages that allowed large fish to move freely in and out. At {{the end of the}} experiment, intermediate-consumer densities were higher in <b>exclosures</b> than in controls at both sites. Decapod crustaceans, especially the riverine grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus), accounted {{for the majority of the}} response. Effects of large fish on shrimp were generally consistent across sites, but per capita effects were sensitive to estimates of predator density. Densities of intermediate con-sumers in our <b>exclosures</b> were similar to marsh densities, while the open controls had lower densities. This suggests that these animals avoided our experimental controls because they were risky relative to the surrounding environment, while the <b>exclosures</b> were neither avoided nor preferred. Although illuminating about the dynamics of open-cage experiments, this finding does not influence the main results of the study...|$|R

5000|$|Roosevelt elk Cervus canadensis roosevelti range {{along the}} Pacific coast from the Russian River to Vancouver Island. [...] Olympic and Vancouver Island elk {{are some of}} the last pure Roosevelt elk herds left; those in the Cascades have mixed with Rocky Mountain elk.

Other herds live year-round in lowland forests and meadows. Elk prefer more humid areas, the Sitka spruce, wet western hemlock, and mountain hemlock zones. [...] Elk browsing is believed to be responsible for the open park-like structure of the Olympic rainforests; the elk graze on hemlock and shrubs, leaving the Sitka spruce to grow. Elk browsing also increases diversity of grasses and forbs. Elk <b>exclosure</b> experiments in rainforest valleys show more species of vegetation growing outside the exclosures, where elk browse, than inside; while there are more brush and saplings inside exclosures, there are more grasses and forbs outside.

5000|$|Further, the {{population}} at the Mekong River may be particularly vulnerable to human exploitation because the ibis’s use of both riverine and dryland forest in this region, thereby potentially exposing it to more human nest exploiters (various workers in the inland forest, and fishers on the river). This ibis may also be in potential competition with humans during amphibian and swamp eel harvesting during the dry season. Alongside direct habitat loss through land development, the white-shouldered ibis’s habitat could also be threatened indirectly through modern agricultural mechanisation to replace traditional keeping of domestic ungulates that graze and trample on underlying vegetation and wallow in mud to maintain forest clearings and seasonal pools as important foraging ground for ibis. [...] The potentially adverse agricultural changes may be driven by the increasing profitability of mechanised farming. The hypothesis concerning the importance of ungulates to ibises in creating suitable habitats has been supported in <b>exclosure</b> experiments which show increased vegetation height and cover in exclosures fenced to bar ungulates compared to unfenced controls. Therefore, the marked decline of traditional farming livelihood practices potentially beneficial to white-shouldered ibis could lead to increased vegetation growth beside pools in clearings, and thereby render these sites unsuitable foraging ground for this ibis. This may be especially likely considering the local extinction or dramatic decline of many wild ungulate species whose role in ibis habitat creation and maintenance has been largely taken over by human-reared ungulates with equivalent functions.|$|E
30|$|<b>Exclosure</b> {{land use}} type has shown an {{improvement}} in soil organic carbon against the findings by Mekuria et al. (2014).

Thus, highly degraded grazing in the sloppy landscape should be designated as <b>exclosure</b> land management zone to improve soil organic matter (carbon) and other more sensitive soil physical and chemical properties. Besides improving the soil quality and productivity, such information is needed during the establishment of carbon projects and helps improve the livelihood of the local community through improved ecosystem services.

40|$|The {{construction}} of <b>exclosures</b> along {{two of the}} most important rivers in the Kruger National Park was done to investigate how patterns of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the riparian zone is affected by fire, flood and herbivory. To assist this research programme, vegetation surveys were conducted within <b>exclosures</b> along the Letaba River to classify and map the vegetation of the area. The history and experimental design of the Letaba <b>exclosures</b> are {{similar to that of the}} Nkhuhlu <b>exclosures</b> along the Sabie River, which is directly related to questions surrounding elephant management. The main difference between the Nkhuhlu and Letaba <b>exclosures</b> is local heterogeneity, since the latter lies within the Mopaneveld, which is floristically and physiognomically much more homogenous than the vegetation of the southern Kruger National Park. Nevertheless, four plant communities, eight sub-communities and six variants were recognised and mapped for the Letaba <b>exclosures.</b> The vegetation description was done in relation to prevailing soil forms, differences in species richness, diversity and community structure, and therefore should serve as a basis for further detailed and broad-based botanical studies. Vegetation mapping was done to sub-community level and, where possible, to variant level. As expected in Mopaneveld vegetation, the plant communities could broadly be related to soil types, although smaller-scale variations correspond to soil moisture availability because the Mopaneveld is considered &lsquo;event-driven&rsquo;, especially in the herbaceous layer. Conservation implications: Floristic surveying and vegetation mapping of a long-term monitoring site, such as the Letaba <b>exclosures,</b> is seen as a baseline inventory to assist natural resource management.
