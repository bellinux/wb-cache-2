40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U.

40|$|From the introduction]. The idea {{of united}} Europe is {{probably}} dated {{as far back}} as the Roman Empire, which, two millenniums ago, united a vast area from Britain on the north to Persia and Sahara on the south. Balkan countries at that time were a part of a single community, and therefore of a single market which existed at that time in accordance with the level of economic development. Even after the breaking of the large and inviolable Roman Empire, the idea of a union did not lose its importance. It just changed its form over time [...] Further on, this paper is not going to discuss all the structural problems, but is going to focus on the economic structure. In the first part of the overview character, it attempts, through a parallel view of models of EU and Balkan countries in three sectors, to draw the most important conclusions concerning differences in the economic structures among them, as well as the most important structural trends within these regions. In the second part, this paper is going to deal with a specific example of Serbia, a country in the heart of the Balkans, which is still in the process of transition and even “late transition”. As a potential EU member country, it is going to have to adjust its economic structure to the economic structure of EU, thus making it compatible and suitable for easier joining. Not only Serbia, but all Balkan countries, potential EU member countries, are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> seriously on the process of the reconstruction of their economies so they could become a part of the single EU market in the foreseeable future...|$|E
