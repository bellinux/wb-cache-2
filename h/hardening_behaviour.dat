40|$|AbstractA new experimental/numerical {{method to}} {{identify}} post-necking strain hardening phenomena in ductile sheet metal is presented. The {{identification of the}} post-necking strain <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{is based on the}} minimization of the external and the internal work in the necking zone during a tensile test. The proposed method takes the material state and the shape of the whole deforming tensile specimen into account. The post-necking <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a cold rolled interstitial-free steel sheet is identified. A hardening law which enables disentangling pre –and post-necking strain <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviour</b> is presented. The method is experimentally validated using an independent material test. For that purpose, the uniaxial tube expansion test is conducted to obtain uniaxial strain <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviour</b> beyond the point of maximum uniform strain in a tensile test.

The comparison of the experimental results with those derived from several codes and recommendatio ns allows evaluating if the <b>hardened</b> <b>behaviour</b> of self- compacting concrete can be appropriately predicted by the existing formulations. The variables analyzed include the maximum size aggregate, paste and gravel content. Results from the analyzed self-compacting concretes presented variability measures in the same range than the expected for conventional vibrated concrete, with all the results within a confidence level of 95 %. From several formulations for conventional concrete considered in this study, {{it was observed that}} a safe estimation of the modulus of elasticity can be obtained from the value of compressive strength; with lower strength self-compacting concretes presenting higher safety margins.

40|$|The {{most common}} way to {{evaluate}} the stress-strain relation of sheet metal is by performing standard tensile tests. However, those tests only allow {{the identification of the}} <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviour</b> up to the point of maximum uniform elongation, at least when using standard measuring equipment and simple analytical formulas to derive the relation between force and stress, and, elongation and strain. Usually the <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviour</b> beyond this point is estimated by extrapolation of the <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviour</b> before the point of maximum uniform elongation. Such procedure may yield very different results, depending on the hardening law which is fitted to the available experimental data. Other methods which deal with the problem of extended yield curve identification have been proposed and the most applied among them are finite-element based inverse approaches. This paper presents an alternative method to identify the post-necking <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviour</b> of sheet metal without using a finite element model. The key point in the presented method is the minimization of the discrepancy between the internal and external work in the necking zone during a tensile test. The main focus of this paper is on the presentation of the method, the underlying assumptions and the experimental validation. In addition, the method was applied to identify two common hardening laws for DC 05, which is a mild deep drawing steel, using experimental data from the pre- and post-necking region.

40|$|Self-compacting fibre {{reinforced}} concrete (SCFRC) combines {{the benefits of}} SCC in the fresh state with an enhanced postcracking performance in the hardened state thanks to the fibres. The main properties of SCFRC in the fresh state {{will be affected by}} the fibres. The beneficial effect of the fibres in the hardened state (i. e. postcracking resistance) will, among other factors, depend on their orientation in the cracked section. One could suppose that fibres orient along the flow due to the effect of the walls and the velocity profile in the concrete flow. To investigate the influence of hooked-end fibres on the fresh and <b>hardened</b> <b>behaviour</b> of SCFRC, a research program is started at the Reyntjens Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, K. U. Leuven. The following parameters are investigated: length of the fibre, flow distance of the concrete and type of concrete (SCFRC and traditionally vibrated fibre {{reinforced concrete}} (TFRC)).

40|$|Plates {{and shells}} are very {{important}} parts of engineering structures. The performance of structures depends on accurate assessment of the behaviour of all such elements. Accurate valuations of the maximum load the structure can carry, along with the equilibrium path followed in elastic and inelastic range {{emphasize the importance of}} material non-linearity to understand the realistic behaviour of structures. Modelling elements in the inelastic range incorporating the theory of plasticity is complex and lengthy and demands for heavy computations. Elastic-Plastic (with or without strain hardening) is a trivial issue in modelling the material (for both uniaxial and multi-axial Von Mises criteria), in numerical procedures like FEM or in modelling using commercial software. ANSYS or ABAQUS contained already defined material subroutines for such behaviour. The objective {{of this study is to}} have better understanding how ABAQUS performs nonlinear analyses of plate under uniformly distributed load incorporating material nonlinearity. Two material behaviours are considered perfectly plastic and linear strain hardening. The results are validated with reference data from Owen & Hint on (1980) and results obtained from FEM numerical solution. The results are compared in terms of load deflection diagrams, first yield load, collapse load and plastic or yield flow. The effect of thickness and boundary conditions are also studied. ABAQUS results and numerical results are found to be in good agreements. The plastic flow patterns clearly depict the perfectly plastic and isotropic strain <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviours</b> and also follow the patterns given by Yield line analysis of slabs. The patters obtained from ABAQUS and numerical solutions are compared and found to be similar. ...|$|R

40|$|Digital image {{correlation}} (DIC) involves certain errors during correlation, which are highly influenced by factors, e. g. image qualities, DIC parameters, and furthermore, degrees of deformation or strain states. In this contribution, {{attention is paid}} to the influence of strain states on the uncertainty of DIC, including the magnitude and the heterogeneity of the strains. A series of 2 D-DIC numerical experiments are carried out on tensile specimens associated with finite element analysis (FEA). The specimens are made of 3 materials, i. e. steel DC 06, steel DX 54 D+Z, and aluminium alloy Al 6016, and cut into 3 different geometries, i. e. standard and 2 complex designs. Initial images were taken from these real specimens, which were all painted manually with random speckle patterns. Deformed images were obtained by imposing FE displacement fields on these undeformed initial images. Consequently, the errors source from imaging system are avoided, and only intrinsic errors of DIC itself are taken into account. The <b>hardening</b> <b>behaviours</b> of those materials in 3 different orientations were introduced to FEA for simulation, namely rolling direction (RD), transverse direction (TD) and 45 o w. r. t. RD (45 o). In FEA, homogeneous and heterogeneous strain states are achieved through applying uniaxial tension on two ends of the standard and complex specimens, respectively. The strain states are characterized by different material properties and geometries of specimens. DIC calculation are performed at various load steps to investigate the influence of the magnitude of the strain. Errors of the fields are compared among the different specimens to study the influence of the heterogeneity. In this contribution, the qualities of the speckle patterns are considered, since different patterns are applied to each experiment. status: publishe...|$|R
