5000|$|Premium pricing (also called {{prestige}} pricing) is {{the strategy}} of consistently pricing at, or near, {{the high end of}} the possible price range to help attract status-conscious consumers. The high pricing of a premium product is used to enhance and reinforce a product's luxury image. Examples of companies which partake in premium pricing in the marketplace include Rolex and Bentley. As well as brand, product attributes such as <b>eco-labelling</b> and provenance (e.g. 'certified organic' and 'product of Australia') may add value for consumers and attract premium pricing.

5000|$|The word organic {{is central}} to the {{certification}} (and organic food marketing) process, and this is also questioned by some.

In the US, motivated by the cost and legal requirements of certification (as of Oct. 2002), the private farmer-to-farmer association, Certified Naturally Grown, offers a [...] "non-profit alternative <b>eco-labelling</b> program for small farms that grow using USDA Organic methods but are {{not a part of the}} USDA Certified Organic program." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{price premium}} {{can also be}} charged to {{consumers}} when purchasing eco-labelled products.

Pressure from environmental groups have caused the implementation of Associations such as these, rather than consumers demanding it. The value consumer’s gain from purchasing environmentally conscious products may create a premium price over non eco-labelled products. This means that producers have some sort of incentive for suppling goods worthy of <b>eco-labelling</b> standard. Usually more costs are incurred when practicing sustainable business, and charging at a premium is a way businesses can recover extra costs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} trade and welfare effects of <b>eco-labels</b> in a {{domestic}} market with one domestic firm and one foreign firm.

The environmental standard will only apply to the domestic firm, while both firms can adopt the <b>eco-label.</b> Given that the environmental damage is not too large, we find that it is optimal {{for the government to}} introduce an <b>eco-label</b> scheme. An <b>eco-label</b> scheme is optimal even though the domestic firm may loose profit and the foreign firm may gain. Hence, the <b>eco-label</b> scheme is not introduced for protectionist purposes.

50|$|The {{amount of}} waste an {{individual}} produces {{is a small}} portion of all waste produced by society, and personal waste reduction can only make a small impact on overall waste volumes. Yet, influence on policy can be exerted in other areas. Increased consumer awareness of the impact and power of certain purchasing decisions allows industry and individuals to change the total resource consumption. Consumers can influence manufacturers and distributors by avoiding buying products that do not have <b>eco-labelling,</b> which is currently not mandatory, or choosing products that minimise the use of packaging. In the UK, PullApart combines both environmental and consumer packaging surveys, in a curbside packaging recycling classification system to minimise waste.

50|$|The use {{of forest}} {{certification}} can marginalise small and community forest managers as {{the costs are}} shifted onto them without any means {{for them to make}} the money back. Therefore, forest certification tends to be most prevalent in extensive and well documented forests in the global north rather than small or community forests in the global south where they {{would be more likely to}} gain more significant benefits. The dominance of <b>eco-labelling</b> markets in western developed economies may result in smaller producers and suppliers finding it increasingly difficult to enter the market without environmental certification. As a result of this it has been argued that certification is a means of changing the actions of producers in the global south to serve the interests and alleviate some of the anxieties of consumers in the global north.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{interdisciplinary}} nature of <b>eco-labelling,</b> {{the sense of}} the phenomenon itself is lost when studied in isolation. With this consideration, a balance of research between practical and theoretical approaches, between environmental sociology, environmental economics, international trade relations, consumer society, sustainability and marketing theory was explored. <b>Eco-labelling</b> has far-reaching ramifications in society, not just in the commercial relationship between producer and consumer, but in socio-cultural norms and values. It combines economic and social forces via the marketplace. The research of this paper focuses on 1) the socio-cultural aspects of <b>eco-labelling,</b> 2) the economic incentive which drives <b>eco-labelling</b> and 3) the global institutional structures which influence the <b>eco-labelling</b> dimension. Chapter 1 provides an overview of <b>eco-labelling</b> and introduces ecological modernization, the theoretical foundation of this paper. Chapter 2 is a summary of interviews which were conducted with <b>eco-labelling</b> managers around the world. Chapter 3 analyses the economic impact of <b>eco-labelling,</b> the effects on international trade and the environment, and how <b>eco-labelling</b> affects consumers and producers. Chapter 4 deals with the social context of <b>eco-labelling,</b> and the social paradigms of consumer society and sustainability, merging in the case of ecological modernization. Chapter 5 looks at opportunities and challenges to <b>eco-labelling,</b> and concrete recommendations with respect to the design of <b>eco-labelling</b> programmes are made. <b>Eco-labelling</b> is the only tool which functions within the conflicting social forces of consumer society and sustainability. As a market-based instrument for environmental management that functions within the producer - consumer relationship, <b>eco-labelling</b> {{can be seen as the}} ecological marketisation of consumer society.

40|$|Since the {{collapse}} {{of some of the}} major fish stocks around the world there has been increasing pressure from non-governmental organizations and individuals for ocean conservation and more sustainably managed fisheries. This desire to impact fisheries management by supporting sustainable fisheries has manifested itself in the form of seafood <b>eco-labelling.</b> [...] <b>Eco-labelling</b> is {{based on the idea that}} if consumers are provided with environmental information and a choice between products, they will choose the products that have fewer negative environmental impacts.

By reviewing various certification schemes, governmental responses to <b>eco-labelling,</b> and the role of retailers, this paper argues that non-governmental organizations are the real driving force behind <b>eco-labelling</b> and that any economic gains from <b>eco-labelling</b> are generally temporary and do not filter back to fish harvesters and processors.

Korea <b>eco-label</b> provides information on CO 2 emission during the production process. It is a global framing message. Thus, consumers do not actively response to <b>eco-label</b> because they are not personally relevant.

The textile industry is responsible for a large amount of pollution, but has started to follow a more holistic, eco-friendly approach. Information about their eco-friendliness is communicated to consumers via <b>eco-labels.</b> Consumers can influence the textile industry to include more <b>eco-labelled</b> textile products in their desired range of products, by buying and demanding <b>eco-labelled</b> textile products. However, international studies indicate that consumers do not understand textile <b>eco-labels</b> and the information that is found on these labels. A lack of understanding prevents consumers from including such products in their pre-purchase decision-making process. Yet some consumers, from developed and developing countries, are willing to buy <b>eco-labelled</b> products and pay more for such products. Limited research in this regard, within a South African context, is available hence, more research was required in this study field. Therefore, this study aimed to explore consumers‟ understanding and utilisation of textile <b>eco-labels</b> during pre-purchase decision-making. The research for the study was done using a convenience and purposive sampling method with a quantitative structured online questionnaire for data collection purposes. Findings suggest that respondents were environmentally conscious, but only to some extent. Most respondents objectively understood textile <b>eco-labelled</b> products, but not textile <b>eco-labels</b> or organic label information regarding cotton production processes. Respondents indicated that they do not use textile <b>eco-labels</b> when making a pre-purchase decision, yet they somewhat recognised the need to buy eco-friendly textile products, because they are aware of environmental implications. Regarding the information on <b>eco-labels,</b> respondents searched for information surrounding the quality of <b>eco-labelled</b> textile products, followed by the care instructions and the credibility of the <b>eco-label</b> on the product. Finally, there was a segment of respondents who buy and utilise textile <b>eco-labelled</b> products, and are willing to pay a higher price for these products. The higher price was the main factor that prevented other respondents from buying <b>eco-labelled</b> textile products. Consumers can benefit from education regarding environmental issues and how their purchasing choices {{can make a difference in}} protecting the environment. Furthermore, educating consumers about <b>eco-labelled</b> textile products might increase their awareness and utilisation of these products. In turn, this awareness about <b>eco-labels</b> might encourage consumers to include these kinds of products in their pre-purchase decision-making process. Additionally the industry can strive towards keeping <b>eco-labelled</b> products‟ prices relatively equal to regular product‟s prices to make it easier for consumers to choose between the different products, based on their environmental attributes and not price. Finally, the textile industry and manufacturers can focus on making textile <b>eco-labels</b> more attractive and attention-grabbing in order to focus consumers‟ attention on these labels. Furthermore, on these labels, symbols and words should be used together and all elements should correspond to enhance consumers‟ understanding. If all of these elements of an <b>eco-label</b> convey the same message, consumers might be able to understand the intended message by manufacturers and the industry better. Master...|$|R

Of particular interest are transparency issues relating to the design and implementation of voluntary <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes; the criteria used in the design of eco-labels which increasingly reflects the life cycle of products; and the WTO treatment of <b>eco-labelling.</b> <b>Eco-labelling</b> was identified as a significant area in Agenda 21 (1992) and in Doha Declaration (2001).

In order to approach this complex issue, the thesis aims to identify the greening potential and the limits of contemporary <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes for SME product within the German coffee-processing sector. With regard to that, the thesis applied the policy evaluation method "Program Theory Evaluation" (PTE), which assesses a policy in place and thus provides information how the introduction and the function of <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes is observed and perceived by German coffee-processing SMEs (GCPS). Hence, based on a policy evaluation from a rational perspective, which has the focus on the policy’s problem-solving process and implementation cycle, the thesis reveals how <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes’ underlying theoretical greening strategy act in practice to German coffee-processing SME (GCPS). Thereby it could be evaluated that <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes imply shortcomings to address and green GCPS high quality coffee products. As the PTE-method aims also on optimizing the policy’s rationalisation, the inappropriate or failed implementation of <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes by GCPS has been further explored. To grasp the <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes extent of limits to green GCPS products, the thesis compares and analyses the policy evaluation results against the backdrop of <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes’ normative theoretical policy conception and in the light of "Environmental Authority of Political Consumerism (Ecological Modernisation Theory) ". With regard to that, the thesis fosters a policy learning process and uncovers that <b>eco-labelling</b> scheme <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes potential to green GCPS products is limited and conditioned to this a lower level of sustainable value as they are focused to supply mainly the demand for mainstream coffee products. Hence, the thesis concludes {{that it is not the}} underlying rationality of <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes, namely being a consumer-oriented and market-based policy instrument that does not apply to green GCPS products. However, this opens up a new perspective as it points out a sustainable quality gap between products using <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes and non-labelled GCPS high quality products. In return this raises considerations in terms of improving <b>eco-labelling</b> schemes’ contribution to sustainable development.

40|$|<b>Eco-labels</b> inform {{consumers}} {{about the}} environmental {{aspects of a}} product or a service. Consumers who are concerned with environmental issues can use the information on <b>eco-labels</b> to learn the environmental aspects of the products that they buy. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine how often the students of higher education pay attention to <b>eco-labels</b> when they are purchasing and the levels of the five internal factors that may motivate the consumers to pay attention to <b>eco-labels.</b> These factors are pro-environmental attitude (willingness to pay higher prices for products with <b>eco-label),</b> perceived consumer effectiveness (how much they believe that individual actions can improve the environment), belief in environment-friendly buying, trust in <b>eco-label</b> and knowledge in <b>eco-labels.</b> This study provided an opportunity to learn if the students consider the environmental aspects when they are buying and what teachers and education professionals can do to encourage the students to pay attention to <b>eco-labels.</b> Three textbooks used for General Studies for Primary students, three textbooks used in Integrated Science for Secondary 1 - 3 students and six teaching materials published by publishers (there is no textbook for Liberal Studies that is standardized by Education Bureau) used in Science, Technology and the Environment in Liberal Studies for Secondary 4 - 6 students were reviewed to find if the topic of <b>eco-labeling</b> was mentioned in them. It was found that none of the textbooks used for General Studies for Primary students mentioned <b>eco-labeling,</b> all textbooks used in Integrated Science used for Secondary 1 - 3 mentioned the Energy Efficiency Label and all teaching material used in liberal studies also mentioned Energy Efficiency Label, among them, one book mentioned the European Union’s <b>Eco-label.</b> A survey was carried out to assess how often students pay attention to <b>eco-labels</b> and how much they agree to statements relating to the five internal factors that may motivate them to pay attention to <b>eco-labels.</b> A test was given to assess their knowledge in the Energy Efficiency Label Scheme (EELS) issued by the Electrical and Mechanical Service Department and <b>eco-labels</b> issued to food and wood products respectively. The mean was 2. 8 (on a scale of 6, in which 1 means strongly disagree and 6 means strongly agree), when asked if they agreed that they often pay attention to eco- label when they were buying 3. 5 for pro-environmental attitude, 4. 2 for perceived consumer effectiveness, 3. 4 for belief in environmental buying, 3. 6 for trust in <b>eco-labels</b> and 3. 6 in perceived knowledge in <b>eco-labels.</b> 63. 2 % of the students correctly answered that there are five grades in EELS, 40 % of students correctly chose that the lower the grading, the more efficient is the electrical appliance. 8. 4 % of students correctly chose all five kind of electrical applicants that are mandated to show EEL. 2. 1 % attempted to name any <b>eco-labels</b> issued to wood products and 3. 1 % attempted to name any <b>eco-labels</b> issued to food products. It was concluded that students do not often pay attention to <b>eco-labels</b> when they are buying and that the limited knowledge in <b>eco-labels</b> was the potential cause. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R
