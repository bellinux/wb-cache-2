5|$|Buddhist teachings <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> {{the mind}} manifests {{moment to moment}} as sense {{impressions}} and mental phenomena that are continuously changing. The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream {{has been described as}} happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain. The manifestation of the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.|$|E
25|$|Early 19th {{century and}} {{contemporary}} Choctaw storytellers <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> the Choctaw people emerged from either Nanih Waiya mound or cave.

25|$|The Honeymooners {{originated}} from a sketch Gleason was developing with his show's writers. He {{said he had}} an idea he wanted to enlarge: a skit with a smart, quiet wife and her very vocal husband. He went on to <b>describe</b> <b>that,</b> while the couple had their fights, underneath it all they loved each other. Titles for the sketch were tossed around until someone came up with The Honeymooners.|$|E
25|$|The {{events that}} took him from Oxford to Ireland marked a shift from {{medicine}} and the physical sciences to the social sciences, and Petty lost all his Oxford offices. The social sciences became the area that he studied {{for the rest of}} his life. His primary interest became Ireland's prosperity and his works <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> country and propose many remedies for its then backward condition. He helped found the Dublin Society in 1682. Returning ultimately to London in 1685, he died in 1687.|$|E
25|$|In many {{documented}} cases, dextromethorphan {{has produced}} psychological dependence {{in people who}} used it recreationally. However, it does not produce physical addiction, according to the WHO Committee on Drug Dependence. It is considered less addictive than the other common weak opiate cough suppressant, codeine. Since dextromethorphan also acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) users <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> regular recreational use {{over a longer period}} of time can cause withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Additionally, disturbances have been reported in: sleep, senses, movement, mood, and thinking.|$|E

25|$|An {{inaccurate}} {{and informal}} {{interpretation of the}} lower right section by several veterans and groups of the 10th <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> section as follows; the sun with its rays showing the rebirth of the 10th as cavalry. The sun symbol {{is different from the}} 22nd Regimental sun symbol and here represents a renewal. The triangle comes from the Seventh Army pyramid patch which the 510th Tank battalion (Negro), then part of the 19th Armored Group and attached to the 4th Infantry Division and in support to the 22nd Infantry Regiment. Again, the 1911 description and use predates this informal view.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Indian {{paintings were}} the rock paintings of pre-historic times, the petroglyphs {{as found in}} places like Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, {{and some of them}} are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of Ellora, Maharashtra state present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of Ajanta and Ellora caves appeared. India's Buddhist literature is replete with examples of texts which <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, but they have not survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.|$|E
25|$|Children {{learn about}} {{different}} gender categories by observing {{various forms of}} media. They often look for gender roles, with whom they can relate to, from books and television. Conversely, these sources of media will also stereotypically shape a child’s understanding for gender acceptable behaviors. Studies examining the effects of gender stereotyping in children’s literature <b>describe</b> <b>that,</b> most often than not, gender views are affiliated with stereotypes which are both culturally and individually constructed. In children’s literature, male characters {{appear to be more}} central as well as less emotional and stronger. Female characters on the other hand worked out their feelings through expression, they are more dependent and usually adopt the roles of more domesticated characters.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{the third}} theater program aims to {{transform}} the business model. Basically, companies create new forms of business to address social or environmental challenges {{that will lead to}} financial returns in the long run. One example can be seen in Unilever's Project Shakti in India. The authors <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> the company hires women in villages and provides them with micro-finance loans to sell soaps, detergents, and other products door-to-door. This research indicates that more than 65,000 women entrepreneurs are doubling their incomes while increasing rural access and hygiene in Indian villages. Another example is IKEA's People and Planet initiative to be 100% sustainable by 2020. As a consequence, the company wants to introduce a new model to collect and recycle old furniture.|$|E
25|$|Vicari et al. <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> {{it remains}} unclear whether neural {{circuits}} involved in semantic and episodic memory overlap partially or completely, and this case {{seems to suggest that}} the two systems are independent. Both of the patient's hippocampal and diencephalic structures on the right and left sides were disconnected. When C.L. came to Vicari et al.'s office, her chief complaint was forgetfulness involving both semantic and episodic memory. After administering a battery of neuropsychological tests, Vicari determined that C.L. performed well in tests of visual naming and sentence comprehension, visual-spatial ability, and “general semantic knowledge about the world.” They also noted an improved vocabulary and general knowledge base after 18 months. C.L.'s episodic memory, on the other hand, was far below expectations: She could not retain daily events, where she had gone on vacation, the names of places she had been, and other such information. However, this study and others like it are susceptible to subjectivity, since it is not always possible to clearly distinguish between episodic and semantic memory. For this reason, the topic remains controversial and debated.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{described}} as the chief of evil spirits in Vedic-era texts, Kubera acquired {{the status of a}} Deva (god) only in the Puranas and the Hindu epics. [...] The scriptures <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> Kubera once ruled Lanka, but was overthrown by his demon half-brother Ravana, later settling in the city of Alaka in the Himalayas. Descriptions of the [...] "glory" [...] and [...] "splendours" [...] of Kubera's city are found in many scriptures.|$|E

[...] There, a beautiful hall stands under the ash (Yggdrasil) near the well (Urðarbrunnr), and from this hall come [...] "three maidens" [...] whose names are Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld. The maidens shape the lives of men, and [...] "we call them norns". High goes on to <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> there are other norns, and their nature.|$|E
500|$|The core {{creative}} team {{behind the}} project was Reznor, Atticus Ross, and Alan Moulder. Live-band member Alessandro Cortini and studio musicians Adrian Belew and Brian Viglione also contributed instrumental performances on select tracks. Reznor described the band's early intentions for the project as [...] "an experiment", and explained the group's process: [...] "When we started working with the music, we would generally start {{with a sort of}} visual reference that we had imagined: a place, or a setting, or a situation. And then attempt to <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> with sound and texture and melody. And treat it, in a sense, {{as if it were a}} soundtrack." ...|$|E

500|$|Sinatra {{received}} three honorary degrees {{during his}} lifetime. In May 1976, {{he was invited}} to speak at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) graduation commencement held at Sam Boyd Stadium. It was at this commencement that he was bestowed an Honorary Doctorate litterarum humanarum by the university. During his speech, Sinatra noted that his education had come from [...] "the school of hard knocks" [...] and was suitably touched by the award. He went on to <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> [...] "this is the first educational degree I have ever held in my hand. I will never forget what you have done for me today". A few years later in 1984 and 1985, Sinatra also received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Loyola Marymount University as well as an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Austrian SS" [...] {{is often}} used to <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> portion of the SS {{membership}} from Austria, but it was never a recognized branch of the SS. In contrast to SS members from other countries, who were grouped into either the Germanic-SS or the Foreign Legions of the Waffen-SS, Austrian SS members were regular SS personnel. It was technically under the command of the SS in Germany, but often acted independently concerning Austrian affairs. The Austrian SS was founded in 1930 and by 1934 was acting as a covert force to bring about the Anschluss with Germany, which occurred in March 1938. Early Austrian SS leaders were Kaltenbrunner and Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Austrian SS members served in every branch of the SS. Political scientist David Art of Tufts University notes that Austrians constituted 8 percent of the Third Reich's population and 13 percent of the SS; he states that 40 percent of the staff and 75 percent of commanders at death camps were Austrian.|$|E
500|$|During the Paris cholera {{outbreak}} of 1832, {{large quantities of}} so-called chloride of lime were used to disinfect the capital. This was not simply modern calcium chloride, but chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute calcium hydroxide) to form calcium hypochlorite (chlorinated lime). Labarraque's discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms, and by doing so, effectively deodorised the Latin Quarter of Paris. These [...] "putrid miasmas" [...] were thought by many to cause the spread of [...] "contagion" [...] and [...] "infection" [...] – both words used before the germ theory of infection. Chloride of lime was used for destroying odors and [...] "putrid matter". One source claims chloride of lime was used by Dr. John Snow to disinfect water from the cholera-contaminated well that was feeding the Broad Street pump in 1854 London, though three other reputable sources that <b>describe</b> <b>that</b> famous cholera epidemic do not mention the incident. One reference {{makes it clear that}} chloride of lime was used to disinfect the offal and filth in the streets surrounding the Broad Street pump—a common practice in mid-nineteenth century England.|$|E
