A Poisson specification is used to estimate a productivity relationship between research expenditures and <b>drug</b> <b>discoveries,</b> thus {{taking into account the}} integer nature of the data. The result s of estimations using panel data indicate that there is a positive c orrelation between a firm's research and development intensity and it s probability of discovering a new drug.

5|$|In chemistry, {{peptides}} are synthesized by {{a variety}} of reactions. One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using combinatorial chemistry) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in <b>drug</b> <b>discovery</b> through high-throughput screening.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, Rosetta {{was used}} to {{computationally}} design a protein with a function never before observed in nature. This was inspired {{in part by the}} retraction of a high-profile paper from 2004 which originally described the computational design of a protein with improved enzymatic activity relative to its natural form. The 2008 research paper from David Baker's group describing how the protein was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, represented an important proof of concept for this protein design method. This type of protein design could have future applications in <b>drug</b> <b>discovery,</b> green chemistry, and bioremediation.|$|E
5|$|In metabolism, {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide {{is involved}} in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD is an oxidizing agent– it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then {{be used as a}} reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for <b>drug</b> <b>discovery.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future <b>drug</b> <b>discovery</b> and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. <b>Drug</b> <b>discovery</b> from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of <b>drug</b> <b>discovery.</b> In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E

5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of <b>drug</b> <b>discovery.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractChemoinformatics play a {{vital role}} in <b>drugs</b> <b>discovery</b> process in which it {{screened}} out compounds with high probability of failing from the <b>drugs</b> <b>discovery</b> pipeline. Hence, more drugs could be produced in less time and at lower cost. The simplest method in Chemoinformatics that could do as such is the Similarity Searching. Starting with just a simple one target per search, similarity searching is now enhanced to be capable at handling multiple targets in one search. This enhancement is achieved by Turbo Similarity Searching (TSS) that has been proven to increase the recall (i. e. the active recovery rates). TSS incorporates Similarity Searching and Group Fusion in its procedure hence the factors that influence both should also influence TSS. In this paper, we present the concept of TSS investigation on factors related to the usage of different set of similarity measures combination at each phase of TSS and the effect of using different fusion rules on TSS with various descriptors. These are the factors that have been identified to affect the performance of Similarity Searching and Group Fusion. Our initial results indicate that there is a strong influence shown by one of the descriptor (SRECFC) when used at any stages of TSS which returned a high recall. We also observed the poor performance of TSS when another descriptor (ECFC) is used at the second stage of TSS. The second investigation revealed that there are certain preference of descriptors towards fusion modes that gave a recall below random...|$|R
