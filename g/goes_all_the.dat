25|$|An urban myth is that Blackheath was {{associated}} with the 1665 Plague or the Black Death of the mid-14th century. The idea that Blackheath got its name from its use as a burial pit <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to the medieval period, when it was almost certainly used for the disposal of the dead during the ‘Black Death‘. Virtually every part of London has a local tradition about plague pits under, say, a local school or shop. Certainly they were very common. The sheer number of bodies meant that the traditional churchyards became, as one contemporary put it, ‘overstuft’ very quickly.|$|E
25|$|Ada Ciganlija has in {{the past}} been a host to a number of local and {{international}} water sporting events such as competitions in rowing and kayaking. The very first golf course in Serbia has been built on this island in recent years along with a golf club house, a golfing store, golfing school and a practice range. This golf course is also the seat of the first and so far only Serbian golfing association. Also there is a separated cycling and rollerblading path that goes full circle around the lake (approximately 8km long) and is connected to the path that <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way by the Sava river in downtown.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a third of the way down that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there is some sort of horizontal beam at the bottom to act as a fulcrum. This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or it can even be another screw. The leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, and it is very strong.|$|E

25|$|If the {{splitting}} <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{way up to}} the root, {{it creates}} a new root with a single separator value and two children, which is why the lower bound on the size of internal nodes does not apply to the root. The maximum number of elements per node is U−1. When a node is split, one element moves to the parent, but one element is added. So, it must be possible to divide the maximum number U−1 of elements into two legal nodes. If this number is odd, then U=2L and one of the new nodes contains (U−2)/2 = L−1 elements, and hence is a legal node, and the other contains one more element, and hence it is legal too. If U−1 is even, then U=2L−1, so there are 2L−2 elements in the node. Half of this number is L−1, which is the minimum number of elements allowed per node.|$|E

His career, however, <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to Carl Theodor Dreyer's classic Gertrude from 1964.

By contrast, Arsenal made their 21st Community Shield appearance, and won 13, including one shared in 1991. They went into the match as holders of the Shield, having defeated Manchester City a year earlier. Both clubs had only once met before in the Shield, when Chelsea won by two goals to one in 2005. Arsenal had failed to beat Chelsea in all competitions since 2011, and [...] Mourinho was undefeated against his opponent Arsène Wenger in 13 matches. Mourinho told reporters a winless run was something he would not tolerate: “I would try to answer, not because of a mental block but because I would {{want to try to}} find solutions to help my team to do it – try to find a different way, try to find the reasons why it <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time against my team." [...] He also attempted to play down the significance of the match, given Arsenal had won the previous year's contest but finished third in the league.|$|E

500|$|As a subplot, Stan {{spends most}} of the episode trying to return the {{aforementioned}} Margaritaville mixer; the trendy retailer Sur La Table will not accept the return because it was bought on a payment plan. He tries to find out to whom he can return it, each person saying the debt has been packaged and sold to someone else (much like real-life mortgage-backed securities). Eventually he <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the United States Treasury, {{where a group of}} associates [...] "consult the charts" [...] and tell him the mixer is worth $90 trillion.

The chicken falls on the [...] "bailout!" [...] spot, so that is what the men do. In anger at the ridiculousness of the system, Stan breaks the mixer on the platform by the chicken and walks off.|$|E

The upper level contains a corridor that <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way around and a number of rooms. [...] The upper level was adorned with stepped frets and scrolls as well.

2500|$|Deleuze's main {{philosophical}} {{project in}} the works he wrote prior to his collaborations with Guattari can be baldly summarized as an inversion of the traditional metaphysical relationship between identity and difference. Traditionally, difference is seen as derivative from identity: e.g., to say that [...] "X is different from Y" [...] assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities (as in Plato's forms). To the contrary, Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference. Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference, Deleuze argues, [...] "given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus." [...] That is, not only are no two things ever the same, the categories we use to identify individuals {{in the first place}} derive from differences. Apparent identities such as [...] "X" [...] are composed of endless series of differences, where [...] "X" [...] = [...] "the difference between x and x'", and [...] "x'" [...] = [...] "the difference between...", and so forth. Difference, in other words, <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way down. To confront reality honestly, Deleuze argues, we must grasp beings exactly as they are, and concepts of identity (forms, categories, resemblances, unities of apperception, predicates, etc.) fail to attain what he calls [...] "difference in itself." [...] "If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things, it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself, according to what it is, in its difference from everything it is not, in other words, in its internal difference." ...|$|E

I bought the record and played it a million times, then sat down and wrote 'Think of Rain.' That's really how I started writing that way. I just decided it was better than what was happening in jazz." [...] Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne wrote that [...] "It's impossible to exaggerate how beautiful this song is. Everywhere, it takes risks." [...] Bono said in October 2006 during Brian Wilson's induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame that [...] "the string arrangement on 'God Only Knows' is fact and proof of angels". Jimmy Webb, an American popular music composer, has also stated his love for the song, stating, [...] "I love 'God Only Knows' and its bow to the baroque that <b>goes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to 1740 and Johann Sebastian Bach. It represents the whole tradition of liturgical music that I feel is a spiritual part of Brian's music. And Carl's singing is pretty much at its pinnacle—as good as it ever got." [...] In a 2003 solo concert in Tel Aviv, Steven Wilson, frontman of Porcupine Tree, declared [...] "God Only Knows" [...] as his favorite song of all time. On the Insurgentes listening party that took place in Mexico City in 2009, Steven Wilson said it was a perfect song. Simon Neil of Scottish band Biffy Clyro has the lyrics [...] "God only knows what I'd be without you" [...] tattooed across his chest.|$|E
