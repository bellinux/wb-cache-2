40|$|Heating {{and thermal}} {{insulation}} {{characteristics of a}} falling hot water film on the roof or the screen sheet of a greenhouse may be analysed by evaluating the temperature profile of the thin water film. The temperature profile of the falling water film {{can be obtained by}} solving the conduction equation with several suitable boundary conditions, based on the concept of “Transfer and Rate of Processes”. The generalized analytical solution of the temperature profile of the water film was given by Eq. (15) and the average temperature at an arbitrary distance along the direction of water flow, ζ=ζ was given by Eq. (18). From the calculated results of illustrative examples by the analytical solutions, the temperature of the water film at the water film-roof interface, ξ= 1 could be approximated by the average temperature of the water film, an effective distance for heating the air in the greenhouse, ζR was determined from the relation between Φav(ζ) and the dimensionless temperature of the greenhouse ΦR and the most suitable thickness of the water film δ could be estimated by plotting Φav (1) against δ with a parameter ΦR, as shown in Fig. 6. The relationship between Φav(1) and δ in Fig. 6 will be also applicable to estimate the suitable flow rate of water. According to the calculated results, the water film performs broadly the task of thermal insulation at the water-roof interface. The corresponding amount of heat to the thermal insulation effect of the water film was given by Eq. (21), theoretically. Figs. 10, 11 and 12 show the over-all heat balance of the water film obtained by Eq. (21) and the amount of heat calculated from Eq. (21) is evaluated quantitatively by the rate of reduction of heating load for heating the greenhouse. Therefore, the analytical solutions and procedures described here are useful for the calculation of actual <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>heating</b> a greenhouse, the design and operations of the practical water curtain system...|$|E

For that purpose, data {{collected on the}} last census and distribution of households are at first examined.

It is planned that after transferring the heat of brine through a heat exchanger to a secondary loop, the heat contained in fresh water in the secondary loop is transported to the Kâhta County by an insulated 6 km long pipe line, and the heat is distributed to the buildings through a hot water distribution network.

40|$|During exercise, circulatory {{reflexes}} {{ensure that}} the cardiac output is sufficiently elevated to meet the oxygen delivery requirements of the contracting skeletal muscles and the <b>heat</b> delivery <b>requirements</b> {{of the body to}} the skin. The latter requirements are met by increasing skin blood flow. These increases are largely driven by elevations in the body temperatures, although non-thermal effects on the control of skin blood flow occur in certain conditions.

Even {{in the face of such}} non-thermal effects, which occur during exercise in the <b>heat,</b> the body's <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>heat</b> transfer from core to skin are largely met by the increased skin blood flow.

40|$|In {{small and}} medium sized {{manufacturing}} facilities, several situations exist where sources of waste heat and sinks needing heat transfer coexist. Examples of waste heat include {{but are not}} limited to: drained hot water streams from water cooled manufacturing equipments, waste heat from compressors, lighting systems, chiller condensers, boiler blowdown, building exhaust, and flue gas. Examples of heat sinks needing heat transfer include but not limited to drying, space heat, domestic hotwater, air, and oil preheaters. The <b>heating</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> these <b>heat</b> sinks are generally met by burning fossil fuels or even by using electric heaters while available waste heat is rejected to the surrounding environment using devices such as cooling towers or chillers which require additional electrical energy for their operation. The practice of rejecting waste heat to the environment and meeting <b>heating</b> <b>requirements</b> by burning fossil fuels or by using electric heaters results in: a) energy waste; b) global warming due to fossil fuels burning and c) economic inefficiency. The objective of the work reported in this report was to develop a design of a heat rejection system, which will replace the operation of currently used mechanical vapor compression chillers at the GBC Film Products in Addison (Illinois). The designed system utilizes the rejected <b>heat</b> <b>for</b> space <b>heating</b> during the winter season and results in additional savings by replacing the combustion of fossil fuels. The design was unique because the proposed system results in dual savings by: utilizing a low temperature <b>heat</b> source <b>for</b> space <b>heating</b> and by reducing the operating cost of the chillers...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} large unexplained variation in heat requirement-based phenology models, resulting in large uncertainty when predicting ecosystem carbon and water balance responses to climate variability. Improving {{our understanding of}} the <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> spring phenology is thus urgently needed. In this study, we estimated the species-specific <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> leaf flushing of 13 temperate woody species using long-term phenological observations from Europe and North America. The species were defined as early and late flushing species according to the mean date of leaf flushing across all sites. Partial correlation analyses were applied to determine the temporal correlations between <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> and chilling accumulation, precipitation and insolation sum during dormancy. We found that the <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> leaf flushing increased by almost 50 % over the study period 1980 - 2012, with an average of 30 heat units per decade. This temporal increase in <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> was observed in all species, but was much larger for late than for early flushing species. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> negatively correlates with chilling accumulation. Interestingly, after removing the variation induced by chilling accumulation, a predominantly positive partial correlation exists between <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> and precipitation sum, and a predominantly negative correlation between <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> and insolation sum. This suggests that besides the well-known effect of chilling, the <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> leaf flushing is also influenced by precipitation and insolation sum during dormancy. However, we hypothesize that the observed precipitation and insolation effects might be artifacts attributable to the inappropriate use of air temperature in the <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> quantification. Rather than air temperature, meristem temperature is probably the prominent driver of the leaf flushing process, but these data are not available. Further experimental research is thus needed to verify whether insolation and precipitation sums directly affect the <b>heat</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> leaf flushing...|$|R

Chilling and <b>heat</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> breaking dormancy and flowering were studied in five peach (Kosary, Haj Kazemi, Anjiry Asali, Anjiry Zafarany, and Zoud Ras) and four apricot (asgarabad, shamlo, shakarpare, tabarze ghermez) cultivars.

40|$|The {{problems}} associated with providing icing protection for the critical components of a typical turbojet transport airplane operating over a range of probable icing conditions are analyzed and discussed. <b>Heating</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> several thermal methods of protection are evaluated and the airplane performance penalties associated with providing this protection from various energy sources are assessed. The continuous <b>heating</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> icing protection and the associated airplane performance penalties for the turbojet transport are considerably increased over those associated with lower-speed aircraft.
