According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (so around 63% percent). This heritage can be seen on the Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok. The first Anarchist groups to attract a significant following of Russian workers or peasants, were the Anarcho-Communist Chernoe-Znamia groups, founded in Białystok in 1903. The Białystok pogrom occurred between 14–16 June 1906 in the city. During the pogrom between 81 and 88 people were killed, and about 80 people were wounded.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{conventional}} art-historical periodization, in which Modernism inexorably supersedes Aestheticism, and the year 1900 marks a radical break in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> art, is seriously flawed: not only historiographically naïve, it is also tinged with misogyny and homophobia. In a long perspective, it clearly makes sense to divide Victorian Aestheticism from twentieth-century Modernism. But in the shorter time frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Victorian period and {{the first few years}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century (<b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> `long <b>nineteenth</b> century`), <b>the</b> divide is not one of period. Aestheticism and Modernism overlap at this historical moment, and both of them involve serious exploration of basic problems in aesthetics and art theory. The difference between them {{is not a matter of}} chronology; instead it is a question of art-historical valuation, of what will count (in Clive Bell's term) as `significant` in modern art. The paper compares Aestheticist and Modernist paintings to argue that the similarities between them may be as important as the differences, and that this observation may change our evaluations on both sides...|$|R
5|$|By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, most Russian churches {{from before}} the Petrine period had bulbous domes. The largest onion domes were erected {{in the seventeenth century}} in the area around Yaroslavl, {{incidentally}} famous for its large onions. Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while cone-shaped domes are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E
5|$|Until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, Giffnock had no church buildings, and {{religious}} meetings {{took place in}} the waiting room of Giffnock Railway Station and, later, in the clubhouse at Eastwood Golf Course. Orchardhill Parish Church, designed by HE Clifford and completed in 1899, was the first church built within Giffnock. Now a category B listed building, the Church is built in a Gothic revival style of architecture and is built mainly of locally quarried stone.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>ending</b> decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century brought many Americans to the {{realization}} that the people who had witnessed <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> a new country were passing on. Historical societies, newspapers, and enthusiastic individuals began recording their own experiences and collecting biographical information and reminiscences of others. Some of these were published, others archived for posterity. The interviews conducted by Eli S. Ricker are a classic example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process. Ricker moved to Chadron, Nebraska, in 1885. He had various careers, but it was probably his editorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chadron Times that developed his interest in Indians. By 1903 he was visiting Pine Ridge Reservation, recording interviews, and writing articles more representative of a Native perspective than most. In 1910, the family moved to Washington, D. C., where Ricker worked for <b>the</b> Office <b>of</b> Indian Affairs in a menial position that allowed him time to conduct additional research. In 1912 he and his wife went to live with their son in Grand Junction, Colorado. At that time his library held more than 2, 000 books, untold pages of interviews, documents, and copies of documents...|$|R
40|$|This article {{looks at}} {{the ways in which}} early films, as much as {{photography}} and colonial exhibitions, transported the spectators to a version of India existing in great part as <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> unchecked British imagination. Late Victorians and Edwardians stepped into this exotic world through different media, and cinematic exposure to the East would soon dominate visual culture and consolidate the East as a product of European imagination. It investigates the ways in which at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called long <b>nineteenth</b> century a very Victorian passion for geographical spectacle migrated to early films of urban spaces in colonized territories, and reassess the part played by early films in the imperial project by investigating <b>the</b> cinematic image <b>of</b> Indian cities between 1895 and 1914...|$|R

5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation {{as a result of}} industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In {{the second half of the}} eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{introduction}} <b>of</b> {{reading to}} New Zealand by missionaries in 1815 was {{a catalyst for}} enormous change in how Māori communicated and recorded information. Reading was quickly adopted by Māori, who learned in mission schools initially, and increasingly taught each other, both in formal educational contexts and informally in village settings across the country. Missionaries were concerned to promote reading as a means <b>of</b> communicating <b>the</b> Christian gospel, and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early material available to Māori readers in reo Māori was ecclesiastical or scriptural works. However, in 1842 the colonial government established the first reo Māori newspaper, <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> around forty titles which were produced over the period 1842 - 1932 by government, church and philanthropist, and Māori groups. Alongside news, speeches and other items, the niupepa included {{a wide range of}} texts that broadened the genres available in reo significantly. Many reports exist of Māori reading and writing in to the niupepa. Māori reading was, however, often carried out in conjunction with traditions of Māori debate and oral communication, which proved to be pragmatic approaches to <b>the</b> reading context <b>of</b> Māori in nineteenth century New Zealand. Government-controlled niupepa in particular used translated texts, both in niupepa and bound separately, as a means of disseminating information on a ‘civilised’ life and urging Māori to take up European behaviours. Other niupepa, however, in particular the Anglican-Māori Te Pipiwharauroa, He Kupu Whakamarama and Te Toa Takitini and the Kotahitanga niupepa Te Puke ki Hikurangi, promoted reading as a means by which Māori could inform themselves, entertain themselves, and connect with other cultures. Rather than being subsumed by Pākehā culture, these niupepa writers aimed to enrich their lives as Māori by incorporating elements of what they read in the paper. Translated texts, reo Māori versions of originals from other languages, were certainly part of this change, with readers reporting their reflections on the text and its application in their lives. Although responses were varied to reading, with many Māori both reading and lacking interest in reading at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>nineteenth</b> century, a well-developed reading culture in te reo existed in New Zealand, Although reading was not engaged in by the whole population, it was, in many cases, highly respected and a part of daily and official life...|$|R

500|$|Trying {{to resolve}} Larkin's {{contradictory}} opinions on race {{in his book}} Such Deliberate Disguises: <b>The</b> Art <b>of</b> Philip Larkin, <b>the</b> writer Richard Palmer quotes a letter Larkin wrote to Betjeman, as if it exposes [...] "all the post-Motion and post-Letters furore about Larkin’s 'racism' as the nonsense it is":"The American Negro is trying {{to take a step}} forward that can be compared only to <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> slavery in <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. And despite the dogs, the hosepipes and the burnings, advances have already been made towards giving the Negro his civil rights that would have been inconceivable when Louis Armstrong was a young man. These advances will doubtless continue. They will end only when the Negro is as well-housed, educated and medically cared for as the white man."Reviewing Palmer's book, John G. Rodwan, Jr. proposes that: [...] "a less forgiving reader could counter by asking if this does not qualify as <b>the</b> thought <b>of</b> a “true racist”: 'I find <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation quite terrifying. In 10 years’ time we shall all be cowering under our beds as hordes of blacks steal anything they can lay their hands on.' Or this: 'We don’t go to cricket Test matches now, too many fucking niggers about.'"Despite controversy about his personal life and opinions, Larkin remains one of Britain's most popular poets. In 2003, almost two decades after his death, Larkin was chosen as [...] "the nation's best-loved poet" [...] in a survey by the Poetry Book Society, and in 2008 The Times named Larkin as the greatest British post-war writer. Three of his poems, [...] "This Be The Verse", [...] "The Whitsun Weddings" [...] and [...] "An Arundel Tomb", featured in the Nation's Top 100 Poems as voted for by viewers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC's Bookworm in 1995.

This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place. The orphanage was an old colonial house from the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E

5|$|The Baronial style peaked {{towards the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, and the {{building}} of large houses declined in importance in the twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890 he produced a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller (1864–1906) in the Adam style. The baronial style continued to influence the construction of some estate houses, including Skibo Castle, which was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth.

5|$|Wristwatches {{were first}} worn by {{military}} men towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, when {{the importance of}} synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized.

The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time.
