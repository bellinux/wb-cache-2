500|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the {{follow-up}} to Yo La Tengo's highly acclaimed 1995 album Electr-O-Pura, which was ranked at number 9 in The Village Voices 1995 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step {{at the time and}} just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 8 December 2016, {{the band}} {{announced}} that they had begun working on their fifth studio album since October 2016, consisting of nine tracks including [...] "Kaban" [...] and planned {{to be released in}} 2017. Depha has said of the album [...] "We will be using the same method and genre {{for the rest of the}} songs except for few rock numbers, which <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> heavier than our previous songs. But we still maintain the album weight, balancing it with a number of rock ballad too and of course will be working hard on it to maintain the quality of the whole album soon". However, despite the band’s fifth album title has been confirmed and finalized, Masterpiece stated that they will reveal it at a later date.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} stages of production, Foreman said that the record <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> {{different}} sonically, initially [...] "shaping up to be more acoustic AND more electronic". [...] "You know, it’s {{one of those things where}} you get to a point where you kind of want to shock yourself again", said Foreman.|$|R
2500|$|... "Oh my God, {{have you}} ever been robbed? I have. I’ve been {{physically}} robbed a couple of times, but this is much worse. Those songs came out and people are like, 'Oh my God, what direction is Kelly going?' I think what made me mad was that. People stole from me, everybody had no idea what my next album <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like. That really caused a lot of confusion. Here’s the best part though, nothing that’s leaked is the final version. Those are all demos." ...|$|R

2500|$|Underwood {{confirmed}} that she began planning {{a new album}} in August 2013 and would start prep work sometime in 2014. Underwood told Billboard, [...] "After The Sound of Music, I feel like I can really buckle down and start working on the next album." [...] Underwood also stated she has been planning another tour, which might be toned down from her earlier ones, stating, [...] "I haven't thought about it much because I don't know what the next album <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like, but I like just standing there and singing, too. I may take a different approach, a more simple approach on the next one. I loved the energy that rock concerts had," [...] Underwood told Billboard. Underwood is featured on Miranda Lambert's album Platinum, on a song called [...] "Somethin' Bad". Released as a single, [...] "Somethin' Bad" [...] reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming Underwood's 13th number-one on the chart. The same week, the song vaulted to No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
5000|$|The PopMatters {{review by}} Will Layman states [...] "Piano Sutras is a glorious, generous, fully mature {{expression}} of creativity {{that could only}} have come from one artist. It is as good and adventurous as jazz <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> in 2013." ...|$|E
5000|$|Henderson said [...] "I {{think this}} is {{probably}} the most excited I have been in a long time, [...] "Light Up the Dark" [...] gives you a sneak peek into what the album <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like and it’s so awesome that it was a part of such a cool Aussie film!" ...|$|E
500|$|The title The Cookbook derived of Elliott feeling [...] "no two records <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> alike; each {{record has}} its own spices and herbs. Each record is cooking up a hot recipe for a hot album." [...] The black and white cover {{features}} Elliott posing with a vintage microphone in a 1920s juke joint. She explained the cover, saying, [...] "I wanted people to see I was taking music back to the roots—not just hip hop, but our ancestors. Whether they was on railroad tracks or cooking in somebody's kitchen, they was always singing." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{full year}} before Bat Out of Hell brought him {{international}} success, vocalist Meat Loaf {{was brought in}} by producer Werman to sing on the album. Meat Loaf was paid the sum of $1000 for his contributions to the album, which included crafting all of the vocal arrangements and two days of recording sessions. He says that after he agreed to do the album he was sent a lyric sheet containing just the words with no arrangements. Having {{no idea what the}} songs <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like, he nonetheless created the vocal arrangements for every song.|$|R
2500|$|... "The song 'Let Me In' is me on {{the phone}} to Kurt, trying {{to get him out of}} the frame of mind he was in," [...] said Stipe. [...] "I wanted him to know he didn't need to pay {{attention}} to all this; that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make it through. I know what the next Nirvana record <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like. It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an amazing fucking record, and I'm a little angry at him for killing himself. He and I <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a trial run of the album. It was set up. He had a plane ticket. At the last minute he called and said, 'I can't come.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2012, {{somebody}} hacked Craig's personal {{e-mail that}} contained some demos that circulated on the internet; Craig stated the leaked material {{will not be}} on his upcoming solo EP.

5000|$|This <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> heretical {{coming from}} me, but I don't {{think there is}} a Generation X. What I {{think a lot of people}} mistake for this thing that might be Generation X is just the {{acknowledgment}} that there exists some other group of people whatever, whoever they might be, younger than, say, Jane Fonda's baby boom.

I really enjoy it {{and look forward to}} it every week." [...] - Adam Buxton ...|$|E
5000|$|Templeman later {{explained}} {{having to}} record the album in an unfamiliar studio negatively affected the final product. [...] "I {{had a great time}} making that record, and Steven {{was one of the most}} amazing guys. But we had to do that record in Berkeleybecause they didn’t want those guys to score (drugs). They didn’t want them to be in L.A. or San Francisco. I wasn’t familiar with the board. As a producer, if you know your room and the mic preamps, you know how things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound.</b> I don’t think I made Joey’s drums sound as good as they could have, or Joe’s guitar." [...] Geoff Edgers ...|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic largely {{praised the}} album's unusual {{stylistics}} in their retrospective review, commenting that Status Quo [...] "were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find their characteristic sound in their posterior effort, Piledriver, but never again <b>were</b> they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> as innovative and inventive as they sound here." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Yeah, {{he talked}} a lot about what {{direction}} he was heading in", Cobains friend, R.E.M.s lead singer Michael Stipe, told Newsweek in 1994. [...] "I mean, I know what the next Nirvana recording <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like. It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very quiet and acoustic, with lots of stringed instruments. It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an amazing fucking record, and Im a little bit angry at him for killing himself. He and I <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> record a trial run of the album, a demo tape. It was all set up. He had a plane ticket. He had a car picking him up. And at the last minute he called and said, I cant come". Stipe was chosen as the godfather of Cobain and Courtney Loves daughter, Frances Bean Cobain.|$|R
5000|$|Shaw's {{comment about}} {{his work in the}} game audio area:"I would not {{want to go back to}} the early days of game audio design. This was a time when audio was very much the afterthought. Nowadays, I need to be in on the early {{conceptual}} stages of game design if the game <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> any good. The audio designer can bring as much to the early game design as anyone else can." ...|$|E
50|$|I've {{wondered}} about that. This <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> bizarre to most people, but ALL inspiration comes from {{something similar to}} the way a radio works. If you imagine that everything ever known or will be known exists between the lowest and the highest frequencies, we simply either stumble upon a brilliant song accidentally, or we spend our lives searching for great songs and find them where we may. Invention works like that. I think Tesla said something to that effect: We are simply filters for Divine Knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|Citing Deerhunter, Woods, Kurt Vile and Girls as his key influences, Mondanile elaborated: [...] "All those dudes {{have great}} songs, {{but they also}} improvise a lot. It {{definitely}} influenced {{me in a way}} for this record, because I wanted to make more songs. But it’s not going to get more and more poppy after this. I want each record to be its own unique thing that attaches to the other records, but I’m just learning how to do what I’m doing. So everything <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> different." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following {{a record}} deal signed with Warner Bros. Records in September 2011, LP {{recorded}} a song titled [...] "Into the Wild", which was prominently {{used in a}} Citibank TV commercial {{in the end of}} 2011. In April 2012, LP released an extended play Into the Wild: Live at EastWest Studios, and [...] "Into the Wild" [...] was released as a single in May 2012. LP started touring, which pushed the release of her major-label debut album back.Initially, the album <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> as [...] "a bit more of an acoustic thing," [...] however, LP and producer Rob Cavallo started adding more layers to the songs, and eventually their sound grew bigger.|$|R
5000|$|Lead singer Mick Hucknall {{said of the}} album: [...] "Once I began {{wondering}} how Simply Red <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound,</b> I started writing songs. With ‘Stay’ I was running away from Simply Red. But now I'm comfortable {{with the notion of}} us as a blue-eyed soul group. I had to stop myself fighting that idea. Our sound is original too. I honestly don't know of another band that has pulled so many musical strands together". Hucknall has said he wanted to make an album like Stars with a consistent theme: [...] "And the theme here is life from a family viewpoint. It’s an album that deals with birth, love, death, and all the stuff in between".|$|R
5000|$|The band's {{original}} name, Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr., {{was suggested}} to the pair as a joke. When asked by NASCAR.com's David Caraviello about the name, Zott stated, [...] "The name for us {{was just a}} way to identify our crazy new project that had no limitations. People have no idea how we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound,</b> and so it gives them a reason to actually take some time to listen to the music." [...] According to ESPN The Magazine, Dale Earnhardt Jr. is a fan of Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. The band emailed him to assure him they were not making fun of him and sent him a few samples of their music.|$|R
50|$|The timekeeper's twenty-minute count-down {{clock is}} not {{displayed}} at a football game. Rather, a count-up clock is displayed, {{which is not}} stopped when the umpire blows time off. As such, patrons and players at a football game never know exactly when the siren <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound,</b> which makes close games particularly tense. Typically, a twenty-minute quarter will last between 27 and 33 minutes; the time period between the 20 minute mark and the siren {{is referred to as}} time on. The coaches' boxes and television networks are provided with a feed to the timekeeper's count-down clock in professional games.|$|E
50|$|Inflating {{the meaning}} of 'antisemitism' to include {{anything}} politically damaging to Israel is a double-edged sword. It may be handy for smiting your enemies, {{but the problem is}} that definitional inflation, like any inflation, cheapens the currency. The more things get to count as antisemitic, the less awful antisemitism <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound.</b> This happens because, while no one can stop you from inflating definitions, you still don't control the facts. In particular, no definition of 'antisemitism' is going to eradicate the substantially pro-Palestinian version of the facts which I espouse, as do most people in Europe, a great many Israelis, and a growing number of North Americans.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014 Kerr's {{book was}} {{published}} by Plume Books, a Penguin imprint. Writing for The New York Times, Dwight Garner called My Boyfriend Barfed [...] "the Lorrie Moore short story, or the Tina Fey memoir, of cleaning tutorials...a wise and funny new book." [...] At NPR Linda Holmes praised Kerr as [...] "at her most irresistible when she's handling the kinds of awkward questions that do traditionally go unanswered in your women's magazines and your perky home-maintenance shows." [...] The Huffington Post told readers: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like an oxymoron, {{but there is a}} genuinely amusing cleaning book out there. Really.

50|$|The biggest {{point of}} {{difference}} between the first record {{and this one is}} the time we took preparing. The preparation time for the first album was like, a couple of years on the road. So we were basically like a garage pop band who went into a studio. Dennis didn't really give us the chance to develop or grow beyond that. It was like what we knew went onto the record. This time it was... like an exam. We studied way harder; just the preparation was far more intense. Once we had {{a pretty good idea of}} what everything <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like, we didn't need much time in the studio, because we had spent six months working on the demos.|$|R
5000|$|Spencer Tracy is the self-titled {{debut album}} by Spencer Tracy, {{released}} in August 2003. It {{was selected as}} Triple J's [...] "album of the week" [...] (August 8 to August 15, 2003). Richard Kingsmill wrote in The Music Network: [...] "I championed Spencer Tracy a little bit around here because I was so surprised by it. I underestimated the band and didn’t think they {{could come up with}} a whole album of good guitar pop but they did. I {{thought it was a good}} strong positive record. It wasn’t just three singles and then really average material. I thought I can’t really fault this, there’s at least six or seven songs that <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> great on the radio." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tool for Evening is {{the fourth}} studio album {{released}} by The Big Wu during the seventh annual Big Wu Family Reunion on Memorial Day weekend in 2004. The album was recorded 20 minutes outside of The Big Wu’s birthplace at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The band took an unconventional approach to producing the CD, when they walked into the studio and set up their equipment, not knowing what songs were to be played or how they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound.</b> [...] "We wanted to capture the same feeling as our live shows," [...] said Big Wu guitarist Chris Castino.

We wrote and wrote, and felt we really achieved what we were going for ... we're really proud of what we've come up with." [...] Johnny Christ stated about the album's musical style in an interview with bravewords: [...] "It's definitely us. It's just the next progression. It's probably the heaviest record that we've put out - in its own right. It's been a great response for the single (Hail to the King) so far, which I feel {{is a good way to}} see what the rest of the record <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like. There will be some surprises in there for fans, but overall, I'm just excited." [...] He also said the album is more groove metal-oriented. The album also shows a thrash metal sound, with fast to mid-paced tempos, heavily distorted guitars and war, religious intolerance or corruption themed lyrics.|$|E
5000|$|Old Habits {{was planned}} to be Smash Mouths fifth studio album and was {{expected}} to be released in the summer of 2005. According to the bands official website at the time, the album <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> much more like ska punk, similar to Fush Yu Mang and The East Bay Sessions. In September 2005, the band performed what <b>was</b> tentatively <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the albums first single, [...] "Getaway Car", on Last Call with Carson Daly. The album was delayed many times, in the hope of gaining publicity with Steves appearance on the reality show The Surreal Life. Smash Mouth returned to the studio intent on making their new record better, however, Old Habits was eventually shelved and most tracks were remixed and released on Summer Girl. One also ended up on Greg Camps solo album Defektor.|$|R

5000|$|Regarding the {{creative}} process behind [...] "Lean On", producer Major Lazer said, [...] "We wrote this song with Armaan Malik very early from an instrumental Jr. Blender created in some sessions in Trinidad. It was a strong hook. Very big to me but the production was lacking an attitude we needed. A year later I remixed the song at a completely different tempo and asked DJ Snake for a signature post chorus. After he did his thing, me, MØ and Blender rewrote the song at the new tempo in Las Vegas and made something very unique that became our album's lead-off single. We're super proud of this song." [...] Diplo offered a slower reggae arrangement of the song to Rihanna, who rejected it. He also offered said arrangement of the song to Nicki Minaj, who turned it down as well. Diplo called this turn of events [...] "a blessing in disguise. MØ sounds better than anybody <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> on that record." ...|$|R
