40|$|Abstract Background Malaria infects over 300 {{million people}} {{every year and}} one of the major {{obstacles}} for the eradication of the disease is parasite's resistance to current chemotherapy, thus new drugs are urgently needed. Quantum dot (QD) is a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>nanocrystal</b> that has been in the spotlight as a robust tool for visualization of live cell processes in real time. Here, a simple and efficient method using QD to directly label Plasmodium falciparum -infected erythrocytes (iRBCs) was searched in order to use the QD as a probe in an anti-malarial drug-screening assay. Methods A range of QDs with different chemical coatings were tested for their ability to specifically bind iRBCs by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). One QD was selected and used to detect parasite growth and drug sensitivity by flow cytometry.

An excellent Z-factor of 0. 8 shows that the QD assay is suitable for high-throughput screening.

In the available methods of fluorescent labeling (optical encoding) of microcapsules, polymers are conjugated or physically mixed with fluorescent labels [14, 15]. The fluorescent components determining the optical properties of the microcapsules can also be incorporated inside them via co-precipitation of polymers labeled with fluorescent dyes during preparation of the matrix microparticles, e.g., calcium carbonate microspherolites [16]. They can also be encapsulated after the matrix is removed; for this purpose, diffusion of low and high molecular weight compounds through the polymer membrane is ensured by increasing the ionic strength or pH of the microenvironment. However, optical encoding of polyelectrolyte microcapsules with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>nanocrystals</b> is more promising due to their unique optical properties and effectiveness in bioimaging [17].|$|R

To give evidence of the inner wall lipid coating we applied X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), laser scanning microscopy (LSM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The high temperature stability (up to more than 200 °C) of the thin tetraether lipid film was proved with thermogravimetric infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and allows sterilization of the coated membrane up to this temperature.

Among them, cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs have become one family of the most extensively studied <b>fluorescent</b> semiconductor <b>nanocrystals</b> due to their suitable and tunable band gap throughout the visible spectrum [3]. The high-temperature chemical reaction was a well-known approach for the synthesis of highly crystalline and monodisperse CdSe QDs with bright fluorescence using organometallic or chelated cadmium and phosphine-coordinated selenium as precursors [4 – 6]. However, besides the use of expensive, toxic chemicals, the as-received QDs were usually hydrophobic and must be converted into water-soluble nanocrystals through surface ligand exchanges [7] or encapsulations of polymers [8] and thin silica layers [9] for biological applications. The possible weight loss and decrease in quantum yields are always unavoidable during the conversion [7].|$|R

Lower vertebrate animals are potential models for analysis of CSF flow during development because they are oviparous. Albino Xenopus laevis larvae are nearly transparent and have a straight, translucent brain that facilitates the observation of fluid flow within the ventricles.

Subsequent cation exchange of Cu to Cd at high temperature (180 degrees C) results in highly <b>fluorescent</b> CdTe <b>nanocrystals,</b> with less than 1 mol 96 of residual Cu remaining in the lattice. The procedure preserves the overall disk shape, but {{is accompanied by a}} substantial reconstruction of the anion sublattice, resulting in a reorientation of the c-axis from the surface normal in Cu 2 Te into the disk plane in CdTe nanodisks. The synthesized CdTe nanodisks show a continuously tunable photoluminescence (PL) peak position, scaling with the thickness of the disks. The PL lifetime further confirms that the CdTe PL arises from band-edge exciton recombination; that is, no Cu-related emission is observed. On average, the recombination rate is about 25 - 45 % faster with respect to their spherical quantum dots counterparts, opening up the possibility to enhance the emission rate at a given wavelength by controlling the nanocrystal shape. Finally, with a PL quantum efficiency of up to 36 % and an enhanced PL stability under ambient conditions due to a monolayer of CdS formed on the nanocrystal surface during cation exchange, these flat quantum disks form an interesting enrichment to the current family of highly <b>fluorescent,</b> shape-controlled <b>nanocrystals...</b>|$|R

Each FDA nanocrystal can be converted into similar to 2. 6 x 10 (6) fluorescein molecules, which is useful for improving immunoassay sensitivity and limits of detection. NeutrAvidin was simply adsorbed onto the surface of the FDA nanocrystals, which were coated with distearoylglycerophosphoethanolamine (DSPE) modified with amino(poly(ethylene glycol)) (PEG(2000) -Amine) as an interface for coupling biomolecules. This can be applied to detect different kinds of analytes that are captured by corresponding biotinylated biomolecules in different bioanalytical applications. The applicability of the NeutrAvidin-labeled nanocrystals was demonstrated in an immunoassay using the labeled avidin-biotin technique. Biotinylated antibody and FDA-labeled avidin were applied to the assay sequentially. The performance was compared with the traditional sandwich-type assay for mouse immunoglobulin G detection. Following the immunoreaction, the nanocrystals were released by hydrolysis and dissolution instigated by adding a large volume of organic solvent/sodium hydroxide mixture. The limit of detection was lower (by a factor of 2. 5 - 21) and the sensitivity was (3. 5 - 30 -fold) higher than immunoassays using commercial labeling systems (FITC and peroxidase).

A two-step approach without layer-by-layer techniques is described to encapsulate the fluorogenic precursor fluorescein diacetate (FDA) nanocrystals (107 -nm average size) followed by conjugation of the antibody. Distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) modified with amino(poly(ethylene glycol)) (PEG(2000) Amine) is coated {{on the surface of the}} FDA nanocrystals to provide a interface for the antibody coupling. Antimouse antibodies are attached to the nanocrystalline FDA biolabels by adsorption. A high molar ratio of fluorescent molecules to biomolecules (2. 8 x 10 (4)) is achieved in this nanocrystal biolabel system. The analytical performance of the nanocrystal-based label system is evaluated in a model sandwich immunoassay for the detection of mouse IgG. After separation of the nonbound antibody nanocrystal labels, fluorophores are released by hydrolysis and dissolution of the nanocrystalline FDA. Due to the release of the fluorophores (fluoresceins) into a large volume of organic solvent/sodium hydroxide mixture, self-quenching is suppressed. The FDA[DSPE-PEG(2000) Amine]-modified biolabels have a highly stable colloidal suspension with minimized nonspecific interactions.
