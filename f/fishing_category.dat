The most dominant occupation (32.5%) is in the agriculture, forestry and <b>fishing</b> <b>category.</b> With limited forestry restricted to the south-eastern corner and no coastal connection for fishery, this category is dominated by sheep and beef production. The second highest occupation is government services, which includes local government and health and social service care (19.8%). This is followed by five categories including retail trade; construction; education and training (schools mostly); transport, postal and warehousing; and accommodation and food services, which all provide significant employment (5 to 8%) in the Galilee Basin. Currently mining is a low-level occupation category within the subregion at 1.3% but this may increase during the constructional and/or operational phases of projected coal mining and coal seam gas extraction developments, with possible impacts on other employment categories.|$|E

Estimated catch by month, by <b>fish</b> <b>categories</b> and both (factors not considered in the sampling design) demonstrated that, as the level of required detail increased, the catch estimates became more biased and less precise. However, when comparing to the 2011 true catches, the order of importance of <b>fish</b> <b>categories</b> based on estimated catches changed slightly in some positions after the fifth place. There was a minor cost reduction due to the sampling in comparison with the census methodology currently in use (15. 4 % at most).

As variable fishing effort is regulated and effort caps appear to be binding, I argue that social choice of political lobbying effort becomes the principal choice variable by which commercial fishermen continue to press for additional fishing opportunities relative to the regulator’s desired catch target.

40|$|Between 1995 and 2009 {{hammerhead sharks}} were sampled from the {{landings}} {{of the industrial}} fleets based in the harbours of Itajaí and Navegantes, Santa Catarina State, and Ubatuba, São Paulo State, Brazil. In this case, fishing boats which operated with gillnets longlines and trawls along the southern Brazilian Economic Exclusive Zone and international adjacent waters were targeted. A total of 2483 and 353 S. lewini and S. zygaena carcasses respectively were sexed, measured and converted to total lengths (LT). Additionally information about, year, season, latitude/longitude and local depth (m) from the catches, by <b>fishing</b> <b>category,</b> were obtained. During the considered period, intense fishing mortality over pups was caused by gillnets and trawls operating on shallow waters (≤ 20 m) and over juveniles along the continental shelf (> 20 m and ≤ 200 m). Additionally, adults were exploited by driftnets and longlines along the shelf border and slope (> 200 m). Therefore, both hammerhead species are exploited at all life-stages and throughout their migratory circuit. This includes during their inshore-offshore migration while they are growing from pups to juveniles and as the offshore-inshore migration of pregnant females to pupping areas in shallower waters. This apparently unsustainable exploitation pattern, over different size classes (newborns-juveniles-adults), and the economic pressure caused by the international fin market, {{is one of the}} reasons for population declining of these two species in southern Brazil. Non fishing zones for the hammerheads, protecting their migratory circuit, which is driven by their growth pattern and reproduction, are necessary. Additionally, fishing effort reduction and a control over the international fin market are recommended. ...|$|E

Fins were analyzed in two <b>categories</b> of <b>fish</b> (weight below 30 g (min. 5 g) and over 100 g (max. 250 g)). Thirty <b>fish</b> per <b>category</b> were randomly selected, netted and each rayed fin was assessed and photographed (total of 5880 fins were analyzed in 840 fish from seven rainbow trout farms). The prevalence of fin damage was 100 % and there was a large range in the level of damage which was mainly characterized by surface abrasions. Worst affected fins in both <b>fish</b> <b>categories</b> were dorsal and pectoral fins. Fin damage was present to a lesser degree in the smaller categories, but there was fin damage in the smallest fish examined. Pattern of damage was Dorsal > Pectoral > Abdominal > Anal > Tail fin. Differences in fin damage in all surveyed farms indicate that some factor or group of factors specific to each farm influence the extent of damage. Fin damage is operational welfare indicator and future research should identify and explore the impact of the factors affecting fin damage and propose management practices that can minimize the level of fin damage.

40|$|Replacing {{aquaculture}} feeds {{based on}} fisheries-derived resources with plant-based diets {{could be a}} relevant strategy to improve the sustainability of aquaculture. Recent studies on sea bass {{have shown that the}} total and early replacement of marine products by plant products would have a moderate effect on fish growth and body lipid content. Whether a plant-based diet impacts behavioural and physiological traits possibly linked to fish welfare, is not known, however. Here, we studied the effect of a totally plant-based diet introduced at an early stage of sea bass development on self-feeding behaviour, learning ability in a T-maze and stress biomarkers. We first compared learning processes in self-feeding conditions, between naive fish fed a plant-based diet (PBF) and fish fed a classic marine diet (MF). Then, we tested fish individually in a T-maze to compare the two feed groups for swimming activity, exploration and the ability to learn to discriminate between two two-dimensional objects associated with a reward. Blood physiological variables, including stress indicators (cortisol and glucose concentrations), were also determined. We did not find any indications of differences in self-feeding behaviour between PBF and MF in the first 30 days. A second experiment showed similar swimming activities in both <b>fish</b> <b>categories.</b> The “no-choice” percentage was high in both <b>fish</b> <b>categories</b> (~ 60 %), but all the fish moved preferentially toward the reward. Their first turns indicated an ability to discriminate between two two-dimensional objects to complete a simple task. However, the high percentage of “no-choice” responses in both <b>fish</b> <b>categories</b> could have rendered the results non significant. The T-maze test procedure induced the production of high concentrations of cortisol, indicating acute stress in fish of both groups during testing. Plasma cortisol concentration was higher in MF than PBF, suggesting that the plant-based diet may affect the short-term release of cortisol. This study provides the first insight into the impact of a plant-based diet on sea bass behavioural traits, and confirms the effect of this diet on cortisol release in response to stress. Overall, in this first experiment, we did not find any major impact of a plant-based diet on sea bass behavioural traits, which is an interesting point for the development potential of such a sustainable aquaculture strategy...|$|R

In this study dietary Hg intake of people at Mugusu gold mining village was determined by us-ing a total diet study approach. Results indicate that 37 types of foods are consumed in this Village. Rice, maize, tubers and fish were the most consumed food categories with an average daily consumption of 134, 270, 113 and 97 g per person per day, respectively. The <b>fish</b> <b>category</b> contained the highest average content of total Hg (0. 16 g g- 1 wet weight).

Community-based coral reef monitoring (CB-CRM), which uses simplified procedures suitable for local conditions, was introduced in Tanzania in 1996. Despite its widespread use, the method has not been calibrated and the validity of merging CB-CRM results with those gained using other techniques has not been determined. In this study, CB-CRM protocols adopted by the Tanga Coastal Zone Conservation and Development Programme (TCZCDP) were tested against SCUBA-based coral reef monitoring (SB-CRM) as practiced by the Institute of Marine Sciences, University of Dar es Salaam. Calibration showed {{no significant differences in}} measuring percent cover of live hard corals, sponges, dead corals and substrata (non-biotic cover). However, CB-CRM monitors recorded higher soft coral and lower fleshy algal cover. Larger differences were observed in deeper (> 6 m) transects. Counts of sea cucumbers, clams, gastropods and bivalves categories were not significantly different.
