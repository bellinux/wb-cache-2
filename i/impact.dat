40|$|In {{the current}} {{economic}} environment, identifying the <b>impacts</b> of government funded projects is important. Fiscal constraints and efficiency savings have put a strain on many government policies and programs and associated organisations, leading to greater focus on the demonstration of <b>impacts</b> by the recipients of funds. Effective communication of <b>impacts</b> is essential. Those programs that are {{unable to do so}} are placed at a significant disadvantage when competing for funding. The diverse nature of <b>impacts</b> The <b>impacts</b> of an organisation, policy or program, are likely to be diverse, wide reaching and affect different parts of the community and the economy. They may be a result of original objectives, or occur as spill over from other work being undertaken. <b>Impacts</b> can be economic, environmental or social. A focus on economic <b>impacts</b> Many studies focus on assessing the economic <b>impacts</b> of an organisation, policy or program. Economic <b>impacts</b> may include changes to Gross Domestic Product, employment or investment output. Techniques utilised to estimate these <b>impacts,</b> include: computable general equilibrium modelling cost benefit analysis financial modelling  multi-criteria decision analysis. Traditionally, the majority of organisations, policies and programs have focused on achieving economic <b>impacts,</b> however this has begun to shift. Increasingly the role of Government and the focus of organisations has begun to consider social and environmental outcomes, as well as economic outcomes. The importance of considering a full range of <b>impacts</b> Measuring and communicating social and environmental <b>impacts,</b> as well as economic <b>impacts,</b> is vital. For example, the Allen Consulting Group recently undertook a study of the economic, social and environmental <b>impacts</b> of the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Program. In addition to assessing the economic <b>impacts,</b> the study identified the breadth and scope of environmental and social <b>impacts</b> the CRC Program has produced. <b>Impacts</b> identified included: reduced greenhouse gas emissions protection of endangered species improved health and well-being improved safety increased business diversity. The quantity and extent of environmental and social <b>impacts</b> demonstrated that purely focusing on economic <b>impacts</b> would have underestimated the true value of the CRC Program to Australia. Measuring environmental and social <b>impacts</b> The concentration on the economic <b>impacts</b> of an organisation, policy or program, makes theoretical sense. Most economic <b>impacts</b> can be readily measured, valued and communicated {{in a way that is}} understood by key stakeholders for example through expression as a dollar figure. While some environmental and social <b>impacts</b> can be valued in dollar terms, not all of these <b>impacts</b> naturally lend themselves to this type of quantification. Assigning values to such <b>impacts</b> is highly sensitive with, in many industries, very little supporting data and information. The approaches used to measure and value social and environmental <b>impacts</b> are not as well recognised as economic approaches, particularly for social <b>impacts.</b> Environmental economists have developed a number of techniques to value the environment, including methods such as the market price, travel cost, benefit transfer and the hedonic pricing approach. The importance of communicating <b>impacts</b> Although the commodification of <b>impacts</b> may seem unsuitable, it is the direction public policy is taking. The impetus falls on the organisation, policy or program to ensure that <b>impacts</b> are articulated in language understood by funding bodies. This approach is consistent with principles of accountability, performance monitoring and efficiency. For many programs, policies and organisations with large economic <b>impacts,</b> a focus on these <b>impacts</b> provides suffiecient evidence that they are performing well, however this may understate the benefits to the wider community. With continued fiscal pressures, the ability to identify and express diverse <b>impacts</b> will remain at the forefront of demonstrating success and benefit to the community. Those organisations best able to gather, measure, value and articulate their <b>impacts</b> are at an advantage when talking to funding bodies and policy makers. Organisations must consider what their <b>impacts</b> are and how these can be measured and communicated...|$|R

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an <b>impact,</b> {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of <b>impact</b> and acceleration is probably to blame.
