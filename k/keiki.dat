25|$|With {{the favor}} of the Tokugawa the temple prospered but, {{at least in the}} first years since foundation, it was just the Tokugawa family temple, while the sole funeral temple of the Tokugawa was still Zōjō-ji, where the second shogun Hidetada rests. His {{successor}} Iemitsu sent his remains to Nikko because the Nikkō Tōshō-gū, mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu, founder of the dynasty, was there; he however also built a mausoleum at Kan'ei'ji. After that, the fourth shogun Tokugawa Ietsuna and the fifth Tokugawa Tsunayoshi were put to rest in Ueno, and Kan'ei-ji became a Tokugawa funeral temple like Zōjō-ji. Zōjō-ji didn't like the change but, after the next shogun Tokugawa Ienobu's mausoleum was built on its land, the custom became to alternate the temples at each generation, and that lasted until the closing of the shogunate era. Excepted Ieyasu and Iemitsu (buried in Nikko) and last shogun Yoshinobu (also known as <b>Keiki,</b> buried in nearby Yanaka Cemetery), all of the Tokugawa shoguns are buried either at Zōjō-ji or Kan'ei-ji, six at one and six at the other. In {{what used to be the}} Kan'ei-ji cemetery near the Tokyo National Museum are interred Tokugawa Ietsuna, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, Tokugawa Yoshimune, Tokugawa Ieharu, Tokugawa Ienari, Tokugawa Iesada and Iesada's wife Tenshoin. Ietsuna's and Tsunayoshi's mausoleums were destroyed in 1945. The cemetery is closed to the public, but can be seen from the street.|$|E

500|$|Some leading partisans of {{the former}} Shogun were imprisoned, but {{narrowly}} escaped execution. This clemency derives from the insistence of Saigō Takamori and Iwakura Tomomi, although much weight {{was placed on the}} advice of Parkes, the British envoy. He had urged Saigō, in the words of Ernest Satow, [...] "that severity towards <b>Keiki</b> [...] or his supporters, especially in the way of personal punishment, would injure the reputation of the new government in the opinion of European Powers." [...] After two or three years of imprisonment, most of them were called to serve the new government, and several pursued brilliant careers. Enomoto Takeaki, for instance, would later serve as an envoy to Russia and China and as the education minister.|$|E

50|$|These orchids grow quickly {{throughout}} summer, {{but take}} a rest during winter. Dormant buds erupt into shoots {{from the base of}} the pseudobulb mainly in spring, and a few species in autumn. This is then followed by rapid growth of new roots. Reproduction is usually through seed, but a few species reproduce asexually through <b>keikis</b> produced along the stem, usually after flowering and sometimes as a result of injury to the growing tip.|$|R
50|$|On a Phalaenopsis, a <b>keiki</b> {{is a small}} plant {{growing from}} one node along the flower stem. <b>Keiki</b> growth may be induced by {{prolonged}} exposure to high temperatures during {{the final phase of}} spike growth.|$|E
50|$|On a Dendrobium, the <b>keiki</b> is {{typically}} found sprouting {{along the length}} of the cane or from the end of the cane. This is induced by the accumulation of growth hormones at that point, either naturally, or by the application of <b>keiki</b> paste.|$|E

50|$|Commonly P. hieroglyphica {{blooms in}} spring, with {{three to four}} star-shaped flowers that open {{simultaneously}} and last two to three months; a well-established specimen with <b>keikis</b> can produce more than 50 flowers. Their fragrance {{is said to be}} faintly rose-like or strongly citrus-like. The background of the flower can be white to ochre, sometimes with a tinge of green at the tips, and the glyphs on the sepals and stamens can be cinnamon or a purple hue. The flowers are comparatively larger and the glyphs more pronounced than those of P. lueddemanniana. The characteristic glyphs are retained in P. hieroglyphica hybrids.|$|R
5000|$|These are epiphytic or lithophytic orchids {{with leaves}} {{arranged}} disticiously and not originating from a pseudobulb. The axillary, racemose inflorescence is pendant to arching {{with a few}} to many, successive opening flowers with free petals and sepals. The colour of the flowers is variable and goes from pure white (S. falcatus) to white and red (S. fitzgeraldii). The trilobed, fleshy labellum is saccate ( [...] = pouch-like) and articulate to {{the apex of the}} column foot. The large side lobes are erect and curved. The small midlobe is attached to a short spur. Some of these species can form <b>keikis,</b> forming large clumps with age.|$|R
5000|$|This {{sympodial}} reed-stemmed Epidendrum {{displays a}} pseudomonopodial habit: an individual stem (to 4 mm in diameter) will grow continuously {{at the tip}} for some time, before producing a bloom spike. Nevertheless, the flowers come {{from the top of}} the stem (halting its upward growth), and new stems start from buds at the base of the old stems, thus making the plant sympodial, like the rest of the subtribe Laeliinae. Less than ideal lighting will encourage the formation of numerous <b>keikis</b> producing a tangled mass of shoots and roots high up the plant. However, full sunlight will cause most growths to start near the base of old growths, leading to a shorter and [...] "tidier" [...] plant.|$|R

40|$|Part of {{the history}} of Japan {{including}} the Azuchi-Momoyama and Edo periods is known as the ‘early modern period’. This period includes the approximately 300 years from 1568 (11 th year of the Eiroku period) when Kyoto’s Nobunaga Oda proceed to the capital until Tokugawa <b>Keiki’s</b> restoration of imperial rule in 1867 (3 rd year of the Keio period). During this period a strict social system was formed and the order of Confucian consciousness was maintained. The ruling elite studied Confucianism thought and in order to control the populace attempted to introduce this through moral ideology. The early modern period education was aimed at fostering a common shared view. However, a look opinions. The different periods, the ruling elite reveals a multiplicity of views. This paper looks at how learning is not only limited to Confucianism and the national learning but also incorporates aspects such as cultural, social, and educational from the Edo period.

50|$|Ii's {{decision}} made him very unpopular with Imperial loyalists, {{especially with the}} Mito samurai. Towards the end of 1858 the reformists went to the emperor with the hopes of restraining Ii. In response to the attempt by Tokugawa Nariaki and his supporters to denounce him in the emperor's court Ii had a shogunal decree passed which allowed him to conduct the Ansei Purge. During the rest of 1858 and into 1859 Naosuke purged over 100 officials from the bakufu, the imperial court and the lands of various daimyōs. Eight of the officials who were purged were executed; the remainder were forced into retirement. During the Ansei purge Ii Naosuke was able to force Hitotsubashi <b>Keiki's</b> supporters to retire and place Hitotsubashi and his family under house arrest. Ii Naosuke was also able to remove officials who had expressed unhappiness with {{his handling of the}} Harris treaty and the shogunal succession from public life.|$|R
5000|$|Angraecum Veitchii: a very {{rewarding}} orchid. In indirect light and watered/fed regularly this plant will produce blooms annually (usually in Late Winter to Spring - for Australia this occurs in August). The flowers last a while if {{kept in a}} sheltered position and their strong heady fragrance is delightful. They only release their perfume at night. Flowers are large (4 - 9 cm across), waxy, white to greenish cream in colour and borne on stems of seven to ten depending on the faithfulness of your fertilising, watering, and indirect light provision. The leaves are large, thick straps that alternately fan out from a central (monopodal) stem. Pups (<b>keikis)</b> form {{at the base of}} the stem and can either be divided from the parent plant once they have at least three roots of their own or alternatively, left on the plant these will make a stunning specimen as when mature will produce blooms with the parent plant - many award winning angraecum veitchiis are grown as such. In the right conditions these orchids are healthy and require little attention. As they are epiphytes the potting mixture should be loose and free draining. Prolific roots are formed from the base and also amongst the lower half of the foliage. These can be troublesome when moving the plant. Once your angraecum is big it is best to pot it in a heavy terracotta pot or place a brick in the bottom of the pot in order to ensure the plant does not get top heavy and risk snapping when blown over in the wind, especially since they flower during the windier times of the year. When watering a good soaking with a hose or watering-can is best (not just a misting from a spray gun) as this helps to flush away any salts from fertilisers that may be present in the potting mixture and also thoroughly wets the plant. Make sure the roots halfway up the stem get a soaking too, not just the potted roots.|$|R
