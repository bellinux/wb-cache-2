25|$|The genetic {{abnormalities}} underpinning {{the combination}} of DBA with Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS)/mandibulofacial <b>dysostosis</b> (MFD) phenotypes are heterogeneous, including RPS26 (the known DBA10 gene), TSR2 which encodes a direct binding partner of RPS26, and RPS28.|$|E
25|$|A limb anomaly {{is called}} a dysmelia. These include all forms of limbs anomalies, such as amelia, ectrodactyly, phocomelia, polymelia, polydactyly, syndactyly, polysyndactyly, oligodactyly, brachydactyly, achondroplasia, {{congenital}} aplasia or hypoplasia, amniotic band syndrome, and cleidocranial <b>dysostosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also, defects {{disturbing}} other glycosylation pathways {{than the}} N-linked one {{are included in}} this classification. Examples are the α-dystroglycanopathies (e.g. POMT1/POMT2-CDG (Walker-Warburg syndrome and Muscle-Eye-Brain syndrome)) with deficiencies in O-mannosylation of proteins; O-xylosylglycan synthesis defects (EXT1/EXT2-CDG (hereditary multiple exostoses) and B4GALT7-CDG (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, progeroid variant)); O-fucosylglycan synthesis (B3GALTL-CDG (Peter’s plus syndrome) and LFNG-CDG (spondylocostal <b>dysostosis</b> III)).|$|E
25|$|Patients {{suffer from}} dwarfism, short lower arms, small feet, and small hands. Fingers and toes {{may also be}} {{abnormally}} short and laterally or medially bent. The thumb may be displaced and some patients, notably in Turkey, experience ectrodactyly. All patients often suffer from vertebral segmentation abnormalities. Those with the dominant variant have, at most, a single butterfly vertebra. Those with the recessive form, however, may suffer from hemivertebrae, vertebral fusion, and rib anomalies. Some cases resemble Jarcho-Levin syndrome or spondylocostal <b>dysostosis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Some {{systemic}} disorders {{which may}} result in hyperdontia include Apert syndrome, cleidocranial <b>dysostosis,</b> Crouzon syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Gardner's syndrome, and Sturge–Weber syndrome. [...] Some systemic disorders which {{may result in}} hypodontia include Crouzon syndrome, Ectodermal dysplasia, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|The {{syndrome}} {{is also known}} as Robinow-Silverman-Smith syndrome, Robinow dwarfism, fetal face, fetal face syndrome, fetal facies syndrome, acral <b>dysostosis</b> with facial and genital abnormalities, or mesomelic dwarfism-small genitalia syndrome. [...] The recessive form was previously known as Covesdem syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis includes Treacher Collins syndrome, Nager acrofacial <b>dysostosis</b> (preaxial cranial <b>dysostosis).</b> Other types of axial cranial <b>dysostosis</b> included the Kelly, Reynolds, Arens (Tel Aviv), Rodríguez (Madrid), Richieri-Costa and Patterson-Stevenson-Fontaine forms.|$|E
5000|$|A defect {{associated}} with Lfng mutations is spondylocostal <b>dysostosis.</b> Spondylocostal <b>dysostosis</b> {{is characterized by}} segmentation problems in the developing vertebrae resulting in fusion or lack of vertebrae along with abnormalities in the ribs. [...] Clinically, spondylocostal <b>dysostosis</b> presents as a shortened neck and trunk relative total height and a mild form of scoliosis. Respiratory problems are also common in spondylocostal <b>dysostosis</b> because of the shortened trunk.|$|E

50|$|The {{syndrome}} {{is named after}} Edward Treacher Collins (1862-1932), the English surgeon and ophthalmologist who described its essential traits in 1900. In 1949, Adolphe Franceschetti and David Klein described the same condition on their own observations as mandibulofacial <b>dysostosis.</b> The term mandibulofacial <b>dysostosis</b> is {{used to describe the}} clinical features.|$|E

50|$|It {{is thought}} that acromelic frontonasal <b>dysostosis</b> occurs due to an {{abnormality}} in the Sonic Hedgehog (SSH) signaling pathway. This pathway {{plays an important role}} in developing the midline central nervous system/craniofrontofacial region and the limbs. Hence, it is plausible that an error in the SSH pathway causes acromelic frontonasal <b>dysostosis,</b> because this syndrome not only shows abnormalities in the midfacial region, but also in the limbs and CNS.|$|E

50|$|Synostosis (plural: synostoses) is {{fusion of}} two bones. It can be normal in puberty, fusion of the epiphysis, or abnormal. When {{synostosis}} is abnormal it {{is a type}} of <b>dysostosis.</b>|$|E
