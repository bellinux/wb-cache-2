40|$|Abstract: The 3 -D {{numerical}} model of bifurcation embedded in <b>anchor</b> <b>block</b> concrete of a diversion type power station is built. And FEM is adopted {{to analyze the}} pipe stresses and displacement. The influence of initial gap along the penstock outside, concrete’s crack status of <b>anchor</b> <b>block</b> and deformation modulus of the bed rock is discussed. Some conclusions can be achieved as follows. Safe factor is enough when the exposed-penstock design scheme is adopted. But enough rebar is required to guarantee the integrity of <b>anchor</b> <b>block.</b> The initial gap, concrete’s crack and the deformation modulus of bed rock has marked influence on the stresses of penstock. According to the design criteria of reinforced concrete penstocks, combined bearing ability of bifurcation steel and <b>anchor</b> <b>block</b> concrete is advised to reduce the thickness of penstock. As a result, the difficulty of construction is reduced and the investment is more economized than before...|$|R

50|$|The Dodhara Chandani Bridge is a {{sequence}} of four suspension bridges with eight pylons, which are anchored to large <b>anchor</b> <b>blocks</b> on both banks as well as three common <b>anchor</b> <b>blocks</b> in the river bed. The lands between the 32.72 m pylons have a wingspan of 225.40 m, the webs between the anchors and the pylons have a wingspan of almost 70 meters. The bridge segments are curved slightly upwards. The result {{is a series of}} arches of spans of 70 + 225.40 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 225.40 + 225.40 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 225.40 with a total length of 1452.96 m plus of approximately 20 m long <b>anchor</b> <b>blocks</b> on the banks.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the transient rocking response of <b>anchored</b> <b>blocks</b> subjected to physically realizable horizontal pulse-type motion. Restrainers with elastic-brittle and elastic-plastic behavior are considered. Under one-sine pulse <b>anchored</b> <b>blocks</b> can overturn with two distinct modes of overturning: (1) by exhibiting one impact; and (1) without exhibiting any impact. It is found that restrainers are more efficient in preventing overturning of small slender blocks subjected to low frequency pulses. The study uncovers that while {{for most of}} the frequency range <b>anchored</b> <b>blocks</b> survive higher accelerations than free-standing blocks, there is a finite frequency range where the opposite happens. The paper examines this counterintuitive behavior and explains the destructive effect that increased strength and increased ductility of restrainers have on the rocking stability of rigid structures when excited by certain ground motions. KEY WORDS: rocking, anchored, pulse-type motions, ductility...|$|R
50|$|The bridge spans 54.9 metres (180 feet) between stone piers {{and cast}} iron towers.

40|$|Anchored Earth System {{had been}} {{developed}} from combination of the techniques used in reinforced earth and soil anchoring. Instead of using steel strip as a reinforcement, Anchored Earth System consist of round steel bar (tendon) with precast concrete block attached at the free end {{of each of the}} reinforcing steel bars, and it is backfilled with granular material or suitable earth fill. This research project can be considered a case study of anchored reinforced soil wall which investigates the performance of Anchored Earth System due to its pullout capacity. In this study, pullout resistance which contributed by friction between the backfill material and the shaft surface of reinforcing tendon, and the passive earth pressure against the concrete <b>anchor</b> <b>block,</b> can be evaluated through pullout tests. The main problems to be studied in this project are the results obtained from field pullout test are different from the calculated theoretical values and there is a non-zero intercept at relationship of pullout force against overburden pressure. The field pullout tests were carried out in three conditions: i) with reinforcing tendon only; ii) with <b>anchor</b> <b>block</b> only; and iii) with both reinforcing tendon and <b>anchor</b> <b>block</b> together {{in order to determine the}} sharing of resistance in the system. The pullout test was also done under soaked condition. The average interaction coefficient a’ = 1. 99 and bearing factor ß = 6. 32 were determined by back analysis. It was found that the sharing of load between the tendon and the <b>anchor</b> <b>block</b> in <b>anchored</b> earth system is not equal, but most of the resistance is contributed by the bearing passive of <b>anchor</b> <b>block</b> where approximately 30 % of resistance contributed by residual frictional resistance and 70 % contributed by peak bearing passive resistance. The pullout resistance in soaked condition observed to be lower than in unsoaked condition due to the increase in pore water pressure that reduced the shear resistance...|$|R
40|$|Anchor text plays {{a special}} {{important}} role in improving the performance of general Web search. The importance of anchor text {{comes from the fact}} that it is fairly objective description for a Web page by potentially a large amount of other Web pages. Vertical search provides indexing and search functionality for objects in a certain domain, and is becoming an important supplement for general Web search. It is desired to utilize anchor text in vertical search as well to improve search performance. Vertical objects typically lack explicit URLs to accurately identify them. The anchor-text of a vertical object is also hard to acquire explicitly. This paper proposes concepts of pseudo-URL and pseudo-anchor-text for vertical objects, corresponding to the URL and anchor-text of a general Web page. For extracting and utilizing pseudo-anchor-text information of vertical objects, we focus on candidate <b>anchor</b> <b>block</b> accumulation and pseudo-anchor extraction in this paper. State-of-the-art data integration techniques are utilized to accumulate candidate <b>anchor</b> <b>blocks</b> belonging to same objects. Pseudo-anchor text for each object is extracted from its candidate <b>anchor</b> <b>blocks</b> using a machine learning based approach. A case study in academic search domain indicates that our approach is able to dramatically improve search performance...|$|R

2500|$|After the war, the Tuckerton Wireless Station was {{included}} in German war reparations paid to America. Shortly afterwards, it was sold to RCA which operated it until 1948 as a backup to their famous Radio Central facility in Rocky Point, New York.

40|$|In this paper, a single-slope tunnel {{pipeline}} was analysed {{considering the}} effects of vertical earth pressure, horizontal soil pressure, inner pressure, thermal expansion force and pipeline-soil friction. The concept of stagnation point for the pipeline was proposed. Considering the deformation compatibility condition of the pipeline elbow, the push force of <b>anchor</b> <b>blocks</b> of a single-slope tunnel pipeline was derived based on an energy method. Then, the theoretical formula for this force is thus generated. Using the analytical equation, the push force of the <b>anchor</b> <b>block</b> of an X 80 large-diameter pipeline from the West-East Gas Transmission Project was determined. Meanwhile, to verify {{the results of the}} analytical method, and the finite element method, four categories of finite element codes were introduced to calculate the push force, including CAESARII, ANSYS, AutoPIPE and ALGOR. The results show that the analytical results agree well with the numerical results, and the maximum relative error is only 4. 1 %. Therefore, the results obtained with the analytical method can satisfy engineering requirements...|$|R

40|$|The seismic {{behaviour}} of many {{art objects}} and obelisks can be analysed {{in the context}} of the seismic response of rigid blocks. Starting from the pioneering works by Housner (1963), a large number of analytical studies of the rigid block dynamics were proposed. In fact, despite its apparent simplicity, the motion of a rigid block involves a number of complex dynamic phenomena such as impacts, sliding, uplift and geometric nonlinearities. Methods that prevent the possible overturning were also presented in the past years, especially to protect statues and art objects with respect to seismic events. In the more general context of control, to date a current strategy is represented by base isolation. In this paper a novel adaptive control strategy for protecting monolithic art objects was investigated. The control under study follows a feedback-feedforward scheme that is realised by adjusting the stiffness of anchorages with adaptive stiffness located at the two corners of the block. A numerical comparison was made between the behaviour of the unanchored <b>block,</b> the <b>anchored</b> <b>block</b> with a system having constant stiffness and the <b>anchored</b> <b>block</b> with adaptive stiffness. Finally, numerical investigations were carried out in order to verify the expected efficiency of the proposed control system, and to validate simple control laws...|$|R
