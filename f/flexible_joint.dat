5|$|Herrerasaurus had a <b>flexible</b> <b>joint</b> in {{the lower}} jaw that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a {{grasping}} bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae.

5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more <b>flexible</b> <b>joint,</b> allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

Therefore, {{it is difficult}} to achieve good control performance on robots with <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> by the conventional control schemes.

40|$|A model {{simulating}} the hysteretic M-θ behaviour of <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> under cyclic {{and dynamic}} loading conditions is presented. This model requires four parameters to describe. These parameters can be evaluated using existing test data for {{different types of}} connections. The proposed model has been cast into a two-node zero length connection element and used to model the nonlinear response of flexibly jointed frames. It is shown {{that the presence of}} <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> alters the vibration characteristics of the structure. Depending on the excitation frequency, the presence of <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> can either dampen or magnify the structural response...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} on assessing {{the effectiveness of}} <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> in mitigating the consequences of faulting on buried steel pipelines through a comprehensive analysis that incorporates the uncertainty of fault displacement magnitude and {{the response of the}} pipeline itself. The proposed methodology is a two-step process. In the first step the probabilistic nature of the fault displacement magnitude is evaluated by applying the Probabilistic Fault Displacement Hazard Analysis, considering also all pertinent uncertainties. The second step is the “transition ” from seismological data to the pipeline structural response through the fault displacement components as the adopted vector intensity measure. To mitigate the consequences of faulting on pipelines, <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> between pipeline parts are proposed as innovative measure for reducing the deformation of pipeline walls. Thus, the mechanical behavior of continuous pipelines and pipelines with <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> is numerically assessed and strains are extracted in order to develop the corresponding strain hazard curves. The latter are a useful engineering tool for pipeline – fault crossing risk assessment and for the effectiveness evaluation of <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> as innovative mitigating measures against the consequences of faulting on pipelines...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{flexibility}} in robot manipulators {{is due to}} compliance at the joints and/or distributed deflection of the links. Dynamic models of the two classes of robots with <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> or <b>flexible</b> links are presented, together with control laws addressing the motion tasks of regulation to constant equilibrium states and of asymptotic tracking of output trajectories. Control design for robots with <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> {{takes advantage of the}} passivity and feedback linearization properties. In robots with flexible links, basic differences arise when controlling the motion at the joint level or at the tip level...|$|R

5000|$|The {{origins of}} this form of {{universal}} joint are from early vehicles that used a disk of thick leather as a similar <b>flexible</b> <b>joint.</b> These were used into the 1920s.

40|$|Abstract: This paper puts {{forward a}} new method in {{designing}} the robotic hand. The innovation of the design {{is to use the}} cross-axis flexural pivots as the joints of the finger. The paper first discusses the advantages of <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> compared to other joints in the design process of robotic hand. The normal <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> used in the robotic fingers are presented. After a brief discussion, a new approach which applies cross-axis flexural pivots in the robotic finger is raised. The pseudo-rigid-body model is established for the new design of robotic finger. Manipulator kinematics is also conducted in this paper...|$|R

50|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>joints.</b> {{introduced}} in the 1950s are required to be leak-free. Further, VCP's resistance {{to a wide variety}} of acids besides hydrofluoric acid make it a long lasting choice for use in underground sewers.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} loss of the <b>flexible</b> <b>joint</b> {{at the rear of the}} palate, this {{primitive}} pattern is broadly retained in reptiles, albeit with some individual modifications. In birds, the epipterygoids are absent and the pterygoids considerably reduced. Living amphibians have a relatively simplified skull in this region; a broad parasphenoid forms the floor of the braincase, the pterygoids are relatively small, and all other related bones except the sphenethmoid are absent.|$|E
50|$|Current {{trends in}} secure communications, light and {{flexible}} enough for SR patrols to carry, {{are based on}} the evolving concept of software defined radio. The immensely <b>flexible</b> <b>Joint</b> Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is deployed with NATO special operations units, and can provide low-probability-of-intercept encrypted communications between ground units, from ground to aircraft, or from ground to satellite. It lets a SR team use the same radio to operate on several networks, also allowing a reduced number of spare radios. Some of the raiders on the Son Tay raid carried as many as five radios.|$|E
5000|$|Mansart's design, of 1685, {{articulated}} the square's unified façades {{according to a}} formula utilised in some Parisian hôtels particuliers, (palatial private homes). Mansart chose colossal pilasters linking two floors, standing on a high arcaded base with rustication of the pilasters; the façades were capped with sloping slate [...] "mansard roofs", punctuated by dormer windows. However, because the building work was incomplete {{at the time of}} the unveiling of the monument, the envisioned façades were painted on canvas. By 1692, the Place des Victoires was pierced by six streets, and the circular plan functioned as a <b>flexible</b> <b>joint</b> to harmonize their various axes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>joints</b> {{have been}} used to achieve thrust vector control over a wide range of sizes of nozzles and have been {{demonstrated}} successfully in bench tests and static firings, and are operational on two motors. From these many joints the problems of <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> have been defined as establishment of the movable nozzle envelope, definition of the actuation power requirements, definition of the mechanical properties of joint materials, adhesive bonding, test methods, and quality control. These data and problem solutions are contained in a large number of reports. Data relating to joint configuration, design requirements, materials selection, joint design, structural analysis, manufacture, and testing are summarized...|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} that the <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> showed large variation {{in the frequency of}} signal with increased vehicular speed due to excessive excitation. Thus, the poorly constructed portion of the bridge would behave differently at different vehicular speeds, reflecting nonhomogeneity along the bridge span.|$|R
50|$|The P2 Pelamis {{design was}} Pelamis Wave Power's second {{generation}} Pelamis machine. The Pelamis P2 is 180m long, 4m diameter and approximately 1350 tonnes in weight.

50|$|The talus {{apparently}} {{derives from}} the fusion of three separate bones in the feet of primitive amphibians; the tibiale, articulating with tibia, the intermedium, between the bases of the tibia and fibula, and the fourth centrale, lying in the mid-part of the tarsus. These bones are still partially separate in modern amphibians, which therefore {{do not have a}} true talus. The talus forms a considerably more <b>flexible</b> <b>joint</b> in mammals than it does in reptiles. This reaches its greatest extent in artiodactyls, where the distal surface of the bone has a smooth keel to allow greater freedom of movement of the foot, and thus increase running speed.|$|E
50|$|The P80 is {{the first}} stage of VEGA, its name is derived from the design phase {{propellant}} weight of 80 tons that was later increased to 88 tons. The P80 includes a thrust vector control (TVC) system (developed and made in Belgium by SABCA) consisting of two electromechanical actuators that operate a movable nozzle with <b>flexible</b> <b>joint</b> using lithium ion batteries. The 3 m diameter case is composed of graphite epoxy filament wound case and low density rubber is used for the internal insulation. The nozzle is made of light low-cost carbon phenolic material; a consumable casing is used for the igniter. The solid propellant loaded has low binder content and high aluminium percentage (HTPB 1912).|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} lobe-finned fishes and tetrapods, the pterygoid bones were flat, wing-like bones forming the {{major part of}} the roof of the mouth. Above the pterygoids were the epipterygoid bones, which formed part of a <b>flexible</b> <b>joint</b> between the braincase and the palatal region, as well as {{extending}} a vertical bar of bone towards the roof of the skull. Between the pterygoids lay an elongated, narrow parasphenoid bone, which also spread over some of the lower surface of the braincase, and connected, at its forward end, with a sphenethmoid bone helping to protect the olfactory nerves. Finally, the basisphenoid bone formed part of the floor of the braincase and lay immediately above the parasphenoid.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the landing motion of an {{articulated}} legged robot. Humans use a peculiar crouching motion to land safely which can be characterized by body stiffness and damping. A stiffness controller formulation is used to realize this human behavior for the robot. Using this method, the landing motion is achieved with only the desired body stiffness and damping values, without desired COG(Center of Gravity) or joint paths. To achieve soft landing, variable body stiffness and damping values were optimized. PBOT, which has four links with <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> was used for validation of the landing controller. A body stiffness and damping controller {{was used as an}} outer landing control loop and a fast subsystem controller for <b>flexible</b> <b>joints</b> was used as an inner force control loop. Simulations and experimental results about the landing motion are presented to show the performance of the body stiffness and damping controller...|$|R
50|$|At first slow whales {{were caught}} by men hurling {{harpoons}} from small open boats. Early harpoon guns were unsuccessful until Norwegian Svend Foyn invented a new, improved version in 1863 that used a harpoon with a <b>flexible</b> <b>joint</b> between {{the head and}} shaft. Norway invented many new techniques and disseminated them worldwide. Cannon-fired harpoons, strong cables, and steam winches were mounted on maneuverable, steam-powered catcher boats. They made possible the targeting of large and fast-swimming whale species that were taken to shore-based stations for processing. Breech-loading cannons were introduced in 1925; pistons were introduced in 1947 to reduce recoil. These highly efficient devices were too successful, for they reduced whale populations {{to the point where}} large-scale commercial whaling became unsustainable.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sway bar}} {{is usually a}} torsion spring that resists body roll motions. It is usually {{constructed}} out of a cylindrical steel bar, formed into a [...] "U" [...] shape, that connects to the body at two points, and at {{the left and right}} sides of the suspension. If the left and right wheels move together, the bar rotates about its mounting points. If the wheels move relative to each other, the bar is subjected to torsion and forced to twist. Each end of the bar is connected to an end link through a <b>flexible</b> <b>joint.</b> The sway bar end link connects in turn to a spot near a wheel or axle, transferring forces from a heavily-loaded axle to the opposite side.|$|E
50|$|Leptictidium is {{a special}} animal {{because of the way}} its anatomy {{combines}} quite primitive elements with elements which prove a high degree of specialization. It had small fore legs and large hind legs, especially at the distal side (that further from the body). The lateral phalanges of its forelegs (fingers I and V) were very short and weak, finger III was longer and fingers II and IV were roughly equal in size, and slightly shorter than finger III. The tips of the phalanges were elongated and tapered.The ankles and the sacroiliac joint were quite loosely fixed, while the pelvis had a <b>flexible</b> <b>joint</b> with only one coccygeal vertebra.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a dynamic modelling technique for a manipulator with multiple flexible links and <b>flexible</b> <b>joints,</b> {{based on a}} combined Euler–Lagrange formulation and assumed modes method. The resulting generalised model is validated through computer simulations by considering a simplified case study of a two-link <b>flexible</b> manipulator with <b>joint</b> elasticity. Controlling such a manipulator {{is more complex than}} controlling one with rigid joints because only a single actuation signal can be applied at each joint and this has to control the flexure of both the joint itself and the link attached to it. To resolve the control complexities associated with such an under-actuated <b>flexible</b> link/flexible <b>joint</b> manipulator, a singularly perturbed model has been formulated and used to design a reduced-order controller. This is shown to stabilise the link and joint vibrations effectively while maintaining good tracking performance...|$|R
