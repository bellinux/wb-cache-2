50|$|The {{most common}} use of shock collars is pet {{containment}} {{systems that are}} used to keep a dog inside the perimeter of the residence without the construction of a physical barrier. This use of shock collars is increasingly popular in areas where local laws or homeowners' associations prohibit the construction of a physical fence. Available systems include: in-ground installation to preserve the aesthetics of the yard; above <b>ground</b> <b>installation</b> to reinforce an existing barrier that was not sufficient in containing the dog; and wireless systems to allow for indoor use. Most pet containment systems work by installing a wire {{around the perimeter of the}} yard. The wire carries no current (as opposed to electric fences which do carry a current at high voltage that may be lethal in the event of unauthorized or defective installation or equipment) but forms a closed loop with a circuit box that transmits a radio signal to the receiver collar worn by the dog. As the dog approaches the perimeter the collar will activate.|$|E

40|$|As an {{intermediate}} solution between Glaser's satellite solar power (SSP) and ground-based photovoltaic (PV) panels, this paper examines {{the collection of}} solar energy using a high-altitude aerostatic platform. A procedure to calculate the irradiance in the medium/high troposphere, based on experimental data, is described. The results show that here a PV system could collect about four to six times the energy collected by a typical U. K. -based <b>ground</b> <b>installation,</b> and between one-third {{and half of the}} total energy the same system would collect if supported by a geostationary satellite (SSP).

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Tomahawk {{cruise missile}} is {{configured}} for launch from a submarine, surface ship, or <b>ground</b> <b>installation.</b> The boost-phase propulsion is supplied by a jettisonable, solid-fuel booster engine.

These configurations require telemetry and tracking systems to aid in flight performance evaluation and an RF link range safety command system to provide for safe conduct of the flight.

40|$|AbstractBifacial {{solar modules}} are {{becoming}} increasingly more attractive stimulated {{by the development of}} new solar cell structures enabling to capture solar insolation on both front and rear surfaces. The possibilities to be installed in the conventional south facing orientation or even vertically are further advantages. Although the potential of bifacial modules have been already shown in specific time intervals and for various ground albedos there is a lack in simulation studies up to now. In this study, we simulated the annual energy yield (AEY) of south facing bifacial modules using a rigorous calculation method of the ground reflected radiation reaching the rear module surface. The necessary tilt angle optimization is done incorporating the influence of module elevation and considering the inherent albedo coefficient. These simulations are able to reproduce measurement observations and show that at optimum tilt angles produced annual energy can be increased by 30 % compared to a standard module simply by positioning modules two meters above ground instead of a close to <b>ground</b> <b>installation.</b> Furthermore, a linear relationship between albedo coefficient and AEY is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} year, solar energy has {{acquired}} {{an important role}} in the production of energy, and today it represents a large quota of the energy demand, so as to represent, together with wind power, quite 100 % of it during some days of the year. The quick diffusion of this technology has emphasized the question about which kind of installation could be productive, efficient and environmental friendly. Buildings are a good site for installation, but in many cases historical restrictions or an insufficient area make this kind of plants not a good investment. <b>Ground</b> <b>installation</b> seems to be easier and has fewer problems to solve, except for the intended use that the chosen area could have. Lands that are suitable for cultivation should not be used for the installation of PV. This paper aims to propose the installation of PV plants on closing (or closed) landfills, as a solution for the area for the PV plant thus achieving a beneficial reuse of dismantled areas. Geographic Information System (GIS) has been used for the screening of areas at regional level and then the technical feasibility of a PV-plant has been evaluated in one among the more suitable landfills...|$|E
