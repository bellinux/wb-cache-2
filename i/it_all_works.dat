500|$|... "Bounce" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} as a digital extended play (EP)—which included a remix by DJ Green Lantern—on 27 May 2013 in selected {{countries such as}} France, while the release in several other countries were postponed to a later date. The delays prompted Azalea's fans to campaign an earlier release of the single; in a press release, Azalea explained: [...] "The problem with kids– and I {{was one of these}} people too– is that they think they work in the industry and know how <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>works.</b> They're like, 'put 'Bounce' out now or it's gonna flop!'. I'm like, 'I need to promote it first or it's gonna flop!'. It's coming out on July 8 and I need fans to trust their fave on this one because it's for the best. I need to hashtag that– #trustyourfaves." [...] The EP was later released on 5 July 2013 in Germany, 7 July 2013 in the United Kingdom, and 8 July 2013 in Italy and Spain.|$|E
500|$|... "Catholic Girls" [...] is {{critical}} of the Catholic Church, and satirizes [...] "the hypocrisy of {{the myth of the}} good Catholic girl." [...] While Zappa was in favor of the sexual revolution, he regarded himself as a pioneer in publicly discussing honesty about sexual intercourse, stating [...] "American sexual attitudes are controlled as a necessary tool of business and government in order to perpetuate themselves. Unless people begin to see through that, to see past it to, what sex is really all about, they're always going to have the same neurotic attitudes. It's very neatly packaged. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>works</b> hand-in-hand with the churches and political leaders at the point, where elections are coming up." [...] This view inspired the lyrical content of [...] "Crew Slut", in which Mary, Joe's girlfriend, falls into the groupie lifestyle, going on to participate in a wet T-shirt contest in the following track, [...] "Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt" ...|$|E
500|$|Josh Harrison of Ology {{deemed the}} episode a [...] "good sign" [...] {{that the second}} season will be [...] "just as good, if not better" [...] than the first season. He said, [...] "The way <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>works</b> {{together}} in this episode ... is subtle and surprising but nevertheless convincing evidence that there's method to the madness. Ugly Americans knows when to play this card; at all other junctures, it's got the right instinct when it shows us yet more madness." [...] Harrison praised the battle scene between the wizards and the demons, calling it [...] "one of the best single sequences in the series so far". In contrast, The Standard-Times critic Kevin McDonough was more critical regarding the episode, noting that it [...] "tries a tad too hard". McDonough commented: [...] "The efforts to meld 1980s summer-camp fantasy comedies with the Harry Potter movies are more odd than amusing. Then again, that pretty much sums up Ugly Americans itself." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the party}} and mini games, Kent {{asserted}} [...] "All of the activities... were designed with an unerring eye for quality", Edge contended [...] "none are half-assed throwaway rewards", and the staff of Nintendo Power remarked [...] "each one is a fully realized activity that you could play for hours." [...] GameSpot's Ricardo Torres called Monkey Race [...] "a solid little racer", and Casamassina recounted it felt [...] "polished and finely tuned." [...] Stevenson [...] "loved Monkey Fight", while Casamassina and Kent highlighted {{the use of a}} crown to identify the player currently in the lead as encouraging [...] "players to gang up on each other." [...] Casamassina hailed Monkey Fight as [...] "a thing of beauty", but Turner dismissed it as [...] "a dud, as it's too much frantic button smacking and not enough skill or thought." [...] Monkey Target, lauded by Kent as the [...] "most addictive interactive activity of 2001" [...] and considered [...] "the most complex" [...] of the party games by Turner, was complimented by Casamassina for its [...] "simple and brilliantly intuitive" [...] control scheme and [...] "careful science of when to use an item and when to forgo it." [...] Nintendo Power and Medina, respectively, described Monkey Billiards as [...] "a full-blown pool game" [...] and [...] "a very fun alternative to the real game"; Casamassina applauded its [...] "ultra-realistic physics engine that perfectly mimics how pool balls would react... <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>works</b> just as good if not better than any pool simulation available to home consoles." [...] Casamassina was further impressed by the physics of Monkey Bowling, elaborating that [...] "when the pins break apart one would swear it's the real deal", but Turner criticized its physics as [...] "slightly wonky". Medina singled out Monkey Bowling's [...] "nailbiting" [...] challenge mode as a personal favorite, while Nintendo Power considered Monkey Bowling [...] "as good as tenpin gets" [...] and Kent wrote it [...] "is one of the most robust bowling simulations I have ever played." [...] Finally, Four-Eyed Dragon conveyed that Monkey Golf provided [...] "a humongous challenge" [...] with [...] "crazy, lopsided miniature golf course", while Kent called it an [...] "absolutely infuriating... test [...] your aim and your logic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Zacharek of TIME Magazine, {{stated that}} [...] "Even within this highly {{synthetic}} world, Pitt and Cotillard give sturdy, coded performances that feel naturalistic, not phony: They understand clearly that their chief {{mission is to}} tap the tradition of melodrama, and they take it seriously. Somehow, almost incomprehensibly, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>works.</b> Allied looks old but smells new, and the scent is heady." [...] Eric Eisenberg from CinemaBlend gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Pitt is given what can be called the meatier part, as Max's raw nerves are fully exposed throughout the film {{as he tries to}} learn the truth about his wife -- but Cotillard's part is the more subtle and challenging, perfectly engulfing Marianne with an enigmatic air that perpetually keeps the audience guessing. They're heavy turns, but Pitt and Cotillard prove again why they're two {{of the best in the}} business." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{has been}} criticized for keeping its {{deliberations}} hidden from public view. According to a review of Jeffrey Toobin's expose [...] "Its inner workings are difficult for reporters to cover, like a closed [...] "cartel", only revealing itself through [...] "public events and printed releases, with nothing about its inner workings". The reviewer writes: [...] "few (reporters) dig deeply into court affairs. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>works</b> very neatly; the only ones hurt are the American people, who know little about nine individuals with enormous power over their lives." [...] Larry Sabato complains about the Court's [...] "insularity." [...] A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll conducted in 2010 found that 61% of American voters agreed that televising Court hearings would [...] "be good for democracy", and 50% of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were televised. In recent years, many justices have appeared on television, written books and made public statements to journalists. In a 2009 interview on C-SPAN, journalists Joan Biskupic (of USA Today) and Lyle Denniston (of SCOTUSblog) argued that the Court is a [...] "very open" [...] institution with only the justices' private conferences inaccessible to others. In October 2010, the Court began the practice of posting on its website recordings and transcripts of oral arguments on the Friday after they occur.|$|E

500|$|Several {{songs on}} the album are about the themes of love & relationships. These tracks are based on reality, but {{according}} to Martin, they were written with a fictional twist: [...] "Songs are like fairy tales: they have a beginning and an end {{and you can make}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>work</b> perfectly. Real life doesn't work like that".|$|R

Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking. Still, I don't know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you'd think he was singing into a barrel. Now, isn't that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get outside of a baron of beef.

60|$|Standing on this ground--the last, the highest, only {{permanent}} ground--and sternly criticising, from <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> <b>works,</b> {{either of}} the literary, or any art, we have peremptorily to dismiss every pretensive production, however fine its esthetic or intellectual points, which violates or ignores, or even does not celebrate, the central divine idea of All, suffusing universe, of eternal trains of purpose, in the development, by however slow degrees, of the physical, moral, and spiritual kosmos. I say he has studied, meditated to no profit, whatever may be his mere erudition, who has not absorbed this simple consciousness and faith. It is not entirely new--but it is for Democracy to elaborate it, and look to build upon and expand from it, with uncompromising reliance. Above the doors of teaching the inscription is to appear, Though little or nothing can be absolutely known, perceiv'd, except from {{a point of view}} which is evanescent, yet we know at least one permanency, that Time and Space, in the will of God, furnish successive chains, completions of material births and beginnings, solve all discrepancies, fears and doubts, and eventually fulfil happiness--and that the prophecy of those births, namely spiritual results, throws the true arch over all teaching, all science. The local considerations of sin, disease, deformity, ignorance, death, &c., and their measurement by the superficial mind, and ordinary legislation and theology, are to be met by science, boldly accepting, promulging this faith, and planting the seeds of superber laws--of the explication of the physical universe through the spiritual--and clearing the way for a religion, sweet and unimpugnable alike to little child or great savan.|$|E
