40|$|The {{behavior}} of nutrient release and adsorption from sediments {{was influenced by}} hydrodynamic disturbance significantly. The resuspension/sedimentation processes of sediment particles and phosphate adsorption in Taihu Lake were investigated under different disturbing intensity by utilizing simulative conditions. The effect of morphological characteristics of suspended particles on phosphate adsorption was also studied. In order to elucidate the characteristics of particles suspended by disturbance, the size and structure of particles during different time were monitored on-line by using photometric dispersion and particles image analysis. The method of fractal geometry to explore the morphology characteristics of particles was also used. The results showed that sediments suspended obviously and the phosphate concentration of overlying water decreased rapidly when strong disturbance was applied. Moreover, two different disturbing conditions, one was static condition without wind {{and the other was}} weak disturbing intensity with slow wind velocity, following heavy disturbance were compared, {{and it turned out that}} the turbidity and phosphate concentration were lower in the latter because the size and the structure of suspended particles were more favorable in the latter disturbing condition. The <b>flocculation</b> <b>index</b> of suspended particles was 0. 25 and characteristic length was 30 mu m under 100 rpm disturbance; comparatively, when heavy disturbance increased to 120 rpm, the <b>flocculation</b> <b>index</b> grew up to 0. 60 and the characteristic length was greater than 60 mu m. The fractal dimensions of suspended particles were between 1. 65 and 1. 92. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The investigated soil showed an unusual behavior: the hydraulic conductivty was high close to and at saturation as it is commonly found in sady soils; however, at high soil water suction, it can retain large amounts of water which is a typical characteristics for clayey soils. This phenomenon may explained to the particle size distribuition (predominatly clay) and its strong aggregation.

40|$|Floes {{generated}} by various shear forces exhibit different characteristics of size, strength and structure. These properties were investigated by employing a continuous optical monitoring and a microscope with CCD camera to directly monitor aggregation under six different shear intensities. The floc structure {{was characterized by}} the fractal dimension. The {{results showed that the}} <b>flocculation</b> <b>index</b> (FI) decreased from 1. 16 at 20 rpm to 0. 25 at 250 rpm and the floc size decreased from 550 pm to 150 Pin, meantime, the FI value showed a good correlation with floc size. In order to determine the floc strength, two methods were used. One was the strength factor, ranging from 18. 3 % to 62. 5 %, calculated from FI curve, and the other was a theoretical value between 0. 005 N/m(2) and 0. 240 N/m(2), estimated by calculation. The floc strength increased with the G value in both cases. Furthermore, the fractal dimension increased with G and its value was between 1. 30 and 1. 63.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of organic farming of wine grapes under physical and chemical characteristics of Ultisol Brazil?s northeastern semiarid region. The samples of soil were collected from the row and interrow of the farming and from the fallow area, at the depths of 0. 0 - 0. 10, 0. 10 - 0. 20, 0. 20 - 0. 30 and 0. 30 - 0. 60 m. The samples were collected at six and twelve months after the culture implementation to evaluate the state of aggregation, bulk density and total soil porosity, <b>flocculation</b> <b>index</b> and organic matter contents, calcium, magnesium, and sodium. The results were submitted to statistical analysis. The adoption of organic farming contributed to the soil aggregation process. The bulk density and total soil porosity did not differ significantly between the evaluations, but were within the critical limits for sandy soils. The index flocculation did not have a great influence on the aggregates formation, being this process influenced by organic matter. The period of one year was considered short to obtain conclusive results in improving the soil quality by organic farming, since there are difficulties in tropical soils in promoting significant increases in organic matter content in short time. 201...|$|E
40|$|Changes in soil {{physical}} properties {{are inherent in}} land use, mainly in superficial layers. Structural alterations can directly influence distribution, stability and especially morphometry of soil aggregates, which hence will affect pore system and the dynamic process of water and air in soil. Among the methods used to measure these changes, morphometry is a complementary tool to the classic methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate structural quality of a Latosol (Oxisol), under different management systems, using morphometric techniques. Treatments consisted of soil under no-tillage (NT); pasture (P), in which both had been cultivated for ten years, and an area under native vegetation (NV – Savannah like vegetation). Aggregates were sampled at depths of 0 - 0. 10 and 0. 10 - 0. 20 m, retained on sieves with 9. 52 – 4. 76 mm, 4. 76 – 1. 0 mm, 1. 0 – 0. 5 mm diameter ranges. Aggregate morphometry was assessed by 2 D images from scanner via QUANTPORO software. The analyzed variables were: area, perimeter, aspect, roughness, Ferret diameter and compactness. Moreover, disturbed samples were collected at the same depths to determine particle size, aggregate stability in water, water-dispersible clay, clay <b>flocculation</b> <b>index</b> and organic matter content.

After analysis of the soil profile (cultural profile) in areas under forest management, samples were collected from the layers 0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 40 cm, with six repetitions.

40|$|Surface waters {{from two}} {{different}} sources, river and reservoir, with different dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and characters were investigated for removals using three metal coagulants, alum, a high performance aluminum polymer (HPAC) and polyaluminum chloride (PACl). Jar tests were conducted with coagulation pH ranging between 5. 5 and 8. 5 and doses between 5 and 16 mgAl/L. The adsorption mechanisms of DOM onto Al hydroxide precipitates of the three coagulants were investigated based on Freundlich, Langmuir and BET isotherm models. Coagulation kinetics and floc formation were studied using a photometric dispersion analyzer (PDA). For the three coagulants tested, optimum DOM removal was achieved at a coagulant dose of 11 mgAl/L and pH 6 for both waters. The lowest coagulant dose (5 mgAl/L) removed most organics with apparent molecular weights of between 2000 and 10, 000 Da for both waters. DOM adsorption is best described by the BET isotherm model, indicating that DOM sorption occurred through multilayer formation in an arbitrary distribution of adsorbed particles. PACl showed the highest DOM adsorption capacity, determined by the Freundlich model. By PDA analyses, the <b>flocculation</b> <b>index,</b> average growth rate and variance values {{from the use of}} HPAC were highest in comparison with alum and PACl.

40|$|Mining {{contributes}} to the life quality of contemporary society, but can generate significant impacts, these being mitigated due to environmental controls adopted. This study aimed to characterize soil physical properties in high-altitude areas affected by bauxite mining, and to edaphic factors responses to restoration techniques used to recover mined areas in Poços de Caldas plateau, MG, Brazil. The experiment used 3 randomized block design involving within 2 treatments (before mining intervention and after environmental recovery), and 4 replicates (N= 24). In each treatment, soil samples with deformed structures were determined: granulometry, water-dispersible clay content, <b>flocculation</b> <b>index,</b> particle density, stoniness level, water aggregate stability, and organic matter contend. Soil samples with preserved structures {{were used to determine}} soil density and the total volume of pores, macropores, and micropores. Homogenization of stoniness between soil layers as a result of soil mobilization was observed after the mined area recovery. Stoniness decreased in 0. 10 - 0. 20 m layer after recovery, but was similar in the 0 - 0. 10 m layer in before and after samples. The recovery techniques restored organic matter levels to pre-mining levels. However, changes in soil, including an increase in soil flocculation degree and a decrease in water-dispersible clays, were still apparent post-recovery. Furthermore, mining operations caused structural changes to the superficial layer of soil, as demonstrated by an increase in soil density and a decrease in total porosity and macroporosity.

In fine-textured soils, it will provide information on ponding of water and decrease in hydraulic gradient with wetting. This study was conducted to determine changes in {{hydraulic conductivity}} and macro- and micro-aggregate stability of a fine-textured submerged soil under intense cattle grazing for 15 years. Hydraulic conductivity of the cattle grazing soil ranged from very slow (0. 46 cm hr- 1) to slow (19. 56 cm hr- 1) in the top 0 - 25 cm depth, and attained near zero permeability (0. 15 cm hr- 1) before 75 cm depth. Permeability was rapid (21. 1 to 30. 06 cm hr- 1) throughout the profile in the non-cattle grazing soil. Organic residues from cattle grazing activities raised the soil total organic carbon to as high as 72 g kg- 1 in the top 0 - 25 cm depth. Wet trampling of organic residues from cattle excreta induced greater soil swelling and loss of soil strength resulting in low aggregated silt and clay (ASC) and clay <b>flocculation</b> <b>index</b> (CFI) within the 25 - 75 cm depth.

40|$|In this study, two model waters {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the ozone effect on aquatic organic matter (AOM) removal by coagulation with inorganic polymer flocculant (IPF) -polyaluminum chloride (PACl). Flocs formation during coagulation processes were detected by using PDA (Photometric Dispersion Analyzer). Apparent molecular weight distribution (AMWD) and resin fractionation (RF) were also performed to characterize the change of AOM as a result of pre-ozonation. The experimental results show that the dosage Of O(3), characteristics and composition of AOM are the most important factors on the behavior of coagulation. Great differences have been found between the two model waters. Coagulation in model water 1 (MW 1) (composed of humic acids) is impaired markedly by pre-ozonation, as more DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon) is produced with increasing O(3) dosage. Floc formation, as exhibited from decreasing of the slopes of A (<b>Flocculation</b> <b>Index),</b> is retarded gradually during coagulation process. Although residual turbidity is reduced with 1. 15 mg/L O(3), removals of DOC and UV(254) all decreased. As for model water 2 (MW 2) (composed of salicylic acid), A is retarded also, but turbidity and DOC removals of coagulation after pre-ozonation are improved to a certain extent. Coagulation performance judged from removal of DOC is improved distinctly by pre-ozonation. Fractionation results show that molecular weight of organic matter (OM) of MW 1 is converted from higher to lower: and OM becomes from more hydrophobic to more hydrophilic, which might be one of the mechanisms involved in the impairment of ozonation on coagulation effect. OM in MW 2 is oxidized and mineralized to a greater extent, thus its impairment on coagulation is released. Finally, according to water properties, some proposed applications were provided for application of ozone in water treatment process. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{drinking}} water treatment, {{there is growing}} interest {{in the application of}} natural cationic polymers that provide an alternate means to achieve enhanced coagulation. A review of the relevant literature concerning the coagulation mechanisms and action of polymer is presented with particular reference to the polymer character, such as polymer type, charge density and molecular weight. In addition, basic knowledge of a novel coagulant, a tannin-based modified polymer, is described. A full characterization of the tannin-based polymer (TBP) has been undertaken to provide an unambiguous description of the polymer, or monomer, structure. Some specialised newer analytical techniques in combination with several old classical techniques for polymer examination have been used to determine the chemical nature of the TBP, including its dissociation and precipitation behaviour, molecular weight, charge density, charge variability with pH, elemental content, functional group and chemical bonding, etc. The overall assessment of TBP indicated that it can be classified as a medium molecular weight polymer with a non-quaternized amine group and a charge density that varies with pH and time. The fundamental coagulation mechanisms and stoichiometry of suspended solid/dissolved organic matter with TBP have been investigated through laboratory experiments. Suspensions of kaolin clay and humic acid have been flocculated in a Gator jar using TBP as a sole primary coagulant. Using online analysis by Photometric Dispersion Analyzer (PDA), the relative floc size was indicated by a <b>Flocculation</b> <b>Index</b> (FI) during the coagulation process and the optimal concentration of coagulants was determined in overall terms by NPDOC, turbidity, colour, UV/Vis absorbance and Floc volume. Under given conditions the optimum dose of TBP corresponded to that required for maximum a 3 <b>Flocculation</b> <b>Index</b> (FI). The optimum dose of TBP was found to depend on the charge density of TBP and hence on the pH values of the solution. At neutral and acid condition, quantitative evidence of a stoichiometric relationship between TBP dosages with the concentrations of model impurity was illustrated. Complicating effects were present at higher pH values. The coagulation behaviour of TBP was generally in agreement with the coagulation mechanisms widely observed, and typical, of cationic polymers. It was evident that the coagulation performance and kinetics of TBP was also influenced by other factors, such as the velocity gradient, ageing of polyelectrolyte and reactor design. For comparative purposes, alum and a commonly used synthetic cationic polymer (polyDADMAC) were also assessed in this study as coagulants. The potential benefits to improving coagulation performance through the combination of TBP with alum as a dual primary coagulant have been investigated. Coagulation experiments using different model waters were carried out under conditions designed to optimize the maximization of flocculation. A full matrix of coagulation tests demonstrated that a unique optimal dosage of combined alum and cationic TBP exists at a given pH and component concentration. In this case, a significant reduction of alum with an improvement of coagulation efficiency was achieved. An approach to minimize the residual soluble TBP in treated waters and increase the floc settling by attaching the TBP to an inert solid (fine sand) has been attempted. The coagulation performance using this particle suspension (‘solid bound TBP’) as coagulant was found to be inferior with a high shear rate in accordance with the floc strength interpretations of TBP. Additional tests with raw waters were carried out to confirm the validity of the findings from the model water experiments using TBP and the alum/TBP combinations as primary coagulants. In the light of these studies, the relative importance of TBP’s chemical properties, especially molecular weight, charge density and solubility, as crucial 4 parameters of coagulation mechanism is discussed. Furthermore, approaches to improve flocculation performance with either partial replacement of inorganic coagulant or the combination with microsand are suggested and analysed.

The better understanding of these two soil properties is necessary to evaluate the suitability of soils for plant production. We collected soil samples from 10 sites from the southeast coast and northeast plateau of Thailand, at upper (0 - 5 cm depth) and lower (5 - 20 cm depth) levels for under udic and ustic Oxisols soil samples. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the contribution of major aggregate binding agents such as soil organic carbon (SOC), Fe and Al oxides, clay minerals and kaolin crystal size to the stability of soil aggregates. Soils were acidic (pH - 1), SOC ranged from 2. 08 - 4. 56 % for udic and 1. 11 - 1. 56 % for ustic soils. The udic soils showed higher contents of crystalline, non-crystalline, and organic forms of Fe and Al than those for ustic soils. The mean coherently scatterings domain (CSD) values for kaolin crystal size were 115 and 152 nm for udic and ustic soils, respectively. The mean water dispersible clay (WDC), water dispersible silt (WDSi), and dispersion ratio (DR) were 92, 43 g kg - 1, and 0. 17 for udic soils, and 218, 45 g kg - 1, and 0. 30 for ustic soils, respectively.

The following work was performed during this experimental study: (1) G versus rpm curves for different impellers were developed using calculated power based on measured torque. The torque was measured by a rotating torque meter using a photographic technique. (2) The effects of impeller geometry, rapid mixing intensity and pattern, concentration of coagulant dosing solution, coagulant injection pattern, and slow mixing intensity and pattern on flocculation efficiency were investigated in a bench scale batch reactor at both warm and cold water temperatures with metal coagulants;All the experiments were performed in a batch reactor with 18 -L liquid working volume inside a walk-in constant temperature room using five impeller geometries. The primary particles were kaolinite and they were flocculated using alum and ferric nitrate (Fe(NO[subscript] 3) [subscript] 3. 9 H[subscript] 2 O].;The paddle type mesh impeller performed significantly better than the turbine type impellers (2 -blade and A 310) under all conditions tested. All the paddle type impellers (mesh, modified stake, and 2 -blade stack) performed almost identically under the conditions tested. Both rapid mixing intensity and pattern had a remarkable impact on flocculation kinetics. An optimum G-value was obtained for each set of conditions. The low intensity, longer duration, rapid mix pattern outperformed the high intensity, short duration, rapid mix pattern in almost all the conditions studied;Slow injection, dilute dosing solution and multi port injection proved more beneficial than the pulse injection, concentrated dosing solution, and the single port injection respectively. There was an optimum slow mix G for each set of experimental conditions when constant G-slow mixing was adopted. Reducing the slow mix G as flocculation progressed resulted in higher <b>flocculation</b> <b>index</b> as flocculation progressed and better settled water turbidity due to less danger of floc breakup.

The flow system is also equipped with a secondary flowcontraction with an area reduction ratio of 2 : 1 after theheadbox nozzle, mimicking accelerations that may take placeduring forming. The flow system is equipped with heating andcooling devices {{for the study of}} temperature effects on fibresuspension flocculation. An online dosage device for the studyof chemical effects on fibre suspension flocculation is alsoincluded. The maximum flow velocity in the system is 16 m/s. Flowing fibre suspensions were studied using a high speedCCD video camera and transmitted infra-red laser light pulseillumination. Images were taken either separately before andafter or along the secondary contraction. Images of fibreflocculation were evaluated by power spectrum analysis, and themean floc size and the <b>flocculation</b> <b>index</b> were calculated. Aconcept of mean floc area reduction, based on power spectrum,has been introduced to characterise the fibre network insuspensions. By comparingthe fibre flocculation before andafter the secondary contraction, or by following the fibreflocs along the secondary contraction, floc rheologyinformation can be obtained. The effects of chemical additivesand fibre surface modification can also be studied by comparingthe corresponding fibre flocculation. For a bleached softwood kraft pulp suspension at a fibreconcentration of 5 g/l, the fibre flocs along the secondarycontraction have been manually evaluated, and the resultsconfirm that the power spectrum analysis is applicable. Ca 1 / 5 of the flocs were broken into two by the contraction. The meanfloc size increases in MD while in CD it decreases during theflow contraction. Both the floc aspect ratio and the flocorientation in MD increase during the flow contraction. The netfibre floc area is decreased and the fibre flocs areconcentrated by the flow contraction, which is confirmed by anincrease of gray value of the flocs in the light transmissionimages. The dewatering of fibre flocs may thus have alreadybeen started in the suspension before reaching the wires in theforming zone. Some physical influences on fibre suspension flocculationhave been investigated. The results confirm that fibreconcentration and fibre length are the dominating factorsaffecting fibre suspension flocculation. Increasing absoluteflow velocity has an insignificant effect on fibre flocs in theflow contraction. Suppressing turbulence, by increasingsuspension viscosity via a decrease of medium temperature,shows a clear effect on reducing fibre suspensionflocculation. Some chemical influences on fibre suspension flocculationhave also been investigated. A retention aid, flocculant,cationic polyacrylamide, C-PAM, increases fibre suspensionflocculation by a bridging mechanism, and a formation aid,class II, anionic polyacrylamide, A-PAM, decreases fibresuspension flocculation by suppressing turbulence. Fibresuspension flocculation can also be reduced by surfacemodification with carboxymethyl cellulose, due to a reductionof the friction between fibres. The amount of fibre dispersiondepends on the ionic form of the grafted CMC, due to theelectrostatic repulsion between negatively charged groups onthe grafted CMC moieties. Xyloglucan, a non-ionic polymer,which is strongly adsorbed on cellulosic fibre surfaces, showsa similar influence on reduction of fibre suspensionflocculation by decreasing the friction between fibres. The fibre flocculation data in the flow loop system werealso compared with the corresponding paper formation data inthe sheets produced on a pilot paper machine, both with andwithout chemical additives. The results show that the fibresuspension flocculation is well correlated with the paper sheetformation: when the fibre suspension flocculation is increased,the corresponding paper sheet formation deteriorates,especially in the large scale range...|$|E
