40|$|Upon the {{addition}} of protons to an aqueous solution containing multiple buffers, the final H+ concentration ([H+]) at equilibrium {{is determined by the}} partitioning of added H+ among the various buffer components. In the analysis of acid-base chemistry, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the Stewart strong ion formulation can only describe (rather than predict) the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pH</b> following a proton load since these formulas calculate the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pH</b> only when the reactant concentrations at equilibrium 1 are already known. In this regard, it is simpler to directly measure the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pH</b> rather than measure the equilibrium reactant concentrations to calculate the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pH.</b> As these formulas cannot predict the final equilibrium [H+] following a proton load to a multiple-buffered aqueous solution, we developed a new quantitative approach for predicting the equilibrium [H+] that is based on the preequilibrium 2 concentrations of all buffers in an aqueous solution. The mathematical model used to derive our equation is based on proton transfer buffer equilibria without requiring the incorporation of electroneutrality considerations. The model consists of a quartic polynomial equation that is derived based solely on the partitioning of H+ among the various buffer components. We tested the accuracy of the model using aqueous solutions with various buffers and measured the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pH</b> values following {{the addition}} of HCl.

Bis (2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex 272) and Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA) were used to separate nickel and zinc. In the D 2 EHPA system, at <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pH</b> of 2, zinc extraction was more than 98 % whereas nickel extraction was only 0. 36 %.

40|$|Effect of citric, malic, tartaric and acetic acids on {{adsorption}} of La, Ce, Pr and Nd by and desorption {{from four}} typical Chinese soils was studied. Generally, adsorption capacities of {{rare earth elements}} (REEs) were significantly correlated with the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soils. In the presence of acetic acids adsorption of REEs {{was similar to that}} in the presence of Ca(NO 3) (2). However, in the presence of citric, malic and tartaric acids adsorption of REEs by Heilongjiang, Zhejiang and Guangdong soils decreased to varying extents if compared with that in the presence of nitrate and acetic acid. The significance of suppression followed the order of citric acid > malic acid > tartaric acid > acetic acid, which was consistent with the order of stability of complexes of REEs with these organic acids. However, the adsorption increased with increasing <b>equilibrium</b> solution <b>pH.</b> For Jiangxi soil with low soil pH, CEC and organic matter these organic acids exerted an even more serious suppression effect on the adsorption of REEs. Another feature {{of the relationship between the}} adsorption of REEs and <b>equilibrium</b> solution <b>pH</b> was that the adsorption of REEs decreased with increase of pH from 2 to 4. 5 and then slightly increased with further increase of pH. Desorption of REEs varied with soils and with organic acids as well. REEs were released easily from Heilongjiang, Zhejiang and Guangdong soils in the presence of organic acid. Generally, desorption of REEs decreased with increasing <b>equilibrium</b> solution <b>pH.</b> Effect of organic acids on desorption of REEs from Jiangxi soil was more complicated. In the presence of citric and malic acids no decrement and/or slight increase in desorption of REEs were observed over the <b>equilibrium</b> solution <b>pH</b> from 3 to 6. 5.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{pesticide}} glyphosate (GPS) on adsorption processes of copper onto three soils of different characteristics has been studied. Cu adsorption decreases in general with increasing GPS concentration in solution, due principally to the lower <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pHs,</b> although {{this is not the}} only variable affecting copper adsorption. For the same pH values, Cu adsorption is higher in two of the three soils in the presence of GPS, but for the third soil, Cu adsorption is higher in the absence of GPS. This behavior is explained by the possibility of GPS adsorption on these soils and by the formation of Cu-GPS complexes in solution. The soils showing a higher Cu adsorption in the presence of GPS than in its absence for the same pH are able to adsorb this pesticide. In these soils, copper can be adsorbed directly on the soil surfaces, and also through the formation of bonds with GPS previously adsorbed. The third soil was not able to adsorb GPS. Consequently, all the pesticide remained in solution, forming strong Cu complexes with low tendency to be adsorbed on this soil. For this reason, the concentration of free Cu in solution is drastically reduced, and the adsorption of copper on this soil is lower. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent {{trend in}} {{extraction}} of nickel and cobalt from laterite ore through hydrometallurgical route is by using leaching agents {{that can be}} effectively regenerated, such as hydrochloric and nitric acid. Despite success stories of nickel laterite leaching in nitric acid, investigations on separation of nickel and cobalt from pregnant leach solution in this leaching media are still poorly reported. Nickel and cobalt are mostly recovered in the forms of intermediate products such as mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) and mixed sulphide precipitate (MSP). In this paper, separations of cobalt and nickel in nitrate solution and in pregnant leach solution of nickel laterite ore from Indonesia are discussed. Series of solvent extraction tests using Cyanex 272 and a combination of Versatic 10 and Cyanex 272 were performed under variations of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>pH,</b> extractant concentration, temperature and volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase (O/A ratio). The investigation results demonstrate that Cyanex 272 can be effectively used to separate cobalt and nickel in a solution with low nitrate concentration at the absences of Fe and Mg.

The structurally-related monovalent OC, 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+), crosses the renal brush border via OC/H+ exchange {{using the same}} pathway by which tetraethylammonium (TEA) is transported. We examined whether paraquat shares the TEA(MPP+) /H+ exchanger by examining 14 C-paraquat transport in rabbit renal BBMV. Compared to a <b>pH</b> <b>equilibrium</b> condition (<b>pH</b> 7. 5 in: 7. 50), an H-gradient (pH 6 in: 7. 50) stimulated the 5 s and 60 s s uptakes of 230 μM paraquat by 51 % and 108 %, respectively, and this stimulation was blocked by both 20 mM unlabeled paraquat and TEA. Pre-loading BBMV with 2 mM unlabeled TEA (under conditions of <b>pH</b> <b>equilibrium)</b> stimulated by 3 -fold the 60 s uptake of 120 μM paraquat and by 5 min produced a transient intravesicular accumulation of paraquat that exceeded equilibrium (2 h) uptake by 45 %. The presence of 200 μM paraquat in the extravesicular solution competitively inhibited H-gradient-stimulated transport of 14 C-TEA in renal BBMV, increasing the apparent Kt for TEA transport from 169 μM to 379 μM, without significantly influencing the Jmax (16. 0 vs. 15. 4 nmol mg− 1 min− 1). The calculated Ki for paraquat (presumably equal to its Kt for transport) after transport was between 160 and 220 μM (depending upon the method of estimation). Significantly, the Kt for MPP+/H exchange is 12 μM, suggesting that the affinity of the exchanger is profoundly influenced by the presence on paraquat of a second positive charge. We conclude that renal transport of paraquat involves the OC/H+ exchanger of proximal cell luminal membranes and that this pathway {{may play a role}} in the renal secretion of polyvalent organic cations...|$|R

The behaviour of DCPD itself under the same conditions requires checking. Solid titration was used to determine the apparent solubility of DCPD in a 100 -mmol·l - 1 KCl solution at 37. 0 ± 0. 1 °C over the pH range 3. 2 - 11. 6. The constitution of the precipitate was determined by X-ray diffraction, particle morphology was observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and the precipitate Ca/P ratio was calculated by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The titration curve for DCPD was substantially lower than the position reported elsewhere.
