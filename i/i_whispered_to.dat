60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Milly that {{it might}} be {{discreet}} for us to move a little way from the vicinity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on. Remember {{your second}} resolution," [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> the Story Girl, who was {{stalking}} {{along with an}} outraged expression.|$|E
6000|$|But we couldn't {{think of}} {{anything}} to say. Directly, however, I thought I must do something, so <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> the Indian: ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{hollow box}} remembers every foot [...] That danced upon the level grass of the world, [...] And will tell secrets if <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|R
60|$|This {{hollow box}} remembers every foot That danced upon the level grass of the world, And will tell secrets if <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> it. (Sings.) Lift up the white knee; That's what they sing, Those young dancers That {{in a ring}} Raved but now Of the hearts that break Long, long ago For their sake.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Otomie,' <b>I</b> <b>whispered,</b> 'listen <b>to</b> me. <b>I</b> love you, Otomie.' Now I saw {{her breast}} heave beneath the bands and the colour come upon her brow.|$|R
6000|$|Here was {{a pretty}} letter from a fond husband. 'But, ha! proud noble,' <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> my heart, 'you and me shall meet to-morrow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now {{you have}} done it!' <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> the old lady as the blessed word 'assimilation' woke up all the old {{arguments}} for and against.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, look here," [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Rectus, [...] "if you're captain, you've got {{to step up}} and do the talking. It isn't my place." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{believe we}} were left a full half-hour waiting for the third assault. Certain {{it was that the}} time seemed long <b>to</b> me, and <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> once <b>to</b> Archie, saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 11. And what art thou? I know, but {{dare not}} speak: Time may {{interpret}} to his silent years. Yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek, And {{in the light}} thine ample forehead wears, And in thy sweetest smiles, and in thy tears, [...] 95 And in thy gentle speech, a prophecy <b>Is</b> <b>whispered,</b> <b>to</b> subdue my fondest fears: And through thine eyes, even in thy soul I see A lamp of vestal fire burning internally.|$|R
60|$|I hesitated. Should <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> him? But what? His immobility {{seemed to}} have been never disturbed. What could I tell him he did not know already?... Finally I went on deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind her," [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> him. [...] "You {{want the}} fresh air. Send for the gardener. Let us take a drive in your pony-chaise." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{taking some}} of the tea, the poor woman revived, and <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> her daughter,--"Don't you think it might please her to see the little picture?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Lucilla, {{trembling}} {{and weeping}} in my arms. [...] "He will deserve our sympathy; he will win our pardon and our pity yet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At least <b>I</b> didn't <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> Guy about Will's faults and his {{blindness}} to my remarkable soul. I didn't! Matter of fact, Will probably understands me perfectly! If only--if {{he would}} just back me up in rousing the town.|$|R
6000|$|... "That strong cigar," [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> feebly <b>to</b> myself; [...] "I ought {{never to}} have ventured upon it. And then the little room with all those people in it. Besides, I have been working very hard. I must really take more exercise." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> Want <b>To</b> <b>Whisper</b> Something - Georgie Locke & Harry Blitztien ...|$|R
6000|$|I felt {{a little}} disappointed: Bruno's {{conception}} of the part seemed so wanting in dignity. [...] "Won't he say any more of the speech?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Sylvie.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What price your latter-day {{lime-juice}} subaltern?' <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Stalky {{behind my}} hand. His nostrils expanded, and he drummed {{on the edge}} of the Japanese jar with his knuckles.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Stephen. [...] "I don't think he'll kill {{us after}} {{drinking}} our coffee, and what's more, I {{believe he is}} coming to breakfast." ...|$|E

6000|$|With ears intent, {{with eyes}} abased, [...] Like a shadow still my steps thou hast chased; [...] If <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> aught <b>to</b> my friend, I feel [...] Thee follow quickly upon my heel. [...] Poor wretch, thou fill'st me with loathing; fly! [...] Thou art a spy! ...|$|R
6000|$|At the {{appointed}} {{time we were}} shown into the small audience room, and, as we passed its door, <b>I</b> ventured <b>to</b> <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> Oliver: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'We've got to skip,' <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> him, {{putting my}} mouth {{close to the}} crack of the door and before I could get away he cried, oh! so mournfully: ...|$|E
6000|$|THOROUGHLY disheartened and disgusted, and (if I must {{honestly}} confess it) thoroughly frightened too, <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Macallan, [...] "I was wrong, and {{you were}} right. Let us go." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was dreadful to hear him. I {{saw that}} the poor girl could endure no more. [...] "Leave us," [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> her; [...] "I will join you at the house." ...|$|E
60|$|Cre. Then strait came on Alcander, with a {{wild and}} bellowing crowd, Whom he had wrought; <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> him <b>to</b> join. And head the forces while the heat was in them. So to the palace I returned, to meet The king, and greet him with another story.-- But see, he enters.|$|R
6000|$|I sprang {{forward with}} a warning hand up. That is why Catherine did not scream. She {{was going to do}} that--I saw it plainly. Then <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> her <b>to</b> slip out of the place, and say nothing of what had happened. I said Joan was asleep--asleep and dreaming. Catherine whispered back, and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Once, during dinner, <b>I</b> {{heard her}} <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> my father (for {{children}} are not quite so deaf as their elders think), [...] "He seems to eat all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|Before {{any more}} {{questions}} {{could be put}} to her, she was called away to receive a basket of eggs at the dairy door. As she left us <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Miss Halcombe-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go upstairs!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> her. She {{shook her}} head. I {{could see him}} taking heavy breaths, and the veins of his neck were swelling. I was furious at her disobedience.|$|E
6000|$|When {{this had}} been done there seemed little chance either of the captives could do more than give {{utterance}} to moans; but, lest they might succeed in loosening their bonds, <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Harvey: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{then the}} doctor come in. 'Oh, sir!' says <b>I,</b> <b>whispering</b> <b>to</b> him--just as if I hadn't found out {{a minute ago}} that she couldn't hear me {{at the top of}} my voice--'I'm afraid there's {{something}} gone wrong with her hearing--.' 'Have you only just now suspected that?' says he; 'I've been afraid of it for some days past, but I thought it best to say nothing till I'd tried her; and she's hardly well enough yet, poor child, to be worried with experiments on her ears.' 'She's much better,' says I; 'indeed, she's much better to-day, sir! Oh, do try her now, for it's so dreadful to be in doubt a moment longer than we can help.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Not notice it!’ {{continued}} Wisbottle. ‘Bless you; <b>I</b> saw him <b>whispering</b> <b>to</b> her, and she crying; {{and then}} I’ll swear I {{heard him say}} something about to-night when {{we were all in}} bed.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Take {{no notice}} of him,” <b>I</b> <b>whispered.</b> “He’s coming <b>to</b> {{see how we}} take it. Don’t {{let him know that}} we know. We can deny him that satisfaction. Take off your shoes—that’s right—and carry them in your hand.” ...|$|R
