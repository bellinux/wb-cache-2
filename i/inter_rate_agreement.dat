That the <b>Rating</b> <b>Agreement</b> would transfer was apparently so obvious to BP that it did not wait to hear the position of the Shire of Hastings before transferring the assets to BP Australia Ltd. Under the <b>Rating</b> <b>Agreement</b> the <b>rates</b> would have been $50,000 however the Shire of Hastings said the <b>Rating</b> <b>Agreement</b> no longer applied and assessed the rates in excess of $150,000.|$|R

50|$|In {{regard to}} structure, the euro money {{market has been}} less {{concentrated}} over the past years. But differences across the various money market segments continue to exist. The market that is least concentrated is the unsecured money market segment. The money market segments that are highly condensed are the forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreement,</b> other interest <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> and the cross currency swap segments. They constitute about 70% of the entire money market share.|$|R

2500|$|In {{business}} and contract law, a forward-forward agreement (FFA) {{is a form}} of forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> in which party A agrees to lend party B the m1 amount of money, at future time t1. In return, B will pay to A a larger monetary amount m2 at time t2 > t1. The name [...] "forward-forward agreement" [...] derives from the fact that both issuing and repayment of the loan take place in the future. A regular forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> lends the money at once. A quoted forward rate is associated with every forward-forward agreement. This {{can be thought of as}} the interest rate earned by party A for lending the money to B.|$|R
50|$|A single Eurodollar {{future is}} similar to a forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> to borrow or lend US$1,000,000 for three months {{starting}} on the contract settlement date.

50|$|In finance, an {{interest}} rate swap (IRS) is {{an interest}} rate derivative (IRD). In particular it is a linear IRD {{and one of the}} most liquid, benchmark products. It has associations with forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> (FRAs), and with zero coupon swaps (ZCSs).|$|R
3000|$|Two {{types of}} rater {{consistency}} indexes were calculated {{to assess the}} degree of consistency between the ratings: Pearson’s correlation and <b>rating</b> <b>agreement.</b> The Pearson’s correlation coefficients ranged from [...]. 52 to [...]. 75 for the computer-delivered tasks and [...]. 60 to [...]. 74 for the face-to-face tasks. The <b>rating</b> <b>agreements</b> for both modes were satisfactory with moderately high exact agreement (54.4 %– 68.4 %) and adjacent agreement (29.1 %– 45.6 %) for the face-to-face tasks; similarly moderate exact agreement (49.4 %– 72.2 %) and adjacent agreement (26.6 %– 40.5 %) were found for the computer-delivered tasks. The unsatisfactory correlation estimates {{may have been due}} to the fact that the rater pairs varied. When taking both types of indexes into account, the consistency of the ratings in both modes was considered acceptable herein.|$|R

Furthermore, {{there was a}}lso an agreement consensus that the new system seemed to be simple and user friendly with an <b>agreement</b> <b>rate</b> of 80.3  %. Moreover, there was an agreement consensus that the new system gives the opportunity for a smooth transition from the old AFS system with an <b>agreement</b> <b>rate</b> of 70.4  %, although this was not ranked as being important during the DELPHI round 1.|$|R

50|$|Linear IRDs {{are those}} whose net present values (PVs) are {{overwhelmingly}} (although not necessarily entirely) {{dictated by the}} one-to-one movement of the underlying interest rate index. Examples of linear IRDs are; interest rate swaps (IRSs), forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> (FRAs), zero coupon swaps (ZCSs), cross-currency basis swaps (XCSs) and single currency basis swaps (SBSs).|$|R
40|$|The ALICE 5 {{software}} package provides a commercially available automated sleep staging system designed for infants. This study aims {{to evaluate the}} accuracy of this sleep staging system in healthy infants. Polysomnograms from 32 healthy infants {{were obtained from the}} CHIME dataset. Sleep staging was performed using the Pneumo mode of the ALICE 5 package. Each polysomnogram was then re-staged by an experienced pediatric sleep physician. The <b>agreement</b> <b>rate</b> and the kappa <b>agreement</b> <b>rate</b> between the manual sleep scoring and the automated sleep scoring were calculated. The mean <b>agreement</b> <b>rate</b> was 74. 6 % (SD = 10 %), and the kappa <b>agreement</b> <b>rate</b> was kappa = 0. 558 (SD = 0. 17).

50|$|Euribors {{are used}} as a {{reference}} rate for euro-denominated forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreements,</b> short-term interest <b>rate</b> futures contracts and interest rate swaps, in {{very much the same}} way as LIBORs are commonly used for Sterling and US dollar-denominated instruments. They thus provide the basis for some of the world's most liquid and active interest rate markets.|$|R
50|$|As part of or {{on top of}} rental <b>rate</b> <b>agreements,</b> the FSA {{also adds}} on an {{additional}} financial incentive of up to 20% of the soil-rental rate for field windbreaks, grass waterways, filter strips, and riparian buffers 10.

50|$|The CME Eurodollar futures {{contract}} {{is used to}} hedge interest rate swaps. There is an arbitrage relationship between the interest rate swap market, the forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreement</b> market and the Eurodollar contract. CME Eurodollar futures can be traded by implementing a spread strategy among multiple contracts {{to take advantage of}} movements in the forward curve for future pricing of interest rates.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method to probe intra- and interchain {{activities}} within dimeric nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Utilizing domain inactivation and analytical mass mutants in conjunction with rapid-quench, mass spectrometry, and a probabilistic kinetic model, we have elucidated the pre-steady-state intra- and interchain rates and the corresponding flux of the acylation of L-Thr onto VibF. Although the intra rate is significantly faster than the <b>inter</b> <b>rate,</b> the data are most consistent with an even flux of covalent substrate loading where neither pathway dominates. These pre-steady-state results confirm previous steady-state in vitro mutant complementation studies of VibF. Extension of this methodology to other dimeric nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and to the related fatty acid and polyketide synthases, will further our biophysical understanding of their acyl-intermediate-processing pathways...|$|R
50|$|Forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreements</b> (FRAs) are {{interconnected}} {{with short}} term interest rate futures (STIR futures). Because STIR futures settle against the same index as {{a subset of}} FRAs, IMM FRAs, their pricing is related. The nature of each product has a distinctive gamma (convexity) profile resulting in rational, no arbitrage, pricing adjustments. This is adjustment is called futures convexity adjustment (FCA) and is usually expressed in basis points.|$|R

50|$|A forward <b>rate</b> <b>agreement's</b> (FRA's) {{effective}} {{description is}} a cash for difference derivative contract, between two parties, benchmarked against {{an interest rate}} index. That index is commonly an interbank offered rate (-IBOR) of specific tenor in different currencies, for example LIBOR in USD, GBP, EURIBOR in EUR or STIBOR in SEK. An FRA between two counterparties requires a fixed rate, notional amount, chosen interest rate index tenor and date to be completely specified.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{banks and}} large {{corporations}} will use FRAs to hedge future interest or exchange rate exposure. The buyer hedges against {{the risk of}} rising interest rates, while the seller hedges against the risk of falling interest rates. Other parties that use Forward <b>Rate</b> <b>Agreements</b> are speculators purely looking to make bets on future directional changes in interest rates. [...] The development swaps in the 1980s provided organisations with an alternative to FRAs for hedging and speculating.|$|R
