At the Domus Aurea (Rome) he collaborated with microbiologists from the University of Rome and archeologists of the Soprintendenza Roma in examining the decay of frescoes caused by contamination from a culture of bacteria. In his artistic realisation he used the same bacteria, which are destroying the “original” site, as active participants in a constructive <b>image</b> <b>process.</b> Since 2004 Edgar Lissel is using his skin flora for his artistic image production.

The path modeling is the analysis tool used, and 2 x 2 (product type: exercise equipment vs. diet pills, and body copy details: detailed vs. vague copy) experimental design is utilized with total N = 665 from University of Connecticut, Wake Forest, and Emerson College. ^ From the study, the motivations of social comparison are not found to be processed at the same level independently. Rather, they are functioning at different levels by integrated to each other. Also, the body <b>image</b> <b>process</b> is not simple process composed of several few key variables. Rather, it is a very complex and dynamic process. The consumer perceptions of product type itself used in the ad has more impact on ad believability, which has the strongest impact on the purchase intention.

40|$|Purpose: A new {{processing}} parameter (T-type parameter) setting for gray scale {{was developed to}} improve the image quality of digital mammograms. To clarify the usefulness of this parameter setting, we have evaluated the image quality of digital mammograms (hard copy <b>images)</b> <b>processed</b> with this parameter, and compared it with S/F mammography. Material and Methods: Mammograms were made under the same radiographic conditions by the S/F and FCR systems (type 1, S/F; type 2 and 3, FCR with new T-type parameters; type 4 and 5, FCR with conventional parameters). A total of 49 images from 10 cases was selected for evaluation testing. Evaluation items were the contrast visibility of mammary glands and adipose tissues together with their granularity and sharpness. Eleven medical doctors participated in evaluating the images. Results: The FCR hard copy <b>images</b> <b>processed</b> with the T-type parameter settings were signifi cantly preferred over the conventional S/F images for the contrast visibility of mammary glands and adipose tissue. As for the other items (except for granularity), the FCR hard copy <b>images</b> <b>processed</b> with the T-type parameter settings were subjectively evaluated as slightly better {{than or equal to}} the S/F images...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBlind {{deconvolution}} {{refers to}} the image processing task of restoring the original image from a blurred version without {{the knowledge of the}} blurring function. One approach that has been proposed recently [T. Chan, C. Wong, IEEE Trans. <b>Image</b> <b>Process.</b> 7 (1998) 370 – 375; Y. You, M. Kaveh, IEEE Trans. <b>Image</b> <b>Process.</b> 5 (1996) 416 – 428] is a joint minimization model in which an objective function is set up consisting of three terms: the data fitting term, and the regularization terms for the image and the blur. This model implicitly defines a one-parameter family of blurred images and point spread functions (PSFs), from which the user can decide, usually using additional information, which is the “best” restored image. To find a local minimum of the objective function, we use an alternating minimization (AM) procedure [Y. You, M. Kaveh, IEEE Trans. <b>Image</b> <b>Process.</b> 5 (1996) 416 – 428] in which we fix either the blur or the image and minimize respect to the other variable, each step of which is a standard non-blind deconvolution problem. While the model is not convex and thus allows multiple solutions, we have found that the AM procedure always converges globally, but with the converged solution depending on the initial guess. In this paper, we give an analysis of the AM procedure which explains the convergence behavior and the observed robustness of the method...|$|E
