5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E

Reviewing actual test questions can confuse children and stifles their natural thinking process, however reviewing similar style questions is a possibility.|$|E
25|$|Since a clear {{archetype}} {{for determining}} guilt does not exist, {{the criminal justice}} system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a decision has been made, it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> know whether a jury has been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.|$|E

25|$|The {{end of the}} ED is {{not defined}} archaeologically, but {{political}}ly. The conquests of Sargon and his successors upset the political equilibrium throughout Iraq, Syria, and Iran. The conquests lasted many years into the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad and built on ongoing conquests during the ED. The transition is much harder to pinpoint within an archaeological context. It <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> date a site to either ED III or Akkadian period based on ceramic or architectural evidence alone.|$|E
25|$|To not be jostled out of {{the saddle}} and to not harm the horse by {{bouncing}} on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, but to do so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders.

25|$|The {{practice}} of exhibiting killer whales born in captivity is less controversial than of retaining free-born orcas, since the captive-born orcas have known no other world {{and may not}} be able to adapt to life in the wild. Captive breeding also promises to reduce incentives to capture wild orcas. However, in January 2002 the Miami Seaquarium stated that captive orcas are dying faster than they are being born, and as it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> obtain orcas captured from the wild, the business of exhibiting captive orcas may eventually disappear.|$|E

500|$|Gibraltar's {{geography}} {{has thus}} given it considerable natural defensive advantages. It <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> scale the eastern or northern {{sides of the}} Rock, which are either vertical or nearly so. To the south, the relatively flat area around Europa Point is surrounded by cliffs which are up to [...] high.

These factors have given it an enormous military significance over the centuries.|$|E
500|$|The {{measured}} abundances {{all agree}} at least roughly with those predicted {{from a single}} value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for , and off {{by a factor of}} two for in the latter two cases there are substantial systematic uncertainties. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> [...] "tune" [...] the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium. Indeed, there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of stellar nucleosynthesis products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than , and in constant ratios, too.|$|E

2500|$|However at 30MHz, {{things are}} different.
