40|$|Estimation {{of models}} for both plant and {{disturbance}} dynamics {{is important in}} controller design applications which especially focus on the disturbance and vibration rejection. Several methods for low order model estimation {{on the basis of}} the closed-loop data exist in the literature, but fail to address the simultaneous estimation of low order models of both plant and disturbance dynamics. This dissertation contributes to the development of a new methodology to extend the results to low order disturbance model estimation, and apply these techniques to the control problems for disturbance rejection. In addition to the control relevant estimation problem, this dissertation also provides new tools for feedforward based disturbance rejection found in Active Noise Control (ANC) systems. We focus on the feedforward control algorithms that are one of the most popular methods to cancel low frequency sound where passive methods are ineffective. This dissertation shows that the <b>feedforward</b> <b>filter</b> design can also be seen as a model matching problem with the system model approximated {{on the basis of the}} expansion of orthonormal basis functions. Therefore, existing results on generalized FIR filters are exploited to provide feedforward compensation with the advantage of including the prior information of the system dynamics in the tapped delay line of the filter. It has the same linear parameter structure as FIR filter which is favorable for adaptation process. In the case that the acoustic coupling can not be neglected in the process of designing the <b>feedforward</b> <b>filter,</b> a dual-Youla parametrization is introduced and applied to estimate the possible perturbation of the <b>feedforward</b> <b>filter</b> and the robust stability of the closed loop system is enforced during the design of <b>feedforward</b> <b>filter</b> for active noise cancellatio...|$|E

Examples of filters that belong to this class of structures include the gamma and the Laguerre filters. Adaptation procedures for this class of structures have been restricted to the LMS algorithm which suffers from slow convergence for large eigenvalue spread. Convergence speed can be greatly improved using recursive least squares (RLS) procedures. RLS algorithms, however, are unsuitable for tracking time varying parameters in nonstationary environments. Direct application of standard RLS algorithms to generalized <b>feedforward</b> <b>filters</b> is not possible because changes in the feedback parameter lead to corresponding changes in the weight vector and this mimics a time varying environment.

30|$|Maximum {{likelihood}} (ML) decoding is computationally impractical for SC-FDE {{systems for}} commonly used block sizes; thus, minimum {{mean square error}} (MMSE)-based equalization is commonly used. SC-FDE systems can also use a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) to improve their error performance. A decision-feedback equalizer uses the previously detected symbols to reduce the postcursor intersymbol interference (ISI), which is left behind by the common MMSE equalizer. An efficient DFE structure for SC-FDE systems, using a linear frequency-domain <b>feedforward</b> <b>filter</b> and a time-domain feedback filter, was proposed in[3]. Since the <b>feedforward</b> <b>filter</b> realizes its operations in the frequency domain, its computational complexity is lower when compared to a purely time-domain DFE. In SC-FDE systems using a DFE, the effect that the error propagation can cause is limited to one symbol block, since the equalizer operates on a per-block basis.|$|E

40|$|Two {{modified}} decision feedback equalizers (DFE) {{structures are}} developed for efficient equalization of long, sparse, multipath channels with large delay spread {{such as those}} encountered in high speed communications. A modified DFE structure called the partial feedback equalizer (PFE) is first developed. The PFE has a simple implementation and partially cancels postcursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) before <b>feedforward</b> <b>filtering.</b> The complete feedback equalizer (CFE) which has a more complex implementation but completely cancels the postcursor ISI prior to <b>feedforward</b> <b>filtering</b> is then developed. Unlike the DFE, these structures allow the channel 2 ̆ 7 s sparseness to be exploited for efficient hardware tap allocation before this property is degraded or destroyed by <b>feedforward</b> <b>filtering.</b> One tap allocation scheme {{is to use a}} thresholded partial feedback equalizer (TPFE) or a thresholded complete feedback equalizer (TCFE), where taps are allocated according to a thresholding strategy. The TPFE and the TCFE are shown to yield significant reductions in the number of complex-multiply operations that must be implemented in hardware for speed, while maintaining performance comparable to the conventional DFE. Consideration is given to the computation and adaptation of the inherently channel-estimate based PFE and CFE algorithms to facilitate operation over time-varying channels. Fully adaptive algorithms are developed, as well as fast algorithms which directly compute the optimal filter settings from the channel estimate and knowledge of the symbol and noise variance. The performance of the DFE-type structures on long, time varying channels is limited when the channel-estimate is updated based on a finite impulse response (FIR) model, due to the large number of coefficients that must be updated. Therefore consideration is given to channel parameterizations based on the underlying multipath gains and delays which are adaptively estimated, from which the channel estimate can be computed. In the linear parametric (LP) approach, multipath path gains are adaptively estimated while the multipath delays are assumed to be known. The non-linear parametric (NLP) approach extends the (LP) approach to include adaptive delay estimation. Simulations show that LP and NLP-based DFE-type structures have improved tracking performance when compared to their FIR-based counterparts. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} two {{feedforward control}} algorithms to attenuate the tension error in digital tape systems. Tape systems are time-varying {{because not only}} do the radii of both reels change as a result of tape winding from one reel to the other but reels also have eccentricities. We address the time-varying nature of the reel radii due to tape winding by introducing a time-varying <b>feedforward</b> <b>filter</b> for the reference input. To attenuate the periodic tension error caused by reel eccentricities, we investigate the error in previous periods and calculate the compensation input that cancels it. This input is then fed forward to the system for future periods. Simulations show that the time-varying reference input achieved from the <b>feedforward</b> <b>filter</b> leads to zero tension error if the variations in the radius are known. With unknown reel eccentricities, the feedforward compensation input reduces the tension error by about 3 orders of magnitude when the system is periodic. I...|$|E

A multichannel ”frequency domain” DFE is proposed in which the <b>feedforward</b> <b>filter</b> coefficients are represented in the frequency domain while the feedback filter coefficients are represented in the time domain.
