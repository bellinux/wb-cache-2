5|$|Apple's then-chief {{executive}} officer (CEO) John Sculley started the PowerBook project in 1990, allocating $1million for marketing. Despite the small marketing budget, the new PowerBook line was a success, generating over $1billion in revenue for Apple {{in its first}} year. Sony designed and manufactured the PowerBook100 {{in collaboration with the}} Apple Industrial Design Group, Apple's <b>internal</b> <b>design</b> team. It was discontinued on September 3, 1992, and superseded by the PowerBook 145 and PowerBook Duo series. Since then, it has been praised several times for its design; PC World named the PowerBook100 the tenth-greatest PC of all time in 2006, and US magazine Mobile PC chose the PowerBook100 as the greatest gadget of all time in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, a study {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Hawker Siddeley and Bristol for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept, which developed as the HSA.1000 and Bristol 198. Armstrong Whitworth also responded with an <b>internal</b> <b>design,</b> the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached Lockheed, and after the creation of British Aircraft Corporation in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with Boeing, General Dynamics, Douglas Aircraft and Sud Aviation.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 {{the fourth}} bell {{of the ring}} of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the <b>internal</b> <b>design</b> of the church was {{beginning}} to be considered impractical {{for the needs of}} the community, and the interior was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. Underfloor heating was built below a new marble floor and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs.|$|E

5|$|Released in , {{four years}} after the launch of the {{original}} PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 2 Slimline was the first major redesign of the PlayStation 2. Compared to its predecessor, the Slimline was smaller, thinner, quieter and also included a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). In , Sony began shipping a revision of the Slimline which was lighter than the original Slimline together with a lighter AC adapter. In , Sony released yet another revision of the Slimline which had an overhauled <b>internal</b> <b>design</b> incorporating the power supply into the console itself like the original PlayStation 2 resulting in a further reduced total weight of the console.|$|E
25|$|The Y-10 is an {{indigenous}} Chinese design. In 1970, the factory got a Pakistan Boeing 707 crashed in Hetian, Xinjiang to study it. While the planes were reverse-engineered {{copies of the}} Boeing 707one report claimed that after Chinese engineers disassembled a 707 to study it, neither the reassembled original nor the copy would flyboth the Y-10's designers and Boeing denied this. While the Y-10 resembles the 707, its dimensions are closer to the Boeing 720 than the 707, and the <b>internal</b> <b>design</b> is very different.|$|E

There is also the fully electronic entry-level model, the EC, which has a very different <b>internal</b> <b>design</b> and has a fixed-focus lens. The production rate for these cameras is considerably slower than in former years, however, as Minox devotes more time to the design and marketing of OEM cameras under the Minox brand.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, {{a desperate}} demand for bomber {{aircraft}} led to many aircraft being produced by secondary manufacturers via licence manufacturing arrangements. The English Electric company mass-produced thousands of piston-engined bombers, {{such as the}} Handley Page Hampden and Handley Page Halifax, in this manner and the firm thus became a well-established British aircraft manufacturer despite having little <b>internal</b> <b>design</b> experience. Sir George Nelson, the chairman of English Electric, decided that the company would seek {{to remain in the}} business and produce its own designs. In November 1943, the company was invited to participate in discussions over a prospective bomber which would take advantage of the newly developed jet propulsion technology.|$|E
25|$|After Poland regained her {{independence}} in 1918, the <b>internal</b> <b>design</b> {{of the castle}} was yet again modified. Since the 1920s it housed several parts of the Warsaw NCO school. The main staircase was restored to its 18th-century representative design. An interesting feature of the staircase was a set of stone tablets placed there May 15, 1927, commemorating {{the names of all}} known Polish military medics who perished in wars between 1797 and 1920. Additional tablets commemorated Karol Kaczkowski, Zdzisław Lubaszewski and a sculpture by Edward Wittig commemorating all military medics.

25|$|Much of the <b>internal</b> <b>designs</b> of the Beverly mill {{were hidden}} due to {{concerns}} of competitors stealing designs. The beginning efforts were all researched behind closed doors, {{even to the}} point that the owners of the mill set up milling equipment on their estates to experiment with the process. There were no published articles describing exactly how their process worked in detail. Additionally, the mill's horse-powered technology was quickly dwarfed by new water-powered methods.|$|R
25|$|George Doundoulakis, who {{directed}} research at General Bronze Corporation in Garden City, New York, along with Zachary Sears, {{who directed}} <b>Internal</b> <b>Design</b> at Digital B & E Corporation, New York, received the RFP from Cornell University for the antenna design {{and studied the}} idea of suspending the feed with his brother, Helias Doundoulakis, a civil engineer. George Doundoulakis identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, (the most important area of the reflector), and devised a better design by suspending the feed. He presented his proposal to Cornell for a doughnut truss suspended by four cables from four towers above the reflector, having along its edge a rail track for the azimuth truss positioning. This second truss, {{in the form of}} an arc, or arch, was to be suspended below, which would rotate on the rails through 360 degrees. The arc also had rails on which the unit supporting the feed would move for the feed's elevational positioning. A counterweight would move symmetrically opposite to the feed for stability and, if a hurricane struck, the whole feed could be raised and lowered. Helias Doundoulakis designed the cable suspension system which was finally adopted. Although the present configuration is substantially the same as the original drawings by George and Helias, (though with three towers instead of the original four), the U.S. Patent office granted Helias a patent, for the brothers' innovative idea. Another assignee on the patent, William J. Casey, later became director of the Central Intelligence Agency under President Ronald Reagan.|$|E

500|$|In practice, {{even the}} revised design ignored the {{acute-angled}} bastions {{which had been}} introduced in Europe, the round towers creating numerous patches of dead ground around the castle into which its guns could not fire; the high walls presented a greater target, the <b>internal</b> <b>design</b> was complicated and it remained difficult to move around inside the fort. Indeed, the historian Peter Harrington describes the final design as even [...] "more archaic than its predecessor". Chute's role was extended to become the Keeper and Captain of Camber, and the Keeper of the Waters of Camber and Puddle in January 1544, {{for which he was}} paid two shillings a day.

500|$|Touchscreen control {{components}} on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including {{a lack of}} underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, {{and a lack of}} rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible [...] "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar {{near the top of the}} display. iFixit reported that this issue, nicknamed [...] "touch disease", was a byproduct of the previous [...] "Bendgate" [...] design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models. The devices' successor, the iPhone 6S, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their <b>internal</b> <b>design,</b> which included the strengthening of [...] "key points" [...] in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the medical}} devices used during the open heart surgery in {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) is the aortic curve-tip cannula. The aortic curve-tip cannula is also used in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) to support patient in intensive care unit. There are few complications caused by the non – physiological jet or dispersed flow from the current cannula design. Thus, a novel designs approach to induce spiral flow and reduce the adverse effect on the aortic wall.

A comparative study between six cannulae designs were carried out by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in a steady state condition. Alls proposed <b>internal</b> helical <b>designs</b> have successfully induced spiral flow. The tapered body with 3 rib design was the best curved-tip aortic cannula design, since wall shear stress induced (2310 dyne/cm 2) was below the critical value of wall shear stress (4500 dyne/cm 2); while the outflow velocity was only slightly more than the standard cannula design. Also, the pressure drop across the cannula (66 mmHg) was significantly below the safe limit (100 mmHg) ...|$|R
