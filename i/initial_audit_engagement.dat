40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine {{whether there is a}} sign of lowballing in the <b>initial</b> <b>audit</b> <b>engagement</b> with a new auditor. I also examine how audit fees develop surrounding an auditor change. Auditors can be divided into big 4 and non-big 4 auditors. Therefore, companies can switch from big 4 or non-big 4 auditors into big 4 or non-big 4 auditors, hence there are four different types of auditor changes. I am interested in examining the effect of lowballing in these different kinds of auditor changes. The research is quantitative and regression analysis is utilized while analyzing the data. The data of this research covers information of US companies from 2008 to 2014 and it includes 30 626 firm-year observations. The effect of lowballing is assessed by examining the effect of auditor change on audit fee, and the similar analysis is performed while examining the lowballing within different auditor changes. The audit fee development is analyzed by comparing means of audit fees' natural logarithm. My findings indicate that there is a sign of lowballing in initial audit with a new auditor. However lowballing is also examined more thoroughly as the development of audit fees surrounding the auditor change is also investigated. Results indicate that for auditor switchers audit fees continue to grow from the initial engagement to the third year of engagement, and in the third year of the engagement the level of audit fees has exceeded the prior-change level of audit fees. The strongest effect of lowballing is found when companies switch from non-big 4 auditors to big 4 auditors...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{investigation}} of the UK audit market by the Competition Commission testifies to perennial regulatory concerns regarding increasing supplier concentration, big 4 dominance of large company audits and the capacity of mid-tier auditors to compete. Against this backdrop, this paper presents new evidence on whether there is competitive pricing for <b>initial</b> <b>audit</b> <b>engagements</b> by big 4 auditors relative to their next four largest mid-tier (mid 4) counterparts for the UK quoted and private corporate sectors. Based on data from FAME for 2007 and 2010, the evidence indicates that larger quoted companies switching between the big 4 benefit from substantial discounts, with smaller discounts attracted by clients switching to the mid 4. Coupled with evidence that fees for both audit and non-audit services recover in subsequent periods, and consistent with the theoretical framework, the paper concludes that big 4 discounting is a competitive outcome aimed at securing future economic rents. New evidence demonstrates that smaller clients switching to big 4 or mid 4 auditors do not benefit from low-balling...|$|R

40|$|With {{the current}} growth in {{awareness}} {{of the value of}} internal audit services, the increased demand from various stakeholders, and the scarcity of competent internal auditors, the profession needs a new mindset, particularly in respect of the execution of internal audit activities. Although risk-based internal auditing is a fairly new concept, its implementation could assist internal auditors to audit 'smarter', that is, more effectively and efficiently. However, it is unclear whether the current concept of a risk-based internal <b>audit</b> <b>engagement</b> is in line with modern business practices, such as enterprise-wide risk management principles. Furthermore, it is also uncertain whether internal auditors share a single set of risk management principles and concepts, and how (or even if) these {{should be included in the}} internal <b>audit</b> <b>engagement.</b> This article explores the common understanding of what the planning phase of a risk-based internal <b>audit</b> <b>engagement</b> should entail when based on risk management principles, and identifies the organisational elements that should be in place that would make it easier for internal auditors to implement such a risk-driven approach when conducting engagements. The research methodology involved a literature review and structured interviews with chief audit executives of risk-mature organisations. The findings support the existence of uncertainty among chief audit executives regarding the use of risk management principles when performing risk-based internal <b>audit</b> <b>engagements.</b> Chief <b>audit</b> executives also appeared uncertain how to apply these principles to the planning and execution of internal <b>audit</b> <b>engagements.</b> Gaps and shortcomings identified by the research should be addressed by the Institute of Internal Auditors through developing more comprehensive guidance for their members.

40|$|To compete {{effectively}} {{in an increasingly}} competitive audit market audit firms need information on {{the efficiency of the}} audit services they offer. This study reports on the cost and labor efficiency for a sample of 114 <b>audit</b> <b>engagements</b> conducted by one of the (then) Big 6 audit firms. Estimating the efficiency of <b>audit</b> <b>engagements</b> is a form of benchmarking, of which economics oriented research has seen many applications. The application to auditing however is, as far as we know, relatively new. To determine the cost and labor efficiency of the <b>audit</b> <b>engagements</b> we employ the statistical technique of stochastic frontier estimation. Using models from the well-known and established audit fee and audit production literature we find that for our sample audit services are produced in a cost and labor efficient manner.

40|$|Several {{previous}} {{studies have examined the}} impact of auditor switching on audit fees. The underpinning theory of these studies is that a potential new auditor will cut <b>initial</b> <b>audit</b> fees (low ball) in order to secure an audit, and the ensuing stream of audit fees including a quasi-rent component payable to any incumbent auditor. Empirical evidence of the presence of audit fee cutting subsequent to an auditor switch is mixed. The present study proposes an alternative theory which argues that a potential new auditor will low ball in order to secure an audit but that such fee cutting is conditional on non-audit services (NAS) growth between the year prior to the auditor change and {{the first year of the}} new <b>audit</b> <b>engagement.</b> That is, the audit fee cut will be recouped by revenue generated from the provision of auditor supplied non-audit services. The study is based on data from 270 publicly listed Australian companies taken at a time when NAS fees provided by incumbent auditors were rising. The empirical evidence shows that auditees who report an auditor change together with real growth in the fees for auditor supplied non-audit services, show a significantly lower audit fee than situations in which these two conditions do not exist together. A number of limitations are discussed, including generalizability to other time periods and markets...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} into the profitability of <b>audit</b> <b>engagements.</b> The study is motivated by the frequently expressed concern regarding the lack of competitiveness on the audit market, based on trends of increasing concentration of suppliers in this market. The argument is that increasing concentration facilitates collusion and monopoly behavior, allowing firms to raise price above cost. A direct test of this argument would be to test the effect of elements of market structure on the ratio between price and costs (i. e. profitability). Industrial organization and industrial economics research has seen studies on this issue for a multitude of industries, but not for the audit industry. Due to unavailability of data particularly on audit costs, audit market research has attempted investigate the competitiveness of the market mainly by examining audit fees and audit production data. The current study attempts to investigate directly whether higher market concentration allows firms to raise price above cost. Based on insights from the audit fee and production literature, the economics of industrial organization, and the relatively recent studies on local (rather than national) audit markets, a model for explaining <b>audit</b> <b>engagement</b> profitability is constructed. This model is tested empirically on a sample of 114 <b>audit</b> <b>engagements</b> conducted by one of the (then) Big 6 audit firms. The results show that the audit market structure differs across local audit markets, and that this local structure has a significant influence on <b>audit</b> <b>engagement</b> profitability. In addition, some factors that have shown to be important determinants in prior audit fee and production studies are also significant in this study’s profitability model. These relate to client risk and financial distress, the length {{of the relationship between the}} auditor and the client, and client complexity. The results for local audit market structure suggest that, as expected, higher market share in local markets allows the audit firm to raise price above cost. This can be interpreted as a sign of market power. However, some alternative explanations for the empirical results of the paper are also suggested. business administration and economics;...|$|R
