Most of the experiments were carried out over Amberlyst- 35. In addition,Amberlyst- 15 and Purolite CT- 275 were also tested. Chemical equilibrium of four chemical reactions was studied:ethyl tert-butyl ether formation, tert-amyl ethyl ether formation from <b>isoamylenes</b> (2 -methyl- 1 -butene and 2 -methyl- 2 -butene) and isomerization reaction between both <b>isoamylenes.</b> Equilibrium data were obtained in a batchwisestirred tank reactor operated at 2. 0 MPa and within the temperature range from 323 to 353 K. Experimental molarstandard enthalpy and entropy changes of reaction were determined for each reaction. From these data, the molarenthalpy change of formation of ethyl tert-butyl ether and tert-amyl ethyl ether were estimated. Besides, the chemical equilibrium between both diisobutene dimers, 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 1 -pentene and 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 2 -pentene, wasevaluated.

40|$|ABSTRACT. TAME was {{synthesized}} {{in liquid}} phase from refinery C 5 cut and methanol using Amberlyst 15 as catalyst. The C 5 stream contains mainly mono-olefins and, {{in a less}} amount, a diolefin, which have a high gum formation tendency. The main purpose {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of mono-hydrogenation of C 5 cut on TAME synthesis. The hydrogenation step was carried out at 80 oC and 10 kgf/cm 2 of H 2, using a 0. 3 % Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. It was observed that the diolefin was totally hydrogenated and olefins content was drastically reduced without any decrease of reactive <b>isoamylenes</b> content. The etherification was carried out in a 250 mL stirred batch reactor at temperatures ranging 50 - 90 oC, 10 kgf/cm 2, and molar ratio of <b>isoamylenes</b> to methanol close to 1. Reaction products were analyzed by GC. Total conversion was similar for original and mono-hydrogenated feeds. However, the products obtained with the original cut presented foul odor and color, even at lower temperatures, characteristic of gum formation in the products. On the other hand, the product obtained from the mono-hydrogenated cut presents no foul odor and color. Therefore, mono-hydrogenation of the C 5 cut is necessary to allow the addition of the produced TAME to gasoline blend...|$|R

The active ingredient in the French lilac is galegine or <b>isoamylene</b> guanidine.

40|$|Liquid-phase trimerization of 2 -methyl- 1 -butene and 2 -methyl- 2 -butene {{mixtures}} over solid acid catalysts {{was carried}} out in a batch-stirred tank reactor in the temperature range 333 − 373 K. Diisoamylenes and triisoamylenes were the main products. Cracking products among C 6 −C 9 and C 11 −C 14 were also obtained under the assayed conditions. The catalityc performance of five different acidic ion exchange resins (Amberlyst 15, Amberlyst 35, Amberlyst 70, Purolite CT- 252, Purolite CT- 276) and four zeolites (H-BEA- 25, H-FAU- 30, H-FAU- 6 and H-MOR- 20) was assessed. Experimental results showed that Amberlyst 15 and H-FAU- 30 were the best catalysts for <b>isoamylene</b> trimerization, with selectivities above 40 % at 373 K. The most influencing physical properties of the catalysts on the selectivity toward dimers and trimers were acid capacity, acid strength, and specific surface area for resins, and microporous surface area for zeolites. <b>Isoamylene</b> trimerization extent was larger at higher temperature. The most probable mechanism of formation of these compounds involves the reaction between one molecule of dimer with one molecule of isoamylenes, although trimers could also be formed directly from three molecules of isoamylenes...|$|E

Three reactions take place simultaneously in TAME synthesis: etherification of the two methylbutenes and their isomerisation. In order to study the equilibrium of the multiple reactions in TAME synthesis, the thermodynamic properties of the compounds in the liquid phase and equilibrium constants were calculated using a modified UNIFAC method to describe the nonideality of the system. Four parameters influencing the equilibrium conversion were derived and discussed in detail. Supplemental experiments were performed at three temperatures in the range from 303 to 343 K and at different initial molar ratios of educts. Equilibrium conversions of methanol were determined from these experiments and compared with calculated values. At 298 K the predicted activity based equilibrium constant was 22. 9 for TAME synthesis from 2 -methyl- 1 -butene and 1. 6 for TAME synthesis from 2 -methyl- 2 -butene; for isomerisation of 2 -methyl- 1 -butene to 2 -methyl- 2 -butene a value of 14. 3 was obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{method of}} {{power-efficient}} two-stage dehydrogenation of isopentane to isoprene considered {{in this study}} comprises {{the production of a}} mixture of <b>isoamylene</b> at the first stage, further dehydrogenation of which occurs with a smaller endothermal effect. The effectiveness of the proposed method for energy saving is calculated. This result is achieved by using chrome-alumina catalyst, which makes it possible to increase the fraction of-isoamylene in the mixture of isoamylenes. This catalyst is prepared using superhigh-frequency microwave energy. Microwaves were used at the stages of affixing active components to an alumina support and catalyst drying.

40|$|Bacterial {{degradation}} pathways of fuel oxygenates such as methyl tert-butyl and tert-amyl {{methyl ether}} (MTBE and TAME, respectively) have already been studied in some detail. However, many of the involved enzymes are still unknown, and possible side reactions {{have not yet been}} considered. In Aquincola tertiaricarbonis L 108, Methylibium petroleiphilum PM 1, and Methylibium sp. strain R 8, we have now detected volatile hydrocarbons as by-products of the degradation of the tert-alkyl ether metabolites tert-butyl and tert-amyl alcohol (TBA and TAA, respectively). The alkene isobutene was formed only during TBA catabolism, while the beta and gamma isomers of <b>isoamylene</b> were produced only during TAA conversion. Both tert-alkyl alcohol degradation and alkene production were strictly oxygen dependent. However, the relative contribution of the dehydration reaction to total alcohol conversion increased with decreasing oxygen concentrations. In resting-cell experiments where the headspace oxygen content was adjusted to less than 2 %, more than 50 % of the TAA was converted to <b>isoamylene.</b> Isobutene formation from TBA was about 20 -fold lower, reaching up to 4 % alcohol turnover at low oxygen concentrations. It is likely that the putative tert-alkyl alcohol monooxygenase MdpJ, belonging to the Rieske nonheme mononuclear iron enzymes and found in all three strains tested, or an associated enzymatic step catalyzed the unusual elimination reaction. This was also supported by the detection of mdpJK genes in MTBE-degrading and isobutene-emitting enrichment cultures obtained from two treatment ponds operating at Leuna, Germany. The possible use of alkene formation as an easy-to-measure indicator of aerobic fuel oxygenate biodegradation in contaminated aquifers is discussed...|$|E

Isothermal experimental runs were carried out in a stirred tank batch reactor in the temperature range 323 - 353 K at 2. 0 MPa, starting from different initial concentrations.

Mathematical fitting {{of a series of}} systematically originated models, model selection, and model averaging procedures were applied to find the best model and to draw conclusions about the reaction mechanism.

This is because ethers enhance gasoline properties, such as octane rating. Ethers result essential to fulfil current environmental legislation, especially in more developed countries. For this reason etherification reactions have today an increasing interest for petrochemical industry. The simultaneous liquid-phase production of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) and tertamyl ethyl ether (TAEE) is the reaction system studied in the present work. These ethers are usually formed from ethanol (as common reactant) and isobutene (IB) for ETBE and <b>isoamylenes</b> (IA) for TAEE. These olefins {{are part of the}} C 4 and C 5 cuts from Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) or Stream Cracking units (SC). Usual impurities from these cuts are basic compounds such as acetonitrile (ACN) and amines. ACN is present in very low concentration but even at such low concentrations is the main cause of acid catalyst deactivation. Diffuse deactivation, means of acid sites neutralization, {{is one of the most}} important drawbacks that affect the catalyst lifespan of industrial reactors. For the mentioned causes, it is therefore interesting to study the effect of the presence of ACN in the reactant streams on the catalysts used for etherification reactions.

40|$|A {{screening}} of macroreticular {{ion exchange resins}} {{has been carried out}} in order to select the most suitable catalysts for liquid-phase oligomerization of an <b>isoamylene</b> mixture. The reaction was performed at mild temperature (343 K) to promote the dimerization and trimerization, and at higher temperature (383 K) to evaluate side reactions like cracking and copolymerization. No compounds higher than trimers were significantly detected at studied conditions. By plotting product yields versus conversion at 343 K, it was showed no significant differences between all catalysts tested. However, at 383 K, the ion exchange resins which mainly work in the external zone were more selective to dimerization and less to cracking and trimerization products, which suggests that trimerization and cracking mainly took place inside the gel-phase of the macroreticular resins. The most active catalysts were the oversulfonated resins with high cross-linking degree and high acid capacity.

Furthermore, the drive towards sustainability and the emergent contribution of biorefineries for the manufacture of intermediate and platform chemicals envisages olefins produced from biomass derived alcohols as an important feedstock for subsequent oligomerization. Over the last years much work has been published on the catalytic oligomerization of propene, butene, isobutene and <b>isoamylene</b> over cation exchange resins, such as Amberlyst and Purolite, and others like Nafion. For instance, isobutene dimers and trimers are accepted additives for gasoline (octane booster) and diesel (cetane booster) while isobutene higher oligomers can be a source for heavier fuels and synthetic lube oils.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{and free}} energy calculations {{have been used}} to examine in detail the mechanism by which a receptor molecule (the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin) recognizes and binds to a target molecule (lipid II) embedded within a membrane environment. The simulations show that the direct interaction of vancomycin with lipid II, as opposed to initial binding to the membrane, leads most readily to the formation of a stable complex. The recognition of lipid II by vancomycin occurred via the N-terminal amine group of vancomycin and the C-terminal carboxyl group of lipid II. Despite lying at the membrane-water interface, the interaction of vancomycin with lipid II was found to be essentially identical to that of soluble tripeptide analogs of lipid II (Ac-d-Ala-d-Ala; root mean-square deviation 0. 11 nm). Free energy calculations also suggest that the relative binding affinity of vancomycin for native, resistant, and synthetic forms of membrane-bound lipid II was unaffected by the membrane environment. The effect of the dimerization of vancomycin on the binding of lipid II, the position of lipid II within a biological membrane, and the effect of the <b>isoamylene</b> tail of lipid II on membrane fluidity have also been examined...|$|E
