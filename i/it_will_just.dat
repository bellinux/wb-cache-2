5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
500|$|Ferraro {{explained}} that his original idea {{had been to}} release the sixteen compositions on Far Side Virtual {{as a set of}} downloadable ringtones, but wanted the songs to have the impact of a complete album; he felt that few would want to purchase the music as a set of ringtones. Ferraro said, [...] "Hopefully these songs [...] made available for ringtone and the album will be condensed into ringtone format so the album won't be the centerpiece, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> dissipate into the infrastructure. The record is just the contained gallery space of these ringtone compositions." [...] Ferraro said that listeners using the songs from Far Side Virtual as ringtones was the realization of Far Side Virtual as [...] "a performance art installation".|$|E
500|$|... "It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] was {{regarded}} by reviewers {{as the best}} segment in the episode. Canning wrote, [...] "this segment may not be all that gory, but it's funny and, quite honestly, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> make you feel good", and Bentley described it as [...] "a dead-on comedy assault of the Charlie Brown animated Halloween special." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concurred, writing that it [...] "succeeds because it offers sly cultural commentary." [...] Show Patrol wrote [...] "The nostalgia factor makes “Grand Pumpkin” {{the best of these}} amusing bits for me, but they all lack that trademark “Simpsons” brand of satirical smartness." [...] Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel gave the episode a 4/5 and called the final segment a [...] "witty parody of Charlie Brown's Halloween classic. [...] The best gag, though, is a subtle one. Marge plays a trombone, a loving salute to the way the Peanuts specials portrayed adult voices." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kapuściński's pronouncements {{on current}} affairs were noteworthy: {{he thought that}} the causes of the 9/11 tragedy, for example, were too complex to lend {{themselves}} to an exhaustively thorough analysis at present, although he offered an extensive and sophisticated exposition of some of the key elements of the puzzle in the Clash of Civilisations. He was critical on the Clash of Civilisations theory which he saw as an American vision of the world. He told a BBC interviewer right after the attacks: [...] "I greatly fear that we will waste this moment. That instead of meaningful dialogue, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> be gates and metal detectors".|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy Cauty said {{of it in}} December 1990: [...] "The 'Black Room' album {{will all}} be this kind of electro turbo metal. It's not really {{industrial}} like, say, Throbbing Gristle, because it's coming from house and has an uplifting vibe about it. But it's so heavy <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> pin you to the floor." [...] Bill Drummond said of it in 1991: [...] "It's the complete yang to the yin of The White Room. It'll be very very dense, very very hardcore. No sort of 'up' choruses or anthems. I think it's going to be techno-metal, I think that's gonna be the sound. Techno-metal. Which'll be... a cross between techno and heavy metal. Megadeth with drum machines." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 29 July the Gold Coast Football Club {{announced}} {{the signing of}} professional Rugby League player Karmichael Hunt. The three-year contract would begin in May 2010 when Hunt completed his prior commitments to play Rugby Union in France. The local media was quick to label the signing a publicity stunt with most media outlets tipping Hunt {{to return to the}} NRL before his contract expired. Hunt completed his last game for the Broncos in a preliminary final loss to the Melbourne Storm at Etihad Stadium. [...] "It's a bit of a sad moment for me but I will still be playing football in the future, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> be a different code." [...] Hunt said after the game. He then traveled to France to play Rugby Union for Biarritz Olympique in the Top 14 competition.|$|E
2500|$|Oral residue rarely disappears {{quickly and}} never vanishes completely. [...] Speech is {{inherently}} an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts. [...] Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly {{shown in the}} arguments of Socrates against writing in Plato’s Phaedrus. [...] Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman. [...] It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the human mind into mere objects in the physical world. [...] By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what {{they are able to}} think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory. [...] True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds. [...] And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> keep saying {{the same thing over and}} over again, no matter how often it is refuted.|$|E
2500|$|The Facebook {{group had}} {{supporters}} including Dutch politician Geert Wilders, former Dutch politician and feminist activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali. An Islamic student association based in Lahore, Pakistan, handed out pamphlets requesting individuals to boycott Facebook; the pamphlet stated: [...] "The west is conspiring against the honour {{of the prophet}} and of Muslims. The real purpose {{of freedom of speech}} is to provoke the sentiments of Muslims." [...] A representative of the Karachi-based Internet company Creative Chaos named Shakir Husain told The Guardian that a ban of Facebook would not be easy to carry out due to the ability to circumvent it using tactics such as proxy servers. Husain noted, [...] "By banning this web page, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> make people more curious. It's pouring petrol on a small fire that could become a lot bigger. You can't police the Internet. The Saudis have tried it, as have other governments, and all have failed. It's a waste of state money." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better. Going through rehab, honestly, did help... it got me away from just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them and you know, they give you such a simple message that any idiot can get and it's just over and over, {{but the bottom line is}} really, and this is the part that is scary for everyone, the individual kinda has to want it... not kinda, you have to want it and to not do that crap anymore or you will never stop and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>just</b> kill you. There’s nothing you can do...if your best friend has a problem and it's very serious, there's nothing you're going to be able to do about it and it was sad for me and the people around me.
