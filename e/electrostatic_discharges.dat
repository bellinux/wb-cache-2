2500|$|The author Renato Vesco {{revived the}} wartime {{theory that the}} foo fighters were a Nazi secret weapon in his work Intercept UFO, reprinted in a revised English edition as Man-Made UFOs: 50 Years Of Suppression in 1994. Vesco claims that the foo fighters were in fact a form of ground-launched, {{automatically}} guided, jet-propelled flak mine called the Feuerball (Fireball). This device, supposedly operated by special SS units, [...] resembled a tortoise shell in shape, and it flew by means of gas jets that spun like a Catherine wheel around the fuselage. Miniature klystron tubes inside the device, {{in combination with the}} gas jets, created the characteristic glowing spheroid appearance of the foo fighters. A crude form of collision avoidance radar ensured the craft would not crash into another airborne object, and an onboard sensor mechanism would even instruct the machine to depart swiftly if it was fired upon. The purpose of the Feuerball, according to Vesco, was twofold. The appearance of this weird device inside a bomber stream would (and indeed did) have a distracting and disruptive effect on the bomber pilots. Also, Vesco alleges that the devices were also intended to have an [...] "offensive" [...] capability. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> from the klystron tubes would, he stated, interfere with the ignition systems of the engines of the bombers, causing the planes to crash. Although there is no hard evidence to support the reality of the Feuerball drone, this theory has been taken up by other aviation/ufology authors, and it has even been cited by some as the most likely explanation for the phenomena -- in at least one recent TV [...] "documentary" [...] on Nazi Secret Weapons.|$|E

50|$|A spark is {{triggered}} {{when the}} electric field strength exceeds approximately 4-30 kV/cm — the dielectric field strength of air. This may cause a very {{rapid increase in}} the number of free electrons and ions in the air, temporarily causing the air to abruptly become an electrical conductor in a process called dielectric breakdown.Perhaps the best known example of a natural spark is lightning. In this case the electric potential between a cloud and ground, or between two clouds, is typically hundreds of millions of volts. The resulting current that cycles through the stroke channel causes an enormous transfer of energy. On a much smaller scale, sparks can form in air during <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges</b> from charged objects that are charged to as little as 380 V (Paschen's law).|$|E

50|$|A Faraday cage or Faraday shield is an {{enclosure}} used {{to block}} electromagnetic fields. A Faraday shield may be formed by a continuous covering of conductive material {{or in the}} case of a Faraday cage, by a mesh of such materials. Faraday cages are named after the English scientist Michael Faraday, who invented them in 1836.A Faraday cage operates because an external electrical field causes the electric charges within the cage's conducting material to be distributed such that they cancel the field's effect in the cage's interior. This phenomenon is used to protect sensitive electronic equipment from external radio frequency interference (RFI). Faraday cages are also used to enclose devices that produce RFI, such as radio transmitters, to prevent their radio waves from interfering with other nearby equipment. They are also used to protect people and equipment against actual electric currents such as lightning strikes and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>discharges,</b> since the enclosing cage conducts current around the outside of the enclosed space and none passes through the interior.|$|E
