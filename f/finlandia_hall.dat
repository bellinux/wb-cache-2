2500|$|Finnish architects, {{primarily}} Alvar Aalto, {{have had}} a significant influence outside Finland. Distinguished Portuguese architect Álvaro Siza Vieira, British architect Colin St John Wilson and American architects Richard Meier, Robert Venturi and Steven Holl have each expressed the influence of Aalto on their work. Indeed, Holl has had the opportunity on two occasions to build next to Aalto buildings, with his competition-winning entry for the Helsinki Museum of Contemporary Art, named after his entry titled Kiasma (1993–98), built close to Aalto's <b>Finlandia</b> <b>Hall,</b> and Simmons Hall at MIT (2002) in Cambridge, USA, built opposite Aalto's Baker House (1947–49). But before Aalto, the first significant event in direct influence was Eliel Saarinen emigrating to the USA in 1923 - after having received second prize in the Chicago Tribune Tower competition of 1922 - where {{he was responsible for}} the design of the campus for the Cranbrook Academy of Art, Michigan. Often dubbed as the [...] "Architect of the American Century", Eero Saarinen (1910–61), although born in Finland, the son of Eliel Saarinen, was raised and educated mostly in the United States, and created significant pieces of architecture throughout the United States, from the TWA Flight Center at New York's Kennedy Airport to the Gateway Arch over St. Louis - the style of each building varying considerably depending on the context and design brief. With his popularity, Saarinen was able to influence the choice of architecture in line with his own, as he did in the selection of Jorn Utzon's entry for the competition for the Sydney Opera House, Australia, {{as well as in the}} selection of Finnish architect Viljo Revell's entry for the competition for Toronto City Hall, Canada (1958–65). Another Finnish architect to find creative success after emigrating was Cyril Mardall (born Cyril Sjöström, son of notable architect Einar Sjöström); he emigrated to England and in 1944 went into partnership with F. R. S. Yorke and Czech emigre Eugene Rosenberg to form the architectural firm Yorke Rosenberg Mardall, better known as YRM. A specialist in prefabricated timber houses, learnt from Finland, among Mardall's notable works are housing for Stevenage and Harlow new towns, as well as the Finnish Lutheran Missionary Church in London (1958).|$|E
50|$|<b>Finlandia</b> <b>Hall</b> {{features}} an optical illusion: the National Museum {{building on the}} other side of the street seems to rise from the edge of the <b>Finlandia</b> <b>Hall</b> tower. The effect is created by a black trapezium on the white marble surface of the <b>Finlandia</b> <b>Hall</b> tower. The trapezium has been measured to fit the rising tower of the National Museum when the <b>Finlandia</b> <b>Hall</b> is viewed from the eastern shore of the Töölönlahti Bay. Aalto liked to create optical illusions. Another example of this can be found on the pedestrian path behind the library building of the Helsinki University of Technology (current Aalto University) in Espoo.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} {{design of the}} building {{is a tribute to}} detail. The design of each lamp, piece of furniture, panel, flooring material and decorative board reflects the mature approach resulting from Aalto’s long career as an architect. All the materials speak the language of nature, simply without technically artificial tones. This is because Aalto’s basic view was that architecture should create a frame for human beings. In the <b>Finlandia</b> <b>Hall,</b> the focus is not on extraordinary forms or ostentatious interior. It is on the audience and on the performers. According to Aalto, the audience at the <b>Finlandia</b> <b>Hall</b> need not dress up like people used to in the opera foyers and gilded concert halls of the old days. What people wear should be as genuine and natural as the environment in the building.|$|E
50|$|The {{inauguration of}} the <b>Finlandia</b> <b>Hall</b> was celebrated on 2 December 1971.
