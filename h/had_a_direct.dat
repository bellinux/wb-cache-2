5|$|Before being {{upgraded}} to a freeway between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road, SR905 <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> connection with SR 125 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. When that {{segment of the}} SR905 freeway was opened in 2010, the interchange with SR125 had initially been omitted, forcing traffic on SR905 and SR125 to exit their respective freeways and use Otay Mesa Road (which continues to parallel SR905) to make the connection. To help fix this problem, ramps from SR905 in both directions and SR11 westbound to SR125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, {{at a cost of}} over $21 million. Southbound traffic on SR125 must currently still exit to Otay Mesa Road at that toll road's south end in order to connect to SR905, but the southbound ramps are scheduled to begin construction in 2018.|$|E

Bardas's own position was further weakened in early 866, when Michael learned that Eudokia Ingerina was pregnant with the future Leo VI: hitherto Bardas stood to succeed to the throne if anything should happen to the emperor, but now Michael <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> heir. Instead of divorcing his wife and marrying his long-time mistress, however, Michael married off Ingerina to Basil instead, who divorced his own wife first. In spring of the same year, Bardas began assembling a large-scale expedition against the Saracen stronghold of Crete. Accompanied by Michael, Basil and the court, Bardas made for Miletus, where the army was assembling. There, on 21 April 866, he was murdered by Basil, ostensibly for plotting against the emperor.|$|E

5|$|On July 5, 2009, the G {{was once}} again {{extended}} south at all times to Church Avenue. This was required for overhaul of the Culver Viaduct, which caused the express tracks at Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue/Ninth Street—used to switch G trains between tracks after they terminated at Smith–Ninth Streets—to be temporarily taken out of service. This had several benefits. First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed to only one storage track at Smith–9th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having {{to wait in the}} station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith–Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn.|$|E

SR11 is planned to be a toll facility that will serve a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa. Ramps from SR 11 westbound and eastbound to SR 125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, at a cost of over $21 million.|$|E
5|$|Starship Troopers <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> {{influence}} on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley's 1984 novel Armor was, {{according to the}} author, born out of frustration with {{the small amount of}} actual combat in Starship Troopers and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The 1988 Gainax OVA series Gunbuster has plot elements similar to Heinlein's novel, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in Ender's Game to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states that the story of Ender Wiggin takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.|$|E

When Kuchlug besieged Almaliq, a city belonging to the Karluks, vassals of the Mongol Empire, Genghis Khan dispatched a force under command of Jebe to pursue Kuchlug. After his force of 30,000 was defeated by Jebe at the Khitan capital Balasagun, Kuchlug faced rebellions over his unpopular rule, forcing him to flee to modern Afghanistan, where he was captured by hunters in 1218. The hunters turned Kuchlug over to the Mongols, who beheaded him.

In 1968, the 102d was moved to Otis, where it continued its regular patrols until 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism.

His political theology in particular shaped the Elizabethan religious settlement and his authority was constantly invoked in the controversies of this period.|$|E
5|$|While {{people have}} used canning and {{artificial}} refrigeration to preserve {{food for the}} last hundred years or so, salt has been the best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years. A very ancient salt-works operation has been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamț County, Romania. Evidence indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of briquetage to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC. The salt extracted from this operation may have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> correlation to the rapid growth of this society's population soon after its initial production began.

5|$|The Second Symphony, and Livre pour orchestre and the Cello Concerto which followed, were {{composed}} during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His {{mother died in}} 1967, and in 1967–70 {{there was a great}} deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production Dziady, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the Cello Concerto of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the Cello Concerto was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades.
