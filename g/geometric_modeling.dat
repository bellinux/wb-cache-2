40|$|This paper {{presents}} a relational <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> for variational geometry. A geometric object in a relational <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> is represented {{based on its}} geometric relationship to other geometric objects and is unilaterally dependent on these objects. Through the unilateral dependency among the geometric objects local dimensional changes can be propagated to the whole model easily so that {{the consistency of the}} <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> is maintained. A new concept called late constraint is introduced to deal with the situation of cyclic dependency among the geometric objects. By using late constraints the number of constraint equations which have to be solved simultaneously can be reduced to a minimum by the user.

40|$|This master's thesis {{describes}} an experimental process of recreating <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> from images. This process is thoroughly described using functionality already {{present in the}} <b>geometric</b> <b>modelling</b> tool GeoMod and functionality added in this master's thesis. Some functionality is not yet implemented, but this is described with suggestions on implementation for further students. The framework described allows students to experiment with different algorithms that automatically recreates <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> from images. The implementation of dynamic linking of views and tools have been finished, and examples are shown. Libraries containing implementations of the BinPic-algorithm, OpenCV and OpenGL have been developed. The BinPic-algorithm creates binary <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> of images that can be shown in the current view. OpenCV is an image-processing library {{that can be used}} to create better binary images than the ones created automatically using Qt-functions. OpenGL allows for the visualization of <b>geometric</b> <b>models.</b> This is similar to the camera-view already implemented in GeoMod, but it provides features like z-buffering, adding light sources, adding different colors inside and outside models and adding images as texture to <b>geometric</b> <b>models.</b> These libraries are used in the development of the framework for recreating models from images...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{navigating}} in <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> and enrich them with additional information. This enables us to adapt <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> to different purposes and thus to reuse them. We offer dedicated views for the structure and context information {{as well as for}} the <b>geometric</b> <b>model,</b> develop strategies to navigate in them and focus on the tight coupling between manipulations in these views. This coupling means that information in one view is emphasized in another view and requires an analysis of visibility and recognizability of information. Our system, which we refer to as the ZOOM STRUCTOR makes it possible to enrich a <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> with context information and to modify the structure of a <b>geometric</b> <b>model.</b> To cope with the navigation problems arising in the exploration of large models, we apply Fisheye techniques.

40|$|<b>Geometric</b> <b>model</b> fitting is a {{fundamental}} task in computer graphics and computer vision. However, most <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> fitting methods are unable to fit an arbitrary <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> (e. g. a surface with holes) to incomplete data, due to that the similarity metrics used in these methods are unable to measure the rigid partial similarity between arbitrary models. This paper hence proposes a novel rigid geometric similarity metric, which is able to measure both the full similarity and the partial similarity between arbitrary <b>geometric</b> <b>models.</b> The proposed metric enables us to perform partial procedural <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> fitting (PPGMF). The task of PPGMF is to search a procedural <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> space for the model rigidly similar to a query of non-complete point set. Models in the procedural model space are generated according {{to a set of}} parametric modeling rules. A typical query is a point cloud. PPGMF is very useful as {{it can be used to}} fit arbitrary <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> to non-complete (incomplete, over-complete or hybrid-complete) point cloud data. For example, most laser scanning data is non-complete due to occlusion. Our PPGMF method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to optimize the proposed similarity metric over the model space. To accelerate the optimization process, the method also employs a novel coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to reject dissimilar models in advance. Our method has been demonstrated on a variety of <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> and non-complete data. Experimental results show that the PPGMF method based on the proposed metric is able to fit non-complete data, while the method based on other metrics is unable. It is also shown that our method can be accelerated by several times via early rejection...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a prototype system, SketchingMetal, that enables individuals with no manufacturing expertise to quickly design a restricted domain of precise, manufacturable, three-dimensional <b>geometric</b> <b>models.</b> Unlike previous systems that generate plastic prototypes from more general <b>geometric</b> <b>models,</b> models created with SketchingMetal can be manufactured automatically as functional machined metal parts without {{the intervention of}} a manufacturing expert. To support automatic manufacturing and rapid, precise geometric design, SketchingMetal demonstrates {{the effectiveness of a}} gestural user interface in a real 3 D solid modeling applicatation and also {{introduces a}} technique for incrementally translating a restricted set of 3 D <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> to fully-specified machinable feature-based models. SketchingMetal's user interface infers from user gestures both low-level 2 D and 3 D geometric primitives and also geometric constraints between primitives. In addition, SketchingMetal's user interface (UI) presents a drag-and-drop spreadsheet paradigm for establishing precise numerical relationships between dimensions of the <b>geometric</b> <b>model.</b> As <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> are interactively refined through this UI, SketchingMetal incrementally updates a second representation of the model composed of mechanical features.
