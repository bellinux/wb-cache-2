5|$|Glacier National Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last <b>ice</b> <b>age.</b> These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} U-shaped valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers {{from the base of the}} highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various warming and cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the Little <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the Little <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to nowhere near as great an extent as they had during the <b>Ice</b> <b>Age.</b>|$|E
5|$|During an <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> glaciers {{pressed against}} Nescopeck Mountain and {{eventually}} moved over it, carrying gravel from the Susquehanna River. The ridge {{was near the}} southern edge of the most recent period of glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{believe that}} Glacier Bay existed during {{a minimum of}} four Glacial periods ending with the Little <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> which has a 4,000-year-old record, as the latest period. All glaciers in the park today {{are said to be}} {{remnants}} of this glacial period.|$|E

40|$|It is not {{possible}} to understand the present or future climate unless scientists can account for the enormous and rapid cycles of glaciation that have taken place over the last million years, and which are expected to continue into the future. A great deal has happened in the theory of the <b>ice</b> <b>ages</b> over the last decade, and it is now widely accepted that <b>ice</b> <b>ages</b> are driven by changes in the Earth's orbit. The study of <b>ice</b> <b>ages</b> is very inter-disciplinary, covering geology, physics, glaciology, oceanography, atmospheric science, planetary orbit calculations astrophysics and statistics...|$|R

5|$|Retreat of the Little <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> glaciers {{was slow}} until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between {{the height of}} the Little <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost about one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{formations}} in {{the ridge}} include the Lower Helderberg Formation, the Onondaga Formation, the Spechty Kopf Formation, the Trimmers Rock Formation, and the Mauch Chunk Formation. In {{the most recent}} <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> it was affected by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the last}} <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> small populations of arctic-alpine plants have survived in {{favourable}} spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves. Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly, the mountain ringlet, also live on and around Helvellyn.|$|E
50|$|Eruptive {{activity}} at Quetrupillán commenced before the <b>ice</b> <b>ages.</b> The {{first phase of}} activity involved the formation of calderas and stratovolcanoes; later during the <b>ice</b> <b>ages</b> lava flows and ignimbrites were emplaced. Finally, the present stratovolcano with its caldera was emplaced {{towards the end of}} glaciation; parasitic vents formed even later.|$|R

50|$|When {{there was}} much {{continental}} crust near the poles, the rock record shows unusually low sea levels during <b>ice</b> <b>ages,</b> because {{there was much}} polar land mass on which snow and ice could accumulate. During times when the land masses clustered around the equator, <b>ice</b> <b>ages</b> had much less effect on sea level.|$|R
5|$|The Little <b>Ice</b> <b>Age</b> caused crop {{failures}} and famines in Europe. The 1690s saw the worst famine in France since the Middle Ages. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696–1697, during which {{about one-third of}} the Finnish population died.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} formed during the retreat of the glaciers {{during the last}} <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> which {{produced}} areas of marshland, notably the Sifton Bog (which is actually a fen), {{as well as some}} of the most agriculturally productive areas of farmland in Ontario.|$|E

5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the Pleistocene, although the glacial history is poorly known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum. During the early Holocene, glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight expansion is noted during the Little <b>Ice</b> <b>Age.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the last}} <b>ice</b> <b>age</b> only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests {{they came from}} {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E

5|$|For example, in the 17th century, {{the solar}} cycle {{appeared}} to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum.

Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.|$|E
