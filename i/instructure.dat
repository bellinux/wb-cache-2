40|$|Fracture {{mechanics}} {{provides an}} engineering framework {{for assessing the}} consequences of defects <b>instructures.</b> In linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), stress intensity factors KI, KII and KIII are usedfor characterizing the stress singularity at the crack tip, which arises from the theory of linear elasticity. Crack growth is assumed to occur when KI exceeds the fracture toughness KC. LEFM can be usefulfor brittle materials, or when {{the size of the}} plastic zone is small compared to global dimensions. In non-linear fracture mechanics (EPFM), an energy based criterion is used for assessing the risk forcrack growth: if the energy release rate at the crack tip exceeds what is required for creating newsurfaces in the material, crack growth will occur. Under certain assumptions the energy release rate atthe crack tip can be calculated by a path independent integral, the so-called J-integral. In modernFE-based fracture mechanics applied to practical design, the structure under consideration ismodelled, including cracks at specific locations, and the J-integral values are computed and used asdesign criteria. From a numerics viewpoint, the J-integral has many appealing properties: it can beevaluated from the far-field solution, which reduces numerical errors that may arise close to the cracktip, and the expected path-independence can to some extent be used as a quick check on solutionvalidity. Evaluation of the J-integral from LS-DYNA simulation results has been implemented as a postprocessingtool in LS-PrePost, including consistent treatment of residual stresses. The implementationcovers both 2 D (plane stress / plane strain) and 3 D applications, using the virtual crack-tip extension(VCE) method.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this work}} is to obtain the {{contemporary}} gradient materials based on the tungsten carbidereinforced high-speed steel using the conventional powder metallurgy method and increasing the high-steelhardness (80 HRA = 800 HV) by introducing the tungsten carbide as the reinforcing phase, with hardnessexceeding 2200 HV. Design/methodology/approach: The materials were fabricated with the conventional powder metallurgymethod consisting in compacting the powder in the closed die and finally sintering it. Forming methods weredeveloped for powders of the HS 6 - 5 - 2 high-speed steel and WC, {{making it possible to}} obtain material withseven layers in the structure. Findings: It was found out basing on the microhardness tests that hardness of test pieces grows along withthe sintering temperature and with WC content in the interface layers and in the high-speed steel ones. It wasalso observed that porosity decreases along with the WC concentration increase in these layers. It was foundout, basing on the comparison of structures and properties of the compacted and sintered test pieces, that <b>instructures</b> of all examined test pieces in the sintered state fine carbides occurred distributed homogeneously inthe high-speed steel layer. Research limitations/implications: It was noticed, that increase of the sintering temperature results in theuncontrolled growth and coagulation of the primary carbides and melting up to forming of eutectics in layersconsisting of the high-speed steel. Practical implications: Material presented in this paper has layers consisting on one side from the mix of thehigh-speed steel and WC, {{and on the other side}} the high-speed steel, characteristic of the high ductility. Suchmaterial is tested for milling cutters. Originality/value: The layers were poured in such way that the surface layer consists of the mix of the highspeedsteel and WC, and the middle one from the high-speed steel.

40|$|International audienceWe study wavefield {{effects of}} direct P- and S -waves in elastic and {{isotropic}} 3 -D seismicstructures {{derived from the}} temperature field of a high-resolution mantle circulation model. More specifically, we quantify the dispersion of traveltime residuals caused by diffraction <b>instructures</b> with dynamically constrained length scales and magnitudes of the lateral variationsin seismic velocities and density. 3 -D global wave propagation is simulated using a spectralelement method. Intrinsic attenuation (i. e. dissipation of seismic energy) is deliberatelyneglected, so that any variation of traveltimes with frequency {{can be attributed to}} structuraleffects. Traveltime residuals are measured at 15, 22. 5, 34 and 51 s dominant periods by cross-correlation of 3 -D and 1 -D synthetic waveforms. Additional simulations are performed for amodel in which 3 -D structure is removed in the upper 800 km to isolate the dispersion signal ofthe lower mantle. We find that the structural length scales inherent to a vigorously convectingmantle give rise to significant diffraction-induced body-wave traveltime dispersion. For both P- and S-waves, the difference between long-period and short-period residuals for a givensource–receiver pair can reach up to several seconds for the period bands considered here. Ingeneral, these ‘differential-frequency’ residuals tend to increase in magnitude with increasingshort-period delay. Furthermore, the long-period signal typically is smaller in magnitude thanthe short-period one; that is, wave-front healing is efficient independent of the sign of theresiduals. Unlike the single-frequency residuals, the differential-frequency residuals are sur-prisingly similar between the ‘lower-mantle’ and the ‘whole-mantle’ model for correspondingsource–receiver pairs. The similarity is more pronounced in case of S -waves and varies betweendifferent combinations of period bands. The traveltime delay acquired in the upper mantleseems to cancel in these differential signals depending on the associated wavelengths andthe length scales of structure at shallow depth. Differential-frequency residuals may thus proveuseful to precondition tomographic inversions for the lower-mantle structure such as to reducethe influence of the upper mantle for certain length scales. Overall, standard deviations of thediffraction-induced traveltime dispersion between the longest (51 s) and the shortest (15 s) period considered here are 0. 6 and 1. 0 s for P - and S -waves, respectively. For comparison, thecorresponding standard deviations of the 15 s residuals are 1. 0 s and 2. 8 s. In the lower-mantlemodel, standard deviations are 0. 3 and 0. 6 s, respectively, which gives an average lower-mantlecontribution to the total dispersion of 50 per cent for P -waves and 60 per cent for S -waves...|$|R
