However, the weekend {{got off to a}} bad start as Rubens Barrichello had a major crash during {{practice}} and was knocked unconscious. Coming too fast into Variante Bassa, his car was launched into the air by the kerb. Less than a yard from that kerb was a tyre wall, which almost instantly stopped the car's forward motion. His car was flipped over and landed upside down. Barrichello had swallowed <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> his life was only saved by quick action from the medical team. He would be back at the circuit on the Saturday afternoon with a fractured nose, bandaged arm and cut lip. Barrichello has never been able to recall anything from the incident.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in Africa, an Eastern monk named Maximus the Confessor {{carried on}} a furious {{campaign}} against Monothelitism, and in 646 he convinced the African councils {{to draw up a}} manifesto against the doctrine. This they forwarded to the new pope Theodore I, who in turn wrote to Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople, outlining the heretical nature of the doctrine. Paul, a devoted Monothelite, replied in a letter directing the Pope to adhere to the doctrine of one will. Theodore in turn excommunicated the Patriarch in 649, declaring him a heretic, after Paul, in 647 or 648, had issued in the name of Emperor Constans II an edict known as the Typos, which banned any mention of either one or two activities or wills in Christ. The Typos, instead of defusing the situation, made it worse by implying that either doctrine was as good as the other. Theodore planned the Lateran Council of 649 but died before he could convene it, which his successor, Pope Martin I, did. The Council condemned the Ecthesis and the Typos, and Pope Martin wrote to Constans, informing the emperor of its conclusions and requiring him to condemn both the Monothelite doctrine and his own Typos. Constans responded by having Pope Martin abducted to Constantinople, where he was tried and condemned to banishment and {{died as a result of}} the torture to which he had been subjected. Maximus also was tried and banished after having <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> his hand cut off.|$|E
500|$|Accounts {{at the end}} of the 20th century {{focused on}} the effects of Smart's confinement. Clement Hawes, {{following}} Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an animality' of madness", believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the [...] "medical stigmatization" [...] he felt at the hands of his fellow man. Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was [...] "a bestializing process and had taught him to hold <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> sit out his time as quietly as possible." [...] Contrary to the bestialisation, Allan Ingram argued that Jubilate Agno was [...] "a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable. The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human, but mad language could be even more disturbing." ...|$|E
500|$|Babayane and Mshete {{had arrived}} back in Bulawayo in August, {{accompanied}} by Maund, and Lobengula had immediately written again to Whitehall, reaffirming that [...] "If the Queen hears that I have given away the whole country, {{it is not}} so." [...] But this letter only reached the Colonial Office in London in late October, too late to make a difference. Meanwhile, the British appointed an official resident in Bulawayo, as Lobengula had requested; much to the king's indignation, it was Moffat. Maund counselled Lobengula that the concession was legal beyond doubt {{and that he would}} just have to accept it. Lobengula rued the situation to Helm: [...] "Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then another. At last, when well within reach, he darts out <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> the fly disappears. England is the chameleon and I am that fly." ...|$|E

500|$|Rutting males {{fight over}} dominance, often giving out noisy roars and chasing one another; they walk stiffly and display their neck and horns. Males desist from feeding and allogrooming during the rut, {{probably}} {{to devote more}} time to garnering females in oestrus; the male checks the female's urine to ensure that she is in oestrus. On coming across such a female, the excited male begins the courtship by pursuing her, keeping a distance of [...] from her. The male flicks <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> may nod vigorously; the female allows him to lick her vulva, and holds her tail to one side. The male tries mounting the female, holding his head high and clasping her sides with his forelegs. Mounting attempts may be repeated every few seconds to every minute or two. The male loses interest in the female after the first copulation, though she is still active and can mate with other males.|$|E
500|$|In 1590 Marbury {{once again}} felt emboldened {{to speak out}} against his superiors, denouncing the Church of England for {{selecting}} poorly educated bishops and poorly trained ministers. The Bishop of Lincoln, calling him an [...] "impudent Puritan," [...] removed him from preaching and teaching, and put him under house arrest. On 15 October 1590 Marbury {{wrote a letter to the}} statesman William Cecil, Lord Burleigh, who was the uncle of Marbury's acquaintance, Francis Bacon. [...] In the letter he explained his religious creed and claimed that he was deprived of his preaching licence [...] "for causes unknown to him." [...] Without employment, he tended his gardens and tutored his children, reading to them from his own writings, the Bible, and John Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Somehow the family was able to survive, perhaps from borrowing from the Drydens. [...] While this suspension from preaching was thought to be short by historian Lennam, his daughter's biographer, Eve LaPlante, wrote that it lasted nearly four years. [...] Whichever the case, by 1594 he was once again preaching, and from this point forward, Marbury resolved to curb <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> not openly question those in positions of authority.|$|E
500|$|In {{his early}} life, Maximus was a civil servant, and {{an aide to}} the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius. However, he gave up this life in the {{political}} sphere {{to enter into the}} monastic life. Maximus had studied diverse schools of philosophy, and certainly what was common for his time, the Platonic dialogues, the works of Aristotle, and numerous later Platonic commentators on Aristotle and Plato, like Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus. When one of his friends began espousing the Christological position known as Monothelitism, Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported an interpretation of the Chalcedonian formula on the basis of which it was asserted that Jesus had both a human and a divine will. Maximus is venerated in both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. He was eventually persecuted for his Christological positions; following a trial, <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> right hand were mutilated. He was then exiled and died on August 13, 662 in Tsageri, Georgia. However, his theology was upheld by the Third Council of Constantinople and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. It is highly uncommon among the saints that he has two feast days: the 13th of August and the 21st of January. His title of Confessor means that he suffered for the Christian faith, but was not directly martyred. [...] The Life of the Virgin, the only extant copy of which is in a Georgian translation, is commonly, albeit mistakenly, attributed to him, and is considered {{to be one of the}} earliest complete biographies of Mary, the mother of Jesus.|$|E

500|$|Korn {{begins with}} [...] "Blind", {{starting}} with the dueling riffs of James Shaffer and Brian Welch. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis' first line is [...] "Are you ready?!", which {{is now one of}} the band's trademarks. [...] "Blind" [...] is about Davis' drug problems (mostly amphetamines) and how he would feel scattered when he was under the influence. Davis told Metal Hammer that on the album's second track, [...] "Ball Tongue", he [...] "didn't sing a goddamn word in that song. I couldn't describe what I wanted to do, so that's how it came out. It's a really heavy sound." [...] "Ball Tongue" [...] is about a man had to work with Korn on a T-shirt design. He either had a pierced tongue or had a wart on <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> he gave Korn a really hard time. [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] is about how many nursery rhymes have dark meanings. The song explores the concept of nursery rhymes. Davis relates: [...] "'Shoots and Ladders' uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes, the first songs many of us ever hear. 'Shoots and Ladders', to set the record straight, calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are. I choose each rhyme for a different reason—'Baa Baa Black Sheep' has racist overtones. 'London Bridge' talks of all the people of London dying (from the Black Plague, as does 'Ring Around the Roses'). Then there's 'Little Red Riding Hood'—one story tells of the wolf raping Red Riding Hood and killing her." ...|$|E

This speech is generally punctuated, but capitals are not used, correct grammar and syntax are rarely employed (e.g. [...] "when come back bring pie!"), and the speech bubbles are occasionally entirely inaccurate; another feature is the occasional addition of an 's' to nouns or verbs that do not require one (e.g. [...] "beefs come from here", or [...] "I have become a Goths" [...] "Is that rights?").|$|E
2500|$|Hunston is a large, spread-out {{village on}} the coastal plain {{south of the city}} of Chichester. [...] "Good wheat-growing land" [...] {{surrounds}} the residential development in the [...] parish. A church has served the village since the 12th century or earlier: in 1105 it was granted by Robert de Haye to Lessay Abbey in Normandy. [...] Its dedication to St Leodegar, the 7th-century bishop of Autun, may derive from this French connection. Bishop Leodegar ( [...] 616–678), sometimes anglicised to Leger or Latinised as Leodegarius, was martyred by having <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> eyes pulled out and being beheaded.

2500|$|Cicero's {{last words}} {{are said to}} have been, [...] "There is nothing proper about what you are doing, soldier, but do try to kill me properly." [...] He bowed to his captors, leaning his head out of the litter in a gladiatorial gesture to ease the task. By baring his neck and throat to the soldiers, he was {{indicating}} that he wouldn't resist. According to Plutarch, Herennius first slew him, then cut off his head. On Antony's instructions his hands, which had penned the Philippics against Antony, were cut off as well; these were nailed along with his head on the Rostra in the Forum Romanum according to the tradition of Marius and Sulla, both of whom had displayed the heads of their enemies in the Forum. Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions who was displayed in that manner. According to Cassius Dio (in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch), Antony's wife Fulvia took Cicero's head, pulled out <b>his</b> <b>tongue,</b> <b>and</b> jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero's power of speech.|$|E

Act first, think later, if at all, is Pete's attitude." [...] She inferred that he was unintelligent suggesting {{that he would not}} get into Mensa and that he seems [...] "thick as a brick". It has been suggested by writer Dorothy Hobson that the character of Pete was a portrayal of a typical East End male, [...] "macho and mouthy". Author Christine Geraghty has suggested that Pete was seemingly intolerant of difference, but that his position was always undermined [...] "by his blustering espousal of an excessively masculine position. Pete's , like much else he does, are not followed through." [...] Discussing the character's other qualities, author Kate Lock has suggested that Pete was [...] "a simple, amiable sort of chap [...] left others {{to get on with the}} complicated things in life." [...] Lock added that complications were beyond Pete's grasp and that he had trouble articulating emotions. Meanwhile, author Rupert Smith has classified Pete as a [...] "soft touch" [...] character. He added that Pete started off as [...] "a cheery chappy" [...] but became [...] "hard to like", using his failure to support his wife Kathy through her rape ordeal in 1988 as a reason why he lost public sympathy.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving at the University of Cambridge in January 1828, Darwin found [...] this elite {{theological}} {{training institution}} governed by complex rules much more congenial than his experiences at Edinburgh. No rooms were available at Christ's College, {{so he took}} lodgings above a tobacconists in Sidney Street, across the road. [...] Extramural activities were important, and while Darwin did not take up sports or debating, his interests included music and his main passion was the current national craze for the (competitive) collecting of beetles. Trainee clergymen scoured Cambridgeshire for specimens, referring to An Introduction to Entomology by William Kirby and William Spence. Charles joined his older cousin William Darwin Fox who was already a skilled collector and like him got a small dog. The two and their dogs became inseparable. [...] They explored the countryside as Darwin learnt about natural history from his cousin. Darwin became obsessed with winning the student accolade and collected avidly. Once he stripped bark from a dead tree and caught a ground beetle in each hand, then saw the rare Crucifix Ground Beetle, [...] Panagaeus cruxmajor. With the habits of an egg-collector, he popped one ground beetle in his mouth to free his hand, but it ejected some intensely acrid fluid which burnt <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> Darwin was forced to spit it out. He lost all three. The specimens he did not lose had to be mounted and identified, and his knowledge from Edinburgh of Lamarck proved useful. Fox introduced him for advice on identification to the Revd. John Stevens Henslow, professor of botany, and Darwin began attending his soirées, a club for budding naturalists. Here he could meet other professors including the geologist the Revd. Adam Sedgwick and the new mineralogist the Revd. William Whewell.|$|E
