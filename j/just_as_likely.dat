Michael Nyman's 1991 opera Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs was first performed as an opera-ballet by Karine Saporta.

5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{potential}} prey-predator relationship, {{the presence of}} predaceous dingoes {{does not appear to}} heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful. The birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try and evade its attacker. Other raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks.|$|E

5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are <b>just</b> <b>as</b> equally <b>likely</b> to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|R

25|$|In 2007, a study {{ordered by}} Congress found that middle school {{students}} {{who took part in}} abstinence-only sex education programs were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to have sex in their teenage years as those who did not. From 1999 to 2006, the study tracked more than 2,000 students from age 11 or 12 to age 16; the study included students who had participated in one of four abstinence education programs, as well as a control group who had not participated in such a program. By age 16, about half of each group students in the abstinence-only program as well as students in the control group were still abstinent. Abstinence program participants who became sexually active during the 7-year study period reported having similar numbers of sexual partners as their peers of the same age; moreover, they had sex {{for the first time at}} about the same age as other students. The study also found that students who took part in the abstinence-only programs were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to use contraception when they did have sex as those who did not participate. Abstinence-only education advocates claim the study was too narrow, began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and ignored other studies that have shown positive effects.|$|E

Other extralegal variables [...] acceptance of blame, IQ race, and SES, did not independently affect sentencing. Further, only crime seriousness and prior record significantly affected prognosis.

25|$|On {{the other}} side of the debate, some argue that influencers have no such effect and {{therefore}} companies shouldn’t target their seeding efforts on a specific group of people. Duncan Watts and Peter Dodds examined the phenomenon through a computer network simulation under the assumption that influential people are more difficult to influence, therefore social hubs have a lower tendency to adopt new products.

25|$|Nest mates must {{communicate}} with each other in order to perform necessary tasks such as nest building and foraging. Some colonies have diffuse connections where each individual is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to interact with any other. On the other hand, some colonies have very high connectedness between a subset of workers that send out communications {{to the rest of the}} colony. Polistes instabilis is an example of these types of colonies, where a few dominant workers seem to induce others to forage. This occurs by dominance interactions mentioned in previous sections. Individuals will do gaster wagging, wing vibrations, or other aggressions in order to assert their dominance and tell subordinates to forage. Therefore more dominant workers will tend to do tasks inside the nest.|$|E
5000|$|The fat {{acceptance}} {{movement has}} primarily {{focused on a}} feminist model of patriarchal oppression of fat women, most clearly represented by the encouragement of women to diet. However, Sander L. Gilman argues that, until the 20th century, dieting has historically been a man's activity. He continues, [...] "Obesity eats away at the idealised image of the masculine <b>just</b> <b>as</b> surely as it does the idealised image of the feminine." [...] William Banting {{was the author of}} an 1863 booklet called Letter On Corpulence which modern diets have used as a model. Men respond to being overweight differently, (i.e., having a Body Mass Index of 25 or more), being half <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> women to diet, a quarter <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to undergo weightloss surgery and only a fifth <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to report feeling shame about their weight. Irmgard Tischner identifies this behaviour as rooted in notions of masculinity that require a disregard for healthcare: [...] "Men do not have to care about their size or health, as they have women to care about those things for them".|$|R
