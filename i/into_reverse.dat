5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine <b>into</b> <b>reverse</b> gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung {{to the side of the}} Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning to the side of the carriage.|$|E
5|$|Since the crash, {{there have}} been several other {{accidents}} involving reverse thrust. A Douglas DC-8 operating United Airlines Flight 859 crashed in 1961 when the first officer attempted to reverse all four engines during the landing roll. The left engines remained in forward thrust, while the right engines went <b>into</b> <b>reverse,</b> causing the aircraft to veer rapidly to the right and collide with airport construction vehicles, killing 17 of the 122 people aboard and 1 person on the ground.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the declining {{population}} trend had gone <b>into</b> <b>reverse.</b> Increasing numbers of retired people were arriving to make their home in the tranquil surroundings, and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s, the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was in crisis, and started to react. Through government initiatives and local actions, opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products began to emerge. However, in 2011, at 3.1%, Ceredigion still had one of the highest proportions of its population working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, close behind such other places as Orkney and Shetland. Another use for marginal land in exposed positions is the provision of renewable wind energy; Cefn Croes Wind Farm near Devil's Bridge has 39 turbines and a nominal capacity of 58,500kW.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch <b>into</b> <b>reverse.</b> The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
5|$|When the lophophore is extended, cilia (little hairs) on {{the sides}} of the tentacles draw water down between the tentacles and out at the base of the lophophore. Shorter cilia on the inner sides of the tentacles flick food {{particles}} into a groove in a circle under and just inside the tentacles, and cilia in the groove push the particles into the mouth. Phoronids direct their lophophores into the water current, and quickly reorient to maximize the food-catching area when currents change. Their diet includes algae, diatoms, flagellates, peridinians, small invertebrate larvae, and detritus. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing the epistome (lid above the mouth) or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch <b>into</b> <b>reverse.</b> The gut uses cilia and muscles to move food towards the stomach and secretes enzymes that digest some of the food, but the stomach digests the majority of the food. Phoronids also absorb amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) through their skins, mainly in summer. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E

25|$|On some models, {{cornering}} lamps provide white steady-intensity light for lateral illumination {{in the direction}} of an intended turn or lane change. They are generally actuated in conjunction with the turn signals, and they may be wired to also illuminate when the vehicle is shifted <b>into</b> <b>reverse</b> gear,. Some modern vehicles activate the cornering lamp on one or the other side when the steering wheel input reaches a predetermined angle in that direction, regardless of whether a turn signal has been activated.|$|E
25|$|Nothing {{improved}} {{when the}} government then tried to go <b>into</b> <b>reverse</b> with contractionary macroeconomic policies and renewed depreciation. Output plunged, but inflation once more went up instead of down, to 163 percent by 1985. By this time, pessimism about the government's capacity to solve anything, inflationary expectations turning into understandable convictions, and the price-increasing effect of devaluation all combined to give Peru a seemingly unstoppable inflation despite the elimination of anything that might be considered excess demand. The government apparently lost its sense of direction, retreated from its attempt to reopen the economy by returning to higher tariff levels, and otherwise did little except wait for its own end in 1985.|$|E

25|$|In early 1968, he was {{contacted}} {{by a friend}} from Chicago who said that Toyota wanted to establish a dealer network in the Southeast U.S. and {{wanted to talk to}} Jim Moran, who asked what a Toyota was. The company had been unsuccessful at breaking into the American market {{at the end of the}} 1950s and was trying again. Moran declined, but his friend was insistent that Moran drive one. According to Moran, he tested everything to see if it would break. While cruising at 55mph on the interstate, Moran shifted <b>into</b> <b>reverse,</b> and the engine and transmission survived. Moran concluded that although Toyotas weren't as stylish or comfortable as domestic vehicles, they were well-built, reasonably priced, and destined to change the automotive business. On October 26, 1968 he entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the port in Jacksonville, Florida to the states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina. His Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) was founded that year and in 2006, distributed over 400,000 vehicles, 20% of all new Toyotas sold in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to remove {{controls on the}} exchange rate had been expected {{to lead to a}} much higher foreign-exchange price, to encourage exports, and to permit import liberalization without a surging external deficit. But when the rate was set free, the price of dollars went down instead of going up. That initial effect could be explained by the tight restraints imposed on liquidity, which drove firms and individuals who held dollar balances to convert them to domestic currency in order to keep operating. This movement should presumably have gone <b>into</b> <b>reverse</b> when holdings of dollars ran out, but fully eighteen months later no reversal had occurred. Dollars remained too cheap to make exports profitable and too cheap for many producers to compete against imports for several reasons, including the continuing influx of dollars from the drug trade into street markets and then into the banking system. A second reason has involved the continuing low level of domestic income and production, and corresponding restraint of demand for imports as compared with what they would be in an expanding economy. But perhaps the most fundamental reasons have been the continuing squeeze on liquidity in terms of domestic currency and the resulting high rates of interest for borrowing domestic currency, which strongly favor borrowing dollars instead or repatriating them from abroad. All this means that the economy has had no foreign-exchange problem, but also that incentives to produce for export have been held down severely, when both near-term recovery and longer-term growth badly need the stimulus of rising exports.|$|E
500|$|The {{largest single}} sensory {{feature is the}} aboral organ (at the {{opposite}} end from the mouth). Its main component is a statocyst, a balance sensor consisting of a statolith, a tiny grain of calcium carbonate, supported on four bundles of cilia, called [...] "balancers", that sense its orientation. The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long, immobile cilia. A ctenophore does not automatically {{try to keep the}} statolith resting equally on all the balancers. Instead its response is determined by the animal's [...] "mood", in other words the overall state of the nervous system. For example, if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey, it will often put some comb rows <b>into</b> <b>reverse,</b> spinning the mouth towards the prey.|$|E

500|$|According to Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, Murdoch told Captain Smith {{that he was}} {{attempting}} to [...] "hard-a-port around [...] ", suggesting that he {{was attempting}} a [...] "port around" [...] manoeuvre– to first swing the bow around the obstacle, then swing the stern so that {{both ends of the}} ship would avoid a collision. There was a delay before either order went into effect; the steam-powered steering mechanism took up to 30seconds to turn the ship's tiller, and the complex task of setting the engines <b>into</b> <b>reverse</b> would also have taken some time to accomplish. Because the centre turbine could not be reversed, both it and the centre propeller, positioned {{directly in front of the}} ship's rudder, were simply stopped. This reduced the rudder's effectiveness, therefore impairing the turning ability of the ship. Had Murdoch simply turned the ship while maintaining her forward speed, Titanic might have missed the iceberg with feet to spare.|$|E
500|$|It's {{closing time}} at the Krusty Krab, and Squidward answers a last-minute call from a customer. Just as {{he is about to}} tell them that the {{restaurant}} is closed, Mr. Krabs suddenly appears and snatches the phone from Squidward's hands. The customer wants to order a pizza and have it delivered, an order Mr. Krabs happily accepts knowing he could get extra money. Squidward protests this by saying the restaurant doesn't serve pizza nor do they do deliveries, but Mr. Krabs spontaneously makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties and forces Squidward and SpongeBob to deliver it. After SpongeBob does a few [...] "safety checks" [...] of the delivery boat, Squidward forces him to drive. However, SpongeBob cannot drive as he is still in boating school, but Squidward insists saying [...] "it's just around the corner". SpongeBob tries to shift <b>into</b> <b>reverse,</b> but panics and ends up [...] "backing up" [...] for miles and miles until the boat runs out of gas {{in the middle of a}} desert. Squidward complains about this, and eventually kicks the boat out of frustration after SpongeBob mentions that the pizza is getting cold. This causes the boat to suddenly drive back to the Krusty Krab, leaving the two stranded and to continue their delivery on foot.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of Anomalocaris ("abnormal shrimp") was a comedy of errors. The name was initially {{given to a}} fossil that looked like the rear end of a shrimp-like crustacean. Walcott classified a ring-like fossil he called Peytoia {{as a kind of}} jellyfish, and another poorly preserved fossil he called Laggania as a holothurian (sea cucumber). After many plot twists, Derek Briggs started dissecting another ill-defined fossil in very thin slices and found a pair of Anomalocaris-like structures on one end of a specimen of Laggania, which also had a specimen of Peytoia attached just behind those of Anomalocaris. After dissecting more specimens and finding similar configurations, Briggs and Whittington concluded that the whole assemblage represented a single animal, which was named Anomalocaris because that was the earliest name assigned to any of its parts. This animal's body was fragile and usually disintegrated before it could be fossilized. But the complete animal had tough grasping appendages (Anomalocaris), a tough, ring-like mouth with teeth on the inner edge (Peytoia) and a long, segmented body (Laggania) with flaps on the sides that enabled it to swim with a Mexican wave motion, and perhaps to turn quickly by putting the flaps on one side <b>into</b> <b>reverse.</b> This monster was over [...] long when other animals were only a few inches at most. Nedin suggested in 1999 that the animal was capable of taking heavily armored trilobites apart, possibly by grabbing one end of their prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock {{the other end of the}} animal back and forth, causing the prey's exoskeleton to rupture and allowing the predator to access its innards. In 2009 Hagadorn found that anomalocarid mouthparts showed little wear, which suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells. Computer modeling of the Anomalocaris mouthparts suggests they were in fact better suited to sucking on smaller, soft-bodied organisms. Although Whittington and Briggs concluded that Anomalocaris did not fit into any known phylum, research since the 1990s has concluded that it was closely related to Opabinia and to the ancestors of arthropods. In 2009 a fossil named Schinderhannes bartelsi, an apparent relative of Anomalocaris, was found in the Early Devonian period, about 100million years later than the Burgess Shale.|$|E
