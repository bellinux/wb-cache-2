50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports populations of bar-necked cuckoo-doves, pink-headed <b>imperial</b> pigeons, jonquil <b>parrots,</b> streak-breasted honeyeaters, Timor friarbirds, plain gerygones, fawn-breasted whistlers, green figbirds, olive-brown orioles, white-bellied bush chats, blue-cheeked flowerpeckers, flame-breasted sunbirds and Timor sparrows.|$|R
50|$|The {{lake and}} its {{surrounds}} {{have been identified}} by BirdLife International as a 28,000 ha Important Bird Area because they support populations of bar-necked cuckoo-doves, pink-headed <b>imperial</b> pigeons, jonquil <b>parrots,</b> streak-breasted honeyeaters, plain gerygones, fawn-breasted whistlers, green figbirds, olive-brown orioles, buff-banded thicketbirds, white-bellied bush chats and flame-breasted sunbirds.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the salt lake, the habitat is characterized as grassland, savanna woodland, and tropical dry forest. There are stands of both mangrove and eucalyptus. Every year, hundreds of water birds from Russia arrive during the winter. Many native birds also live here, as well as fifteen restricted-range species. Populations of several near-threatened species include slaty cuckoo-dove, pink-headed <b>imperial</b> pigeon, olive-shouldered <b>parrot,</b> white-bellied bush chat, and the Timor sparrow. Cephalopod, crustacean, frogfish, harlequin ghost pipefish, small octopus, rhinopias, sea horse, and soft coral crab encompass some of the sea life.|$|R
50|$|The {{imperial}} amazon is an endangered species. The number of birds {{have increased in}} the past few years; however, there are still fewer than 250 individuals. There have been many efforts to help the habitat for these parrots. With the help of Dominicaâ€™s Forestry, and the Wildlife and Parks Division and the Rare Species Conservatory Foundation (RSCF), areas such as the Northern Forest Reserve and the Central Forest Reserve are protected. However areas adjacent to the Northern Forest Reserve and the Central Forest Reserve remain unprotected. Efforts are being made to help make other areas of Dominica protected. Many of the organizations have helped create groups of people to raise awareness, provide education, and conduct research. The educational programs held in Dominica have reduced the bird trade.The first successful breeding of this species by humans was conducted in 2011. The captive-bred parrot developed fully in 12 weeks and resembled the wild <b>imperial</b> amazon <b>parrots.</b> No one really knew what the reproductive potential of these <b>parrots</b> was. The <b>imperial</b> amazon has the lowest reproductive potential of any of the Amazona species. The {{imperial amazon}} lucked out when it came to extinction because of their reproductive potential and the bird trade that was going on in Dominica. The captive breeding efforts proved to be extremely helpful in the conservation of the species.|$|R
