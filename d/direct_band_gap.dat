5|$|ZnO has a {{relatively}} large <b>direct</b> <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> of ~3.3eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation.

5|$|ZnO has wide <b>direct</b> <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, {{its most}} common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E

40|$|Group III nitride {{semiconductors}} with <b>direct</b> <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> {{have recently}} {{become increasingly important}} in optoelectronics and microelectronics applications due to their <b>direct</b> <b>band</b> <b>gaps,</b> which cover the whole visible spectrum and {{a large part of}} the UV range. Major developments in wide <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> III–V nitride semiconductors have recently led to the commercial production of high-temperature, high-power electronic devices, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and laser diodes (LDs). In this study, GaN nanowires were grown on horizontal reactors by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) employing a vapor-solid mechanism. Many studies have described how to control the diameters of wires in the liquid phase catalytic process, but one-dimensional nanostructures, which are grown using a noncatalytic process, are relatively unexplored due to the challenge of producing high-quality synthetic materials of controlled size. However, vapor-solid mechanisms to make synthesized nanowires are simple to implement. We obtained results from GaN nanostructures that were a preferential c-axis orientation from the substrate. The morphology and crystallinity of the GaN nanowires were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.

40|$|Efficient photo-electrochemical (PEC) {{splitting}} {{of water}} to hydrogen usually requires photoelectrodes to have certain electronic properties. Unfortunately, at present available semiconductors do not meet all these criteria. So, {{a thorough understanding of}} band-engineering for mixed alloys is necessary to successfully design these photoelectrodes. Among the semiconductors, transition metal oxides are of particular interest due to their low cost and relatively high stability in aqueous media. Here, we will present a theoretical study of delafossite-alloys for PEC photo-electrodes. Previous studies have indicated that the group IIIA delafossite family (CuMO(2), M = Al, Ga, In) do not exhibit <b>direct</b> <b>band</b> <b>gaps.</b> Their fundamental <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> are significantly smaller than their reported optical <b>band</b> <b>gaps.</b> On the other hand group IIIB delafossite family (CuMO(2), M = Sc, Y, La) in general show <b>direct</b> <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> and, except for CuLaO(2), <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> are above 3. 00 eV. However, both of these two families exhibit p-type conductivity. We will show that by appropriate alloying of these two delafossite-families we can tune their <b>band</b> <b>gaps</b> and other opto-electronic properties. These types of alloying are desirable, as these introduce no localized impurity states in the <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> due to isovalent alloying. Also, the electronic effective masses can be lowered by selective doping of main group elements. Finally, it will be discussed that, lowering the symmetry constraints of these alloys would enhance their optical absorption properties.

50|$|Interactions among electrons, holes, phonons, photons, {{and other}} {{particles}} {{are required to}} satisfy conservation of energy and crystal momentum (i.e., conservation of total k-vector). A photon with an energy near a semiconductor band gap has almost zero momentum. One important process is called radiative recombination, where an electron in the conduction band annihilates {{a hole in the}} valence band, releasing the excess energy as a photon. This is possible in a <b>direct</b> <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> semiconductor if the electron has a k-vector near the conduction band minima (the hole will share the same k-vector), but not possible in an indirect band gap semiconductor, as photons cannot carry crystal momentum, and thus conservation of crystal momentum would be violated. For radiative recombination to occur in an indirect band gap material, the process must also involve the absorption or emission of a phonon, where the phonon momentum equals the difference between the electron and hole momentum. (It can also, instead, involve a crystallographic defect, which performs essentially the same role.) The involvement of the phonon makes this process much less likely to occur in a given span of time, which is why radiative recombination is far slower in indirect band gap materials than <b>direct</b> <b>band</b> <b>gap</b> ones.
