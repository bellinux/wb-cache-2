50|$|Aside {{from the}} missing 80 chapters, there are {{differences}} in the chapter divisions between the Italian and Spanish texts; and also between the Sydney transcript and the Spanish passages quoted by Dr. White <b>in</b> English. The <b>Italian</b> and Spanish chapters agree for the prologue and up to chapter 116. Chapter 117 <b>in</b> the <b>Italian</b> version is split into Chapters 117 and 118 in the Spanish; and then Chapters 118 and 119 <b>in</b> the <b>Italian</b> correspond with 119 in the Spanish. Chapter 120, before the lacuna, is common to both; but when the Spanish manuscript resumes, its numbered Chapter 200 corresponds to the numbered Italian Chapter 199. The two versions continue one chapter out of phase {{for the rest of the}} book so that the final Chapter 222 in the Sydney transcript corresponds to Chapter 221 <b>in</b> the <b>Italian.</b> The final Chapter 222 <b>in</b> the <b>Italian</b> is missing from the Spanish text. In the quotations of Joseph White, there is a further difference in that the long Chapter 218 (217 <b>in</b> the <b>Italian</b> text) is split, so that Chapter 220 in Dr. White's text corresponds to Chapter 219 in the Sydney transcript and Chapter 218 <b>in</b> the <b>Italian</b> manuscript. Dr. White's Chapter 221 corresponds with both Chapters 220 and 221 in the Sydney transcript, and Chapters 219 and 220 <b>in</b> the <b>Italian.</b> <b>In</b> this context it may be noted that Chapter 218 <b>in</b> the <b>Italian</b> manuscript contains a corrected chapter division, in that the scribe originally split off the final paragraph into the start of Chapter 219, and then erased and overwrote the division. This suggests that whatever text the scribe of the Italian manuscript was using as his copy, was unclear as to chapter divisions at this point.|$|R
