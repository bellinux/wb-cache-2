50|$|On July 26, 2013, {{there was}} bad weather in Atlanta, and many Atlanta-bound flights were {{diverted}} to Montgomery including an American Eagle ERJ-145 from Miami, FL, a Delta Connection CRJ-200 from Monroe, LA, two Delta MD-88s from Dallas, TX, and one Delta MD-88 from Fort Myers, FL. While a Delta MD-88 was refueling, <b>fuel</b> <b>leaked</b> {{from the plane}} {{and there was a}} fuel spill. Flights were delayed and passengers were not let off the <b>fuel</b> <b>leaked</b> plane because there was not a tug big enough at the airport to tow the plane away from the spill. The plane departed safely for ATL.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary cause}} of the {{incident}} was improper maintenance, caused by an incorrect part installed in the hydraulics system, resulting in the <b>fuel</b> <b>leak.</b> However, the final investigation also assigned the flight crew partial responsibility for failing to detect the fuel situation earlier. Review of the Cockpit Voice Recorder showed that the pilot failed to use the main procedural checklist when attempting to rectify the imbalance of fuel between the tanks, which might have prevented {{the extent of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> on one side. The pilot also transferred fuel from the working engine to the failing engine which magnified the crisis.|$|R

40|$|The fire {{extinguishant}} storage temperature requirements were examined for several commercially available dry chemicals.

40|$|Fuel leakage has {{the risk}} of being ignited by {{external}} ignition sources, and therefore it is important to detect any fuel leakage before the departure of the aircraft. Currently, there are no <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> detection systems installed on commercial aircrafts, to detect fuel tank leakage, while {{only a small number of}} more recent aircraft, have a fuel monitoring system, that generates a fuel leak-warning message in cockpit in the case of fuel imbalance between the tanks. The approach proposed in this paper requires the fuel vent ports on the wings to be replaced with fuel vent valves, which can be controlled to be in open or close position. The fuel vent valve will be in close position, when certain conditions are fulfilled (all the related fuel valves closed, pumps not operating, etc.), the fuel tank ullage area is then pressurized to 4 psi and the rate of change of the pressure is measured over a period. Several experiments have been conducted and, the result show that a continuous <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> of one liter per minute can be detected. Further experiments show that if the fuel tank is pressurized to higher pressures, a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> can be detected sooner...|$|R
