He observed that his [...] "London base afforded me {{the advantage of being}} away from the Hollywood rat race. Just going your own way in spite of whatever anyone <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> or in spite of what you've done already was satisfying. I also had the advantage of the European influence: their way of looking at life, of making movies." [...] While in the UK in the early 1960s Donen was praised as an early influence on the then-emerging British New Wave film movement.|$|E
500|$|Miguel held a {{press conference}} at the Las Ventas {{building}} in Madrid, Spain on the album's launch date of 13 September 1999. Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because I had more time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. I like my language and I really feel proud of it. I'm not saying that I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for me. Why should I do it, just because everybody <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E

500|$|The team wrote each {{character}} to embody a game protagonist archetype; Michael embodies greed, Franklin ambition and Trevor insanity. Houser felt Michael and Trevor were written to juxtapose each other, with Michael [...] "like the criminal {{who wants to}} compartmentalise and be a good guy some of the time" [...] and Trevor [...] "the maniac who isn't a hypocrite". He considered that the three lead characters helped move the game's story into more original territory than its predecessors, which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising {{through the ranks of}} a criminal underworld. Ned Luke portrayed Michael, Shawn [...] "Solo" [...] Fonteno portrayed Franklin and Steven Ogg portrayed Trevor. Fonteno first became aware of the acting job through his friend DJ Pooh, who worked on San Andreas and was involved in Grand Theft Auto Vs music production. When Luke's agent advised him of the casting call, he initially did not want to audition for the part because it was in a video game. After reading the audition material and learning more about the project, he became interested. He reflected, [...] "I went immediately after reading the material from 'I'm not doing it' to 'nobody <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> it'. It was just brilliant". During the initial audition process, Ogg noticed an on-set chemistry between him and Luke, which he felt helped secure them the roles. [...] "When [...] and I went in the room together we immediately had something", he explained. While the actors knew their auditions were for Rockstar Games, it was not until they signed contracts that they learnt it was a Grand Theft Auto title.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} in the Chinese legal community that the endemic corruption {{is caused by the}} lack of an independent judiciary and a failure to enforce laws and regulations. They contend that these problems will not be permanently fixed until much deeper systemic problems are addressed. Guanxi and other social customs, may have also contributed to the prevalence of practices seen as corrupt from a strictly legal perspective but seem relatively benign from a cultural standpoint. Gift-giving during holidays, securing patrons for career advancement, hosting banquets at expensive restaurants to secure minor deals, exchanging favours, and navigating the complex web of guanxi to get things done was seen as an ordinary part of Chinese life. Indeed, many people did not see these activities as illegal or even morally problematic. [...] Moreover, many regulations and law governing cadre work and public service were rarely enforced, resulting in two prevailing winds among Chinese officialdom that [...] "if everyone <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> it then it must be okay," [...] and that [...] "I probably won't ever be caught anyway".|$|E
2500|$|... ll New-York {{moves on}} the first of May; not only moves about, as usual, in the {{everlasting}} hurry-scurry of business, but one house empties itself into another, all over the city. The streets are full of loaded drays, on which tables are dancing, and carpets rolling to and fro. Small chairs, which bring up such pretty, cozy images of rolly-pooly mannikens and maidens, eating supper from tilted porringers, and spilling the milk on their night-gowns – these go ricketting along on the tops of beds and bureaus, and not unfrequently pitch into the street, and so fall asunder. Children are driving hither and yon, one with a flower-pot in his hand, another with work-box, band-box, or oil-canakin; each so intent upon his important mission, that all the world seems to him (as it does to many a theologican,) safely locked up within the little walls he carries. Luckily, both boy and bigot are mistaken, or mankind would be in a bad box, sure enough. The dogs seem bewildered with this universal transmigration of bodies; and as for the cats, they sit on the door-steps, mewing piteously, that they were not born in the middle ages, or at least in the quiet old portion of the world. And I, who have almost as strong a love of localities as poor puss, turn away from the windows, with a suppressed anathema on the nineteenth century, with its perpetual changes. Do you want an appropriate emblem of this country, and this age? Then stand on the side-walks of New-York, and watch the universal transit {{on the first}} of May ... However, human being are such creatures of habit and imitation, that what is necessity soon becomes fashion, and each one wishes to do what everyone <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> A lady in the neighbourhood closed all her binds and shutters, on May-day; being asked by her acquaintance whether she had been in the country, she answered, [...] "I was ashamed not to be moving {{on the first of}} May; and so I shut up the house that the neighbours might not know it."

And {{as soon as the}} two Irish regiments had passed, the little troop trotted across to the rising ground and {{dismounted}} a few hundred yards from the guns. They soon saw with satisfaction that the fire of the Boers was far from effective, their aim was not good, and a very small proportion of the shells burst; while on the other hand the shrapnel from the British batteries burst with splendid accuracy over the crest of the hill. For two hours the artillery duel continued, then the Boer guns gradually ceased their fire. The mist that had partly shrouded the summit of Talana, eight hundred feet above the plain, and the smoke that still hung thickly there, rendered it impossible to say whether they had all been put out of action or simply withdrawn, but when it cleared off they could no longer be seen. It was now the turn of the infantry. Beyond the donga in which they were lying the rise of the ground was gradual, up to a plantation which surrounded Smith's farm. Beyond this the ground was rocky. The men advanced at the double in open order, and the moment they were seen by the Boers a continuous fire of musketry was opened. The distance was about a mile, but the Mauser rifles had a much greater range than this and the bullets pattered thickly on the ground. Only four men, however, fell. The two regiments halted in the plantation and farm buildings, and the advanced line {{at the edge of the}} trees opened fire in answer to that to which they were exposed. The general at first had taken up his position with the guns, but as soon as the men advanced from the donga he joined them and accompanied them as far as the plantation. Then he returned to the battery, which continued its fire with greater activity to prepare the way for the further advance of the infantry.|$|E
