5|$|The {{increased}} use of the stirrup from the 8th century on aided the warrior's stability and security <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> when fighting. This {{may have led to}} greater use of shock tactics, although a couched lance could be used effectively without stirrups. In particular, Charles Martel recognized the military potential of the stirrup, and distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him by fighting in the new manner.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Aerosmith {{embarked}} on a reunion tour called the Back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Saddle</b> Tour, {{which led to the}} live album Classics Live II. While concerts on the tour were well-attended, it was plagued with several incidents, mostly attributed to drug abuse by band members. Their problems still not behind them, the group was signed to Geffen Records and began working on a comeback. Despite the band signing on to a new record company, the band's old label Columbia continued to reap the benefits of Aerosmith's comeback, releasing the live companion albums Classics Live I and II and the collection Gems.|$|E

5|$|Party Politics, {{who won the}} 1992 Grand National with partner Carl Llewellyn, {{was also}} pulled up after the water jump when in a good position. Since his Aintree victory the {{previous}} April he had run unimpressively in two chases without Llewellyn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> before they were reunited to win the Greenhalls Gold Cup at Haydock in February. As defending champion, and with his jockey taking his fourth ride in a Grand National, the horse was popular with the public who had backed him down to 7/1 favourite at the start.|$|E
5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters became involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in mother of pearl inlay, gold leaf and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and {{a complete set of}} a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
25|$|The most {{noticeable}} feature of western style riding is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> {{which has a}} substantial tree that provides greater support to horse and rider when working long hours <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b> The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a lariat after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to {{be attached to the}} saddle.|$|E

40|$|The ridgelines of {{mountain}} ranges {{are a source}} of geomorphic information unadulterated by the arrival of sediment from upslope. Studies along ridgecrests, therefore, can help identify and isolate the controls on important regolith properties such as thickness and texture. A 1. 5 [*]km section of ridgeline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sierra Nevada (CA) with a tenfold decrease in erosion rate (inferred from ridgetop convexity) provided an opportunity to conduct a high-resolution survey of regolith properties and investigate their controls. We found that regolith along the most quickly eroding section of the ridge was the rockiest and had the lowest clay concentrations. Furthermore, a general increase in regolith thickness with a slowing of erosion rate was accompanied by an increase in biomass, changes in vegetation community, broader ridgeline profiles, and an apparent increase in total available moisture. The greatest source of variation in regolith thickness at the 10 – 100 [*]m scale, however, was the local topography along the ridgeline, with <b>the</b> deepest regolith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> and <b>the</b> thinnest on the knobs. Because regolith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> had higher surface soil moisture than the knobs, we conclude that the hydrological conditions primarily driven by local topography (i. e. rapid vs. slow drainage and water-storage potential) provide the fundamental controls on regolith thickness through feedbacks incorporating physical weathering by the biota and chemical weathering. Moreover, because <b>the</b> ridgeline <b>saddles</b> are <b>the</b> uppermost extensions of first-order valleys, we propose that the fluvial network affects regolith properties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> furthest reaches of the watershe...|$|R

25|$|Horsemen in the Sassanid cavalry {{lacked a}} stirrup. Instead, {{they used a}} war saddle which had a cantle at the back and two guard clamps which curved {{across the top of}} the rider's thighs. This allowed the {{horsemen}} to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> at all times during the battle, especially during violent encounters.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} {{most of the night}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> Custer's brigade arrived at Two Taverns, Pennsylvania roughly five miles southeast of Gettysburg around 3 A. M. July 3, 1863. There he was joined by Farnsworth's brigade. By daybreak they received orders to protect Meade's flanks. He was about to experience perhaps his finest hours during the war.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Bigg {{and his colleagues}} {{discovered}} that individual killer whales can be identified from a good photograph of the animal's dorsal fin and saddle patch taken when it surfaces. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin, and the pattern of white or grey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> patch, are sufficient to distinguish killer whales from each other.|$|E
50|$|A {{wire rope}} clamp, also called a clip, {{is used to}} fix the loose end of the loop back to the wire rope. It usually {{consists}} of a U-shaped bolt, a forged saddle, and two nuts. The two layers of wire rope are placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U-bolt. <b>The</b> <b>saddle</b> is then fitted over the ropes on to <b>the</b> bolt (<b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> includes two holes to fit to the u-bolt). The nuts secure <b>the</b> arrangement <b>in</b> place. Three or more clamps are usually used to terminate a wire rope. As many as eight may be needed for a 2 in diameter rope.|$|R
50|$|Harness bend {{is useful}} when {{one needs to}} tighten <b>the</b> slack <b>in</b> a binding loop before locking <b>the</b> knot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tight position.

5000|$|Buford's return towards Gordonsville {{was also}} ordered as a ruse {{to mask the}} return of the main body of Stoneman's cavalry to Hooker's command. Colonel George B. Sandford would later write: [...] "Buford was the man of all others to be {{entrusted}} with such an undertaking." [...] For three days and nights, Buford's exhausted men remained on the move and such was the trooper's fatigue that dozens of men fell asleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> of their emaciated, sore backed horses. Even now, as the mission was nearing completion, ended by the Union retreat from its defeat at Chancellorsville, Buford's column was still battling the swollen rivers and streams.|$|R
25|$|In the Sierra Nevada, the Buffalo Soldiers {{regularly}} endured {{long days}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> slim rations, racism, and separation {{from family and}} friends.

Yosemite Park Ranger Shelton Johnson researched and interpreted the history {{in an attempt to}} recover and celebrate the contributions of the Buffalo Soldiers of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E
25|$|A stirrup {{is a light}} frame or {{ring that}} holds {{the foot of a}} rider, {{attached}} to the saddle by a strap, often called a stirrup leather. Stirrups are usually paired and are used to aid in mounting and as a support while using a riding animal (usually a horse or other equine, such as a mule). They greatly increase the rider's ability to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> and control the mount, increasing the animal's usefulness to humans in areas such as communication, transportation and warfare.|$|E
25|$|The {{first race}} in 1913 was won by 25-year-old Paul Deman, {{who won the}} sprint of a six-man group after more than 12 hours <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b> Deman {{went on to win}} Bordeaux–Paris in 1914, but his career almost ended with World War I. He joined Belgium's espionage {{underground}} war effort and smuggled documents into the neutral Netherlands by bike. After many trips he was arrested by the Germans, jailed in Leuven and held for execution. The Armistice of 1918 saved his life and he became a war hero.|$|E

5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did <b>the</b> commotion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddling</b> paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|R
25|$|There are a {{spectrum}} of stirrup lengths, which the rider may chose depending on the purpose. For example, in dressage, the longest possible stirrup length is used {{in order for the}} rider to have complete control over every nuance of the horse's movement. Likewise, a very long stirrup is used in the western sport of cutting, where, though the rider relinquishes control to the horse, requires maximum security to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> during the rapid stops, turns and bursts of speed the horse uses when maneuvering cattle. For a comfortable ride over long hours at slow speeds, the long stirrup is also preferred by trail riders.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Low {{back pain}} is a {{frequent}} pathology among bicyclists, probably due to unappropriate saddle position. This radiographic {{study was conducted to}} evaluate dorso-lumbar angular values in two different pedal unit positions; <b>the</b> first one <b>in</b> a bicycle frame type with pedals <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> axis and <b>the</b> second one with the pedals behind <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> axis, <b>in</b> order to define the most physiological sitting position. Materials and methods. Ten voluntary healthy adults, ranging in age between 21 to 45 years, were randomly choosen among a group of cyclist not involved in competition and underwent serial fluoroscopic studies while cyclists sit on two different saddles of a prototype cyclette; dorso-lumbar angles at both different sitting positions were measured on film according to modified Lippmann-Cobb method using as reference the upper somatic limitant of the eleventh or twelth dorsal vertebra and the lower somatic limitant of the third lumbar vertebra. Results. Statistical analysis of the measured angles demonstrates that the differences between the dorso-lumbar spine angle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different <b>saddle</b> positions are statistically significative with a coefficient correlation equals to 0. 64015 and p> 0. 01; angular values are more physiological <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second position with pedal unit behind <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> axis. Conclusions. <b>The</b> incidence and importance of low back pain in cyclists can be reduced with appropriate pedal unit position; the position with pedals behind <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> axis permits more physiological spine angles <b>in</b> comparison with <b>the</b> classic one having <b>the</b> pedals <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> axis; this fact is due to a different pelvic position which coincides with lumbar angles...|$|R
50|$|Before the 2007-2008 race meet began, Tampa Bay Downs {{underwent}} several renovations, {{including the}} installation of the Grandstand elevator; the all-new Silks Poker Room, located {{on the third floor of}} the Grandstand; and the Party Suite, adjacent to the Silks Poker Room, was also updated with new flat-screen TVs installed. The Legends Bar, which includes a museum-quality exhibition of famed Thoroughbred Seabiscuit, became the newest feature of the Legends Bar on the second floor of the Grandstand. Horsemen enjoyed improvements to the Paddock area, with all-new stalls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddling</b> barn ensuring <b>the</b> safety and comfort of horses and their connections.

25|$|The {{following}} year, {{with the}} Holy Roman Empire {{threatened by the}} success of Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt, Marlborough made his march to the Danube. During the campaign, the Scots Greys served as part of Ross's Dragoon Brigade. At the Battle of Schellenberg, on 2 July 1704, the Scots Greys were originally held as part of the reserve. With the failure of the first assault, the Scots Greys were ordered into the line as dismounted cavalry, a role which dragoons, being in origin mounted infantry, were of all cavalry units especially-suited to fulfil when the occasion demanded. Once the breakthrough occurred, the Scots Greys were back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> in their more familiar role, participating in the pursuit.|$|E
25|$|It rapidly {{became clear}} that the Boer forces {{presented}} the British forces with a severe tactical challenge. What the Boers presented was a mobile and innovative approach to warfare, drawing on their experiences from the First Boer War. The average Boers who made up their Commandos were farmers who had spent almost all their working life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> both as farmers and hunters. They depended on the pot, horse and rifle; they were also skilled stalkers and marksmen. As hunters they had learned to fire from cover; from a prone position and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed, the game would either be long gone or could charge and potentially kill them.|$|E
