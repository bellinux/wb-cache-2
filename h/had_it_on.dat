5|$|A detective named Havez (Dwight McFee) {{takes over}} as Bruckman's guard when Mulder and Scully {{are called to}} {{investigate}} yet another new murder victim: the tarot card reader. As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop is actually the killer, and when he enters the room (while Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush back to the hotel. Mulder chases the killer to the basement kitchen and the scene plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives {{in the nick of time}} and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E

500|$|In March 2016, Fazekas {{noted that}} the {{producers}} felt [...] "bad" [...] about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she [...] "would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever. I doubt that there's a Netflix play for it." [...] She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers {{would find a way}} to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb said he did not understand the decision, as [...] "there were no conversations" [...] regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying Agent Carter was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, [...] "if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour Agent Carter [...] for May 2017,' [...] We'll put together the greatest Agent Carter movie we can.” Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it [...] "a network political thing" [...] since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more [...] "mainstream" [...] drama Conviction [...] "to get their ratings up" [...] instead of staying on Agent Carter, which Atwell felt had gained a [...] "cult following". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving Agent Carter because it is [...] "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [...] original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting [...] "deal complexities" [...] for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air Agent Carter globally, as [...] "Some of those output partners still <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [...] Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one." ...|$|E
