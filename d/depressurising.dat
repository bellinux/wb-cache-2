500|$|As the Comet {{represented}} {{a new category}} of passenger aircraft, more rigorous testing was a development priority. From 1947 to 1948, de Havilland conducted an extensive research and development phase, {{including the use of}} several stress test rigs at Hatfield for small components and large assemblies alike. Sections of pressurised fuselage were subjected to high-altitude flight conditions via a large decompression chamber on-site, and tested to failure. However, tracing fuselage failure points proved difficult with this method, and de Havilland ultimately switched to conducting structural tests with a water tank that could be safely configured to increase pressures gradually. The entire forward fuselage section was tested for metal fatigue by repeatedly pressurising to [...] overpressure and <b>depressurising</b> through more than 16,000 cycles, equivalent to about 40,000hours of airline service. [...] The windows were also tested under a pressure of , [...] above expected pressures at the normal service ceiling of [...] One window frame survived , about 1,250 percent over the maximum pressure it was expected to encounter in service.|$|E

50|$|Sprinkler valve (otherwise {{known as}} a solenoid valve): The use of {{irrigation}} sprinkler valves as pneumatic valves has become increasingly popular for spudgunning. These valves are intended to be electrically triggered causing a solenoid to <b>depressurise</b> a diaphragm and allow airflow through. It is also possible to remove the solenoid and, instead, to actuate the valve manually with a blowgun to <b>depressurise</b> the diaphragm. Such modifications allow the valve to open as much as 3 to 5 times faster.|$|R
50|$|Non-portable {{chambers}} {{are generally}} constructed from steel, {{as it is}} inexpensive, strong and fire resistant. Portable chambers have been constructed from steel, aluminium alloy, and fibre reinforced composites. In some cases the composite material structure is flexible when <b>depressurised.</b>|$|R
50|$|The field {{underwent}} a massive £1.3 billion upgrade {{project in the}} mid 1990s, which involved <b>depressurising</b> the entire reservoir and making extensive modifications to {{three of the four}} Brent platforms. This converted them to low-pressure operation, which unlocked significant quantities of natural gas from the reservoir and extended the field life beyond 2010.|$|E
50|$|The captain {{tried to}} land the plane on the sea, but the <b>depressurising</b> cabin and the failing {{circuits}} made that impossible. Additionally, smoke was seeping into the cockpit. Left with no other option, the crew issued life jackets and opened the emergency doors to ensure a quick escape as the plane plunged into the sea below.|$|E
50|$|Before {{internal}} inspection {{the valve}} {{must be removed}} after <b>depressurising</b> and verifying that the valve is open. Cylinders containing breathing gases do not need special precautions for discharge except that high oxygen fraction gases should not be released in an enclosed space because of the fire hazard. If the valve is blocked or stuck closed {{it may be necessary}} to release the pressure by removing the burst disc or drilling into the valve body below the valve seat. These operations require care to avoid injury.|$|E
50|$|He {{is killed}} when Bond uses {{a knife to}} shatter the window next to his seat on an aircraft, which <b>depressurises</b> the plane and blows Oddjob out of the window, a fate {{transferred}} to Auric Goldfinger in the film version.|$|R
50|$|Using two {{adsorbent}} vessels allows near-continuous {{production of}} the target gas. It also permits so-called pressure equalisation, where the gas leaving the vessel being <b>depressurised</b> is used to partially pressurise the second vessel. This results in significant energy savings, and is common industrial practice.|$|R
50|$|On June 30, 1971, {{the crew}} of Soyuz 11 died when their {{spacecraft}} <b>depressurised</b> during re-entry. One of {{the recommendations of the}} investigating government commission was that pressure suits should be worn by future crews during critical phases of their mission - launch, docking and landing.|$|R
50|$|For wind speeds {{greater than}} 5.7 m/s at ridge height then {{the side walls}} are in pro-flux mode with a U value {{dramatically}} increasing with wind speed (Fig 6) At wind speeds greater than 9.0 m/s at ridge height the lee-ward switches from contra-flux to pro-flux mode. The average U-value for the four walls is now 0.36 W/(m2K), which is significantly greater than the 0.2 W/(m2K) for an air-tight construction. These changes from contra-flux to pro-flux mode could be delayed by <b>depressurising</b> the building below -10 Pa.|$|E
5000|$|Slow, or gradual, {{decompression}} occurs slowly {{enough to}} go unnoticed and might only be detected by instruments. [...] This type of decompression may also come about from a failure to pressurize as an aircraft climbs to altitude. An {{example of this is}} the 2005 Helios Airways Flight 522 crash, in which the pilots failed to check the aircraft was pressurising automatically and then to react to the warnings that the aircraft was <b>depressurising,</b> eventually losing consciousness (along with most of the passengers and crew) from hypoxia.|$|E
50|$|Despite his fantastic story, Dale {{believes}} the Doctor. The {{peace with the}} Draconians lasted many years, but suddenly devolved into senseless acts of hostility. The Doctor's story would explain a great deal. Dale outlines the escape plan: Cross, one of the overseers, will leave two spacesuits near an airlock, and they will walk across the lunar surface to steal a spaceship. Dale offers to take the Doctor back to Earth where he can tell his story to Dale's contacts {{in the press and}} government. However, once inside the airlock, they find oxygen tanks for the suits are empty. Cross has double-crossed them, and the room is <b>depressurising.</b>|$|E
50|$|During routine {{maintenance}} of a liquid-fuelled ICBM, the fuel tank is penetrated by a falling socket. The film traces {{the efforts of the}} maintenance crew and associated military and civilian personnel to recover the potentially disastrous situation before the fuel tank is sufficiently <b>depressurised</b> that the stack collapses and explodes.|$|R

50|$|For {{propaganda}} {{reasons the}} Soviets claimed {{the flight was}} a success. A State Commission investigating the crash later determined that the coronal discharge effect which caused the parachute to jettison would only occur at the 25 mm capsule pressure. If the capsule had been completely <b>depressurised</b> to a high vacuum, the accident would not have occurred.|$|R
50|$|The TARDIS materialises on the station, but {{the smell}} of decay and death is everywhere. The station {{computer}} demands that the Doctor leave and, when he refuses, tries to kill him and Peri by <b>depressurising</b> the passageway. The Doctor manages to open a hatch and drag his unconscious companion through to another section. The Doctor discovers Dastari's day journal and the Time Lords' objections to the Kartz-Reimer experiments, but refuses to believe his people {{are responsible for the}} massacre. Peri suggests someone is trying to frame the Time Lords and drive a wedge between them and the Third Zone governments. They leave the office to enter the service ducts, work their way to the control centre and attempt to deactivate the computer before it succeeds in killing them.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{cylinder}} passes the listed procedures, but the condition remains doubtful, further tests {{can be applied}} to ensure that the cylinder is fit for use. Cylinders that fail the tests or inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered unserviceable after notifying the owner of the reason for failure. Before starting work the cylinder must be identified from the labelling and permanent stamp markings, and the ownership and contents verified, and the valve must be removed after <b>depressurising</b> and verifying that the valve is open.

50|$|Initially not on {{the mission}} to recover live {{specimens}} from Panthalassa, David reluctantly joins the mission {{in order to keep}} Kaylie from harm's way and agrees to dive into the subterranean sea to look for the prehistoric creatures that bin Rashidi seeks. Weathering an underwater storm and escaping a pack of Ichthyosaurs which destroys another of the manta-ray submersibles, they discover the wreck of the USS Indianapolis, which had broken through Panthalassa's ceiling. The imposing bulk of the WW-II era cruiser momentarily scares away a pursuing mosasaur, enabling David and Kaylie to reach one of Michael Maren's underwater labs, which is nearby. The docking station is unable to take the strain of the <b>depressurising</b> and collapses shortly after David and Kaylie are safely inside, effectively trapping them beneath the ocean with limited air and no food. The mosasaur soon arrives and gets crushed under the spherical lab when it rolls on the ocean floor.|$|E

50|$|The {{density of}} both gases and liquids {{depends on the}} {{pressure}} and temperature of the fluid. Thus volumes measured in cold conditions or in pressurised conditions will be lower than the same mass of fluid at warmer or <b>depressurised</b> conditions.

50|$|Small {{pressure}} vessels are normally tested using a water jacket test. The vessel is visually examined for defects and then {{placed in a}} container filled with water, and in which the change in volume of the vessel can be measured, usually by monitoring the water level in a calibrated tube. The vessel is then pressurised for a specified period, usually 30 or more seconds, and if specified, the expansion will be measured by reading off the amount of liquid that has been forced into the measuring tube by the volume increase of the pressurised vessel. The vessel is then depressurised, and the permanent volume increase due to plastic deformation while under pressure is measured by comparing the final volume in the measuring tube with the volume before pressurisation. A leak will give a similar result to permanent set, but will be detectable by holding the volume in the pressurised vessel by closing the inlet valve for a period before <b>depressurising,</b> as the pressure will drop steadily during this period {{if there is a}} leak. In most cases a permanent set that exceeds the specified maximum will indicate failure. A leak may also be a failure criterion, but {{it may be that the}} leak is due to poor sealing of the test equipment. If the vessel fails, it will normally go through a condemning process marking the cylinder as unsafe.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of July 9, while the {{aircraft}} was cruising at flight level 190 over the town of Flat Rock, Michigan, the No. 4 engine on the aircraft experienced a drop in RPM. The engine then sped to 14,000 RPM, significantly above the engine's normal cruise figure. As pilots attempted to feather the propeller, the engine sped up even more, the aircraft's indicated airspeed decreased, and the pilots declared an emergency and began an immediate emergency descent, <b>depressurising</b> the cabin as they did so. Less than a minute later and as the aircraft descended through 9,000 feet, the propeller attached to the No. 4 engine broke loose. One of the four propeller blades penetrated the passenger cabin and cut through the first row of seats, immediately killing a young woman travelling with her two small children. The blade also injured {{a family of three}} sitting across the aisle from the victim and a flight attendant who had been standing {{at the front of the}} cabin. The children of the victim were not injured. The pilots eventually landed the aircraft at Windsor, Ontario; they learned only after landing that there had been casualties in the passenger cabin. One small section of the blade remained in the cabin, while the main section of the blade and the other three blades from the propeller were found on the ground in the vicinity of Flat Rock.|$|E
5000|$|Zond 6 used a {{relatively}} uncommon technique called [...] "skip reentry" [...] to shed velocity upon returning to Earth. A {{few hours before}} reentry, on 17 November 1968, a faulty O-ring rubber gasket caused the cabin to <b>depressurise,</b> killing all the animal test subjects aboard. Zond 6's parachutes also deployed too early and it crashed in Kazakhstan, near the designated landing area.|$|R

40|$|Pre-mining <b>depressurising</b> {{of a deep}} {{ore body}} at the McArthur River mine in {{northern}} Saskatchewan was considered to decrease the risk associated with mining near 5 MPa water pressure and {{increasing the amount of}} ore that can be extracted. Based on a limited amount of field data, a three-dimensional finite element ground-water flow model was developed to predict the amount of water {{that would have to be}} pumped from surface wells or extracted with underground drainholes to meet this goal and the associated magnitude and extent of drawdown that would propagate to the surface over the life of the operation and its impact on surface-water resources. In addition, the results from the preliminary model were used to design a prototype <b>depressurising</b> well and a 30 -day pumping test. Because of the predicted large volume of water that would have to be discharged, another still on-going investigation has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of localized depressurisation in improving mine tunnel stability in conjunction with ground freezing and cementaceous grouting...|$|E
