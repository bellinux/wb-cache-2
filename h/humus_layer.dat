5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests.

The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner <b>humus</b> <b>layer,</b> decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots.

40|$|Aboveground vegetation, four belowground fauna {{groups and}} humus {{composition}} have been analyzed {{in order to}} inves-tigate the links between autotrophic and heterotrophic communities in a Norwayspruce mountain forest in Tours-en-Savoie (France). The aboveground plant community was recorded in small patches corresponding to contrasting micro-habitats. Animal communities and <b>humus</b> <b>layers</b> were sampled within the same patches. The relationships between hu-mus profile, faunistic and floristic compositional gradients were investigated by Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and, {{for the first time}} in ecology, a Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis (HMFA) was used to interpret differences among <b>humus</b> <b>layers.</b> The analysis revealed a pattern with three main groups of microhabitats. The thorough study of separate <b>humus</b> <b>layers</b> could explain this result. The interplay of plant–animal–soil interactions is likely to drive the ecosystem toward three alternative states supporting humus traditional classification between mull–mor–moder. HMFA revealed the impor-tance of depth to explain this contrast among humus forms, using <b>humus</b> <b>layers</b> as diagnostic tools in both inert and living components. HMFA also showed contrast between unexploited and exploited parts of the forest, but the study of soil and vegetation indicate that this contrast does not only hold in forest management but also in geomorphology. RV-coefficients among the six groups of variables showed significant fauna–fauna relationships in almost all <b>humus</b> <b>layers</b> except Actin-edida. Plant–soil interactions are not as strong as expected and are even weaker when the soil in question is deep. In ad-dition, HMFA failed to show direct interactions between plant and soil fauna but, paradoxically, HMFA does suggest that indirect plant–fauna interactions are at the focus of the ecosystem strategy that leads to the differentiation of ecological niches within the forest mosaic...|$|R

In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers.

50|$|Paphiopedilum species {{naturally}} occur among <b>humus</b> <b>layers</b> as terrestrials on {{the forest}} floor, while a few are true epiphytes and some are lithophytes. These sympodial orchids lack pseudobulbs. Instead, they grow robust shoots, each with several leaves; some are hemicryptophytes. The leaves can be short and rounded or long and narrow, and typically have a mottled pattern. When older shoots die, newer ones take over. Each new shoot only blooms once when it is fully grown, producing a raceme between the fleshy, succulent leaves. The roots are thick and fleshy. Potted plants form a tight lump of roots that, when untangled, can be up to 1 m long.|$|R
40|$|Boreal forests harbour diverse fungal {{communities}} with decisive roles in decomposition and plant nutrition. Difficulties in studying soil fungi have limited knowledge about how fungal communities are shaped. The {{objective of this}} thesis was to study factors influencing soil fungal communities, aiming for increased understanding of their effect on environmental processes. Using next generation sequencing, responses of fungal communities to their physical-chemical environment, and responses of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to logging, were investigated. In a trenching experiment, this technology, combined with measurements of decomposition and vertical nitrogen distribution, enabled evaluation of direct and indirect involvement of ECM fungi in humus decomposition. Fungal community composition {{was found to be}} significantly related to soil fertility, with ascomycetes dominating in less fertile forests, whereas basidiomycetes increased under more fertile conditions. ECM fungi were found to more or less disappear with complete clear-cutting and reestablishment of ECM diversity took several decades. However, a clear positive relationship between the amount of retention trees and ECM fungal species richness and abundance was found. By excluding ECM fungi, nitrogen limitation of saprotrophic fungi was released, increasing litter decomposition rates. However, this effect was overshadowed by an almost complete loss of oxidative enzyme activities in deeper <b>humus</b> <b>layers,</b> associated with removal of ECM fungi by trenching. Our results indicate ECM fungi to be the principal decomposers of boreal forest <b>humus</b> <b>layers.</b> This, together with the predictability of soil fungal communities, reinforces the importance and ability of integrating rhizosphere microorganisms, in particular ECM fungi, in forest ecosystem models...|$|R
