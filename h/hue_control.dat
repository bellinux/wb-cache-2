50|$|The {{photograph}} is of a Space Command 600, {{and was the}} remote control designed for use with their color television receivers. The Space Command 600 was introduced in 1965 and this particular design was in use {{until the end of}} the 1972 model year. The Space Command 600 remote control had an additional, distinctive feature—this remote control could also adjust color hues. By pressing the mute button on the remote, a relay would be activated at the television in which to transfer the VHF motor drive tuner circuit to the motorized <b>hue</b> <b>control.</b> This would allow the user to adjust the hue in increments by depressing the channel up or down buttons on the remote control, and restore the television to normal tuning operation when the mute button was pressed again (mute off).|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s some Japanese set {{manufacturers}} developed decoding systems {{to avoid paying}} royalties to Telefunken. The Telefunken license covered any decoding method that relied on the alternating subcarrier phase to reduce phase errors. This included very basic PAL decoders that relied on the human eye to average out the odd/even line phase errors. One solution was to use a 1H analog delay line to allow decoding of only the odd or even lines. For example, the chrominance on odd lines would be switched directly through to the decoder and also be stored in the delay line. Then, on even lines, the stored odd line would be decoded again. This method effectively converted PAL to NTSC. Such systems suffered hue errors and other problems inherent in NTSC and required {{the addition of a}} manual <b>hue</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was to {{find out}} the change of the hue {{lightness}} saturation after the change of composition of dyeing liquor. The reactive dye Bezaktiv rot S-B was used for dyeing cotton. Dyeing was performed in the laboratory by exhaustion method with two concentrations of dye 0, 5 and 2 %. The influence of the change of alkali and electrolyte concentration additions to dyeing bath liquor at different liquors dye ratio was studied. Sodium chloride and Glauber's salt as elektrolyte were used. The dyed samples were washed and then fixed by two types of fixative agents REWIN ACP and REWIN EL. After that the measurement of <b>hue</b> <b>control</b> and the evaluation of fastness to water and rubbing fastness were done. The results were displayed in L*a*b* space and CIE differences between chosen standards and samples were performed by Datacolor International DC 3890...|$|E

A limited effort, directed at improved methods of display of TM Band 6 data, has concentrated on implementation of intensity hue and saturation displays using the Band 6 data to <b>control</b> <b>hue.</b> These displays tend {{to give the}} appearance of high resolution thermal data and make whole scene thermal interpretation easier by color coding thermal data in a manner that aids visual interpretation.

500|$|Aether is a space {{adventure}} {{game with}} washed-out pastel colors and a varying soundtrack {{consisting of a}} piano, synthesizer, guitar, and percussion piece. There are four monochrome planets to explore, which have subdued <b>hues.</b> Players <b>control</b> a lonely boy from Earth and an octopus-like monster he befriends. The monster's tongue is used to propel itself and the boy through space and onto other planets. Each planet has a unique soundtrack that gets louder as you approach it. Each moon or planet exerts gravity over the player character, requiring momentum {{to escape from the}} planet's orbit. To escape a planet, the tongue must first be latched onto a cloud floating above the planet's surface, which can then be used to swing the player around. By propelling themselves from the initial cloud using swinging momentum, players can latch onto the next and repeat the process to leave the planet's orbit. After reaching space the process is repeated with stars and asteroids. In space the lack of gravity causes the player to drift until the direction is changed by swinging on another object.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{potassium}} cations on {{the shade of}} the ultramarine blue pigment system has been investigated through analysis of commercial materials, ion exchange reactions of sodium-form ultramarine blue and a detailed study of the effect of adding potassium sources to ultramarine precursor mixtures. Incorporation of potassium cations has the result of producing redder shade material and the replacement of around 20 % of the sodium in the standard reaction mixture produces the optimised red-shade pigment. The origin of this <b>hue</b> <b>control</b> may be a direct effect, involving interaction of potassium ions with the ultramarine blue structure and the S 3 ? chromophore or, more likely, potassium ions aids the stabilisation of S 3 ? within the sodalite framework during the ultramarine blue formation process. In the commercial process, the role of the potassium source in red shade formation may be performed by the incorporation of potassium-rich feldspar additives...|$|E
40|$|This study {{confirms}} that infants, like older children, {{are capable of}} responding "categorically" to stimuli of different shape if these are similar in hue. 24 infants (mean age 20. 0 weeks) were familiarized to a stimulus in 1 hue (dominant wavelength 515 nm) and in either of 2 different shapes (face of a bear or a rabbit) and then presented with 4 main test comparisons in which the familiar stimulus was paired with a novel stimulus in either the familiar or the alternate (novel) shape and in a novel hue from the same or a different category (dominant wavelengths being 548 and 482 nm, respectively, and equally different from the familiar hue). Infants displayed a preference for the novel stimuli only in the new-category <b>hue.</b> <b>Control</b> tasks with a further 40 infants (same mean age as experimental group) eliminated alternative explanations of this pattern of response in terms of differential brightness of the hues, hue preferences, or inability to discriminate the shapes...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The {{quality of}} a digital image {{pipeline}} relies greatly on its color reproduction which should at a minimum handle the color constancy, and the final judgment of the excellence of the pipeline is made through subjective observations by humans. This dissertation addresses a few topics surrounding the color processing of digital image pipelines from a practical point of view. Color processing fundamentals {{will be discussed in}} the beginning to form a background understanding for the topics that follow. A memory color assisted illuminant estimation algorithm is then introduced after a review of memory colors and some modeling techniques. Spectral sensitivity of the camera is required by many color constancy algorithms but such data is often not readily available. To tackle this problem, an alternative method to the spectral characterization for color constancy parameter calibration is proposed. <b>Hue</b> <b>control</b> in color reproduction can be of great importance especially when memory colors are concerned. A hue constrained matrix optimization algorithm is introduced to address this issue, followed by a psychophysical study to systematically arrive at a recommendation for the optimized preferred color reproduction. At the end, a color constancy algorithm for high dynamic range scenes observing multiple illuminants is proposed...|$|E
50|$|For the {{remainder}} of Trịnh Sâm's life, the Trịnh allowed emperor Gia Long (Nguyễn Ánh), the last surviving member of the Nguyễn Lords, to make repeated attempts to re-take the south. The Tây Sơn brothers were too busy fighting with the Nguyễn loyalist rather than worry about the Trịnh in the north. In 1782 as Trịnh Sâm was dying, he tried to leave control over Vietnam to his son (from his favorite concubine, Đặng Thị Huệ), Trịnh Man, but his rightful heir, Trịnh Khai organized an army and fought against his half-brother. Although he was successful, this civil war fatally divided the Trịnh at a critical time when the Tây Sơn (under Nguyễn <b>Huệ)</b> were gaining <b>control</b> over the south.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to test the effects of copper on the color of pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in vivo. Forty-eight shrimps (L. vannamei) were exposed to a low concentration of copper (1 mg/L; experimental treatment) and forty-eight shrimps were used as controls (no copper added to the water). As a result of this experiment, it was found that shrimps with more copper are significantly redder than those designated as <b>controls</b> (<b>hue</b> (500 - 700 nm) : P= 0. 0015; red chroma (625 - 700 nm) : P< 0. 0001). These results indicate that redder color may result from exposure to copper and challenge the commonly held view that highly pigmented shrimps are healthier than pale shrimps...|$|R
50|$|Painting : His oil {{paintings}} and pastels are especially striking for {{their sense of}} colour. During the same years in which Dutch artists like Dick Ket, Raoul Hynckes or Pyke Koch were aiming at casting rough, mysterious or dream-like images into an impeccable, yet somewhat frozen workmanship, Patrick Bakker remained attached to the ideals of high art and a sensual, expressive, even expressionist technique. His subjects are traditional - nudes, portraits, still-lives and landscapes - yet he portrayed them with continual colour experiments. This is, probably, his most personal contribution to painting. Whereas the German expressionists or the Dutch painters of the De Ploeg movement (except perhaps George Martens) liked to use primary colours, Patrick Bakker, whilst staying clear of any hint of impressionism, cultivated bitter-sweet and dissonant juxtapositions, introducing often deliberately dirty <b>hues,</b> with a <b>controlled</b> violence of expression.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} color tunable Dy 3 +/Eu 3 + co-doped CsGd(MoO 4) (2) (CGM) {{phosphors}} were {{prepared by the}} conventional solid state reaction. The crystal structure, morphology, vibrational modes, luminescence properties and energy transfer mechanism were investigated. Upon near ultraviolet `(n-UV) excitation, Dy 3 +/Eu 3 + co-doped phosphors exhibit the characteristics blue (F- 4 (9. 2) -> H- 6 (15 / 2)), yellow (F- 4 (9. 2) -> H- 6 (13 / 2)) and red (D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (2)) emission corresponding to transitions of Dy 3 +and Eu 3 +ions. By changing the doping concentration of Dy 3 + and Eu 3 +, the emission <b>hue</b> could be <b>controlled</b> via the energy transfer mechanism. The energy transfer efficiency and critical distance of Dy 3 + and Eu 3 + have been calculated. The calculated chromaticity coordinates and color correlated temperature of co-doped phosphors lie at the F- 4 warm white points of standard illuminants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Fifteen color {{normal and}} dichromatic {{observers}} {{participated in a}} CRT image display study conducted via the Internet at the The Rochester Institute of Technology. The groups consisted of three color normal and twelve color deficient observers. All observers were given identical visual tests. The tests, investigated one factor consisting of multi-hued graphics. The graphics were designed to evoke a response from the observers to help the experimenter investigate the difficulties associated with the inability to discriminate colors. Twelve of the observers (eleven males and one female) had been previously classified with dichromatic color vision deficiency, as established by the Ishihara pseudoisochromatic test and /or the Farnsworth- Munsell 100 <b>Hue</b> test. The <b>control</b> (color normal) group consisted of two male and one female observers. The experiment indicated that specialized color deficient-based palettes are beneficial in selecting color schemes to aid the dichromatic consumer. Once multimedia designers become aware of this discrimination process experienced by the color deficient observer, they can respond with appropriate color combinations to minimize these visual challenges in the daily flow of electronic information via CRT image display...|$|R
40|$|Cortical {{visual area}} V 4 in macaque monkeys {{has a large}} {{proportion}} of neurons that are sensitive to the wavelength or to the color of light. We tested its role in hue discrimination by removing it in macaque monkeys trained to discriminate small differences in hue. Hue discrimination thresholds were permanently elevated in 4 macaque monkeys in which V 4 was removed bilaterally. In contrast, there was no impairment in achromatic intensity thresholds tested in an identical manner. However, the discrimination of pattern and orientation was also conspicuously impaired, indicating that area V 4 is not concerned solely with processing information about wavelength. The multiple defect is consistent with evidence that V 4 provides the major cortical visual input to the temporal lobe, where a large range of visual properties is registered. The performance of monkeys with V 4 ablation was compared with that of unoperated control monkeys and monkeys with removal of cortex in the banks and floor of the rostral superior temporal sulcus (STS). Removal of STS had only slight effects on pattern discrimination and none of <b>hue</b> discrimination. To <b>control</b> for the possible effects of inadvertent damage to the visual radiations when removing V 4, the lateral striate cortex was partially ablated bilaterally in a control monkey. This had no effect on any discrimination, despite producing more retrograde damage to the lateral geniculate nuclei than in any monkey with V 4 ablation. The visual disorder following removal of visual area V 4 strikingly resembles the clinical disorder of mild cerebral achromatopsia with associated apperceptive agnosia for objects and patterns...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{widespread}} tendency to associate certain properties of sound with those of colour (e. g., higher pitches with lighter colours). Yet it {{is an open question}} how sound influences chroma or <b>hue</b> when properly <b>controlling</b> for lightness. To examine this, we asked participants to adjust physically equiluminant colours until they 'went best' with certain sounds. For pure tones, complex sine waves and vocal timbres, increases in frequency were associated with increases in chroma. Increasing the loudness of pure tones also increased chroma. Hue associations varied {{depending on the type of}} stimuli. In stimuli that involved only limited bands of frequencies (pure tones, vocal timbres), frequency correlated with hue, such that low frequencies gave blue hues and progressed to yellow hues at 800 Hz. Increasing the loudness of a pure tone was also associated with a shift from blue to yellow. However, for complex sounds that share the same bandwidth of frequencies (100 – 3200 Hz) but that vary in terms of which frequencies have the most power, all stimuli were associated with yellow hues. This suggests that the presence of high frequencies (above 800 Hz) consistently yields yellow hues. Overall we conclude that while pitch–chroma associations appear to flexibly re-apply themselves across a variety of contexts, frequencies above 800 Hz appear to produce yellow hues irrespective of context. These findings reveal new sound–colour correspondences previously obscured through not controlling for lightness. Findings are discussed in relation to understanding the underlying rules of cross-modal correspondences, synaesthesia, and optimising the sensory substitution of visual information through sound...|$|R
40|$|Color vision {{deficiency}} (CVD) is {{the inability}} or limited {{ability to recognize}} colors and discriminate between them. A person with this condition perceives a narrower range of colors compared to {{a person with a}} normal color vision. A growing number of researchers are striving {{to improve the quality of}} life for CVD patients. Finding cure, making rectification equipment, providing simulation tools and applying color transformation methods are among the efforts being made by researchers in this field. In this study we concentrate on recoloring digital images in such a way that users with CVD, especially dichromats, perceive more details from the recolored images compared to the original image. The main focus is to give the CVD user a chance to find information within the picture which they could not perceive before. However, this transformed image might look strange or unnatural to users with normal color vision. During this color transformation process, the goal is to keep the overall contrast of the image constant while adjusting the colors that might cause confusion for the CVD user. First, each pixel in the RGB-image is converted to HSV color space in order to be able to <b>control</b> <b>hue,</b> saturation and intensity for each pixel and then safe and problematic hue ranges need to be found. The method for recognizing these ranges was inspired by a condition called “unilateral dichromacy” in which the patient has normal color vision in one eye and dichromacy in another. A special grid-like color card is designed, having constant saturation and intensity over the entire image, while the hue smoothly changes from one block to another to cover the entire hue range. The next step is to simulate the way this color card is perceived by a dichromatic user and finally to find the colors that are perceived identically from two images and the ones that differ too much. This part makes our method highly customizable and we can apply it to other types of CVD, even personalize it for the color vision of a specific observer. The resulting problematic colors need to be dealt with by shifting the hue or saturation based on some pre-defined rules. The results for the method have been evaluated both objectively and subjectively. First, we simulated a set of images as they would be perceived by a dichromat and compared them with simulated view of our transformed images. The results clearly show that our recolored images can eliminate a lot of confusion from user and convey more details. Moreover, an online questionnaire was created and 39 users with CVD confirmed that the transformed images allow them to perceive more information compared to the original images...|$|R
