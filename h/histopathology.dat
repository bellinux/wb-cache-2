5|$|Human anatomy, {{physiology}} and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical {{students in their}} first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as <b>histopathology</b> and radiology.|$|E
5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for <b>histopathology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for <b>histopathology</b> and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{classification}} schema {{are used}} for prognosis and include <b>histopathology,</b> grade, stage, and genomic profiling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Histopathology</b> {{processes}} solid tissue {{removed from}} the body (biopsies) for evaluation at the microscopic level.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, IHC {{is used in}} <b>histopathology</b> for the {{diagnosis}} of specific types of cancers based on molecular markers.|$|E
25|$|Sir Nicholas Wright – British academic, Professor of <b>Histopathology,</b> Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London.|$|E
25|$|TNM staging, in {{combination}} with <b>histopathology,</b> grade and genomic profiling, {{is used for the}} purpose of prognosis, and to determine whether additional treatment is warranted.|$|E
25|$|Anatomic pathology: units {{included}} {{here are}} <b>histopathology,</b> cytopathology, and electron microscopy. Academically, each unit is studied alone in one course. Other courses pertaining to this section include anatomy, physiology, histology, pathology, and pathophysiology.|$|E
25|$|Most {{tumors of the}} {{salivary glands}} differ from the common carcinomas {{of the head and}} neck in cause, <b>histopathology,</b> {{clinical}} presentation, and therapy, Other uncommon tumors arising in the head and neck include teratomas, adenocarcinomas, adenoid cystic carcinomas, and mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Rarer still are melanomas and lymphomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.|$|E
25|$|<b>Histopathology</b> - the {{microscopic}} examination of stained tissue sections using histological techniques. The standard stains are haematoxylin and eosin, {{but many others}} exist. The use of haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides to provide specific diagnoses based on morphology {{is considered to be}} the core skill of anatomic pathology. The science of staining tissues sections is called histochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Part 3 (1.5 years) – Pathology (<b>Histopathology),</b> Medical Microbiology, Chemical Pathology, Hematology, Forensic Pathology, Immunology and Toxicology. A {{professional}} exam {{is written}} {{at the end}} of the third year and the student has to pass to proceed. There are also surgery and medicine rotations during the year. Also, the students cover most of the basic Pharmacology during the third stage of the degrees.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparing}} tissues for histology or <b>histopathology,</b> d-limonene {{is often}} used as a less toxic substitute for xylene when clearing dehydrated specimens. Clearing agents are liquids miscible with alcohols (such as ethanol or isopropanol) and with melted paraffin wax, in which specimens are embedded to facilitate cutting of thin sections for microscopy. In traditional medicine, d-limonene is marketed to relieve gastroesophageal reflux disease and heartburn.|$|E
25|$|Gross {{examination}} - {{the examination}} of diseased tissues with the naked eye. This is important especially for large tissue fragments, because the disease can often be visually identified. It is also at this step that the pathologist selects areas that will be processed for <b>histopathology.</b> The eye can sometimes be aided with a magnifying glass or a stereo microscope, especially when examining parasitic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Hawkins et al.. {{demonstrated}} the toxic effects of CYN by mouse bioassay, using an extract {{of the original}} Palm Island strain. Acutely poisoned mice displayed anorexia, diarrhoea and gasping respiration. Autopsy results revealed haemorrhages in the lungs, livers, kidneys, small intestines and adrenal glands. <b>Histopathology</b> revealed dose-related necrosis of hepatocytes, lipid accumulation, and fibrin thrombi formation in blood vessels of the liver and lungs, along with varying epithelial cell necrosis {{in areas of the}} kidneys.|$|E
25|$|<b>Histopathology.</b> Breast {{cancer is}} usually {{classified}} primarily by its histological appearance. Most breast cancers {{are derived from}} the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and these cancers are classified as ductal or lobular carcinoma. Carcinoma in situ is growth of low-grade cancerous or precancerous cells within a particular tissue compartment such as the mammary duct without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, invasive carcinoma does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, Deer {{expanded}} on laboratory {{aspects of}} his findings in {{a report in the}} BMJ, recounting how normal clinical <b>histopathology</b> results (obtained from the Royal Free hospital) had been subjected to wholesale changes, from normal to abnormal, in the medical school and published in The Lancet. On 2 January 2011, Deer provided two tables comparing the data on the twelve children, showing the original hospital data and the data with the wholesale changes as used in the 1998 The Lancet article.|$|E
25|$|Also, a {{radiological}} {{procedure is}} {{available as a}} reliable and accurate test for SS. A contrast agent is injected into the parotid duct, which opens from the cheek into the vestibule of the mouth opposite {{the neck of the}} upper second molar tooth. <b>Histopathology</b> studies should show focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through ultrasound examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid sialography or salivary scintigraphy, and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.|$|E
25|$|EDTA finds many {{specialized}} uses in the biomedical laboratories, {{such as in}} veterinary ophthalmology as an anticollagenase {{to prevent}} the worsening of corneal ulcers in animals. In tissue culture EDTA {{is used as a}} chelating agent that binds to calcium and prevents joining of cadherins between cells, preventing clumping of cells grown in liquid suspension, or detaching adherent cells for passaging. In <b>histopathology,</b> EDTA {{can be used as a}} decalcifying agent making it possible to cut sections using a microtome once the tissue sample is demineralised.|$|E
25|$|In the 5th category, the Trainee {{immediately}} starts Specialty Training (ST1 {{instead of}} CT1) progressing up to Consultant level without break or further competitive application process (Run-Through Training). Most of the run-through schemes are in stand-alone specialties (such as Radiology, Public Health or <b>Histopathology),</b> {{but there are}} also a few traditionally Surgical specialities which can be entered directly without completing Core Surgical Training - Neurosurgery, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Ophthalmology. The length of this training varies, for example General Practice is 3 years while Radiology is 5 years.|$|E
25|$|Slătineanu {{was head}} of the public health {{directorate}} from 1918 to 1920. He continued developing the laboratory, which eventually had three sections: bacteriology, physical chemistry and biochemistry, and hematology and <b>histopathology.</b> Its professionalism brought success: work contracts brought significant sums; medical, veterinary, military and civilian authorities sought its services; and it certified the quality of laboratory glass manufactured domestically. In 1919, while Cantacuzino was attending the Paris Peace Conference as a delegate, Slătineanu taught at the experimental medicine department in Bucharest. In 1920, he initiated a course on infectious diseases and set up an isolation unit for contagious diseases at Sfântul Spiridon Hospital in Iași.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} there are mainly {{three types of}} Medical Laboratories as per the types of investigations carried out. 1. Clinical Pathology: Haematology, <b>Histopathology,</b> Cytology, Routine Pathology2. Clinical Microbiology: Bacteriology, Mycobacteriology, Virology, Mycology, Parasitology, Immunology, Serology.3. Clinical Biochemistry: Biochemical analysis, Hormonal assays etc.Blood Banks:- Blood bank is a separate body. Its laboratory need Microbiological analysis for infectious diseases that {{may be found in}} blood. Pathology to observe Blood grouping, Haematology & cross matching reactions. It also involves PRO department for the communication & contact for blood donations etc.. Molecular diagnostic lab or cytogenetics and molecular biology lab is the latest addition to the three types of medical laboratories listed above in {{many countries}}.|$|E
25|$|NOAA awarded TDI-Brooks International with {{a five-year}} {{contract}} to analyze sediment and bivalve tissue chemistry from September 21, 2009 to September 20, 2014. TDI-Brooks has also conducted the testing for the previous ten years from 1999-2009. TDI-Brooks and their affiliate B Laboratories conducts the organic chemical analysis, Rutgers University is subcontracted to conduct the <b>histopathology</b> analysis, and Texas A is subcontracted to conduct the metal and nutrient analysis. Due to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill the resources at these labs were shifted towards chemical analyses of the high-priority samples for the Gulf of Mexico. This caused significant delays, in some cases {{of more than a}} year, of analysis results for the Mussel Watch Program.|$|E
500|$|The <b>histopathology</b> of endometrial cancers {{is highly}} diverse. The most common finding is a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is {{composed}} of numerous, small, crowded glands {{with varying degrees of}} nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and stratification. This often appears on a background of endometrial hyperplasia. Frank adenocarcinoma may be distinguished from atypical hyperplasia by the finding of clear stromal invasion, or [...] "back-to-back" [...] glands which represent nondestructive replacement of the endometrial stroma by the cancer. With progression of the disease, the myometrium is infiltrated.|$|E
500|$|Moderate {{or heavy}} {{clinical}} infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed {{on the basis}} of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though [...] "injury or deficiency in dietary tryptophan and ascorbic acid can evoke similar signs", so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the fish's cartilage. [...] In heavy infections, only examining cartilage microscopically may be needed to find spores. In less severe infections, the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the proteases pepsin and trypsin (pepsin-trypsin digest—PTD) before looking for spores. [...] The head and other tissues can be further examined using <b>histopathology</b> to confirm whether the location and morphology of the spores matches what is known for M. cerebralis. Serological identification of spores in tissue sections using an antibody raised against the spores is also possible. [...] Parasite identity can also be confirmed using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the 415 base pair 18S rRNA gene from M. cerebralis. Fish should be screened at the life stage most susceptible to the parasites, with particular focus on fish in aquaculture units.|$|E
2500|$|... “The <b>histopathology</b> {{component}} of the Mussel Watch Program, quantifies the stage of gamete development, and the prevalence of nearly 70 diseases and parasites found in mussels and oysters. Trends in <b>histopathology</b> data may help to assess the effects of global warming.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Recorded {{descriptions}} {{of the effects of}} AIS date back hundreds of years, although significant understanding of its underlying <b>histopathology</b> did not occur until the 1950s. [...] The taxonomy and nomenclature associated with androgen insensitivity went through a significant evolution that paralleled this understanding.|$|E
2500|$|Ovarian cancers are {{classified}} {{according to the}} microscopic appearance of their structures (histology or <b>histopathology).</b> Histology dictates many aspects of clinical treatment, management, and prognosis. The gross pathology of ovarian cancers is very similar regardless of histologic type: tumors have solid and cystic masses. According to SEER, the types of ovarian cancers in women age 20 and over are: ...|$|E
2500|$|Osteosarcoma is {{also the}} most common bone tumor in cats, {{although}} not as frequently encountered, and most typically affects the rear legs. [...] The cancer is generally less aggressive in cats than in dogs, so amputation alone can lead to a significant survival time in many affected cats, though post-amputation chemotherapy is recommended when a high grade is confirmed on <b>histopathology.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "The central corneal {{flattening}} {{obtained by}} radial diamond knife incisions has been duplicated by radial laser incisions in 18 enucleated human eyes. The incisions, made by 193 nm far-ultraviolet light radiation emitted by the excimer laser, produced corneal flattening ranging from 0.12 to 5.35 diopters. Both {{the depth of}} the corneal incisions and the degree of central corneal flattening correlated with the laser energy applied. <b>Histopathology</b> revealed the remarkably smooth edges of the laser incisions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Usually, {{treatment}} of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for <b>histopathology</b> to check {{that they are not}} a more dangerous type of tumor such as a liposarcoma. This last point can be important as the characteristics of a [...] "bump" [...] are not known until after it is removed and medically examined.|$|E
2500|$|By 1895 the {{institute}} was outgrowing its Turbot Street premises; work had expanded beyond pleuropneumonia to tuberculosis, redwater, tetanus, and as time permitted, leprosy. The laboratory featured bacteria culturing apparatus, and <b>histopathology</b> preparation using paraffin. The institute's [...] "museum" [...] included specimens that showed advanced bovine tuberculosis (communicable to humans and a risk before milk pasteurisation), collected from apparently healthy cattle which supported Pound in urging {{for the establishment}} of public abattoirs and inspection of carcasses.|$|E
2500|$|Functional tests [...] {{may include}} {{electroretinogram}} and visual field testing. [...] Diagnostic confirmation and an estimation of disease severity may involve imaging tests such as retinography, fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography, {{optical coherence tomography}} and ultrasound. For example, indocyanine green angiography may detect continuing choroidal inflammation in the eyes without clinical symptoms or signs. Ocular MRI may be helpful and auditory symptoms should undergo audiologic testing. <b>Histopathology</b> findings from eye and skin are discussed by Walton.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Histopathology</b> {{refers to}} the {{microscopic}} examination of various forms of human tissue. [...] Specifically, in clinical medicine, <b>histopathology</b> {{refers to the}} examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides. [...] This contrasts with the methods of cytopathology, which uses free cells or tissue fragments. [...] Histopathological examination of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. [...] The tissue {{is removed from the}} body of an organism and then placed in a fixative that stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay. The most common fixative is formalin, although frozen section fixing is also common. [...] To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast. [...] Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. [...] The histological slides are then interpreted diagnostically and the resulting pathology report describes the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. [...] In the case of cancer, this represents the tissue diagnosis required for most treatment protocols.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{who do not}} {{advocate}} {{food irradiation}} argue the safety of irradiated food is not scientifically proven {{because there are a}} lack of long-term studies [...] {{in spite of the fact}} that hundreds of animal feeding studies of irradiated food, including multigenerational studies, have been performed since 1950. Endpoints investigated have included subchronic and chronic changes in metabolism, <b>histopathology,</b> function of most systems, reproductive effects, growth, teratogenicity, and mutagenicity. A large number of studies have been performed; meta-studies have supported the safety of irradiated food.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that visual examination, or monitoring, cannot 'clear' a person of risk. It can only say what their condition is at the time. If at any point in their life the person develops numerous polyps, this would tend to suggest a diagnosis of FAP. (Absence of polyps does not 'clear' a person, as polyps can develop later in life; also a few polyps over time are not that uncommon in people without FAP. However a substantial number or a profusion of polyps would generally tend to suggest a diagnosis of FAP, and <b>histopathology</b> to determine whether or not any polyps are cancerous.) ...|$|E
