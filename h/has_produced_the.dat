5|$|Wall, {{along with}} Tommy Tallarico, <b>has</b> <b>produced</b> <b>the</b> Video Games Live concert series, which began on July 6, 2005.

The series is international and ongoing, with more than 70 shows planned for 2009. Although Wall composed the soundtracks to three games released in 2005 including the award-winning score to Jade Empire, his works released since then have been 2007's Mass Effect and 2010's Mass Effect 2.
