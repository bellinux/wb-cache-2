2500|$|The {{energy balance}} {{can be done}} in two balance types: 1) Balance of delivered/imported and {{exported}} <b>energy</b> (<b>monitoring</b> phase as self-consumption of energy generated on-site can be included); 2) Balance between (weighted) energy demand and (weighted) energy generation (for design phase as normally end users temporal consumption patterns -e.g. for lighting, appliances, etc.- are lacking). Alternatively a balance based on monthly net values in which only residuals per month are summed up to an annual balance is imaginable. This can be seen either as a load/generation balance or as a special case of import/export balance where a “virtual monthly self-consumption” is assumed (see figure 2 [...] and compare).|$|E

40|$|The {{smart grid}} {{initiative}} has encouraged utility companies worldwide to rollout new and smarter versions of energy meters. Before an extensive rollout, {{which is both}} labor-intensive and incurs high capital costs, consumers need to be incentivized to reap the long-term benefits of smart grid. Off-the-shelf <b>energy</b> <b>monitors</b> can provide consumers with an insight of such potential benefits. Since <b>energy</b> <b>monitors</b> are owned by the consumer, the consumer has greater control over data which significantly reduces privacy and data confidentiality concerns. We evaluate several existing <b>energy</b> <b>monitors</b> using an online technical survey and online product literature. For consumers, the use of different off-the-shelf <b>energy</b> <b>monitors</b> can help demonstrate the potential gains of smart grid. Our survey indicates a trend towards incorporation of state-of-the-art capabilities, like appliance level monitoring through load disaggregation in <b>energy</b> <b>monitors,</b> which can encourage effective consumer participation.

40|$|Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS), e. g. <b>energy</b> <b>monitors,</b> are {{intermediary}} {{products that}} can visualize, manage, and/or <b>monitor</b> the <b>energy</b> {{use of other}} products or whole households. HEMS increasingly receive attention for their role in energy conservation in households. A literature review and a case study examine the mid-term effectiveness (more than 4 months) of HEMS. The case study {{presents the results of}} a 15 -month pilot with a domestic <b>energy</b> <b>monitor</b> in the Netherlands. It explores the extent to which participants manage to sustain their initial electricity savings over time, with a special focus on the development of habitual energy-saving behaviour. The results show that the initial savings in electricity consumption of 7. 8 % after 4 months could not be sustained in the medium- to long-term. A second finding is that certain groups of people seem more receptive to energy-saving interventions than others. These participants quickly develop new habits and exhibit larger savings than other participants. Obviously, a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach for home <b>energy</b> <b>monitors</b> cannot be justified.

40|$|Double-pulsed 2 -micron {{integrated}} path {{differential absorption}} (IPDA) lidar {{is well suited}} for atmospheric CO 2 remote sensing. The IPDA lidar technique relies on wavelength differentiation between strong and weak absorbing features of the gas normalized to the transmitted energy. In the double-pulse case, each shot of the transmitter produces two successive laser pulses separated by a short interval. Calibration of the transmitted pulse energies is required for accurate CO 2 measurement. Design and calibration of a 2 -micron double-pulse laser <b>energy</b> <b>monitor</b> is presented. The design {{is based on an}} InGaAs pin quantum detector. A high-speed photo-electromagnetic quantum detector was used for laser-pulse profile verification. Both quantum detectors were calibrated using a reference pyroelectric thermal detector. Calibration included comparing the three detection technologies in the single-pulsed mode, then comparing the quantum detectors in the double-pulsed mode. In addition, a self-calibration feature of the 2 -micron IPDA lidar is presented. This feature allows one to monitor the transmitted laser energy, through residual scattering, with a single detection channel. This reduces the CO 2 measurement uncertainty. IPDA lidar ground validation for CO 2 measurement is presented for both calibrated <b>energy</b> <b>monitor</b> and self-calibration options. The calibrated <b>energy</b> <b>monitor</b> resulted in a lower CO 2 measurement bias, while self-calibration resulted in a better CO 2 temporal profiling when compared to the in situ sensor...|$|R
