5|$|Volcanism in the Spanish Creek and Ray Lake {{areas were}} synglacial but {{continued}} after the glacial ice had melted away. Two cinder cones, known as Flourmill Cone and Pointed Stick Cone, {{were created in}} the Spanish Creek area. Lava <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two cinder cones lie on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, indicating an early Holocene age.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E

5|$|Gareloi is {{the northernmost}} volcano of the Delarof Group, a {{subgroup}} of the Aleutian Islands. It {{is composed of}} two craters, the older of which is covered by lava flows running to the northwest and southern coasts. The northern crater is small, with a feature suggesting dome collapse in its northwest flank. The southern flank, higher up and considerably larger, contains fumarolic activity. A fissure created by Gareloi's 1929 eruption runs along the southern summit of the volcano. Steep sea cliffs on the southwest {{side of the island}} cut into the older caldera. Three masses offshore of the island were produced by debris <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> volcano.|$|E
5|$|The St. Joseph River <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{east end}} of the city turning north near the city center, giving South Bend its name at the bend in the river. South Bend {{is located on the}} North-South {{continental}} divide, and the river flows northwest into Lake Michigan. The downtown area is located in the north-central part of the city along the St. Joseph River. Notre Dame, Indiana, is directly adjacent to the north. The city extends further north on the west side, mainly with manufacturing and distribution facilities near the South Bend International Airport. Mishawaka, Indiana, is adjacent to South Bend's east side.|$|E
5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E

5|$|Geologists have dated and {{documented}} dozens of major eruptions over the volcano's long history, bridging the long gap between Kīlauea's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation. Historical lava <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> volcano are generally recovered by scientists {{in one of}} three ways. The oldest flows, dating back 275,000 to 225,000 years, have been recovered from Kīlauea's submerged southern slope by ship-towed remotely operated vehicles. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, submerged preshield-stage eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was still a rising seamount that had not yet breached the ocean surface, and their surface exposure is unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Loa's {{most recent}} {{eruption}} occurred from March24 to April15, 1984. No recent eruptions {{of the volcano}} have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, {{and the city of}} Hilo is partly built on lava <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century. Because of the potential hazards it poses to population centers, Mauna Loa is part of the Decade Volcanoes program, which encourages studies of the world's most dangerous volcanoes. Mauna Loa has been monitored intensively by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory since 1912. Observations of the atmosphere are undertaken at the Mauna Loa Observatory, and of the Sun at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, both located near the mountain's summit. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park covers the summit and the southeastern flank of the volcano, and also incorporates Kīlauea, a separate volcano.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E

5|$|The Great Salt Lake is fed {{by three}} major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed {{directly}} or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on the north slope of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river {{by means of the}} Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also starts on the north slope of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas, rather it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River; the Provo River does originate in the Uintas, {{a few miles from the}} Weber and Bear. The Jordan <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north part of Utah Lake into the southeast corner of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|The Irwell, sourced at Cliviger in Lancashire, <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{north and}} for a {{distance}} forms the statutory boundary between Salford and Manchester. Flooding has historically been a problem and the Irwell has seen much modification along its course in Salford with some bends being removed, channelisation, {{and the construction of}} levees and bank reinforcements. Salford has expanded along the river valley to the north and south and on to higher ground on the valley sides at Irlams o' th' Height and Higher Broughton. Unconsolidated glacial deposits along the riverbank at Broughton have caused several landslides along the riverbank. The City Engineer's Department of the City of Salford recorded one such incident near Great Clowes Street in February 1882, and others in 1886, 1887 and 1888. In 1892 the road was propped with timber supports. The tram service along the road was discontinued in 1925, and the road closed to mechanically propelled vehicles in January 1926. Further slips saw the road closed completely in July 1933, and although no substantial movements have been recorded since 1948 slow subsidence around the Cliff continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E
