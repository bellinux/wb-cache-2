40|$|Although {{the ideas}} of the {{knowledge}} society and knowledge based economy originate from the 1960 s and 1970 s, they became popular as a policy idea especially {{at the end of the}} twentieth century. Developed and less developed countries alike portray the path towards the knowledge society as the way forward, bringing economic prosperity and social advancement. The policies linked to these ideas are currently travelling throughout the world. In adapting to this move towards knowledge societies, universities apply specific organisational forms which have gradually evolved into <b>global</b> <b>models.</b> This spread of globalised models implies processes of convergence, isomorphism, homogenisation or standardisation. On the surface, a convergence of higher education and science policies seems to have occurred in the past decade or so. A closer look at organisational practices however reveals more local variation in the adoption of these <b>global</b> university <b>models</b> for the knowledge society. This occurs on the one hand through the loose coupling between policy and practice. On the other hand, <b>global</b> <b>models</b> are re-invented locally, moulding the <b>global</b> <b>models</b> into local shapes. It is argued in this paper that, although many <b>global</b> <b>models</b> may be adopted by governments and universities around the world, in their implementation they become either symbolic reforms or they become localised adaptations of <b>global</b> <b>models,</b> ultimately leading to diversity in these <b>global</b> <b>models</b> after they have become institutionalised...|$|R

In this paper, we mathematically develop this method {{in such a way that}} the local data {{can be used for}} Moho modelling. Two integral formulae are presented, one for integrating the data and one for their inversion. The kernels of both integrals are well-behaving meaning that the contribution of far-zone quantities being integrated are not very significant in the results. Both of these methods are applied for computing the Moho model of Iran and their results are compared to the Moho model determined based on the <b>global</b> <b>models.</b> Consistency of the computed Moho models from the simulated data and the <b>global</b> <b>models</b> verifies the correctness of both approaches. The presented methods are consistent even for the case of using real data. Numerical results show that the minimum value of the Moho models derived by the simulated data and <b>global</b> <b>models</b> are about 31 km, whilst those derived from the real data are about 3 km smaller. Similarly, the mean value of Moho depths derived from real data is about 1 km smaller than that from the <b>global</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since its}} foundation, IIASA has assumed a {{monitoring}} {{role in the}} field of <b>Global</b> <b>Modeling.</b> Whenever a major model reached a state of completion, a IIASA conference was convened in which this model was presented and discussed by a (rapidly emerging) "Global Modeling Community" of scholars actively or passively working on <b>global</b> <b>models</b> or problems of <b>global</b> <b>modeling.</b> The 6 th IIASA <b>Global</b> <b>Modeling</b> Conference, held at IIASA 17 - 20 October 1978, was different in scope in as far as it was mainly devoted to an assessment of the state-of-the-art. The first (major) part of the conference was organized around seven major topics (rather than models); all contributions and papers pertaining to this first part have been incorporated into a book, probably to appear under the title "Groping in the Dark". The second part of the Conference was, as usually, devoted to a presentation and discussion of ongoing modeling work. It is the papers belonging to this second part which should have been assembled in a separate volume. It deserves to be emphasized that these papers should not merely be considered an appendix to "Groping in the Dark"; from what was said above, it should be clear that {{the second part of the}} Conference was sufficiently independent from the first part to warrant a publication per se. As the 7 th IIASA <b>Global</b> <b>Modeling</b> Conference was devoted to a special problem (environmental aspects in <b>global</b> <b>models)</b> and the 8 th Conference will again be devoted to a special problem (international economic modeling), these papers represent a rather comprehensive overview of all major methodological and practical work recently done in <b>global</b> <b>modeling</b> or, in other words, the latest somewhat complete assembly of reports on <b>global</b> <b>modeling</b> work available for sometime to come.
