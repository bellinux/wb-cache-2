40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new species}} of Paracarophenax Cross based on females found attached to the larvae of three Mycetophagus sp. (Coleoptera: Mycetophagidae) collected from the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus (Agaricales: Pleurotaceae) in Alberta, Canada. These mites exhibit a novel means of attachment: instead of grasping one of the host’s setae, adhesive pads are deposited on the host’s cuticle and gripped by the mite’s opposed tarsus I claw and uncinate seta uʺ. We hypothesize that the glue-like material is exuded from the mite’s mouth. The mite’s association with the larval beetle represents pre-parasitic (these mites are parasitoids of beetle eggs) and pre-phoretic (mites disperse on adult beetles) attendance of the host and is a rare record of phoretic (as opposed to <b>feeding)</b> <b>attachment</b> to a pre-adult stage in the Heterostigmatina. This mite is also the first record of the Acarophenacidae from the Mycetophagidae. We provide updated keys to the genera of Acarophenacidae and to species of Paracarophenax and move Paracarophenax dermestidarum to Aethiophenax, i. e.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Fluid and {{sediment}} dynamics affect benthic community dynamics and structure in manifold ways. We single out three community-structuring {{processes that are}} both strongly affected and amenable to controlled manipulation: microbial population growth, faunal recruitment, and particle <b>feeding.</b> <b>Attachment</b> and colony growth rates of microbes depend {{on the details of}} near-bed fluid exchange. Their emigration and colony growth rates are affected by erosion of microbial films and by abrasion during sediment transport. Recruitment and successional patterns of metazoans, especially those resulting from the settlement of weakly swimming, small larvae and juveniles, also are very sensitive to local variations in boundary layer flow pattern and strength. While the importance of particle fluxes to suspension feeders has long been apparent, the foraging patterns {{of a growing number of}} surface deposit feeders are being found to reflect a dependence upon sediment transport. Although these three processes have spatial and temporal scales amenable to both laboratory and field experimentation, proper dynamic scaling of laboratory model flows may not always be easy. Even the simplest two-phase (particles plus liquids, where particles can be bacteria, floes, larvae, or sediments) flows must match appropriate laboratory and field Reynolds number, Froude number, particle-fluid density (weight per unit volume) ratio, and the ratio of boundary layer thickness to particle size, if the laboratory flow model is to provide accurate results...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis Saxitoxins (STXs) are paralytic {{alkaloids}} {{produced by}} marine dinoflagellates {{in response to}} biotic and abiotic stressors yielding harmful algal blooms. Because STX impacts coastal, near-shore communities {{to a greater extent}} than would be predicted by its relative abundance, it has been referred to as a ‘‘molecule of keystone significance’ ’ in reference to Robert Paine’s Keystone Species Concept. Pisaster ochraceus, the predator upon which Paine’s concept was founded, inhabits waters regularly plagued by harmful algal blooms, but the effects of STX on Pisaster have not yet been inves-tigated. Here, we used laboratory and field experiments to examine the potential consequences of exposure to STX on sea stars ’ <b>feeding,</b> <b>attachment</b> to the substrate, and success in fertilization. Pisaster exhibited similar feeding behaviors when offered non-toxic prey, STX-containing prey, or a combination of the two. Although feeding behavior is unaffected, consumption of STX poses a physiological tradeoff. Sea stars in the laboratory and field had significantly lower thresholds of the force needed to detach them from their substrates after either being exposed to, or consuming, STX. High pressure (or high performance) liquid chromatography analysis indicated an accumulation of STX (and structural analogues) in sea stars ’ viscera, likely due to trophic transfer from toxic prey. Incidence of fertilization tended to decrease when gametes were exposed to high, yet ecologically relevant, STX concentrations of STX. These findings suggest that the molecule of keystone significance, STX, produced during harmful algal blooms extends its impacts to rocky intertidal communities by way of the keystone predator P. ochraceus...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the field}} of engineering, metallurgists {{are looking for ways}} to improve the {{mechanical}} properties of the materials. By doing so it is possible to improve the quality of the materials which in turn gain the International market share. Therefore in the present research work, an investigation has been carried out to fabricate and evaluate the microstructure, strength, micro hardness of chilled composites consisting of nickel matrix and fused SiO 2 particles as the reinforcement (size 40 - 150 μm) in the matrix. The reinforcement being added ranges from 3 to 9 wt. % in steps of 3 %. The resulting composites cast in moulds containing metallic chill blocks (MS & SiC) were tested for their microstructure and mechanical properties. The main objective of the present research is to obtain fine grain Ni/SiO 2 chilled sound composite having very good mechanical properties. A detail of melting and composite preparation is described elsewhere by number of researchers.

40|$|Background and aims: Parenteral {{nutrition}} is a complex, risky procedure {{administered by}} parents {{to children with}} intestinal failure. Previous research has demonstrated that, while psychological and social challenges {{are associated with the}} procedure, families can adapt to their circumstances. The mechanisms through which coping occurs have not been explored. Age-specific exploration, such as <b>feeding</b> and <b>attachment</b> in the early developing child, is also required. This study aims to examine the experience of living and coping with intestinal failure and parenteral nutrition during early childhood (age 0 – 5) from mothers’ perspectives. Methods: Seven mothers with children aged between 0 – 5 years were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: A four stage model of experience emerged from the data with specific tasks to negotiate in each stage: experiencing trauma, preparing to launch, transitioning home, and reflection and re-organising. Adjustment and coping in each stage was mediated by individual, interpersonal and environmental/systemic factors. Conclusions: The model of parenteral nutrition has implications for enhancing clinicians’, policy makers’ and health care providers’ understanding of the experience and impact of this procedure on families with young children.

50|$|Cafeteria roenbergensis is a {{suspension}} feeder, meaning it feeds by filtering suspended bacteria, its primary food source, and other particulate matter from the water. Its two flagella facilitate <b>feeding,</b> locomotion and <b>attachment</b> to substrates. The anterior flagellum {{is responsible for}} locomotion and feeding. It propels the cell in a swift spiral movement. During feeding, it beats at about 40 times per second to create a current of water that moves about 100 micrometers/second. This current brings bacteria to its mouthparts. The food is ingested below {{the base of the}} flagella, which {{is referred to as the}} ventral side. In nonmotile C. roenbergensis cells, (cells that prefer to anchor themselves to a substrate) the posterior flagellum helps attach the organism to a substrate while it is feeding.

This premise is validated by the tendency of current anthelmintics to act on classical neurotransmitter-gated ion channels present on helminth nerve and/or muscle, yielding therapeutic endpoints associated with paralysis and/or death. Supplementary to classical neurotransmitters, helminth nervous systems are peptide-rich and encompass associated biosynthetic and signal transduction components – putative drug targets that remain to be exploited by anthelmintic chemotherapy. At this time, no neuropeptide system-targeting lead compounds have been reported, and given that our basic knowledge of neuropeptide biology in parasitic helminths remains inadequate, the short-term prospects for such drugs remain poor. Here, we review current knowledge of neuropeptide signalling in Nematoda and Platyhelminthes, and highlight a suite of 19 protein families that yield deleterious phenotypes in helminth reverse genetics screens. We suggest that orthologues of some of these peptidergic signalling components represent appealing therapeutic targets in parasitic helminths...|$|R

Here, we focused on the sialome of the European vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes ricinus. Results In the attempt to describe expressed genes and their dynamics throughout the feeding period, we constructed cDNA libraries from four different feeding stages of Ixodes ricinus females: unfed, 24 hours after attachment, four (partially fed) and seven days (fully engorged) after attachment. Approximately 600 randomly selected clones from each cDNA library were sequenced and analyzed. From a total 2304 sequenced clones, 1881 sequences forming 1274 clusters underwent subsequent functional analysis using customized bioinformatics software. Clusters were sorted according to their predicted function and quantitative comparison among the four libraries was made. We found several groups of over-expressed genes associated with feeding that posses a secretion signal and may be involved in tick <b>attachment,</b> <b>feeding</b> or evading the host immune system. Many transcripts clustered into families of related genes with stage-specific expression. Comparison to Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus transcripts was made. Conclusion In addition to a large number of homologues of the known transcripts, we obtained several novel predicted protein sequences.

40|$|Cospeciation {{occurs when}} {{interacting}} groups, such as hosts and parasites, speciate in tandem, generating congruent phylogenies. Cospeciation {{can be a}} neutral process in which parasites speciate merely because they are isolated on diverging host islands. Adaptive evolution may also play a role, but this has seldom been tested. We explored the adaptive basis of cospeciation by using a model system consisting of feather lice (Columbicola) and their pigeon and dove hosts (Columbiformes). We reconstructed phylogenies for both groups by using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences. Both phylogenies were well resolved and well supported. Comparing these phylogenies revealed significant cospeciation and correlated evolution of host and parasite body size. The match in body size suggested that adaptive constraints limit the range of hosts lice can use. We tested this hypothesis by transferring lice among hosts of different sizes to simulate host switches. The results of these experiments showed that lice cannot establish viable populations on novel hosts that differ in size from the native host. To determine why size matters, we measured three components of louse fitness: <b>attachment,</b> <b>feeding,</b> and escape from host defense (preening). Lice could remain attached to, and feed on, hosts varying in size by an order of magnitude. However, they could not escape from preening on novel hosts that differed in size from the native host. Overall, our results suggest that host defense reinforces cospeciation in birds and feather lice by preventing lice from switching between hosts of different sizes...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{diversity}} {{based on}} species traits {{is a powerful}} tool to investigate how changes in species richness and composition affect ecosystem functioning. However, studies aimed at understanding changes in functional diversity over large temporal and spatial scales are still scant. Here we evaluate the combined effect of diversification and species sorting on functional diversity of fossil marine gastropods during the Pliocene-Quaternary transition in the Pacific coast of South America. We analyzed a total of 172 species in 29 Pliocene and 97 Quaternary sites. Each species was characterized according to six functional traits: body size, <b>feeding</b> type, mobility, <b>attachment,</b> life-habit, and larval mode. Functional diversity was estimated according to four indexes (functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) based on functional traits measured. Extrapolated species richness showed a slight yet not significant decrease from the Pliocene to the Quaternary {{despite the fact that}} a large faunal turnover took place; furthermore, a large extinction of Pliocene species (61 - 76 %) was followed by a high pulse of appearances (49 - 56 %) during the Quaternary. Three out of four indices of functional diversity (evenness, divergence and dispersion) increased significantly towards the Quaternary which is more than expected under a random turnover of species. The increase in functional diversity is associated with a loss of large-sized carnivore forms, which tended to be replaced by small-sized grazers. Hence, this trait-selective species turnover, {{even in the absence of}} significant changes in species richness, likely had a large effect and has shaped the functional diversity of present-day assemblages...|$|R
