5000|$|Such an {{assembly}} {{would mean that}} the stabilizers are closely packed: a near bit stabilizer within 0-30 feet of the drill bit, and two more spaced 30 and 60 feet beyond it. If a short <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> is used, then the stabilizers can be even closer together.|$|E
50|$|Collar-mounted tools, {{also known}} as fat tools, cannot {{generally}} be removed from their <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> at the wellsite.

50|$|The <b>Drill</b> <b>Collar</b> Severing Tool {{is often}} used to {{separate}} heavy weight drill pipe or drill collars. The DCST contains an explosive charge {{at either end of the}} tool; both charges are detonated simultaneously. The explosive shock waves meet in the center of the tool and combine to produce a very high energy wave capable of cutting through the thickest of pipe. The severed pipe is typically split and deformed, requiring milling.|$|E

50|$|Swabbing {{occurs when}} bottom hole {{pressure}} is reduced {{due to the}} effects of pulling the drill string upward in the bored hole. During the tripping out of the hole, the space formed by the drillpipe, <b>drill</b> <b>collar,</b> or tubing (which are being removed) must be replaced by something, usually mud. If the rate of tripping out is greater than the rate the mud is being pumped into the void space (created by the removal of the drill string), then swab will occur. If the reduction in bottom hole pressure caused by swabbing is below formation pressure, then a kick will occur.|$|E

50|$|The J.T. Murphy No. 1 Crater is {{the site}} of a {{historic}} oil-drilling accident near Norphlet, Union County, Arkansas. The site is located about 3 mi north and west of Norphlet, off Firetower Road about 3/4 mile (1.21 km) north of its junction with Baugh Street. On May 14, 1922, an oil drilling crew completed a 2000 ft well, dubbed J.T. Murphy No. 1, and began pumping. The early production was entirely natural gas, which began escaping from the <b>drill</b> <b>collar.</b> Eventually it caught fire, burning for several hours, and destroying the derrick. It also caused a series of violent underground explosions. This resulted {{in the creation of a}} crater 450 ft in diameter and 50 ft deep, along with a number of other, shallower, craters. The land, which had previously been in cotton production, was abandoned, and has gradually returned to forest.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} make use of {{acoustic}} wave to transmit the information from near- bit end to a remote bit end, using the finite element method, simulate and analyze the acoustic wave propagating characters of common near-bit drill tools: ordinary <b>drill</b> <b>collar,</b> spiral <b>drill</b> <b>collar,</b> integral straight edge stabilizer, integral spiral stabilizer and screw drill. The results show that: because the form and size of axial cross section are in basic consistent, the ordinary <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> and spiral <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> not only have better characteristics in time domain, no repeated oscillation of waveform occurring, but also have wider bandwidth (up to 4 KHz), and because of the stabilizer section, the acoustic impedance in the axial direction discontinuities and the time domain waveforms of other three kinds of drilling tools appear that not only waveforms have shook repeatedly, but also the width of the pass band has narrowed significantly...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLogging while {{drilling}} (LWD) acoustic measurement provides timely {{analysis for}} borehole stability and drilling optimization in the oilfield. An LWD acoustic tool {{is composed of}} a <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> (thick steel pipe) equipped with an acoustic source and receivers to probe rocks surrounding the borehole. The <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> area is favorable for tool wave propagation from the transmitter to the receiver section of the tool. Minimizing such arrival is critical to avoid unwanted interference with formation signal. In order to decrease such interferences, multiple grooves of different sizes are machined inside the <b>drill</b> <b>collar.</b> Non-homogeneity of the structure constructs a solid filter similar to a solid rod loaded with heavy masses. The stop-band and attenuation of the tool propagation largely depend on the distribution {{and size of the}} grooves machined into the collar. Their characteristics as an acoustic filter are also subject to properties of borehole fluid, where the <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> is immersed. Therefore, the groove pattern has to be designed by modeling with consideration to many factors within given constraints. A method to optimize the groove pattern for given acoustic characteristics is discussed in this paper. The application to real data will illustrate the effectiveness of this methodology...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the removal}} of the pipe on Sedco 135, the {{drilling}} mud suddenly began to flow up towards the surface; by removing the drill-string the well was swabbed [...] leading to a kick. Normally, this flow can be stopped by activating shear rams contained in the blowout preventer (BOP). These rams are designed to sever and seal off the well on the ocean floor; however in this case the <b>drill</b> <b>collars</b> had been brought in line with the BOP and the BOP rams were not able to sever the thick steel walls of the <b>drill</b> <b>collars</b> leading to a catastrophic blowout.|$|R

50|$|Heavyweight {{drill pipe}} (HWDP) {{may be used}} to make the {{transition}} between the <b>drill</b> <b>collars</b> and <b>drill</b> pipe. The function of the HWDP is to provide a flexible transition between the <b>drill</b> <b>collars</b> and the <b>drill</b> pipe. This helps {{to reduce the number of}} fatigue failures seen directly above the BHA. A secondary use of HWDP is to add additional weight to the drill bit. HWDP is most often used as weight on bit in deviated wells. The HWDP may be directly above the collars in the angled section of the well, or the HWDP may be found before the kick off point in a shallower section of the well.|$|R

40|$|Drillstring {{vibration}} {{is a very}} crucial phenomenon {{which has}} a great effect on the drilling process. The drillstring is responsible to transfer rotary motion and energy to the drill bit. Unwanted vibration causes reduction {{in the rate of}} penetration (ROP), bit wear and connection failure between drillstring parts. In this thesis, a model of a realistic <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> is generated which can predict any possible motion of the <b>drill</b> <b>collar.</b> This study contains several analyses about drillstring vibration in three main modes. The focus is on the <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> section of the drillstring because of the importance of this section in vibration generation of the whole drillstring. This study attempts to determine the vibration behavior of the <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> in axial, lateral and torsional directions in the presence of vibration-assisted rotary drilling (VARD) and unbalanced rotation. The model includes self weight, hydraulic forces due to drilling mud circulation and most realistic boundary condition for each particular scenario. This model also can be used for coupled vibration states and determination of vibration behavior of the drillstring in three coupled modes, simultaneously. Simulation results show the vibration behavior of the drillstring due to several cases and boundary conditions. The time response to each single mode is expressed and will be validated by finite element method (FEM). The vibration behavior of the rotating drillstring in three coupled modes will be studied using unbalanced rotation of the drillstring. The rock-bit interaction will also be applied to the model. Finally, the effect of the VARD tool will be examined...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to present a {{methodology}} to predict vibrations of drilllstrings for oil recovery service. The work extends a previous model of the <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> between two stabilizers in the literature to include <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> flexibility utilizing a modal coordinate condensed, finite element approach. The stiffness due to the gravitational forces along the drillstring axis is included. The model also includes the nonlinear effects of drillstring-wellbore contact, friction and quadratic damping. Bifurcation diagrams are presented to illustrate the effects of speed, friction at wellbore, stabilizer clearance and <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> length on chaotic vibration response. Their effects shifts resonance peaks away from the linear natural frequency values and influences the onset speed for chaos. A study is conducted on factors for improving the accuracy of Lyapunov Exponents to predict the presence of chaos. This study considers {{the length of time}} to steady state, the number and duration of linearization sub-intervals, the presence of rigid body modes and the number of finite elements and modal coordinates. The Poincare map and frequency spectrum are utilized to confirm the prediction of Lyapunov exponent analysis. The results may be helpful for computing Lyapunov exponents of other types of nonlinear vibrating systems with many degrees of freedom. Vibration response predictions may assist drilling rig operators in changing a variety of controlled parameters to improve operation procedures and/or equipment...|$|E
40|$|In large {{borehole}} drilling of some blocks or formations, due {{to serious}} downhole vibration, fatigue {{failure of a}} <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> occurs frequently and most washouts and fractures are in thread root. An analysis of the above failure shows that the <b>drill</b> <b>collar</b> fatigue failure {{is caused by the}} cyclic bending stress due to serious downhole vibration. Therefore, downhole vibration modes were theoretically analyzed in terms of axial vibration, lateral vibration, stick-slip, and the physical model established by the mechanical vibration field. Then the resonance damage caused by the actual different downhole vibrations and its theoretical basis were analyzed; and according to the downhole drill string lateral vibration and whirling law, the best area to ensure drilling parameter stability based on the given boundary conditions was figured out, and the theory was clarified that in the best area of drilling, the maximum ROP will be achieved by maintaining the drill string stable or eliminating the vibration/stick-slip, meanwhile the stress fatigue of BHA will be reduced or eliminated especially for <b>drill</b> <b>collar.</b> Finally, solutions were provided as follows: (1) According to the special BHA, drilling conditions, together with physical and mathematical models listed above, downhole resonance speed and related parameters to be avoided can be easily figured out. It was also clarified that resonance speed is exactly the vibration speed that need to be avoided; and that the resonance frequency can be avoided with software for vibration analysis in BHA design and application at well sites; (2) V-Stab is a new and efficient tool which can reduce or eliminate downhole lateral vibration and stick-slip...|$|E
