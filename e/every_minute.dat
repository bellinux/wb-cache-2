5|$|With {{the units}} in the rear, the only {{communications}} method was via the intercom. Contemporary systems used the radio as the intercom as well, but the TR9D sets used in RAF aircraft used the voice channel for 15 seconds <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> for the pip-squeak system, blocking communications. Even when modified sets were supplied that addressed this, the radar was found to interfere strongly with the intercom. A speaking tube was tried but found to be useless. Newer VHF radios being developed through this same period did not suffer these problems, and the Blenheims were moved {{to the front of}} the queue to receive these units.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{suffered}} a broken ankle {{in the fourth}} game of the 2010 WPS Season while playing for Sky Blue FC, she played in 15 matches for the United States in 2010, starting 14.

5|$|David Wetherall (born 14 March 1971) is an English former footballer {{who played}} {{as a central}} defender, {{finishing}} his playing career with Bradford City {{at the end of}} the 2007–08 season. Born in Sheffield, he supported Sheffield Wednesday as a child, and started his playing career there. Before he made a league appearance for Sheffield Wednesday, he transferred to Leeds United and made more than 200 appearances. After this he joined Bradford City for a then club-record fee of £1.4million and played <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> of every match in his first season for the club. Relegation from the Premier League soon followed and the club went into administration in 2002 but when Stuart McCall departed for Sheffield United, Wetherall became the team captain. Wetherall missed several games through injury in the seasons that followed and Bradford City were further relegated to League One in 2004 and then to League Two in 2007. He played his final game in professional football on 3 May 2008 against Wycombe Wanderers.|$|E

5|$|Due to the under-19 team's semi-final {{appearance}} in the 2012 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, the nation qualified for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup, which merited under-20 team appearances for Pogba. Similar to the previous two seasons, Pogba was installed as captain by Mankowski and made his under-20 debut in a 0–0 draw against China. In the team's next match against North Korea, Pogba scored the team's second goal in a 3–1 win. Pogba was {{the captain of the}} team that won France's first ever FIFA U-20 World Cup. In that tournament held in Turkey, he played <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> of all of France's matches except for the final group match against Spain, in which he was an unused substitute. He was named the best player of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash <b>every</b> <b>minute,</b> and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and mild steel rods.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{football}} {{improved his}} confidence {{and with it}} his effectiveness. Under Lee Clark, he started regularly but was often substituted; under Gary Rowett, who replaced Clark in late October, he played <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> of Birmingham's league fixtures, usually partnering Stephen Gleeson in a 4–2–3–1 formation, until injuring a knee in mid-February. He missed the 4–3 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion, in which the local newspaper attributed Birmingham's defensive frailties to his absence. On his return, away at Ipswich Town, his presence achieved more in attack than defence, twice– with a header {{and then with a}} volley– restoring Birmingham to only one goal behind before Ipswich secured a 4–2 win in stoppage time. Rowett signed Nottingham Forest midfielder Robert Tesche on loan on 2 March. Initially he played alongside Davis in place of the suspended Gleeson, and then as part of a three-man midfield, but when Rowett reverted to 4–2–3–1, it was Davis who missed out.|$|E
