2500|$|Senator Harry Reid (Majority Leader of the 2007/2008 U.S. Senate) {{told the}} 2007 Clean Energy Summit {{that he will}} do {{everything}} he can to stop construction of proposed new IGCC coal-fired electric power plants in Nevada. Reid wants Nevada utility companies to invest in solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy instead of coal technologies. Reid stated that global warming is a reality, and just one proposed coal-fired plant would contribute to it by burning seven million tons of coal a year. [...] The long-term healthcare costs would be far too high, he claimed (no source attributed). [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> I can to stop these plants.", he said. [...] "There is no clean coal technology. There is cleaner coal technology, but there is no clean coal technology." ...|$|E

[...] Regarding the different explanations afterward for what had happened, she said, [...] "In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion. And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scrubs {{focuses on}} the unique {{point of view of}} its main {{character}} and narrator, Dr. John Michael [...] "J.D." [...] Dorian (Braff) for the first eight seasons, with season nine being narrated by the new main character Lucy Bennett (Kerry Bishé). Most episodes feature multiple story lines thematically linked by voice-overs done by Braff, as well as the comical daydreams of J.D. According to Bill Lawrence, [...] "What we decided was, rather than have it be a monotone narration, if it's going to be Zach's voice, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> through J.D.'s eyes. It opened up a visual medium that those of us as comedy writers were not used to." [...] Actors were given the chance to improvise their lines on set with encouragement by series creator Bill Lawrence, with Neil Flynn and Zach Braff being the main improvisors.|$|E
2500|$|The views predominating {{among the}} city's {{politicians}} {{and other leaders}} {{turned out to be}} closer to those of The Stranger than the Times. As mayor Greg Nickels put it, [...] "This is not about music, this is not about a party. This was about a guy who decided {{he was going to kill}} people and he had the firepower to do it." [...] Several city council members spoke up against the [...] "quick fix" [...] mentality inherent in the Times editorial; council member Peter Steinbrueck added he was [...] "really incredulous over young teenaged girls going out all night unsupervised and mixing with much older people," [...] but didn't see that as an issue over the nature of the place where they had socialized. Sandra Williamson, mother of shooting victim Christopher [...] "Deacon" [...] Williamson, announced, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> in my power to make sure that those raves continue… That is what I am going to do for Chris."

50|$|In 2010-11 season Di Francisca {{earned a}} medal in {{six out of}} the seven World Cup events in which she took part, {{including}} two golds in Seoul and Tauberbischofsheim. At the European Championships she met again Vezzali in the final. After being led {{for the first two}} periods, Di Francisca levelled the score and hit twice in the last ten seconds to win the bout 10-8 and claim her first continental title. Vezzali took her revenge at the World Championships in Catania when they met once again in the final. Vezzali took a 0-6 lead in the first bout and kept until the final score of 7-15. “I didn't understand anything”, commented Di Francisca. “It's as if she had a walkie talkie earpiece suggesting <b>everything</b> I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> She anticipated <b>everything</b> and riposted.” The silver medal however strengthened her ranking and she won the 2010-11 World Cup series.|$|R
6000|$|Whoever has {{travelled}} in the New England States will remember, in some cool village, {{the large}} farmhouse, with its clean-swept grassy yard, shaded by the dense and massive foliage {{of the sugar}} maple; and remember the air of order and stillness, of perpetuity and unchanging repose, that seemed to breathe over the whole place. Nothing lost, or out of order; not a picket loose in the fence, not a particle of litter in the turfy yard, with its clumps of lilac bushes growing up under the windows. Within, he will remember wide, clean rooms, where nothing ever seems <b>to</b> be <b>doing</b> or <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done,</b> where <b>everything</b> is once and forever rigidly in place, and where all household arrangements move with the punctual exactness of the old clock in the corner. In the family [...] "keeping-room," [...] as it is termed, he will remember the staid, respectable old book-case, with its glass doors, where Rollin's History,* Milton's Paradise Lost, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, and Scott's Family Bible,** stand {{side by side in}} decorous order, with multitudes of other books, equally solemn and respectable. There are no servants in the house, but the lady in the snowy cap, with the spectacles, who sits sewing every afternoon among her daughters, as if nothing ever had been <b>done,</b> or were <b>to</b> be done,--she and her girls, in some long-forgotten fore part of the day, [...] "did up the work," [...] {{and for the rest of}} the time, probably, at all hours when you would see them, it is [...] "done up." [...] The old kitchen floor never seems stained or spotted; the tables, the chairs, and the various cooking utensils, never seem deranged or disordered; though three and sometimes four meals a day are got there, though the family washing and ironing is there performed, and though pounds of butter and cheese are in some silent and mysterious manner there brought into existence.|$|R

60|$|He {{walked away}} with a tumult of {{thoughts}} in his head. What a fool he had been! That {{was the first thing}} that struck him, an abject, miserable fool, and he repeated it to himself a dozen times in a rush of angry feeling. He despised himself. How could he have got into such a mess? But at the same time, for his thoughts chased one another through his brain and yet seemed to stand together, in a hopeless confusion, like the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle seen in a nightmare, he asked himself what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Everything</b> was so clear before him, all he had aimed at so long within reach at last, and now his inconceivable stupidity had erected this new obstacle. Philip {{had never been able to}} surmount what he acknowledged was a defect in his resolute desire for a well ordered life, and that was his passion for living in the future; and no sooner was he settled in his work at the hospital than he had busied himself with arrangements for his travels. In the past he had often tried not to think too circumstantially of his plans for the future, it was only discouraging; but now that his goal was so near he saw no harm in giving away to a longing that was so difficult to resist. First of all he meant to go to Spain. That was the land of his heart; and by now he was imbued with its spirit, its romance and colour and history and grandeur; he felt that it had a message for him in particular which no other country could give. He knew the fine old cities already as though he had trodden their tortuous streets from childhood. Cordova, Seville, Toledo, Leon, Tarragona, Burgos. The great painters of Spain were the painters of his soul, and his pulse beat quickly as he pictured his ecstasy on standing face to face with those works which were more significant than any others to his own tortured, restless heart. He had read the great poets, more characteristic of their race than the poets of other lands; for they seemed to have drawn their inspiration not at all from the general currents of the world's literature but directly from the torrid, scented plains and the bleak mountains of their country. A few short months now, and he would hear with his own ears all around him the language which seemed most apt for grandeur of soul and passion. His fine taste had given him an inkling that Andalusia was too soft and sensuous, a little vulgar even, to satisfy his ardour; and his imagination dwelt more willingly among the wind-swept distances of Castile and the rugged magnificence of Aragon and Leon. He did not know quite what those unknown contacts would give him, but he felt that he would gather from them a strength and a purpose which would make him more capable of affronting and comprehending the manifold wonders of places more distant and more strange.|$|E
