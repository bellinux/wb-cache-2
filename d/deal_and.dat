Byrne accepted the offer subject to a 90% rate, leaving only 10% for the Beatles and NEMS combined. Completely unaware of the potential market that existed, particularly in America, Epstein agreed to the <b>deal,</b> <b>and</b> subsequently lost The Beatles an estimated $100,000,000 in possible income.|$|E
5|$|For {{the album}} session, Steve Albini was engineer, Josephine Wiggs {{replaced}} Halliday on bass, Britt Walford played drums, and both <b>Deal</b> <b>and</b> Donelly played guitar. Following {{two weeks of}} practicing in England, the Breeders recorded Pod at the Palladium studio in Scotland. Albini recorded the group quickly, and focused more on getting good sounds from the musical equipment than on trying to improve the musicians' performances. Critics have discussed similarities between Pod and the Pixies' music, and commented favorably or unfavorably on Pods relative quality to that band's work. The album has been noted for its minimal instrumentation, and for its sexual, dark, girl-like lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Fox {{alleged that}} it {{contacted}} Warner Bros. before production began in 2005, {{and told the}} studio that it had violated Fox's 1991 and 1994 deals with Gordon.

Warner Bros. also claimed that the 1994 deal did not cover distribution rights and had conferred upon Gordon all the rights he needed to take the film to Warner Bros.

5|$|From the {{formation}} of the Breeders in 1989 until the mid-1990s, the line-up changed several times. Vocalist and songwriter Kim Deal was the band's sole consistent member. The line-up that recorded the group's debut Pod (released in 1990) included guitarist Tanya Donelly and drummer Britt Walford; they were replaced by Deal's sister Kelley and Jim Macpherson by the time the band's 1993 album Last Splash was recorded. Kelley <b>Deal</b> <b>and</b> original bassist Josephine Wiggs left in 1995. Kim Deal formed the Amps that year, but reformed the Breeders in 1996—initially using the Amps' line-up: Deal (vocals), Macpherson (drums), Luis Lerma (bass), and Nate Farley (guitar).|$|E

In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between idiosyncratic <b>deals</b> <b>and</b> organizational commitment. In particular, it examines how two individual differences which reflect self-worth (core self-evaluations and age) moderate that relationship. We predicted that employees with feelings of high self-worth will expect and will feel entitled to these deals, but employees with feelings of low self-worth will feel particularly obligated to reciprocate positively for special treatment. Data were collected from 375 managers at two points in time. As predicted, the relationship between idiosyncratic <b>deals</b> <b>and</b> affective organizational commitment was stronger for those managers who had low core self-evaluations. While the two-way interaction effect between idiosyncratic <b>deals</b> <b>and</b> age was not significant, we did find modest evidence for a three-way interaction effect. As predicted, the strongest relationship between idiosyncratic <b>deals</b> <b>and</b> organizational commitment occurred for older workers who had low core self-evaluations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|In 1997, Diarra {{was signed}} to an amateur {{contract}} by professional club CS Louhans-Cuiseaux who were playing in Ligue 2, {{the second level}} of French football, and was inserted into the club's youth academy. In the 1998–99 season, Diarra was promoted to the club's reserve team and spent two seasons playing there. In {{the latter part of}} the 1999–2000 season, he was called up to the senior team by manager Philippe Hinschberger. On 15 April 2000, Diarra made his professional debut in a 2–1 defeat to Toulouse picking up a yellow card. Two weeks later, he made his first professional start in the team's 3–2 loss to Niort. In his final appearance with Louhans-Cuiseaux, Diarra received his first red card of his career after incurring two yellow card infractions in a 2–1 defeat to Le Mans. Louhans-Cuiseaux finished the campaign in last place and were relegated to the semi-professional Championnat National, the third division of French football. After the season, Louhans-Cuiseaux attempted to tie down Diarra on a long-term <b>deal</b> <b>and</b> offered the player a trainee contract.
