500|$|Earlier {{that year}} Witherspoon {{was chosen to}} portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in Walk the Line. She never {{had the chance to}} meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time Carter Cash died. Witherspoon {{performed}} her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was so worried about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. [...] "That was the most challenging part of the role," [...] she later recalled in an interview, [...] "I'd never sung professionally." [...] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role. Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added [...] "boundless energy" [...] to the movie. She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for [...] "collaborative video of the year" [...] from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: [...] "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems." [...] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: [...] "I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> her a very modern woman." ...|$|E

Asked to explain the reason for her large gay fanbase, Minogue replied, [...] "It's always difficult for me to give the definitive answer because I don't have it.

2500|$|For Series 10, Capaldi {{described}} his character as more 'closed off' and 'suspicious' {{than the previous}} season, he elaborated 'If you’ve been following this Doctor, you’ve seen him go through all those different colours and all those different places, and as for where he goes now, I don’t know, but he’s been put through the mill.” Capaldi {{expressed in terms of}} his character 'Because in some ways he’s much more amenable, but in other ways he’s even darker.

Upon discussing the interaction between The Doctor and his latest companion Bill Potts, Capaldi elaborated “It’s a kind of teacher-pupil relationship, but it becomes more complex than that and I think ultimately the Doctor has to undergo some dramas by himself. So I think he becomes slightly worried that he’s swept someone else up into his adventures without quite preparing them.” ...|$|E

"No," [...] said Maggie, {{with simple}} seriousness, walking {{on as if}} she meant Philip to {{accompany}} her, [...] "I'm very glad you came, for I wished very much {{to have an opportunity}} of speaking to you.

He made a deliberate decision to retire from the All-Japan Open Championships and reported it to Masutatsu Ōyama after the Fifth All-Japan Open Championships. Yamazaki left a steady record of wins in all of the All-Japan Open Championships in which he participated. Yamazaki said “I don't do professional karate. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> martial arts dirty. It was good for me only in the Spirit of Kyokushin that had been cultivated for years.” It was a simple retirement.|$|E

I try to make music that's universal to every aspect ...the one obvious message is my identity. I want my identity to be known with my music. This turban and beard, I feel like, {{is a big part}} of why I am where I am today. So even though I'll do a 'Hotline Bling' cover, the fact that there's aspects of the music that are foreign and even the aspects of me — the way I look — <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> a difference because it's something people haven't seen, and it's something people need to see." ...|$|E

50|$|In an interview, author Scott Westerfeld {{addressed}} {{the subject of}} where {{to draw the line}} between steampunk and dieselpunk, arguing that his own work Leviathan (2009) still qualifies as steampunk despite the technology in it including diesel engines.I like the word dieselpunk if you are doing something like 'Weird World War II'. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> perfect sense. But to me, World War I is the dividing point where modernity goes from being optimistic to being pessimistic. Because when you put the words machine and gun together, they both change. At that point, war is no longer about a sense of adventure and chivalry and a way of testing your nation's level of manhood; it's become industrial, and horrible. So playing around with that border between optimistic steampunk and a much more pessimistic dieselpunk, which is more about Nazis, was kind of interesting to me because early in the war we were definitely kind of on the steampunk side of that.|$|E

That explains why I’m a free spirit. I even served the Public Schools before as Assistant Schools Division Superintendent of Bohol, OIC Superintendent of Siquijor and Toledo City. I have an extensive exposure in different fields, which serve me well now. I get to try anything, anytime {{for the right reasons}} and that’s why I ran for Vice Mayor in 2004. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> me lucky.” ...|$|E

Dear Members, I {{received}} {{your gift}} and I {{would like to}} thank all of you for it very much. It was mailed to me on June seventh, but because I didn’t receive it until three months later. A year ago, when I was helping to support the Bryant Service Club, I didn’t appreciate how much help it could be to a serviceman away from home. But now that I am a soldier myself, I am fully aware of the good that the club performs. There is nothing, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> a fellow feel better than to know that there is someone at home who hasn’t forgotten about him. Even though I received your package of candy three months later, that did not in any way make it less welcome. I thought I would take time to drop you a few lines and let you know of the good work you are doing, and I know you will keep up this worthy project. A fellow Bryantite,Henry C.
