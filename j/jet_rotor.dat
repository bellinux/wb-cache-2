To understand the effects of tip injection, the flow field at the tip region of a transonic compressor rotor with and without fluid injection was investigated in this paper. Using results acquired by phase-locked PIV measurements as well as the static pressure field obtained by fast response pressure transducers, the unsteady interaction between the injection <b>jet</b> and the <b>rotor</b> could be described thoroughly. Both, an influence of the rotor’s flow field on the jet as well of the <b>jet</b> on the <b>rotor</b> was clearly visible. Since unsteady inflow conditions to the front rotor in the relative frame of reference were imposed by the injection <b>jets,</b> the <b>rotor’s</b> unsteady response was investigated by inspection of the position of the tip leakage vortex trajectory. It could be shown that due to a short time for the flow to adapt at the rotor’s leading edge, its position didn’t change distinctly. Because a significantly longer time was needed for the overall passage flow to adapt, it was concluded that this causes the beneficial effect of tip injection...|$|R

In recent days, the study about rotordynamics has gained more importance within Jet engine industries. The main reason is Jet engine consists of many rotating parts constitutes a complex dynamic system. While designing rotors of high speed turbo machineries, it is of prime importance to consider rotordynamics characteristics in to account. Considering these characteristics at the design phase may prevent the jet engine from severe catastrophic failures.

50|$|The {{main rotor}} may {{be driven by}} tip jets. Such a system may be powered by high {{pressure}} air provided by a compressor. The air {{may or may not}} be mixed with fuel and burnt in ram-jets, pulse-jets, or rockets. Though this method is simple and eliminates torque reaction, prototypes that have been built are less fuel efficient than conventional helicopters. Except for tip jets driven by unburnt compressed air, very high noise levels is the single most important reason why tip <b>jet</b> powered <b>rotors</b> have not gained wide acceptance. However, research into noise suppression is ongoing and may help make this system viable.|$|R
50|$|If the helicopter's engine fails, the tip <b>jets</b> on the <b>rotor</b> {{increase}} {{the moment of}} inertia, hence permitting it to store energy, which makes performing a successful autorotation landing somewhat easier.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of tip jet powered rotorcraft. The Percival P.74 was under-powered {{and could not}} fly. The Hiller YH-32 Hornet had good lifting capability but performed poorly otherwise. Other aircraft used auxiliary thrust for translational flight so that the tip jets could be shut down while the rotor autorotated. The experimental Fairey Jet Gyrodyne, 48-seat Fairey Rotodyne passenger prototypes and McDonnell XV-1 compound gyroplanes flew well using this method. Perhaps the most unusual design of this type was the Rotary Rocket Roton ATV, which was originally envisioned to take off using a rocket-tipped rotor. The French Sud-Ouest Djinn used unburnt compressed air to drive the rotor, which minimized noise and helped it become the only tip <b>jet</b> driven <b>rotor</b> helicopter to enter production.|$|R

40|$|Acoustic comfort is an {{important}} issue in aircraft industry. Important external noise sources are the turbulent boundary layer (TBL) and the engines (<b>jet</b> or <b>rotor).</b> The induced aerodynamic and acoustic pressure fluctuations propagate as structure- and airborne sound through the fuselage into the cabin. The degree of sound transmission and with it the level of interior noise, strongly depends on the sound insulation of the primary fuselage structure and the interior lining elements. The increasing use of lightweight materials in aircraft industry such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) fuselage structures induces great acoustic challenges, which can not be solved solely by means of passive acoustic insulation. Active structural acoustic control (ASAC) is especially effective in the low-frequency domain (< 1 kHz), where the sound transmission loss of passive structures is very low.

40|$|The growing use of {{light-weight}} {{structures in}} the aerospace {{but also in the}} automotive industry spotlights the challenging vibroacoustic properties and its implications on comfort and reliability. Aircraft noise mainly originates from the turbulent boundary layer (TBL) and the engines (<b>jet</b> or <b>rotor</b> noise). The TBL induces a broadband, stochastic vibration of the fuselage structure causing the noise transmission into the cabin. The concept of active structural-acoustic control (ASAC) facilitates a light-weight compliant improvement of transmission loss in the low-frequency range (< 500 Hz). In this frequency range, passive noise abatement methods inevitably result in a signifi-cant increase of mass and volume. The radiation mode concept was adopted in order to integrate an acoustic performance metric into the control-design that purely relies on structural sensor in-formation. Its validity for different panel configurations (non-stiffened and stiffened) was experi-mentally investigated in the acoustic wind tunnel of DLR (TBL excitation). For reasons of numeri-cal efficiency the principal components of the radiation resistance matrix were interpolated by low-order digital filters. The predicted radiated sound power by this structurally-based technique has been compared to acoustic nearfield holography and sound intensity measurements...|$|R

Compound helicopters use these methods, but the Boeing A160 Hummingbird shows that rotor-slowing is possible without wings or propellers, and regular helicopters may reduce turbine RPM (and thus rotor speed) to 85% using 19% less power. Alternatively, research suggests that twin-engine helicopters may decrease consumption by 25%-40% when running only one engine, given adequate height and velocity well inside the safe areas of the height-velocity diagram.|$|R
40|$|Squeeze film dampers are novel rotor dynamic devices used to {{alleviate}} small amplitude, large force vibrations {{and are used}} in conjunction with antifriction bearings in aircraft jet engine bearings to provide external damping as these possess very little inherent damping. Electrorheological (ER) fluids are controllable fluids in which the rheological properties of the fluid, particularly viscosity, can be controlled in accordance with the requirements of the rotor dynamic system by controlling the intensity of the applied electric field and this property can be utilized in squeeze film dampers, to provide variable stiffness and damping at a particular excitation frequency. The paper investigates the effect of temperature and electric field on the apparent viscosity and dynamic (stiffness and damping characteristics) of ER fluid (suspension of diatomite in transformer oil) using the available literature. These characteristics increase with the field as the viscosity increases with the field. However, these characteristics decrease with increase in temperature and shear strain rate as the viscosity of the fluid decreases with temperature and shear strain rate.

Yarns may be made from natural staple fibers or from a variety of synthetic fibers or from the blends of different fibers. As a matter of fact, blends constitute a bulk of the staple yarns manufactured in the U. S. Although both natural (primarily cotton) and synthetic fibers (primarily polyester) have geometric and physical properties that meet most, if not all of the end-use requirements for a variety of applications. However, the limits in the utilization and translation of the physical and mechanical properties of fibers into yarns are strongly influenced by the system of manufacturing.

Due to limitations of the present experimental setup in terms of performance of the synthetic jets, the main focus is on the numerical flow simulations.
