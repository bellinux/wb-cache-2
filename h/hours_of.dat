5|$|While there aren’t many {{external}} morphological {{differences between}} queens and workers {{there are some}} internal traits that can be signals of a wasp’s social status. It has also been found that caste determination is irreversibly determined by temperature during the immature stages of development. In one experiment, some wasps emerging in June were kept in long day chambers, or chambers set at 26°C with 16 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> light and 8 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> darkness. These individuals had larger and more active ovaries as {{compared to those who}} were incubated in short day chambers, which are set at 22°C with 14 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> light and 10 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> darkness. It is thought that this phenomenon may occur because of a juvenile hormone secretion that determines the castes and a suppression of the workers’ ovaries by environmental or hormonal factors.|$|E
