5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place).</b> In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E

They split up after a few months and Jansch was eventually repatriated to Britain after catching dysentery in Tangiers.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of cicada, the males remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place,</b> usually with quieter calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into {{the bark of}} a twig where she deposits her eggs.|$|E

5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place.</b> In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} two tower complexes, there is a {{reception}} office, administrative block, monastic quarters, meditation halls and a kitchen complex where lay supporters prepare meals for the monks and visitors. The monastic quarters and meditation hall are not open to laypeople and can provide accommodation for hundreds of monks. This large capacity is often utilised during the Rains Retreat. This retreat commemorates events during {{the life of the}} Buddha, when the rainy season came between the full moons of the fourth and seventh lunar months. As a result, monks of the time stayed in one place to practice rather than travel <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having {{performed}} in parlor theatricals as a child, from 1916 Simonovich-Efimova began staging puppet shows for fellow artists. The plays were so well received {{that she and}} her husband were invited to create a children's puppet theater by the Russian authorities in 1918, becoming two of the first professional puppeteers in Russia. She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work by publishing books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She and her husband are known as the first couple of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft. They performed over 1,500 shows throughout Russia between 1920 and 1940, moving <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> with their traveling puppet theater.|$|E

50|$|The floor {{material}} varies tremendously <b>from</b> <b>placed</b> <b>to</b> <b>place,</b> {{but often}} consists of carefully laid cobbles over which {{a coat of}} clay was applied. In addition to red sandstone, {{in the form of}} grus and slabs, flint, flint grus, clay alone, gravel, or gneiss and slate slabs were occasionally used. Sites also occur where pieces of broken pottery or combinations of several materials are used. The thickness of the floor covering varies from three to ten centimetres. The floor at Sassen, Germany in Mecklenburg is unique. Here, thin red sandstone slabs have been placed vertically and not covered with a clay layer. The flooring apparently formed the final stage of building. How important floor coverings were, is demonstrated by the fact that subsequent users neither removed nor replaced them, nor did they cover them with a further layer. Floor coverings were especially in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Sweden also divided into sections (Quartiere).|$|R

The resolution was moved in the legislature on 7 February 1925, by the then SNDP Secretary N. Kumaran (Later he became High Court Judge). The text of the resolution was [...] "All roads around the temple at Vaikom, and similar roads {{all over the state}} of Travancore must be open for traveling for people of all castes and creeds." [...] The resolution was defeated by 22 votes against 21. (It is understood that Dr. Palpu's brother who was expecting favors from the Government voted against the resolution. He was a close associate of the Narayana Guru at Aruvippuram, but he turned Judas.

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways. Those on the lower river, slightly closer to the coast, often relied on fishing as their primary economic mainstay. Salmon {{was the most important}} fish to Willamette River tribes {{as well as to the}} Native Americans of the Columbia River, where white traders traded fish with the Native Americans. Upper-river tribes caught steelhead and salmon, often by building weirs across tributary streams. Tribes of the northern Willamette Valley practiced a generally settled lifestyle. The Chinooks lived in great wooden lodges, practiced slavery, and had a well-defined caste system. People of the south were more nomadic, traveling <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> with the seasons. They were known for the controlled burning of woodlands to create meadows for hunting and plant gathering (especially camas).|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} chess (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place.</b> Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E

After that Parasuram recovered a shining stone (Parasmanisila), a wonderful form of glittering Basalt-stone from underneath the earth and carved the divine image of goddess with his arrow. As per the legend the name of the Goddess became Sarada, as the figure of Goddess carved out by arrow (Sara) of Parasurama. The place still bears the legend as meeting banyan tree (Bheta Bara). The name “JHANKARA” or “JHANKADA” is lexically related in the magical reverberations of the sound of Parsurama’s arrow and divine stone.|$|R
40|$|An {{essential}} {{task for}} {{autonomous mobile robot}} is <b>to</b> move <b>from</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> <b>places</b> while avoiding obstacles and keep itself located. In a dynamically changing environment this requires the utilization of diverse sensor information. For mobile robots equipped with multiple sensors, different types of sensor and sensor configurations provide competing and complementing functions for the above purposes. A hierarchical architecture with centralized sensor data fusion scheme lacks the flexibility and is prone to overall failure caused by loss of single sensor or communication line. In this paper we {{address the problem of}} sensing based navigation by modelling various sensors as a team of experts cooperating to achieve a common objectives. Our approach is based on the team theory[10] and the problem of coordination of sensor information for robot navigation is addressed. 1 Introduction Navigation of a mobile robot would be relatively easy if the mobile robot could perceive its environment and co [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Western gunslinger {{heroes are}} portrayed as local lawmen or {{enforcement}} officers, ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, nomadic loners, or skilled fast-draw artists. They are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle - courageous, moral, tough, solid, and self-sufficient, maverick characters (often with trusty sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude (but often characterized as slow-talking). They are depicted as similar to a knight-errant, wandering <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> with no particular direction, often facing curious and hostile enemies, while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry. The Western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own, commonly against lawlessness, with an expert display of his physical skills (roping, gun-play, horse-handling, pioneering abilities, etc.).|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents {{and the appearance of}} witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
5|$|Human {{habitation}} on the Santa Ana River {{dates back}} 9,000 to 12,000 years ago, {{close to the}} early stages of the Holocene period. The first Native Americans to live in the area were nomadic tribes that traveled <b>from</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>place,</b> grazing animals on fertile grasslands and gathering fruits and seeds for food. The ancestors of these early people originated from the Shoshone and Uto-Aztecan people of the northwestern United States. Eventually, the human population of the watershed reached a peak of about 15,000. About 8,000 years ago, the climate experienced a change becoming more arid and the originally nomadic tribes began to stay in individual places longer, becoming semi-nomadic. However, they did not establish agriculture, nor did they raise animals or live in villages. Like many Native American tribes in California, acorns were a staple food of many of the inland valley people. People closer to the ocean often fished and hunted small animals, often from tide pools and coastal stream areas, for food.|$|E
