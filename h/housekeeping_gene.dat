5|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% {{of the known}} phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important {{for the health of}} the intestinal tract. There are two types of functions in these range clusters: housekeeping and those specific to the intestine. The <b>housekeeping</b> <b>gene</b> clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from irritable bowel syndrome indicating that changes in patients’ gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{stability}} of <b>housekeeping</b> <b>genes</b> is critical when performing gene expression studies. To date, {{there have been}} no studies that look at the {{stability of}} commonly used <b>housekeeping</b> <b>genes</b> in alveolar macrophages. Expression levels may be affected by culture, stimulation or disease severity. The present study investigated the expression level of 10 <b>housekeeping</b> <b>genes</b> and analysed the stability of their expression in alveolar macrophages from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients (n 522) who were classified according to disease severity. Guanine nucleotide-binding protein, beta polypeptide 2 -like 1 (GNB 2 L 1), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT 1) and ribosomal protein L 32 (RPL 32) were the most stably expressed in alveolar macrophages, irrespective of disease severity. There was no difference in the expression levels of 10 <b>housekeeping</b> <b>genes</b> between mild and moderate/severe patients. GNB 2 L 1, HPRT 1 and RPL 32 were also stably expressed in alveolar macrophages cultured with no stimulation, or with interleukin- 1 b, lipopolysaccharide or tumour necrosis factor-a stimulation. In conclusion, as fluctuations in the expression of some <b>housekeeping</b> <b>genes</b> were observed, including glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, it is recommended that guanine nucleo-tide binding protein, beta polypeptide 2 -like 1 be used as a reference gene for alveolar macrophages in similar study designs, or that the stability of <b>housekeeping</b> <b>genes</b> be validated in alveolar macrophages prior to expression studies...|$|R

Here, we used statistical analysis to examine a large human microarray database, seeking genes that were stably expressed in various tissues, disease states and cell lines. We further selected genes that were expressed at different levels, because reference and target genes should be present in similar copy numbers to achieve reliable quantitative results. Real time RT-PCR amplification of three newly identified reference genes, CGI- 119, CTBP 1 and GOLGAl, alongside three well-known <b>housekeeping</b> <b>genes,</b> B 2 M, GAPD, and TUBB, confirmed that the newly identified genes were more stably expressed in individual samples with similar ranges.
