40|$|Abstract In Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gastrojejunostomy {{is commonly}} performed using a circular stapler. The initial description for placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvil</b> was via <b>the</b> transoral approach. Although {{the concept was}} ingenious, technical difficulty was encountered during pas-sage resulting in complications such as hypopharyngeal perforation and esophageal mucosal injury. As a result, most surgeons subsequently changed their route <b>of</b> <b>anvil</b> placement to <b>the</b> transabdominal approach. Advances in stapler technol-ogy now allow <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvil</b> to be pre-tilted, permitting transoral introduction with greater ease and safety. This paper describes this improved method for transoral placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvil</b> during laparoscopic gastric bypass and reoperative bariatric surgery...|$|R

40|$|High-pressure torsion (HPT) is a {{processing}} {{technique in}} which samples {{are subjected to}} a high pressure and torsional straining. Anvil alignment and anvil roughness are two important factors related to <b>the</b> successful application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HPT processing technique. Using a two-phase duplex stainless steel as a model material, experiments were conducted by placing <b>the</b> <b>anvils</b> in different amounts of initial misalignment. Experiments show that the flow patterns (<b>the</b> development <b>of</b> double-swirl patterns) in HPT are dependent upon <b>the</b> alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvils</b> within <b>the</b> HPT facility. Through carefully designed experiments, it is shown that <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a double-swirl is a feature of HPT processing when <b>the</b> initial positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvils</b> have a small lateral misalignment. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double-swirl patterns on the hardness evolution was also evaluated quantitatively. By comparing the flow patterns developed on the disc upper surface using both rough and smooth anvils with a fixed anvil misalignment, it was demonstrated {{that there are some}} differences in the flow patterns which are dependent upon <b>the</b> <b>anvil</b> surface roughness...|$|R

50|$|Many other {{designs are}} used, but all <b>of</b> them {{accomplish}} <b>the</b> same goal <b>of</b> allowing <b>the</b> hammer to spin freely <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvil,</b> {{allowing it to}} be accelerated and store energy, then delivering that energy suddenly to <b>the</b> <b>anvil,</b> before allowing <b>the</b> process to repeat.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{work surface}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvil</b> {{is known as}} the face. It is {{generally}} made of hardened steel and should be flat and smooth with rounded edges for most work. Any marks on the face will be transferred to the work. Also, sharp edges tend to cut into the metal being worked and may cause cracks to form in the workpiece. The face is hardened and tempered to resist <b>the</b> blows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smith's hammer, so <b>the</b> <b>anvil</b> face does not deform under repeated use. A hard anvil face also reduces <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> force lost in each hammer blow. Hammers, tools, and work pieces of hardened steel should never directly strike <b>the</b> <b>anvil</b> face with full force, as they may damage it; this can result in chipping or deforming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvil</b> face.|$|R

50|$|Yet another design uses {{a rocking}} weight inside the hammer, and a single, long {{protrusion}} on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvil's</b> shaft. When <b>the</b> hammer spins, the rocking weight first contacts <b>the</b> <b>anvil</b> on <b>the</b> opposite side than {{used to drive}} <b>the</b> <b>anvil,</b> nudging <b>the</b> weight into position for the impact. As the hammer spins further, the weight hits <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>anvil,</b> transferring <b>the</b> hammer's and its own energy to the output, then rocks {{back to the other}} side. This design also has <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> hammering only once per revolution, as well as its simplicity, but has <b>the</b> disadvantage <b>of</b> making <b>the</b> tool vibrate as the rocking weight acts as an eccentric, and can be less tolerant <b>of</b> running <b>the</b> tool with low input power. To help combat the vibration and uneven drive, sometimes two of these hammers are placed in line with each other, at 180Â° offsets, both striking at the same time.|$|R
