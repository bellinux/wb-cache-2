Sweeps months (which occur in November, February, May, and to a lesser extent July) are important landmarks in the television season - ratings earned during these periods determine advertising rates until the next sweeps period, therefore shows often have their most exciting plot developments happen during sweeps.|$|E

40|$|The <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>networked</b> applications, {{especially}} those requiring continuous access to shared information resources and databases, may be effected by scheduled unavailability {{of one or}} more of these applications. The scheduled unavailability usually occurs due to a number of reasons including application or data backup, software or hardware maintenance for the application’s platform, executing periodic processes such as file reorganization or end-of-period processes, application maintenance, or application migration. This paper provides an object-oriented framework to increase the availability of integrated applications without fully replicating the application environment such as the application platforms, programs, and data. The proposed framework can be used to maintain the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>networked</b> applications during scheduled unavailability of one of the applications.

Those configuration factors will be presented and linked to "state variables" and "contingency variables". Both kinds of variables are to be later exploited to develop an architecture and a methodology for engineering and integration of NoF...|$|E

40|$|Los Angeles {{is often}} {{described}} as the epitome of urban fragmentation, a notion which in this context is frequently connected to, or even conflated with urban sprawl. At the same time, the city features integrated water and power networks which have been under public ownership for over 70 years. We thus have an apparent paradox {{in the context of the}} debate on 'splintering urbanism', between socio-spatial fragmentation and the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>networks.</b> In discussing the idea that deregulation of infrastructural networks exacerbates urban fragmentation, the authors use the case of Los Angeles in order to highlight the central role of private interests in management decisions concerning infrastructure networks. The authors carry out their analysis in an historical perspective, revealing that network integration and universal access can often serve private interests more than the public good. Urban fragmentation in Los Angeles, they conclude, is the result of a complex process of instrumentalisation of network development and management...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a concept that considers network behavior {{as a collection of}} software objects, which can be used or modified in computer programs. The interfaces of these software objects are exposed as web services and enable applications to analyze and manipulate networks, e. g. to find articulation vertices or configure non-default routes. This article describes the software that allows Mathematica to optimize networks and applications in a continuous cycle of monitoring, analysis and adaptation. Here, the full collection of Mathematica algorithms becomes available to calculate the next optimal configuration. These algorithms use parameters such as energy consumption, application performance or bandwidth consumption as input. As a result, Mathematica can automatically adapt the network to maintain or provide (sub-) optimal or 'better-than-best-effort' services. Furthermore, <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>networks</b> with Mathematica allows a multiscale optimization approach, where local behavior is adapted to support global goals. The presented work makes extensive use of Mathematica's Dynamics and Combinatorica Package, but also of web services and J/Link...|$|E

Networks in NDEx receive globally unique accession IDs and can be stored for private use, shared in pre-publication collaboration, or released for public access. Standard and novel data formats are accommodated in a flexible storage model. Organizations can use NDEx as a distribution channel for networks they generate or curate. Developers of bioinformatic applications can store and query NDEx networks via a common programmatic interface.
