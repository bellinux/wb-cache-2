Bonaventura warned against Marian maximalism. [...] "One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> as to not to minimize the honour of our Lord, Jesus Christ."

60|$|Among {{the many}} church bells that rang on those bygone Sundays {{was that of}} St. John's, of which Dr. Gilman, of beloved memory, was rector. Dr. Gilman was a saint, {{and if you had}} had the good luck to be baptized or married or buried by him, you were {{probably}} fortunate in an earthly as well as heavenly sense. One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to deal exclusively in superlatives, and yet it is not an exaggeration to say that St. John's was the most beautiful and churchly edifice in the city, thanks chiefly to several gentlemen of sense, and one gentleman, at least, of taste--Mr. Horace Bentley. The vicissitudes of civil war interrupted its building; but when, in 1868, it stood completed, its stone unsoiled as yet by factory smoke, its spire delicately pointing to untainted skies, its rose window glowing above the porch, citizens on Tower Street often stopped to gaze at it diagonally across the vacant lot set in order by Mr. Thurston Gore, with the intent that the view might be unobstructed.|$|E
6000|$|Let us {{begin by}} {{considering}} what constructive forces may exist {{in this new}} plutocracy which already so largely sways American economic and political development. The first impression is one of extravagant and aimless expenditure, of a class irresponsible and wasteful beyond all precedent. One gets a Zolaesque picture of that aspect in Mr. Upton Sinclair's [...] "Metropolis," [...] or the fashionable intelligence of the popular New York Sunday editions, and one finds {{a good deal of}} confirmatory evidence in many incidental aspects of the smart American life of Paris and the Riviera. The evidence in the notorious Thaw trial, after one has discounted its theatrical elements, was still a very convincing demonstration of a rotten and extravagant, because aimless and functionless, class of rich people. But one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> in this matter if one is to do justice to the facts. If a thing is made up of two elements, and one is noisy and glaringly coloured, and the other is quiet and colourless, the first impression created will be that the thing is identical with the element that is noisy and glaringly coloured. One is much less likely to hear of the broad plans {{and the quality of the}} wise, strong and constructive individuals in a class than of their foolish wives, their spendthrift sons, their mistresses, and their moments of irritation and folly.|$|E

As he handed me the cutting he said: [...] "I am Destilia!" [...] His [...] story was so strange that I asked him a good many questions about it. [...] He answered me quite frankly on every point, but always adhering [...] stoutly to the main point--namely, that it was no phantom or mirage, [...] no dream or imperfect vision in a fog. [...] "We were four in all who saw [...] it," [...] he said--"three from the bridge and the Englishman, [...] Caulfield--from the bows--whose account exactly agreed with what we [...] saw.
