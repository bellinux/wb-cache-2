500|$|Many {{plants have}} {{developed}} effective defences against termites. However, seedlings {{are vulnerable to}} termite attacks and need additional protection, as their defence mechanisms only develop when they have passed the seedling stage. Defence is typically achieved by secreting antifeedant chemicals into the woody cell walls. This reduces the ability of termites to efficiently digest the cellulose. A commercial product, [...] "Blockaid", has been developed in Australia that uses a range of plant extracts to create a paint-on nontoxic termite barrier for buildings. An extract of a species of Australian <b>figwort,</b> Eremophila, {{has been shown to}} repel termites; tests have shown that termites are strongly repelled by the toxic material {{to the extent that they}} will starve rather than consume the food. When kept close to the extract, they become disoriented and eventually die.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, after {{completing}} a 28-page environmental assessment (EA) the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) granted Roundup Ready alfalfa (RRA) nonregulated status under Code of Federal Regulations Title 7 Part 340, called, [...] "Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests", which regulates, among other things, the introduction (importation, interstate movement, or release into the environment) of organisms and products altered or produced through genetic engineering that are plant pests {{or that there}} is reason to believe are plant pests. Monsanto had to seek deregulation to conduct field trials of RRA, because the RRA contains a promoter sequence derived from the plant pathogen <b>figwort</b> mosaic virus. The USDA granted the application for deregulation, stating that the RRA with its modifications: [...] "(1) Exhibit no plant pathogenic properties; (2) are no more likely to become weedy than the nontransgenic parental line or other cultivated alfalfa; (3) are unlikely to increase the weediness potential of any other cultivated or wild species with which it can interbreed; (4) will not cause damage to raw or processed agricultural commodities; (5) will not harm threatened or endangered species or organisms that are beneficial to agriculture; and (6) should not reduce the ability to control pests and weeds in alfalfa or other crops." [...] Monsanto started selling RRA and within two years, more than 300,000 acres were devoted to the plant in the US.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the distribution and {{intraspecific}} systematics of Scrophularia olympica Boiss., one of taxonomically problematic species of <b>figworts.</b>  The special attention {{is given to the}} record of this species from the Crimea from where it had been reported based on the single herbarium specimen collected “infra Baidara” by F. J. Ruprecht in 1861. This collection was previously regarded as made near the village of Orlinoye (former Baydary) in the vicinity of Sevastopol. Actually, the locality “infra Baidara” should be referred to the river Baydara in Georgia, and S. olympica should be excluded both from the floras of the Crimea and Europe as a whole.  Six varieties are recognized within the species; a key to their identification is proposed. Lectotypes of S. olympica var. integrifolia Freyn et Sint., S. olympica var. macrophylla Freyn et Sint., S. olympica var. pinnatifida Trautv.  ex Grossh. and S. olympica var. platyloma Grossh. are designated.

40|$|More than 1800 phanerogamic parasites {{have been}} {{recorded}} throughout the world. Among the most important are the parasitic <b>figworts</b> or Scrophulariaceae, which are economically damaging root parasites. The genus Striga, with more than 50 species, belongs to this family; however, only a few are completely parasitic and damaging to their hosts. Undoubtedly, the major species are S. hermonthica-a widespread and important pest of cereals in Af r ica-and S, asiatica, an important pest both in Asia and in eastern and southern Africa. Although precise estimates of crop loss are difficult to make and data are incomplete, {{it is well known}} that severe losses, amounting in many seasons to total crop failure, are caused by these parasitic weeds. However, there is still a general lack of awareness of the magnitude and importance of the problem. These Proceedings bring together the results of discussions held at Ouagadougou, Upper Volta, in October 1981, where the latest research findings and proposals for further research were presented. They highlight the important advances made in knowledge of the pest species, methods of control, and techniques for breeding for resistance to these noxious weeds. It is hoped that this publication will prompt increased effort to be focused on methods of combat ing Striga and reducing the serious losses it causes to cereal production, and on strengthening links between scientists working in numerous programs to produce solutions to outstanding research roblems...|$|R
