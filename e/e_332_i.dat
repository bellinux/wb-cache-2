40|$|The -secretase {{complex is}} {{responsible}} for the proteolysis of integral membrane proteins. Nicastrin has been proposed to operate as the substrate receptor of the complex with the Glutamate <b>332</b> (<b>E</b> 333 in human) serving as the anionic binding site for the a-amino-terminal group of substrates. The putative binding site is located within the aminopeptidase-like domain of Nicastrin. The <b>E</b> <b>332</b> is proposed to function as the counterpart of the exopeptidase Glu located in the active site of these peptidases. While <b>E</b> <b>332</b> could bind the a-amino-terminal group of substrates, we hypothesized, in analogy with M 28 -aminopeptidases, that other residues in the putative binding site of Nicastrin should participate in the interaction as well. Surprisingly, mutagenesis of these residues affected the in vivo processing of APP and Notch substrates only weakly. In addition, the <b>E</b> <b>332</b> Q mutation, which completely abolishes the anionic a-amino-terminal binding function, remained fully active. When we introduced the previously characterized <b>E</b> <b>332</b> A mutation, we found strongly decreased -secretase complex levels, but the remaining complex appeared as active as the wild type complex. We confirmed in two independent in vitro assays that the specific enzymatic activity of the <b>E</b> <b>332</b> A mutant was comparable to that of the wt-complex. Thus, <b>E</b> <b>332</b> crucially affects complex maturation rather than substrate recognition. Moreover other Nicastrin mutants, designed to either impede or alter substantially the putative binding pocket, affected only marginally -secretase activity. Consequently, these studies indicate that the main role of the <b>E</b> <b>332</b> is in the maturation and assembly of -secretase rather than in the recognition of the substrates. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) {{performs}} {{the first and}} rate-limiting step in the synthesis of catecholamines, which feed back to regulate the enzyme by irreversibly binding to a high-affinity site and inhibiting TH activity. Phosphorylation of Ser 40 relieves this inhibition by allowing dissociation of catecholamine. We have recently documented {{the existence of a}} low-affinity catecholamine binding which is dissociable, is not abolished by phosphorylation, and inhibits TH by competing with the essential cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. Here, we have substituted a number of active site residues to determine the structural nature of the low- and high-affinity sites. <b>E</b> <b>332</b> D and Y 371 F increased the IC 50 of dopamine for the low-affinity site 10 -fold and 7 0 -fold, respectively, in phosphorylated TH, indicating dramatic reductions in affinity. Only 2 − 4 -fold increases in IC 50 were measured in the nonphosphorylated forms of <b>E</b> <b>332</b> D and Y 371 F and also in L 294 A and F 300 Y. This suggests that while the magnitude of low-affinity site inhibition in wild-type TH remains the same upon TH phosphorylation as previously shown, the active site structure changes to place greater importance on <b>E</b> <b>332</b> and Y 371. Changes to high affinity binding were also measured, including a loss of competition with tetrahydrobiopterin for <b>E</b> <b>332</b> D, A 297 L, and Y 371 F and a decreased ability to inhibit catalysis (Vmax) for A 297 L and Y 371 F.

The manganese K-edge (1 s core electron to 4 p) absorption spectrum of D 1 -H <b>332</b> <b>E</b> shifts to a lower energy compared with that of the native WT samples, suggesting that the electronic structure of the manganese cluster is affected by the presence of the additional negative charge on the OEC of the mutant.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Continuous-flow mass {{spectrometry}} (CFMS) {{was used to}} monitor the products formed during the initial 0. 25 − 20 s of the reactions catalyzed by the flavoprotein N-acetylpolyamine oxidase (PAO) and the pterin-dependent enzymes phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheH) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH). N,N′-Dibenzyl- 1, 4 -diaminobutane (DBDB) is a substrate for PAO for which amine oxidation is rate-limiting. CFMS of the reaction showed formation of an initial imine due to oxidation of an exo-carbon−nitrogen bond. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the imine formed benzaldehyde and N-benzyl- 1, 4 -diaminobutane; the subsequent oxidation by PAO of the latter to an additional imine could also be followed. Measurement of the deuterium kinetic isotope effect on DBDB oxidation by CFMS yielded a value of 7. 6 ± 0. 3, in good agreement with a value of 6. 7 ± 0. 6 from steady-state kinetic analyses. In the PheH reaction, the transient formation of the 4 a-hydroxypterin product was readily detected; tandem {{mass spectrometry}} confirmed attachment of the oxygen to C(4 a).

40|$|BACKGROUND: P 450 c 17 has two {{distinct}} activities: 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity and 17, 20 -lyase activity. Combined 17 alpha-hydroxylase/ 17, 20 -lyase deficiency {{leads to a}} severe defect {{in the production of}} cortisol and sex steroids. In affected males this results in impaired masculinization with ambiguous or female external genitalia. Female patients have normal genitalia but show a lack of pubertal development in adolescence. An increased production of mineralocorticoids often leads to hypertension and hypokalemia in both sexes. METHODS: To better understand the mechanisms of P 450 c 17 deficiency, we studied 2 patients (both 46,XY) with combined 17 alpha-hydroxylase/ 17, 20 -lyase deficiency of different severity: one with complete lack of masculinization and one with ambiguous genitalia. RESULTS: Four mutations were identified by sequencing of the CYP 17 A 1 gene: <b>I</b> <b>332</b> T and A 355 T in the less severely affected patient; G 111 S and R 440 H in the patient with complete lack of masculinization.

The extent to which stores of protein, carbohydrate, and fat are used to store short-term surpluses of energy {{and the extent to which}} these stores are used to make up temporary energy deficits are incompletely known. We have measured body energy balance as well as carbohydrate, fat, and protein balances in 27 Caucasian men and 27 Caucasian women over a 24 -h period in a respiratory chamber. An estimated weight-maintenance diet was fed to each subject. Because of individual differences in family background, body composition, activity, and the failure of some subjects to eat all of their food, these estimates are not exact, and energy balance is rarely achieved. Energy balance was correlated with fat balance in men (r = 0. 79, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and women (r = 0. 72, P 3 ̆c O. OOOl), and the slope of this relationship was not distinguishable from unity in men (1. 16 t 0. 18) or women (0. 80 +- 0. 15). There were no correlations between energy balance and either carbohydrate or protein balances. This study demonstrates that carbohydrate and protein stores are closely regulated by adjusting oxidation to intake.

40|$|In the {{textbook}} view, {{the ratio of}} X chromosomes to autosome sets, X:A, is the primary signal specifying sexual fate in Drosophila. An alternative idea is that X chromosome number signals sex through the direct actions of several X-encoded signal element (XSE) proteins. In this alternative, the influence of autosome dose on X chromosome counting is largely indirect. Haploids (1 X; 1 A), which possess the male number of X chromosomes but the female X:A of 1. 0, and triploid intersexes (XX;AAA), which possess a female dose of two X chromosomes and the ambiguous X:A ratio of 0. 67, represent critical tests of these hypotheses. To directly address the effects of ploidy in primary sex determination, we compared {{the responses of the}} signal target, the female-specific SxlPe promoter of the switch gene Sex-lethal, in haploid, diploid, and triploid embryos. We found that haploids activate SxlPe because an extra precellular nuclear division elevates total X chromosome numbers and XSE levels beyond those in diploid males. Conversely, triploid embryos cellularize one cycle earlier than diploids, causing premature cessation of SxlPe expression. This prevents XX;AAA embryos from fully engaging the autoregulatory mechanism that maintains subsequent Sxl expression, causing them to develop as sexual mosaics. We conclude that the X:A ratio predicts sexual fate, but does not actively specify it. Instead, the instructive X chromosome signal is more appropriately seen as collective XSE dose in the early embryo. Our findings reiterate that correlations between X:A ratios and cell fates in other organisms need not implicate the value of the ratio as an active signal.

40|$|In this paper, {{the high}} purity bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA) epoxy resin (D. <b>E.</b> R <b>332),</b> which is mainly used as {{filament}} winding, electrical laminates and encapsulation applications, {{was used as}} a host. The epoxy resins were loaded with nano-SiO 2 and nano-BN in different loading concentrations, and then test of the AC/DC breakdown strength has been performed. It has been observed that the presence of untreated nano-fillers will decrease the AC/DC breakdown strength of nanocomposites. This may be caused by field enhancement resulting from agglomeration of un-treated nano-fillers. The influence of filler concentration and surface treatment, especially the filler type, of particles on AC, DC breakdown strength and space charge has been investigated. Moreover, it has been widely recognised that the presence of moisture in nanocomposites has detrimental effect on the electrical performance. Therefore, the water absorption of epoxy nanocomposites and its impact on electrical performance has also been considered...|$|R
40|$|P 2 X receptors are ATP-gated cation {{channels}} {{consisting of}} three subunits that are mutually intertwined and form an upper, central, and extracellular vestibule with three lateral portals {{and the channel}} pore. Here we used cysteine and alanine scanning mutagenesis of the rat P 2 X 4 R receptor V 47 -V 61 and K 326 -N 338 sequences to study structural and functional properties of extracellular vestibule during gating. Cysteine mutants were {{used to test the}} accessibility of these residue side chains to cadmium during closed-open-desensitized transitions, whereas alanine mutants served as controls. This study revealed the accessibility of residues E 51, T 57, S 59, V 61, K 326, and M 336 to cadmium in channels undergoing a transition from a closed-to-open state and the accessibility of residues V 47, G 53, D 331, <b>I</b> <b>332,</b> <b>I</b> 333, T 335, I 337, and N 338 in channels undergoing a transition from an open-to-desensitized state; residues E 56 and K 329 were accessible during both transitions. The effect of cadmium on channel gating was stimulatory in all reactive V 47 -V 61 mutants and inhibitory in the majority of reactive K 326 -N 338 mutants. The rat P 2 X 4 receptor homology model suggests that residues affected by cadmium in the closed-to-open transition were located within the lumen of the extracellular vestibule and toward the central vestibule; however, the residues affected by cadmium in the open-to-desensitized state were located {{at the bottom of the}} vestibule near the pore. Analysis of the model assumed that there is ion access to extracellular and central vestibules through lateral ports when the channel is closed, with residues above the first transmembrane domain being predominantly responsible for ion uptake. Upon receptor activation, there is passage of ions toward the residues located on the upper region of the second transmembrane domain, followed by permeation through the gate region...|$|R
40|$|Human rabies {{cases in}} the Guangxi {{province}} of China decreased from 839 in 1982 to 24 in 1995, but subsequently underwent a sharp increase, and has since maintained a high level. 3, 040 brain samples from normal dogs and cats were collected from 14 districts of Guangxi and assessed by RT-PCR. The brain samples showed an average rabies virus (RV) positivity rate of 3. 26 %, but reached 4. 71 % for the period Apr 2002 to Dec 2003. A total of 30 isolates were obtained from normal dogs and 28 isolates from rabid animals by the mouse inoculation test (MIT). Six representative group I and II RV isolates showed an LD 50 of 10 - 5. 35 /ml to 10 - 6. 19 /ml. The reactivity of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to group I and II RV isolates from the Guangxi major epidemic showed that eight anti-G MAbs showed strong reactivity with isolates of group I and II with titers of ≥ 10, 000; however, the MAbs 9 - 6, 13 - 3 and 12 - 14 showed lower reactivity. Phylogenetic analysis based on the G gene demonstrated that the Guangxi RV isolates have similar topologies with strong bootstrap values and are closely bonded. Alignment of deduced amino acids revealed that the mature G protein has four substitutions A 96 S, L 132 F, N 436 S, and A 447 I specific to group I, and 13 substitutions T 90 M, Y 168 C, S 204 G, T 249 I, P 253 S, S 289 T, V <b>332</b> <b>I,</b> Q 382 H, V 427 I, L 474 P, R 463 K Q 486 H, and T 487 N specific to group II, coinciding with the phylogenetic analysis of the isolates. Re-emergence of human rabies has mainly occurred in rural areas of Guangxi since 1996. The human rabies incidence rate increased is related with RV positive rate of normal dogs. The Guangxi isolates tested showed a similar pathogenicity and antigenicity. The results of phylogenetic analysis coincide with that of alignment of deduced amino acids...|$|R
40|$|Cdc 6 p {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of {{the cell}} cycle in eukaryotes {{and is a member}} of the AAA(+) (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) family of proteins. In this family of proteins, the sensor 1 and sensor 2 regions are important for their function and ATPase activity. Here, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to examine the role of these regions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc 6 p in controlling the cell cycle progression and initiation of DNA replication. Two important amino acid residues (Asn(263) in sensor 1 and Arg(332) in sensor 2) were identified as key residues for Cdc 6 p function in vivo. Cells expressing mutant Cdc 6 p (N 263 A or R <b>332</b> <b>E)</b> grew slowly and accumulated in the S phase. In cells expressing mutant Cdc 6 p, loading of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex of proteins was decreased, suggesting that the slow progression of S phase in these cells was due to inefficient MCM loading on chromatin. Purified wild type Cdc 6 p but not mutant Cdc 6 p (N 263 A and R <b>332</b> <b>E)</b> caused the structural modification of origin recognition complex proteins. These results are consistent with the idea that Cdc 6 p uses its ATPase activity to change the conformation of origin recognition complex, and then together they recruit the MCM complex...|$|R
30|$|Shields et al. {{performed}} single alanine point mutations of all solvent-exposed {{amino acids}} in CH 2 and CH 3 domains of human IgG 1. They further demonstrated that combining several identified mutations (e.g., S 298 A/E 333 A/K 334 A) resulted in enhanced ADCC relative to IgG 1 (Shields et al., 2001). Lazar et al. engineered {{a series of}} Fc variants with optimized Fcγ receptor affinity using computational design algorithms and high-throughput screening. The authors identified S 239 D/I <b>332</b> <b>E</b> and S 239 D/I 332 E/A 330 L as two variants with enhanced ADCC activity (Lazar et al., 2006). A crystal structure of an Fc fragment with the mutations S 239 D/A 330 L/I <b>332</b> <b>E</b> was solved and modeling studies suggested that additional hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, and/or electrostatic interactions resulted in enhanced binding to FcγRIIIa (Oganesyan et al., 2008). Richards demonstrated that the addition of G 236 A to the S 239 D/I <b>332</b> <b>E</b> mutations resulted in up to 70 -fold improved binding to FcγRIIa, a 13 -fold improvement in the FcγRIIa/FcγRIIb binding ratio (activating/inhibitory ratio), and enhanced phagocytosis of antibody-coated target cells by macrophages (Richards et al., 2008). Stavenhagen et al. utilized yeast surface display to identify the variant F 243 L/R 292 P/Y 300 L/V 305 I/P 396 L, which showed > 100 fold increased ADCC activity (Stavenhagen et al., 2007). Margetuximab, an anti-HER 2 mAb with these 5 mutations completed a phase I clinical trial for patients with HER 2 -overexpressing carcinomas (Bang et al., 2017). Mimoto et al. designed antibody variants with an asymmetrically engineered Fc domain by introducing different amino acid changes in each Fc domain. They screened ~ 1000 variants and demonstrated that L 234 Y/L 235 Q/G 236 W/S 239 M/H 268 D/D 270 E/S 298 A changes in one Fc domain and D 270 E/K 326 D/A 330 M/K 334 E changes in the other increased affinity for FcγRIIIa F 158 by more than 2000 -fold and FcγRIIIa V 158 by more than 1000 -fold (Mimoto et al., 2013 a). Together, these investigations demonstrate that various technologies can be employed to obtain Fc variants with enhanced FcγR-dependent effector function.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The human {{restriction}} factor TRIM 5 α {{may play}} an important role in regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is unclear whether non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNP) in TRIM 5 α affect the clinical course of HIV infection. Findings We surveyed the literature for TRIM 5 α nsSNPs and used comparative sequence analysis to predict the effect of each polymorphism on protein function. Twenty-eight nsSNPs were identified with available functional data, clinical data, or both. The four comparative method programs assessed included SIFT, PolyPhen, A-GVGD, and average BLOSUM 62 pairwise score. Two common polymorphisms, H 43 Y and R 136 Q, were predicted to be benign based on comparative sequence analysis. The nsSNPs P 323 R, K 324 N, I 328 M, G 330 Q, R <b>332</b> P, <b>I</b> 348 V, and T 369 S were all predicted to affect protein function. Conclusion Comparative sequence analysis offers a functional tool to analyze unknown nsSNPs in TRIM 5 α. </p...|$|R
