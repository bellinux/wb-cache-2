500|$|The {{second section}} of Facundo explores {{the life of}} its titular character, Juan Facundo Quirogathe [...] "Tiger of the Plains". Despite being born into a wealthy family, Facundo {{received}} only a basic education in reading and writing. He loved gambling, being called el jugador (the player)in fact, Sarmiento describes his gambling as [...] "an ardent passion burning in his belly". As a youth Facundo was antisocial and rebellious, refusing to mix with other children, and these traits became more pronounced as he matured. Sarmiento describes an incident in which Facundo killed a man, writing {{that this type of}} behaviour [...] "marked his passage through the world". Sarmiento gives a physical description of the man he considers to personify the caudillo: [...] " [...] short and well built stature; <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> supported, on a short neck, a well-formed head covered with very thick, black and curly hair", with [...] "eyes ...full of fire".|$|E
2500|$|His next {{release was}} Ashu Trikha's Deewaanapan, in which Rampal was paired with Dia Mirza. He earned {{critical}} acclaim for his performance, {{but the film}} flopped at the box office. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal carries the film on <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> and {{comes up with a}} sincere performance that is consistent throughout. He is wonderful in action sequences and springs a pleasant surprise in the emotional moments by delivering the apposite expressions." [...] Ashish Magotra of Rediff gave negative reviews on Rampal, writing: [...] "Among the actors, Arjun Rampal as the hero does pretty much what he has been known to do. He models. His acting capabilities leave a lot to be desired." [...] His last release of the year was Ashok Mehta's Moksha. It was actually his first film, but was released after Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat. Rampal was paired with famous actress Manisha Koirala in a lead role in Moksha. This film marked Rampal's third consecutive flop at the box office, but Rampal earned critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal excels in a role that was difficult to portray. He takes giant strides as a performer and proves that he's an actor with an amazing range." [...] Priyanka Bhattacharya of Rediff considered the movie to be [...] "more a 70-mm portfolio for Arjun Rampal than a story." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{all looked}} at Geoffrey. He shrugged <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Youse don't know me, miss," [...] he said, and stooping {{he lifted}} {{the body of the}} Frenchman to <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and started up the {{hillside}} through the trackless underbrush.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take care,' said Theodora, peeping {{out beyond}} the shadow of <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder.</b> 'Tis under the strictest seal of confidence; she asked my advice {{as soon as she}} had done it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mavering put {{his hand}} on <b>his</b> friend's <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and gave him a playful push.|$|R
60|$|But {{the smith}} had shrugged <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> and uttered an exclamation of contempt.|$|E
60|$|With a shrug of <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> he {{dismissed}} what seemed an encroachment of pessimistic thought.|$|E
60|$|Taurus Antinor shrugged <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> with marked {{contempt}} for his forbearance {{was threatening to}} give way.|$|E
60|$|Having limped {{on until}} the village was quite hidden from view, the sailor quietly put his crutch across <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and {{brightening}} up wonderfully, walked across the moor {{at the rate of}} full five miles an hour, whistling gaily in concert with the larks as he sped along.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{do not believe in}} miracles," [...] said Decoud, quietly. Father Corbelan shrugged <b>his</b> high, <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> doubtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Git back, Bill, git back!" [...] he roared. [...] "Git 'em back!" [...] With one lunge Stillwell shoved Stewart and Nick and {{the other}} cowboys up on the porch. Then he crowded Madeline and Alfred and Florence to the wall, tried to force them farther. His motions were rapid and stern. But failing to get them through door and windows, he planted his wide person between the women and danger. Madeline grasped his arm, held on, and peered fearfully from behind <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, Francois; don't quarrel for nothing," [...] said Massan, {{interposing}} <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> {{and pushing}} him vigorously back.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Cause you're {{black and}} don't need no clothing," [...] said Hockins, awkwardly {{attempting}} {{to put the}} lamba on <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|E
60|$|He breathed heavily, and squared <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> {{as one who}} braces {{himself for}} battle against an element {{stronger}} than himself.|$|E
6000|$|Outside, {{the wind}} shook the frail {{building}} and tore the shuddering sea to pieces. The rain poured down. It was already settling {{in for a}} night of storm. But, inside, Young Si's fire was casting cheery flames over the rude room, and Young Si himself was kneeling by Ethel Lennox with his arm about her and her head on <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder.</b> There were happy {{tears in her eyes}} and her voice quivered as she said, [...] "Miles, can you forgive me? If you knew how bitterly I have repented--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We'll put you {{to sleep}} as {{sound as if}} you were in a hammock just off middle watch,' said Harry; and the next moment he had her rolled up in her little blue dressing-gown, {{nestling}} on <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder,</b> while he walked up and down the room, crooning out a nautical song, not in first-rate style, but the effect was perfect; the struggles and sobs were over, and when {{at the end of a}} quarter of an hour Harry paused and looked at the little thin sharp face, it was softened by peaceful sleep.|$|R
5000|$|Fleeman is {{described}} as having a large round head with dull hair that stood on end giving the impression he had been [...] "scared out of <b>his</b> wits", <b>broad</b> <b>shouldered</b> and possessing formidable strength. He often went barefoot and wore basic clothing of sack-cloth or serge material.|$|R
60|$|Marizano {{smiled and}} shrugged <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> but made no reply, for just then his {{attention}} had {{been attracted to}} the slave-girl.|$|E
60|$|Black Star {{bent his}} graceful neck and bowed his noble head, and <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> yielded as he knelt for Jane to mount.|$|E
6000|$|... "Small, young man!" [...] {{repeated}} the Captain, with feigned surprise, {{as he drew}} himself up to his full height and squared <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|E
60|$|The tribe {{had kept}} his women. He must find others to replace them. This hairless white ape {{would be the first}} of his new household, and so he threw her roughly across <b>his</b> <b>broad,</b> hairy <b>shoulders</b> and leaped back into the trees, bearing Jane away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aint she a peart young un?" [...] said Tom, {{holding her}} {{from him to}} take a {{full-length}} view; then, getting up, he set her on <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and began capering and dancing with her, while Mas'r George snapped at her with his pocket-handkerchief, and Mose and Pete, now returned again, roared after her like bears, till Aunt Chloe declared that they [...] "fairly took her head off" [...] with their noise. As, according to her own statement, this surgical operation was a matter of daily occurrence in the cabin, the declaration no whit abated the merriment, till every one had roared and tumbled and danced themselves down to a state of composure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yis--de Izlrights, to be sure. I mis-remembered. Ho! look; dar's de house-tops now; an' {{the pine}} grove whar' we was use to hold palaver 'bout you, Massa, arter you was lost; an'--yis--dat's de house--yous own house. You see de wife lookin' out o' winder bery soon. I knows it by de pig-sty close 'longside whar' de big grumper sow libs, dat Ziffa's so fond o' playin' wid. Ho! Lippy, come here, you little naked ting," [...] (he caught up the child an' sat her on <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder).</b> [...] "You see de small leetil house. Dat's it. Dat's whar' Ziffa lubs to play, but she'll hab {{you to play}} wid soon, an' den she'll forsake de ole sow. Ho! but I forgit--you no understan' English." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right, dame," [...] {{said the}} armourer; and, {{throwing}} the buckler over <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> he departed {{from his house}} without abiding farther question.|$|E
6000|$|... "The danger may bide," [...] said he, shrugging <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders.</b> [...] "And now, Tiphaine, tell us {{what will}} come of this war in Spain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{that it is}} a lie, Illustrious, like {{everything}} else that he has told us," [...] replied Acour with a shrug of <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sally, {{regarding}} the wash-tub {{from a different}} point of view, looked sourly serious, and hurried away with Lizzie, who trotted submissively along, her little head in eclipse under a large nankin bonnet, while Mr. Jerome followed leisurely with <b>his</b> full <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> in rather a stooping posture, and his large good-natured features and white locks shaded by a broad-brimmed hat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] {{answered}} Claus, {{pleased that}} the toy he had made could give pleasure to the child. So he wrapped {{the boy and the}} wooden cat in a warm cloak, perching the bundle upon <b>his</b> own <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and then he tramped through the snow and the drifts of the Valley and across the plain beyond to the poor cottage where Weekum's mother lived.|$|R
60|$|This was {{all that}} was said on the subject. The thing was, as the captain said, settled off-hand, and {{accordingly}} next morning he conveyed such of his worldly goods as he meant to retain possession of to his sister's cottage--"the new ship", as he styled it. He carried his traps on <b>his</b> own <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and the conveyance of them cost him three distinct trips.|$|R
6000|$|... "But they're {{frightened of}} me," [...] he added, {{with a shrug}} of <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> [...] "and I don't seem {{to know how to}} tackle them." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} the stout negro had the pirate on <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and, under his guidance, mounted the slightly-marked path that led to Zeppa's retreat.|$|E
60|$|Wessex shrugged <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> {{and turned}} to where a pretty wench, {{dispensing}} ale to a scarlet-cloaked burgher, formed a picture pleasing to his artistic eye.|$|E
50|$|He was an {{aggressive}} batman, stocky in build like his father, particularly later in <b>his</b> career, with <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> and strong arms. He played mainly {{off the back}} foot, cutting square, hooking, and driving on the off side. He was also a good fielder with safe hands.|$|R
60|$|When he {{was gone}} Red Rooney raised himself on one elbow, and looked over his {{shoulder}} at Okiok with a broad grin. Okiok, who felt grave enough at the moment, and somewhat perplexed, opened his eyes gradually, and reciprocated the smile with interest. By degrees he closed the eyes, and allowed the smile to develop into a high falsetto chuckle which convulsed <b>his</b> <b>broad</b> hairy <b>shoulders</b> for full five minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} that that wasn't my line, unless he'd try Eley's greens at forty yards; and then I was his man: but if he laid a finger on me, I'd give him as sound a horsewhipping, old as I am, as ever man had in his life. And so I would." [...] And Mark looked complacently at <b>his</b> own <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders.</b> [...] "And since then, my lord and I have had it all our own way; and Minchampstead and Co. is the only firm in the vale." ...|$|R
