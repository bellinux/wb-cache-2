5|$|After Montagu's death his son {{elected to}} {{continue}} living at nearby Townhill Park House, and South Stoneham was subsequently sold to University College Southampton (now the University of Southampton) {{for use as}} student accommodation. In 1964 the building was considerably altered by adding a 17-storey tower and a kitchen and dining complex to the building. In 2004 the University submitted plans to demolish these extensions {{with the intention of}} converting the original <b>house</b> <b>into</b> a conference venue and building new blocks of flats on the remaining landscaped gardens.

According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one {{prepared}} by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla <b>House,</b> <b>into</b> a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Marrash {{was famous}} for the salon she held in the home she shared with her husband. She had {{travelled}} to Europe once, and was impressed by what she saw of life there.

5|$|Shakuni schemes an evil plan to {{kill the}} Pandavas through trickery. He {{constructs}} a house made of wax in Varanasi. Pandavas are ordered to go on pilgrimage to Varanasi until the troubled affairs of the state are resolved. Krishna sees through the plan of the evil Shakuni. He warns Bheema {{to keep an eye}} on miscreants trying to burn the house. He later orders Bheema to dig an underground tunnel from the wax <b>house</b> <b>into</b> a forest nearby, which Bheema does. On a midnight, as Krishna predicted, the house is burned by fire on the orders of Duryodhana.|$|E
5|$|The {{homes were}} reached through tunnels. Other {{examples}} of subterranean, semi-subterranean or cliff-based dwellings in both {{hot and cold}} climates are found in Turkey, northern China and the Himalayas, and the southwest USA. A number of Buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in Himalayan areas such as Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and northern India are often perilously placed. Starting in the 1970s, interest in the technique has revived in developed countries.

The skit, first conceived in 2009 and roughly modeled after TED Talks, features Resnick telling the audience how to create a complete digital backup of himself. Long-time associate Ben O'Brien co-produced, directed and edited the special along with Resnick. In addition, both co-produced the episode under their video production division, AB Video Solutions. Resnick, along with set decorator Emma Alamo, transformed Resnick's <b>house</b> <b>into</b> the set of the special.|$|E

When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace, ordering him to move to a retirement home. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his <b>house</b> <b>into</b> a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons. Russell, a young Wilderness Explorer who visited Carl in his effort to earn his final merit badge, for assisting the elderly, becomes an accidental stowaway.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} in 1820, King GeorgeIV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the <b>house</b> <b>into</b> a palace {{with the help of}} his architect John Nash. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by GeorgeIV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of GeorgeIV in 1830, his younger brother King WilliamIV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. After the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|As NY38 enters Auburn, {{it passes}} by Auburn High School before heading north through densely {{populated}} blocks filled with homes. The divided highway ends abruptly at Swift Street, where NY38 turns west {{to follow the}} two-lane undivided Swift Street west for seven blocks to NY34 (South Street). Here, NY38 leaves Swift Street and joins NY34 on South Street. The two routes follow South Street past the William H. Seward <b>House</b> <b>into</b> downtown Auburn, where the homes are replaced with businesses at Lincoln Street. Three blocks later, South Street intersects with the East Arterial (eastbound US20 and NY5). The overlap between NY34 and NY38 ends one block later at the West Arterial (westbound US20 and NY5), where NY38 turns to follow the Arterial for a block to the west.|$|E
5|$|Balfour {{also gave}} the island its most {{noticeable}} landmark when he recruited an Edinburgh architect, David Bryce, to transform Cliffdale <b>House</b> <b>into</b> the Scottish Baronial Balfour Castle. Other buildings he {{added to the}} island include the porter's lodge (now a public house called The Gatehouse), a water mill, a school, and a gasworks that remained operational until the 1920s. The gasworks {{is in the form}} of a round tower with a corbelled parapet of red brick and carved stones—including one possibly removed from Noltland Castle on Westray, which is inscribed with the year 1725. The structure appears to be fortified, in accordance with Balfour's intention to give the village a medieval appearance. David Balfour was also responsible for the construction of Mill Dam, a wetland which was once the water supply for the mill and is now an RSPB nature reserve.|$|E
5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the <b>house</b> <b>into</b> upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E

5|$|In 1823 Hogg met Jane Williams {{while they}} were both visiting Percy Shelley's friend John Gisborne, husband of Maria Gisborne. Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley's shortly before his death. Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident, leaving Jane alone with two young children. Hogg soon became very enamoured with her. They saw {{each other at the}} Gisborne {{household}} regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December he went back to Northern England to see his family. While he was there, he began writing to Jane regularly. The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother's house, and they often took long walks together. In March she moved out of her mother's <b>house</b> <b>into</b> a home of her own, allowing Hogg to see her more freely.|$|E
5|$|Leicester House was {{intermittently}} inhabited {{during the}} mid-18th century, and was finally {{sold to the}} naturalist Ashton Lever in 1775. Lever turned the <b>house</b> <b>into</b> a museum with {{a significant amount of}} natural history objects. In turn, the square began to serve as a venue for popular entertainments. Brothels started appearing around Leicester Square during the century, and visitors could pay to watch the severed heads of traitors executed at Temple Bar through a telescope. Leicester House became home of a museum of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s. It was demolished in 1791–72 due to rising debts following the extinction of the Leicester peerage, and replaced by Leicester Place. That in turn was converted into a church in 1865 and is now the site of the Prince Charles Cinema.|$|E
5|$|St Helen's Church is the Anglican parish {{church of}} Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in the deanery of North West Leicestershire and the Diocese of Leicester. There was {{a church in}} the town in the 11th century, but {{the core of the}} present {{building}} mainly dates from work started in 1474, when the church was rebuilt by William Hastings {{at the same time that}} he converted his neighbouring manor <b>house</b> <b>into</b> a castle. The church was refurbished in about 1670 to create more space, but the large and increasing size of the congregation led to further work in 1829, and a major rebuild in 1878–80, including the widening of the nave by the addition of two outer aisles.|$|E
