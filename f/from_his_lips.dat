25|$|Byron would pleasantly {{pretend that}} Braham called 'enthusiasm' entoozy-moozy; {{and in the}} {{extraordinary}} combination of lightness, haste, indifference and fervour with which he would pitch out that single word <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> accompanied with a gesture to correspond, he would really set before you the admirable singer {{in one of his}} (then) characteristic passages of stage dialogue. He did not live to see Braham become an exception in his dialogue as in his singing.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{after signing}} his first solo career record deal, Osbourne bit the {{head off a}} dove during a meeting with CBS Records {{executives}} in Los Angeles. Apparently {{he had planned to}} release doves into the air as a sign of peace, but due to being intoxicated at the time, he instead grabbed a dove and bit its head off. He then spat the head out, with blood still dripping <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> Despite its controversy, the head-biting act has been parodied and alluded to several times throughout his career and is part of what made Osbourne famous.|$|E
25|$|Job was quiet, brief in words, and {{the only}} sound heard <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> was the Jesus prayer. For many days and weeks he would retreat into his locked cave, so narrow that entry is difficult, and so small that it was {{impossible}} to sit, stand or lie conveniently. From the long periods of kneeling, his knees were covered with wounds, and wearing knee-marks into the rock floor. His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural light coming from the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight was terrified and fell to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|He boarded {{then the}} noblest ship [...] And from the harbor glided. [...] "Adieu, adieu!" [...] fell <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] Verdict: [...] "He suicided." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mummy, {{come and}} look at Daddy!" [...] the boy shrieked. [...] "He's cut off all the hair <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> and he's got such funny clothes on! Do come {{and look at}} his hat!" ...|$|R
60|$|He wore a soiled suit of blue flannel {{with a pair}} {{of dirty}} cricketing shoes; a dingy gray {{moustache}} drooped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> and daylight could be seen in two places between the rim and the crown of his hat.|$|R
500|$|A [...] New York Times profile {{said that}} [...] "his life story reads {{more like the}} script of an Errol Flynn adventure", though the stories he told about himself were often dubious. He was once {{described}} as [...] "a feisty little man who always had a cigarette dangling <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> and {{looked more like a}} bartender than a choreographer." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "cartoon-like, diseased lung cowboy created by crossing the diseased lung pictured on cigarette packs in Australia with the Marlboro Man". Similarly, Rolling Stone Daniel Kreps said Jeff helps to [...] "bridge the gap between the Marlboro Man ... and a 'lung that looks like you're breathing through baked ziti'". Alicia Lu of Bustle wrote: Sure, he may be an anthropomorphic lung that's decaying from being exposed to years of cigarette smoke, which might not be Big Tobacco's first choice for branding, but he's a cowboy. Look at his regal cowboy hat, his spiffy red cowboy boots, and the way that cigarette nonchalantly dangles <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> – doesn't Jeff remind you of a figure from days of yore? If you squint, I swear you'll see the Marlboro Man.|$|E
2500|$|The writer Lamartine [...] left a vivid {{description}} of Thiers, {{with whom he}} had dinner at this time: [...] "He spoke first; he spoke last; he hardly listened to the replies; but he spoke with an accuracy, with an audacity, with a fecundity of ideas, that excused his volubility of words <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> It was his spirit and heart which spoke....There was enough gunpowder in his nature to explode six governments." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Henry {{reined in}} {{his horse and}} looked upon her, the blood flowing <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] "Ay, Jess?" [...] says he. [...] "You too? And yet ye should ken me better." [...] For {{it was he who}} had helped her with money.|$|R
6000|$|... "One gets in and it's all over," [...] Klaus said. [...] "They move fast. One lets all {{the rest}} inside. They're inflexible. Machines with one purpose. They were built for only one thing." [...] He rubbed sweat <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] "We saw." ...|$|R

2500|$|According to Guiraud, Dominic abstained from meat, [...] "observed stated fasts and {{periods of}} silence", [...] "selected the worst {{accommodations}} and the meanest clothes", and [...] "never allowed himself {{the luxury of}} a bed". [...] "When travelling, he beguiled the journey with spiritual instruction and prayers". Guiraud also states that [...] "as soon as Dominic passed the limits of towns and villages, {{he took off his}} shoes, and, however sharp the stones or thorns, he trudged on his way barefooted", and that [...] "rain and other discomforts elicited <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> nothing but praises to God".|$|E
2500|$|The {{officials}} {{were unable to}} use their whistles after the opening kick-off. As referee Norm Schachter blew his metal whistle to signal the start of play, it froze to his lips. As he attempted to free the whistle <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> the skin ripped off and his lips began to bleed. The conditions were so hostile that instead of forming a scab, the blood simply froze to his lip. For {{the rest of the}} game, the officials used voice commands and calls to end plays and officiate the game. At one point during the game, CBS announcer Frank Gifford said on air, [...] "I'm going to take a bite of my coffee." ...|$|E
2500|$|With his clipped speech, cool {{smile and}} a {{cigarette}} dangling impudently <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> Laurence Harvey established himself as the screen's perfect pin-striped cad. He could project such utter boredom that willowy debutantes would shrivel in his presence. He could also exude such charm that the same young ladies would gladly lend him their hearts, which were usually returned utterly broken... The image Mr Harvey carefully fostered for himself off screen was not far removed {{from some of the}} roles he played. [...] "I'm a flamboyant character, an extrovert who doesn't want to reveal his feelings", he once said. [...] "To bare your soul to the world, I find unutterably boring. I think part of our profession is to have a quixotic personality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die. [...] He, mildly smiling, in his milk-white palm [...] Close-held {{a golden}} apple, lightningbright [...] With changeful flashes, dropt with dew of Heaven [...] Ambrosially smelling. <b>From</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> [...] Curved crimson, the full-flowing river of speech [...] Came down upon my heart.|$|R
60|$|Blunt {{had picked}} up the clog he had dropped when he first {{attacked}} the lad, and now stood over the struggling heap, white with rage, the blood running <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> cut and puffed where Myles had struck him, and murder looking out <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face, if ever it looked out of the face of any mortal being.|$|R
60|$|A sigh {{of relief}} broke <b>from</b> <b>his</b> parched <b>lips,</b> and the colour came back to his cheeks.|$|R
2500|$|General Norman Schwarzkopf, who {{commanded}} US forces {{during the}} Gulf War against Iraq in 1991, served as Trưởng's adviser in the 1960s {{when he was}} deployed to South Vietnam as a major during a campaign at Ia Drang. He wrote in his autobiography It Doesn't Take A Hero, that Trưởng [...] "did not look like my idea of a military genius: only five feet seven … very skinny, with hunched shoulders and a head that seemed too big for his body … His face was pinched and intense … {{and there was always}} a cigarette hanging <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> Yet he was revered by his officers and troopsand feared by those North Vietnamese commanders who knew of his ability." [...] Schwarzkopf said that Trưởng was [...] "the most brilliant tactical commander I'd ever known" [...] and that [...] "by visualizing the terrain and drawing on his experience fighting the enemy for fifteen years, Truong showed an uncanny ability to predict {{what they were going to}} do".|$|E

40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of either Samuel Meyer (or Ben R. or Alexander Meyer), shown in profile, [s. d. ]. A man is shown from the chest up, facing right, wearing {{what appears to}} be a button peacoat. A large, grisly moustache grows <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> bookending either side of his mouth. The hair on his head is trimmed close to the scalp, and receding <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead. He appears to be in his late forties...|$|R

5000|$|In 2008 Rowlatt {{became the}} first {{television}} journalist to interview a serving MI6 agent; the intelligence service was seeking to broaden its recruitment. Rowlatt says of his interviewing technique, [...] "It wasn’t like a Paxman interview but I {{was trying to get}} under his skin a bit and understand {{what it was like to}} do his job." [...] Under the hot camera lights, the agent's false moustache slipped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip.</b> <b>His</b> technique evidently annoyed Sir Alan Sugar, the entrepreneur at the centre of The Apprentice, when Today arranged a tenth anniversary interview. Rowlatt asked him about bullying; Sugar objected, called him a [...] "crap reporter", and walked out.|$|R
60|$|Then with knitted brows {{he began}} to read onward <b>from</b> a mark, <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> moving.|$|R
