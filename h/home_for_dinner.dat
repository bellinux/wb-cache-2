5|$|The Mangalorean Catholics {{constituted}} {{a small community}} widely scattered across the South Canara district. Rather than being a closely knit and united group, the Goan Catholic immigrants and their progeny did not associate with the native Catholics on account of caste, origin, and language, and even among themselves were strongly divided by caste. The Hindus, including the indigenous Brahmins (mostly belonging to the Shivalli, Havyaka, and Kota sub-groups) and Bunts did not associate with the Catholics and would not admit them into their houses on account of their religion. However, a close contact was kept by the Catholics with the Hindus of the same caste who were refugees from Goa. Catholics would invite their Hindu cousins to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings, and funeral feasts. The Hindus accepted such invitations. Unlike his Hindu counterpart, a high-caste Mangalorean Catholic did not consider himself polluted upon physical contact {{with a member of}} the lower caste, but members of different castes did not fraternise or invite each other <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b>|$|E

Brooks began pursuing his interest in aviation, taking flying lessons at a local airstrip, where he was observed on several occasions by Henry Ford. His father played the violin at dances at a local inn and met Ford. The elder Brooks invited Ford <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> and introduced him to his son.|$|E

25|$|At around 6pm on 5 June 1983, Einem (possibly {{along with}} other unknown persons) {{abducted}} Kelvin in a North Adelaide street, just 60 metres from Kelvins' home in Ward Street. Kelvin had just seen off a friend at a nearby bus stop {{on the corner of}} O'Connell and Marian Streets, North Adelaide, and was returning <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> Several witnesses living near to the Kelvins' home heard cries for help, car doors slamming, and a car with a noisy exhaust speeding away. Significantly, Kelvin had a dog collar in his possession which was likely to have attracted Einem's attention. Einem then tortured, drugged, raped and held Kelvin captive for five weeks, before murdering him and dumping his body alongside an airstrip near Kersbrook in the Adelaide Hills area (to the north-east of the city and close to where relatives of Einem lived).|$|E
500|$|This {{aversion to}} war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein {{a tour of}} his studio and {{introduced}} him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a [...] "highly emotional temperament," [...] from which came his [...] "extraordinary intellectual energy".|$|E

During the family introduction, Sam explains that, as mentioned in Cheers, Frasier's father {{was supposed to be a}} dead scientist and that Frasier is supposed to be the only child, much to dismay of Frasier's family. Frasier explains the inconsistency, indicating that he had an argument with Martin, which motivated him into making up the [...] "dead scientist father" [...] story.|$|E
500|$|After a {{relationship}} in the mid-1860s with the novelist Annie Thomas, Gilbert married Lucy Agnes Turner, whom he called [...] "Kitty", in 1867; she was 11 years his junior. He wrote many affectionate letters to her over the years. Gilbert and Lucy were socially active both in London and later at Grim's Dyke, often holding dinner parties and being invited to others' <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner,</b> {{in contrast to the}} picture painted by fictionalisations such as the film Topsy-Turvy. The Gilberts had no children, but they had many pets, including some exotic ones.|$|R
50|$|Unsatisfied {{with the}} actors {{cast in the}} leads, Hitchcock shifted {{the point of view}} of the plot from the defecting scientist's wife to the American amateur spy and he {{centered}} his attention in the colorful international actors who played supporting roles in the film. Lila Kedrova was Hitchcock's favorite among the cast; he ate lunch with her several times during filming and invited her <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinners</b> with his wife. Although the length of the film was shortened in post-production, Hitchcock left intact Countess Kutchiska's scenes in the final film.|$|R

The Lutz family owned the bar until 1954, when it was purchased by the Barisich family. Lilias Barisich, who shared ownership with her brothers after their parents handed it over to them, said of the bar and her mother's operating style: [...] "It's always been a homey place because my mom would kick people out if they acted different. She'd tell them they wouldn't act that way if they were invited to our <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner,</b> {{so there was no}} call to act like that at the Lutz." ...|$|E
500|$|Very {{became known}} {{for his ability to}} draw people into literature, and was asked to speak at a lyceum in his {{hometown}} of Salem in 1837.

Very lectured on epic poetry on April 4 of that year, after he had walked twenty miles from Salem to Concord to deliver it. [...] Emerson made up for the meager $10 payment by inviting Very to his <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> Emerson signed Very's personal copy of Nature with the words: [...] "Har of Man with Nature Must Be Reconciled With God".|$|E

After several minutes of fighting, Melllvar's mother appears and makes him come <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> While he is gone, the two groups combine the engine of the cast's ship with the hull of the Planet Express Ship to escape. To lose enough weight to lift off, the cast jettison their bodies. Melllvar follows the crew into space with his own ship, a Klingon Bird of Prey. Zapp Brannigan boards the Planet Express Ship and [...] holds a court-martial of the occupants for trespassing on Omega 3. Leela points out that while the court-martial is in progress Melllvar is still chasing them. Fry convinces Melllvar that he cannot spend his life watching Star Trek, and Melllvar agrees to end the chase. The crew and cast return to Earth.|$|E

500|$|In 1878, Gilbert {{realised}} {{a lifelong}} dream to play Harlequin, {{which he did}} at the Gaiety Theatre {{as part of an}} amateur charity production of The Forty Thieves, partly written by himself. [...] Gilbert trained for Harlequin's stylised dancing with his friend John D'Auban, who had arranged the dances for some of his plays and would choreograph most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] Producer John Hollingshead later remembered, [...] "the gem of the performance was the grimly earnest and determined Harlequin of W. S. Gilbert. It gave me an idea of what Oliver Cromwell would have made of the character." [...] Another member of the cast recalled that Gilbert was tirelessly enthusiastic about the piece and often invited the cast to his <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> extra rehearsals. [...] "A pleasanter, more genial, or agreeable companion than he was it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to find." [...] In 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre, so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study. Gilbert had referred to the new technology in Pinafore in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service.|$|E
500|$|When public {{relations}} specialist Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) departs from an unsuccessful meeting pitching his All-Heart logo for corporations who are extraordinarily charitable, he becomes trapped on railroad tracks with an incoming freight train. Hancock saves Ray's life but he causes {{the train to}} derail and nearly injures another driver. Hancock is jeered by other drivers for causing more damage but Ray steps in and publicly thanks Hancock for saving his life. Ray invites him <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> with his wife, Mary ( [...] Charlize Theron), and their son, Aaron, during which Ray offers to improve Hancock's public image. Hancock goes back home to ponder the offer and returns to his house {{the next day and}} grudgingly accepts. Ray convinces the alcoholic superhero to agree to be jailed for outstanding warrants so they can show Los Angeles how much the city really needs Hancock. Hancock tries to resist the urge to break out of jail using his powers and refuses to talk during a prison group therapy but frequent visits by Ray and his family encouraged him to be patient. When crime rates rise after Hancock's incarceration, the superhero is contacted by the Chief of Police. Reluctantly donning a new costume (which has been provided by Ray), Hancock foils a bank robbery and aids a wounded officer. He prevents Red Parker (Eddie Marsan) from detonating explosive-laden vests attached to the bank hostages, by slicing off his hand (which was holding onto a [...] "deadman's switch").|$|E
500|$|Lee Bo (aka Paul Lee, 李波, age 65), was a British {{citizen and}} the husband of Sophie Choi, who is in turn {{one of the three}} {{shareholders}} of Mighty Current. Lee regularly helped out in the bookstore. Lee Bo's wife has written a column for 20 years under the pen name of Syu Fei at Ta Kung Pao – owned by the Liaison Office; Lee worked at Joint Publishing until he started work at the bookstore. Since the disappearances of four of his colleagues, he had been doing anonymous interviews with BBC and various media. After the arrest of Yiu Man-tin and the disappearance of three of his colleagues, Lee went on record to say that their motive was purely economic, and that not setting foot in the mainland was the cost to bear for being in the publishing business. Lee was last seen on 30 December 2015, while delivering books in Chai Wan to a certain unknown client. Choi, who had been expecting Lee <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> at around 7.15pm on 30 December, raised the alarm when he failed to return home. Lee had apparently received an order for about ten books from a new customer and had arranged to hand them over in person that night. He descended his building in a lift with at least eight other people at around 6pm, and witnesses saw him being pushed by a group of men into a minivan, which sped away the moment he was securely on board. Choi, Lee Bo's wife, later received a telephone call from him from a Shenzhen number. Uncharacteristically speaking in Mandarin Chinese and apparently with someone whispering over his shoulder, Lee said that {{he had to go to}} the mainland on urgent business and that he would not be back home for some time. He assured her that he was well but assisting with investigations. His wife was told to be discreet. The Immigration Department has no record of Lee having left Hong Kong, and Hong Kong does not have any extradition agreement with the PRC. The fact that his home return permit was left at home led many to fear that he may have somehow been abducted by the mainland public security bureau and renditioned to Shenzhen. His disappearance is the only known disappearance that occurred in Hong Kong territory, and thus sparked even more concern on whether the integrity of [...] "one country, two systems" [...] is being maintained.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 December, {{shortly after}} the elections, Louis-Napoleon invited Thiers to his <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner,</b> and they {{discussed}} the future government. Louis-Napoleon offered the position of President of the Council of Ministers to Thiers, but Thiers refused. He wanted to retain his independence as a deputy. He and his wife dined frequently with Louis-Napoleon in the new Presidential residence, the Élysée Palace. Under the new Constitution, new elections for the National Assembly were held on 13 May 1849. The new Assembly had 750 members, of whom 250 were republicans, of whom 180 are radicals or socialists. There were 500 monarchists, divided about equally between Legitimists, who wanted a constitutional monarchy under Bourbon king, and the Orleanists, who wanted a King from the family of Louis-Philippe. The socialists were impatient with {{the slow pace of}} change; [...] led by Ledru-Rollin, they staged an uprising in Paris, which was quickly suppressed by the army. Ledru-Rollin fled to London. In 1849 a cholera epidemic struck Paris; among the victims was Thiers' father-in-law. Thiers and his wife inherited a substantial fortune.|$|E
2500|$|In September Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte {{returned}} to Paris and {{took part in}} the legislative elections. Though he stayed in London, was a Swiss citizen he did not campaign, he was overwhelmingly elected in five departments. On September he {{returned to}} Paris and took a residence on Place Vendôme. The first appearance of Louis-Napoleon at the Assembly, his Germanic accent and awkward speaking style, persuaded Thiers and other Deputies that he was minus habens; an imbecile. This was also the view of Ledru-Rollin and the socialist deputies. The new Assembly voted to hold elections for a new President of the Republic, the first in which all Frenchmen with residences could vote. Elections were set for 10 December 1848. Thiers considered running, but told Falloux, another Deputy: [...] "If I lost it would be a grave setback for the ideas of order; [...] if I won, I would be obliged to embrace the ideas of the Republic, and, in truth, I [...] am too honest a lad to marry such a bad woman.". [...] Instead, he made the major mistake of his political career; he decided to support to Louis-Napoleon, certain that he could control him. He believed that Louis-Napoleon's term would be failure, which would open the way for Thiers to run in 1852. On the eve of the vote, Thiers hosted Louis-Napoleon at his <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> In the December 1848 elections, the moderate republican Lamartine received just 18,000 votes; the socialist Ledru-Rollin received 371,000, and the conservative General Cavaignac received 1,448,000 votes. Louis-Napoleon received 5,345,000 votes, or three-quarters of the votes cast.|$|E
