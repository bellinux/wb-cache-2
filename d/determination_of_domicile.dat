The term domicile, employed as the most important connecting factor for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> jurisdiction under the Brussels I Regulation, is the key word thereof. Domicile as such is a very interesting, although complicated, legal concept. This holds true even in the case <b>of</b> <b>domicile</b> for the purposes of Brussels I Regulation. At the European level, the tradition <b>of</b> <b>domicile,</b> being the connecting factor in most cases <b>of</b> the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> jurisdiction, was established by the Brussels Convention. Nevertheless, it did not provide for a uniform definition. Instead, it referred to the national laws of the then contracting states. By adopting, with an exception, a uniform definition of a legal person's domicile, the Brussels I Regulation has partially deviated from this practice. However, as regards the natural person's domicile, the reference to the national laws of the European Union Member States was upheld. As the understanding of this concept differs from [...] ...|$|R
