5000|$|NCLB {{includes}} {{incentives to}} reward schools showing progress {{for students with}} disabilities and other measures to fix or provide students with alternative options than schools not meeting the needs of the disabled population. [...] The law is written so that the scores of students with IEPs (<b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plans)</b> and 504 plans are counted just as other students' scores are counted. Schools have argued against having disabled populations involved in their AYP measurements because they claim that there are too many variables involved.|$|R
5000|$|IDEA's {{focus on}} various {{measures}} stems from its foundation in <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plans</b> {{for students with}} disabilities (IEP). An IEP is designed to give students with disabilities individual goals that are often not on their grade level. An IEP is intended for [...] "developing goals and objectives that correspond {{to the needs of the}} student, and ultimately choosing a placement in the least restrictive environment possible for the student." [...] Under the IEP, students could be able to legally have lowered success criteria for academic success.|$|R

50|$|Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, {{the school}} {{district}} must provide every disabled child with an <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plan</b> (IEP). The IEP is compiled {{by a team of}} school administrators and guardians, and may include a child advocate, counselors, occupational therapists, or other specialists. This team evaluates the goals for the child and determines {{what needs to be done}} in order for those goals to be met. Children with disabilities who do not have a parent or guardian advocating on their behalf are not as well served in the education system as their peers with parent or guardian advocates.|$|E

50|$|Students {{identified}} with a speech and language disability often qualify for an <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plan</b> as well as particular services. These include one-on-one services with a speech and language pathologist. Examples used in a session include reading vocabulary words, identifying particular vowel sounds and then changing the context, noting the difference. School districts in the United States often have speech and language pathologists within a special education staff to work with students. Additionally, school districts can place students with speech and language disabilities in a resource room for individualized instruction. A combination of early intervention and individualized support has shown promise increasing long-term academic achievement with students with this disability.|$|E
40|$|Developed by {{the staff}} of the Albuquerque Integration Model (Project AIM Outreach), the {{guidelines}} present a framework for organizing and conducting an integrated classroom for handicapped and nonhandicapped preschoolers. AIM is reviewed in terms of its conception of placement along a continuum of less restrictive environments. Guidelines center on four program aspects: (1) preparation (staffing, curriculum choice); (2);lacement (placement of handicapped children and selection of nonhandicapped children); (3) planning and implementation strategies (educational assessment, <b>individualized</b> <b>education</b> <b>plans,</b> classroom rules, the environment, classroom planning, schedules, play, classroom strategies); and (4) parent/professional partnerships.

40|$|Elementary, middle, {{and retired}} teachers, from the Montour School District, volunteered to {{participate}} in a research study of teachers' attitudes and beliefs pertaining to academic standards and inclusion of autistic students in the general curriculum. Fourteen participants completed two surveys and a personal interview with an independent observer present. Survey responses were analyzed and further clarified during the interviews. Teacher profiles were developed, which shared personal experiences and beliefs regarding the standards and inclusion. Although experiences and attitudes varied greatly between individuals, all of the participants recognized the need {{to participate in}} <b>individualized</b> <b>education</b> <b>planning</b> and the need for additional training regarding autism and inclusion.

40|$|In February 2013, the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) {{informed}} {{school districts}} that they were considering changing the rules related to special education class size {{and the percentage of}} students with <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plans</b> (IEPs) who can be enrolled in regular education classrooms. As of January 17, 2014, the rules related to special education staffing and the percentage of regular and special education students in classrooms are still pending approval by ISBE (Special Education Today, 2014). The purposes of this project are as follows: to advocate for the maintenance of the current rule while building in some flexibility, to ensure a least restrictive environment with the understanding that no fixed percentage is reasonable, to reflect on situations where severity of student needs demand that students are appropriately educated in an appropriate setting, to maintain current staffing practices, and to retain self-containe...|$|R
5000|$|When {{writing the}} IFSP for a child, the IFSP can (but not always) outline {{services}} that are {{not one of the}} seventeen mandated early intervention services under Part C of the IDEA. [...] For example, a parent may need counseling services to overcome debilitating depression in order to better care for the infant or toddler, and these services will be written into the family's plan. The IEP (<b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plan)</b> cannot include services to meet [...] "family goals" [...] but must focus solely on what the child needs to achieve academic success in an educational setting (whether the class or activity is academic or extra-curricular in nature).|$|E
50|$|Connellsville Area School District Administration {{reported}} that 175 or 3.18% {{of its students}} were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test, by a school psychologist. A Gifted <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plan</b> is developed for each gifted student. Other factors that indicate giftedness are also considered for eligibility.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{students}} who {{may benefit from}} special education receive services in preschools. Since {{the enactment of the}} Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Public Law 101-476 in 1975 and its amendments, PL 102-119 and PL 105-17 in 1997, the educational system has moved away from self-contained special education classrooms to inclusion, leading special education teachers to practice in a wider variety of settings. As with other stages {{in the life of a}} child with special needs, the <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plan</b> (IEP) or an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) is an important way for teachers, administrators and parents to set guidelines for a partnership to help the child succeed in preschool.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} research {{study was to explore}} the perceptions of former and current foster youth about the barriers they encountered during their K- 12 education, and to learn how they overcame these obstacles and achieved academic success. The study included in-depth interviews of 11 participants, all of whom were current or former foster youth who were enrolled or had plans to enroll in a community college or 4 -year university. The results of this study indicated that previously identified barriers to academic achievement were true for this group of participants, but that these topics or themes represented the effects of the deeper issues of anger, abuse, and disempowerment. This anger, abuse, and disempowerment touched every aspect of their lives, resulting in high mobility, <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plans</b> for emotional/behavioral issues, and difficulty transitioning from care to independence...|$|R
40|$|Since 1997 federal special {{education}} policy mandated that all classroom teachers {{take part in}} planning and implementation of <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plans</b> (IEP) for students with disabilities. This legislation has given teachers new responsibilities because it requires greater participation in the IEP process. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the usefulness of <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plans</b> (IEP). ^ Eighty seven certified Miami-Dade County Public School teachers, 60 general education teachers and 27 {{special education}} teachers were surveyed using an updated version of Rheams 2 ̆ 7 (1989) The Teacher Perceptions of the Usefulness of IEPs. Subjects completed a survey form containing a demographic cover page, 18 Likert-scale statements and 3 open ended questions. This study looked at differences in perceptions by teacher group affiliation (general and special), grade level taught (elementary and secondary), and years of experience (3 ̆c= 5 and 3 ̆e 5 years). The dependent variables were teacher preparedness; feasibility of IEP implementation; relevancy of IP to classroom instruction; and legal, professional and personal accountability with regard to the IEP. ^ Results of the Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) revealed that (a) special education teachers held a more positive perception of overall IEP usefulness than general education teachers, (b) special educators held more positive perceptions concerning issues of feasibility and preparedness, (c) elementary level teachers viewed the IEP more positively than secondary level teachers, specifically in the areas of preparedness and feasibility. ^ Findings of this study indicate that general and secondary educators have not embraced the legislation and incorporated it into their planning and instruction. These findings provide policymakers, institutions of higher education, and school administrators with insight as to how to better translate policy into classroom instructional practice. Consideration should be given to implementing (a) honest communication and shared decision making with regard to IEP directed curriculum and instruction, (b) updated pre and in-service IEP development and implementation training, and (c) opportunities for collaboration and increased plan time, especially on the secondary level. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of the research-based The Six-Minute Solution: A Reading Fluency Program on middle school students with learning disabilities. All the participants are students in special education who have active <b>Individualized</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Plans</b> (IEPs), and who receive instruction in one of two self contained special day classes (SDCs). One of the SDCs implemented The Six-Minute Solution while the other continued using its current reading program. The Six-Minute Solution incorporates repeated reading and peer-assisted learning to promote reading fluency, automatic word recognition, and comprehension. A pre-and post-implementation assessment measuring each participant's correct words per minute (CWPM) and instructional reading level (lRL) by grade were taken to determine effects of the oral reading fluency program. The results of this study, though not statistically significant, indicate that the implementation of The Six-Minute Solution in self contained classrooms {{for students with learning disabilities}} can have a positive effect on their oral reading fluency rates.
