Fantastic mists parted and met again on the lower slopes, as the varying breeze blew them. The blackening waters of the lake before our window seemed to anticipate the coming darkness.

40|$|The {{distortion}} of ground vibration measurements by different methods for mounting transducers {{in the ground}} is investigated experimentally. The following mountings are considered: (i) Tapered stake having cruciform cross-section; (ii) Wood plate attached to the <b>ground</b> with <b>threaded</b> thin rods; and (iii) Embedded aluminum box of density equivalent to that of soil. The frequency range over which acceptable measurements of ground vibrations can be made is determined {{for each of these}} mountings using frequency response tests. These tests are performed by lightly impacting the mounting with a small instrumented hammer. The impact force and the response of the mounting were recorded and analyzed on a two-channel frequency analyzer. Tests were performed at two sites: stiff clay and fine loose sand. Results show that the frequency limit for acceptable accuracy was about 200 Hz for the plate and stake mountings, whereas that for the embedded box mounting was about 120 Hz.

50|$|The larvae {{leave the}} trees to pupate, {{descending}} to the <b>ground</b> on silken <b>threads.</b> The pupae are commonly found in the leaf litter {{on the forest floor}} beneath the oak trees. After one or two weeks in the pupal stage, the adult moths emerge in late May or June. The moths are small with a wingspan of 12 mm; the wings have a characteristic bell shape. Wing color can vary considerably. Some forewings are yellow while others have dark brown or even purple markings. The adults mate and lay eggs - only one generation of moths is produced annually. Acleris semipurpurana was first described by Kearfott in 1909.|$|R
40|$|On the Swedish Island of Bjorko, {{that today}} lies in Lake Malaren, is the Viking Age (eighth-tenth century) town of Birka.

50|$|Once hatched {{from the}} eggs the larvae burrow a 1 mm {{diameter}} hole into the host fruit. A discoloration {{appears at the}} wound site. Once the larvae are inside the pulp they begin to feed. Young larvae feed on the outer portion while older specimens move further into {{the interior of the}} fruit.

Upon maturity the larvae exit the fruit and drop to the <b>ground</b> on silken <b>threads.</b> Initially, on emergence from the egg, the larvae are only 1 mm and spotted. By the time of emergence from the fruit the larva have grown to roughly 15 mm and have developed an orange and pink color.|$|R

This examination confirmed materials and patterns. I have yet to compare the quality of the weave structures between Groups I and II. The Sources There are several Arab accounts that note particulars about the trade, travel, and physical appearance of the Eastern Vikings. Ibn Khordadhbeh, in c. 885 CE, writes about Vikings sailing down the Caspian Sea and exiting at 2 ̆ 2 Djordjân. 2 ̆ 2 He explains that they would then pack their merchandise on camels and using eunuchs as interpreters, would make their way to Baghdad. Perhaps the most famous account of the Vikings comes to us from Ibn Fadlan who describes his meeting with the Rus 2 ̆ 7 at a Northern Bulgar settlement on the Volga in 922 CE. His famous description of a chieftain 2 ̆ 7 s funeral includes details about his attire and available textiles. The dead chief wore pants, slippers, ankle-length boots, a tunic, a brocaded caftan with gold buttons, and a brocaded hat trimmed in Marten fur. He was carried out to a pavilion built in his ship and placed on a Byzantine brocade-covered couch. These accounts clearly indicate that Vikings had access to foreign merchandise. Another contemporary course comes from Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, a learned Byzantine Emperor who ruled from 905 - 959 CE. He wrote De administrando imperio in c. 944 CE. In this book he includes an account of the trade route the Rus 2 ̆ 7 used to get from Novgorod, Smolensk, Teliutza, Chernigov, and Vyshegrad, to Byzantium along the Dnieper river. This information confirms the use of at least this one route from the North to the Mediterranean and includes details of ship building, portaging, and travel time...|$|R
50|$|Along with Progradungula carraiensis and Macrogradungula moonya, odd-clawed spiders {{are one of}} {{the only}} three species {{belonging}} to the family Gradungulidae that are cribellate. Unlike other members of the family which are all cursorial (active roving hunters), these three species are ambush predators that construct snares. The snares are made from silk spun from specialized spinnerets known as the cribellum, and combed with the row of bristles (the calamistrum) on their fourth leg pair. Unlike normal spinnerets, the cribellum produces extremely fine silk that can easily entangle prey without the need for glue. The snares of all three species are distinctively ladder-shaped, in contrast to the snares of other cribellate spiders from other families.The larger part of the odd-clawed spider's web is composed of a network of supporting threads built up to 2 m above the ground. Two lateral support threads extend from this network and are attached to vegetation or <b>ground</b> below. These <b>threads</b> are held more or less parallel to each other by several short bridge threads. The spider spins the catching ladder in between them, composed of a loose irregular zigzag of cribellate thread. The catching ladder and the supporting webs are usually built far from the retreat of the spider in the tree hollows, as far as 3 m away. The retreat and the webs are connected to each other by a single sturdy thread.|$|R
6000|$|The {{morning after}} our arrival {{we took a}} walk, and, {{following}} {{the sound of a}} church-bell, entered {{what appeared to be a}} park, and, passing along a road at the base of a line of crags, soon came in sight of a beautiful church. I rather imagine it to be the place of worship of the Arkwright family, whose seat is in this vicinity,--the descendants of the famous Arkwright who contributed so much towards turning England into a cotton manufactory. We did not enter the church, but passed beyond it, and over a bridge, and along a road that ascended among the hills and finally brought us out by a circuit to the other end of Matlock village, after a walk of three or four miles. In the afternoon we took a boat across the Derwent,--a passage which half a dozen strokes of the oars accomplished, --and reached a very pleasant seclusion called [...] "The Lovers' Walk." [...] A ferriage of twopence pays for the transit across the river, and gives the freedom of these <b>grounds,</b> which are <b>threaded</b> with paths that meander and zigzag to the top of the precipitous ridge, amid trees and shrubbery, and the occasional ease of rustic seats. It is a sweet walk for lovers, and was so for us; although J-----, with his scramblings and disappearances, and shouts from above, and headlong scamperings down the precipitous paths, occasionally frightened his mother. After gaining the heights, the path skirts along the precipice, allowing us to see down into the village street, and, nearer, the Derwent winding through the valley so close beneath us that we might have flung a stone into it. These crags would be very rude and harsh if left to themselves, but they are quite softened and made sweet and tender by the great deal of foliage that clothes their sides, and creeps and clambers over them, only letting a stern face of rock be seen here and there, and with a smile rather than a frown.|$|R
50|$|The adult moths are {{comparatively}} small, with a wingspan of 3-4 cm, {{and have}} a characteristic resting posture that conceals the black and orange-yellow hindwings under the greyish-brown forewings. Males and females emerge more or less simultaneously and mating takes place {{within a couple of}} days. Eggs are laid on tender new leaves, placed singly near the veins, and usually on the undersurface. They are oval, flat, and white and measure about 1 mm in length. About 500 eggs are laid per female with a recorded maximum of 1000. Larvae hatch in about two days. There are five larval instars. The first and second instars mainly feed on the leaf surface. Starting with the third instar, the larva cuts out a leaf flap, usually {{at the edge of the}} leaf, folds it over, fastens it with silk, and feeds from within. The entire leaf, excluding the major veins of tender leaves, is eaten, but more veins are left in older leaves. Under the optimal conditions, the larval period lasts 10-12 days. The full-grown larva measures about 3.5-4.5 cm, and there is considerable colour variation in the fourth and fifth instars; the body may be either wholly black or dark greyish to black, with longitudinal coloured bands may include a dorsal orange or ocherous band and lateral white lines. A recent study revealed the existence of density-dependent colour polyphenism and resistance build-up against invading baculovirus by H. puera larvae. The mature larvae descend to the <b>ground</b> on silken <b>threads</b> and pupate under a thin layer of leaf litter or soil, within loosely built cocoons made of dry or decayed leaves, or soil particles held together with silk. Pupation may some times occur within green leaves of other plants in the under growth, folded or juxtaposed with silk. On Avicennia plants the caterpillars pupate inside the cases made out of the host plant leaves itself. It is probably an adaptive trait acquired by the species for surviving in the hostile mangrove environment, since the pupation is not possible in the muddy and inundated soils of mangroves. The average pupal period lasts six to eight days under optimal conditions. There is no evidence of hibernation or aestivation of pupa.|$|R
40|$|The term sashiko {{refers to}} the {{stitching}} {{of one or more}} layers of cloth with a simple running stitch and can also apply to the completed fabric. Sashiko is the noun of the verb sasu, meaning to pierce. Sashiko probably was initially a way to recycle or extend the life of cloth. Among the textiles in the Shoso-in, the Imperial Repository built circa 752 to preserve thousands of objects of art and other belongings of the Emperor Shomu, is an 8 th Century 2 ̆ 2 distant mountain 2 ̆ 2 pattern monk 2 ̆ 7 s robe covered with a purple silk running stitch. This running stitch is superfluous to the actual structure of the robe. This is a development of an earlier ritual robe, evolved {{to the point where the}} stitches have lost their original function to strengthen and attach the patches of cloth, but retained to give the appearance of the original 2 ̆ 2 robe of rags. 2 ̆ 2 This is the oldest example of sashiko extant in Japan. There is a gap in recorded history from this point until the 17 th Century when other sashiko are mentioned. Sashiko was done throughout Japan, primarily by women. It is not known to have been done commercially with the possible exception of some of the firemen clothing. Often it was done by and for people who were too poor to buy new cloth. Sashiko developed from necessity rather than as a luxury, so the art of sashiko wasn 2 ̆ 7 t highly competitive, with some exceptions. That is, the product was not regarded as a statement of fashion. Originally a practical technique for making cloth thicker, warmer, and more durable, sashiko can also be purely decorative. Clothing that has been over stitched is not only very strong, but warm. Therefore, it was reasonable to reinforce the cloth by stitching before the cloth wore out. Presently it is done on new cloth, for garments and textiles to be sold in folk craft shops. Typically, sashiko stitching is done with white cotton thread on an indigo-dyed fabric. Most sashiko uses one strand of thread through the needle, doubled so that both strands account for the stitch although it can be done with a single strand. The length of the stitch varies with the number of layers being stitched together. Keeping the stitches even in length, as well as straight, requires skill and practise. There are approximately five to ten stitches per inch (five to ten stitches per 2. 5 cm.) with certain districts noted for having particularly fine stitching. Sashiko was done on balanced weave textiles, that is the warp and weft are the same thickness and weight of <b>thread.</b> Although the <b>ground</b> fabric <b>threads</b> were not usually counted, the stitches were. Within a pattern, per line, the same number and length of stitch is held constant and is consistent (from point A to B are always x number of stitches and the length of each stitch is held constant). Many patterns consist of straight lines that intersect at right angles, so counting the stitches made the patterns quite exact. At the point of intersection either the stitching threads cross creating a pattern, or the absence of the threads create a pattern such as a star or the center of a flower. Sashiko can be either a single repeating pattern or a combination of several patterns on one fabric...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} section, taste, along with {{parallel}} phenomena linked {{to form and}} symbolism in general, is discussed {{in relation to the}} fundamental device of the reason-feeling dichotomy. The dichotomy's internal possibilities of significance and basic ways in which these have at times affected aesthetics are traced. Examples are used which range from ancient Greek philosophy, via the 18 th century, to Wittgenstein. The latter's gradual evolution from a position of unyielding separation of rational, valid knowledge from fantasy and the 'unspeakable', towards an increasingly unified view of language and conceptualization as phenomena rooted in wide social contexts, serves as the point leading into, as well as the basic-idea underlying, the second section. Accordingly, issues relevant to a 'game' notion of taste are brought forth, such as the continuity (as opposed to any clearcut and schematical division) of experience and of the processes of perception and conception; the idea of utility, convention as an indispensable means of obtaining knowability, conmunicability, and persistence of our mental constructions, either scientific, or aesthetic, or religious, etc.; prejudice, appearing as an ineluctable factor underlying our arguments; or, the phenomenon of aesthetic polarities, being the result of fundamental traits (or 'rules') of the 'game'. Juxtaposed to these issues is the theme of the autonomy of art and taste, chiefly as it was propounded by Kant. Genuine autonomy is disputed in the ends of the second and in the beginnings of the third section and it is by way of this disputation that the game notion is resumed. This time, in a more extended sense, i. e. as centering upon the search for order in the conceptions of nature. The implication of this for a commentary on the phenomenon of taste is that, whatever the techniques appropriated and the results sought, what ever the specific biases of art, form-giving, and form-appreciating at different times, a possibility of unification may be presented. That possibility results from considering the general ground of perception and conceptualization, i. e. the tendency to effect an ordering of experience whatsoever. However, by unification, nothing of the sort of a smoothly functioning though artificial and forced generalization is meant. On the contrary, what is implied is an attempt to visualize, in the sphere of formal systems, what Michel Foucault calls a "discursive unity. " That is, a discourse unified not by virtue of any consistency or continuity 'reigning over it, but rather by virtue of clashes, contradictions, discontinuities, which may nevertheless have a common focus. In terms of form, conceptions of orderable nature are taken to formulate such a common locus of diverse formal systems, and the hypothesis is brought forth of a possibility of "discursive" unification of formal and aesthetic in compatibilities, on the <b>grounds</b> of subtle <b>threads</b> that link them with integral epistemologies or world-views. by Panos Kokkoris.
