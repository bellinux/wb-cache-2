5000|$|Fat is a {{nutrient}} {{that provides}} more energy per gram {{than all other}} nutrients. Fat provides 9.4kcal/g of gross energy (GE) compared to protein and carbohydrate which only provide 5.56 and 4.15 kcal/g respectively. Due to this greater energy concentration and the higher energy demand of puppies, the higher fat content of canine development diets helps reach these increased energy requirements while also providing the essential fatty acids necessary for the growing dog. Omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids are {{an important component of}} puppy diets. Multiple studies suggest brain and retinal function are dependent on the level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids acquired during in utero development and postnatal life. DHA is the main n-3 fatty acid and can be obtained as DHA itself from dietary sources such as fish and fish oils, or as the DHA precursor linolenic acid. With a high DHA intake, plasma lipid <b>DHA</b> <b>content</b> increases, aiding neurological development, as demonstrated by increases in memory and learning ability. Other benefits of n-3 and DHA include promotion of neurogenesis, increased neuron size and phospholipid synthesis, as well as protection against cell death and peroxidative brain damage by damaging free radicals in the rodent model and presumably across the mammalian kingdom. A deficit of dietary n-3 fatty acids leads to a reduction in brain <b>DHA</b> <b>content</b> by 50-80%, leading to cognitive deficits and increased n-6 fatty acid level which increases inflammation. Adequate intake and recommended allowance levels of 85g/kg (DM) of total fat (8.5%), and 0.5g/kg (DM) of omega 3 fatty acids (EPA+DHA) are laid out by the NRC. Both of these values are also laid out as recommendations by AAFCO. However, according to a study on the effects of supplementing DHA in puppy diets, diets containing 1.4% n-3 fatty acids, or 0.19% DHA resulted in optimal neurological function.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> {{in breast}} milk varied upon {{maternal}} dietary intakes.

40|$|Current {{recommendations}} for arachidonic (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids in infant formulae {{are based on}} milk of Western mothers. Validity may be questioned {{in view of the}} profound dietary changes in the past 100 years, as opposed to our slowly adapting genome. Hominin evolution occurred in the proximity of East-African freshwater lakes and rivers and early homo sapiens had higher intakes of AA and DHA from a predominantly lacustrine-based diet. In search of milk AA and <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> of our African ancestors, we investigated the milk of 29 lactating women living in Doromoni near lake Kitangiri (Tanzania). They consumed sunflower oil-fried local fish as only animal lipid sources, maize and local vegetables. AA and <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> of Doromoni milk may be close to that of early homo sapiens, because of the similarity of their life-long consumption of East-African lacustrine-based foods. Human milk fatty acid relationships from our historical worldwide database and the literature revealed that disparities between the Doromoni diet and the presumed ancient diet (i. e. higher carbohydrate and linoleic acid intakes) are unlikely to affect milk AA and <b>DHA</b> <b>contents.</b> Doromoni milk had high contents of AA (median 0. 70 mol%), DHA (0. 75) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 0. 17), and low AA/DHA ratios (median 0. 91; 0. 55 - 2. 61). This tracks down to consumption of fish with high AA and <b>DHA</b> <b>contents,</b> and AA/EPA ratios. We conclude that the milk AA, <b>DHA</b> and EPA <b>contents</b> of Doromoni women might provide us with clues to optimize infant formulae and perhaps the milk of Western women...|$|R
40|$|An {{enrichment}} {{experiment was}} performed to evaluate the changes in lipid and essential fatty acid contents of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis fed with freeze-dried cells of tropical thraustochytrid Schizochytrium mangrovei (Isolate IAo- 1). Rotifers starved for 24 h were fed with S. mangrovei cells at 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 mg L âˆ’ 1. Enrichment was carried out at two periods (Short-term = 5 h; Long-term = 10 h) to determine the optimum time needed for the maximum enrichment of the rotifers. There was an overall {{significant increase in the}} total lipid, arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (<b>DHA)</b> <b>contents</b> of rotifers after feeding with freeze-dried S. mangrovei indicating the successful uptake of these nutrients in the rotifer's biochemical composition. On the other hand, docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) did not change significantly in enriched rotifers. Results of the present study indicate that both factors, feeding concentrations and enrichment periods, significantly affected the lipid, AA and <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> of rotifers. Uptakes of lipid, AA and DHA significantly increased with increasing feeding concentrations except for those fed the highest feeding concentration of 700 mg L âˆ’ 1 for 10 h. Moreover, lipid and AA contents of enriched rotifers were significantly higher during the short-term enrichment period while <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> were significantly higher during the long-term enrichment period. Therefore, it is concluded that the feeding concentration of 700 mg L âˆ’ 1 at an enrichment period of 5 h is optimum in the AA and DHA enrichment of rotifers. The strategic scheme of combining the proper amount of enrichment product and the duration of enrichment in boosting the <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> of rotifers will effectively ensure a reliable production of nutritionally superior rotifers at a minimal cost. This will ultimately contribute to the success of rearing marine fish larvae in the hatchery. The authors thank Dr. Josephine Nocillado for her critical review of the manuscript.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fish, {{especially}} fatty fish, are {{the main}} contributor to eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) intake. EPA and DHA concentrations in red blood cells (RBC) has been proposed as a cardiovascular risk factor, with 8 % associated with the lowest and greatest protection, respectively.

We aimed to study the shape of this relationship among high seafood consumers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seafood consumption records and blood were collected from 384 French heavy seafood consumers and EPA and DHA were measured in RBC. A multivariate linear regression was performed using restricted cubic splines to consider potential non-linear associations. Thirty-six percent of subjects had an RBC EPA + <b>DHA</b> <b>content</b> lower than 4 % and only 5 % exceeded 8 %.

40|$|Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey {{with high}} methylglyoxal content, {{commonly}} expressed as unique manuka factor (UMF®) content, has strong antibacterial and anti-fungal properties. Consequently, {{there is a}} strong demand for high UMF manuka honey in the health food industry both in New Zealand and overseas. Currently manuka honey is produced from natural stands of manuka, but UMF content varies among regions. The active ingredient methylglyoxal is produced by natural chemical transformation of dihydroxyacetone (DHA) present in the nectar. Production of high UMF honey is insufficient to meet market demand; this is due to variation in UMF amongst stands causing unpredictability in quality as well as inaccessibility of many manuka stands. The feasibility of increasing production by establishing manuka plantations using plants known to produce nectar with high <b>DHA</b> <b>content</b> is being investigated. This study compared establishment, growth and nectar <b>DHA</b> <b>content</b> of four manuka provenances; two from Northland, and one each from Waikato and Wairarapa in a replicated, randomised complete block trial (Site A). In addition a manuka plantation of a single provenance was monitored for nectar <b>DHA</b> <b>content</b> (Site B). Both sites are in the Whanganui area. Survival of seedlings in the Site A trial at 12 months was high in all provenances.

Omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet help to prevent cardiovascular disease. We used life cycle assessment to analyse the potential of two strategies to improve the nutritional and environmental characteristics of French diets: 1) modifying diets by changing the quantities and proportions of foods and 2) increasing the omega- 3 contents in diets by replacing mainly animal foods with equivalent animal foods having higher omega- 3 contents. We also investigated other possibilities for reducing environmental impacts. Our results showed that a diet compliant with nutritional recommendations for macronutrients had fewer environmental impacts than the current average French diet. Moving from an omnivorous to a vegetarian diet further reduced environmental impacts.

So far, no comparative analysis between temperate and polar algal species had been carried out. In addition, many earlier studies reporting on EPA and DHA variability in polar species focused on relative variability, rather than on absolute cellular production rates. To be able to measure true interspecific differences, taking into account differences in total fatty acid content relative to algal biomass, the absolute amounts of EPA and DHA were determined, using biovolume as biomass unit.|$|E

Maximum growth and nitrate uptake exhibit an optimum concentration and threshold tolerance to bicarbonate addition (~ 9 mM) above which both parameters decreased.

Infants received preterm formula without long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP; n = 81), with LCP (n = 29) or maternal milk (n = 33). RBC AA contents on day 10 were correlated (P < 0. 05) with birth weight in breast-fed infants and all formula-fed infants, with on day 10 a standard deviation score (SDS) for weight, length and occipito-frontal circumference in all formula-fed infants, and with on day 10 an SDS for length in breast-fed infants. Brain weight was related to RBC DHA and CE <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> on both day 10 and day 42 in formula-fed infants. Of the variances of brain growth parameters on day 42, 21 - 34 % were explained by DHA status on day 42 and protein intake from days 10 - 42. Conclusion. We conclude that parameters of early neonatal AA status are related to intra-uterine rather than to post-natal growth.

Ultimately, highest lipid and DHA productivity was attained with NaNO 3 supplementation. In another report, highest biomass productivity was obtained in S. rubescens when treated with urea and NaNO 3 mixture while highest lipid productivity was gained with ammonium treatment (Lin and Lin 2011). Similarly, T. pseudonana (Griffiths and Harrison 2009), N. oleoabundans (Li et al. 2008), S. costatum (Rodolfi et al. 2008) and S. dimorphous (Benider et al. 2001) also significantly respond to different nitrogen sources. In another report, the highest biomass (5.03  g/L), TFA (24.9 % DCW) and <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> (82.8  mg/g) of Crypthecodinium sp. SUN were achieved at 96  h of cultivation under light conditions (Sun et al. 2017). Under sesamol supplementation, highest biomass (3.9  g/L), TFA (21 % DCW), DHA (41.3 % TFA) and DHA productivity (58  mg/L day) was attained in C. cohnii ATCC 30556 (Liu et al. 2015). Pleissner and Eriksen (2012) reported highest biomass (2.1  g/L), TFA (111  mg/g) and <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> (36.2 % TFA) in C. cohnii CCMP 316 when cultured on acetic acid as major carbon source. In the present study highest biomass (23.7  g/L), TFA (26.9 % DCW), DHA (0.99  g/L) and DHA productivity (236  mg/L day) was attained in C. cohnii ATCC 30555 under NaNO 3 supplementation. These results indicated {{that there is still}} much room to enhance lipid (% DCW) and <b>DHA</b> (% TFA) <b>content</b> in C. cohnii ATCC 30555.|$|R

After enrichment nauplii were starved for 72 h at three different temperatures (6. 1, 12. 2 and 22 °C). Following enrichment the <b>DHA</b> <b>content</b> and DHA/EPA ratio reached a maximum 41. 2 and 42. 8 mg g - 1 dry weight and 1. 88 and 2. 09 in A. franciscana and A. sinica, respectively.

40|$|Homo sapiens {{has evolved}} {{on a diet}} rich in alpha-linolenic acid and long chain {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids (LCP). We have, however, gradually changed our diet from about 10, 000 years ago and accelerated this change from about 100 to 200 years ago. The many dietary changes, including lower intake of omega 3 -fatty acids, are related to 'typically Western'. diseases. After a brief introduction in essential fatty acids (EFA), LCP and their functions, this contribution discusses our present low status of notably LCP omega 3 {{in the context of}} our rapidly changing diet within an evolutionary short time frame. It then focuses on the consequences in pregnancy, lactation and neonatal nutrition, as illustrated by some recent data from our group. We discuss the concept of a 'relative' EFA/LCP deficiency in the fetus as the outcome of high transplacental glucose flux. This flux may in the fetus augment de novo synthesis of fatty acids, which not only dilutes transplacentally transported EFA/LCP, but also causes competition of de novo, synthesized oleic acid with linoleic acid for delta- 6 desaturation. Such conditions were encountered by us in mothers with high body mass indices, diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia. The unifying factor might be compromised glucose homeostasis. In search of the milk arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (<b>DHA)</b> <b>contents</b> of our African ancestors, we investigated women in Tanzania with high intakes of freshwater fish as only animal lipid source. These women had milk AA and <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> that were well above present recommendations for infant formulae. Both studies stimulate rethinking of 'optimal homeostasis'. Subtle signs of dysbalanced maternal glucose homeostasis may be important and observations from current Western societies may not provide us with an adequate basis for dietary recommendations.

40|$|The use of {{specific}} microalgae {{as sources of}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), for incorporation in either aquaculture or human diets, has been receiving increasing interest. The fatty acid profile of intracellular fats in a given species can, within certain limits, be modulated via manipulation of the culture growth conditions, namely nutrient availability. In attempts to shed further light {{on the effects of}} chemical parameters upon microalgal metabolism, correlations between the components of a medium and the resulting biomass yield, as well as the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (<b>DHA)</b> <b>contents</b> are presented, using Pavlova lutheri as model system. Although several studies of individual nutrients have been published previously, the effects of variation of all medium components upon fatty acid production are systematically presented here, apparently for the first time. The optimum formulation to optimise EPA and <b>DHA</b> <b>contents</b> should consider the buffering agent, since some of them are toxic to the cells; P. lutheri was able to use several nitrogen sources, yielding equivalent amounts of EPA and DHA; synthesis of EPA was induced in culture media under low salinity, whereas a trend could be noticed between decreasing yields of EPA and increasing concentrations of N, at 0. 15 g L− 1 of P. Regarding the micronutrient composition, a culture medium lacking sulphur was unable to sustain cellular growth, whereas cultures deprived of either calcium, iron or manganese revealed a statistically significant decrease in cellular yields relative to those possessing such minerals; conversely, those cultures without boron produced higher cell numbers than those containing this element. Media deprived of boron, molybdenum or copper led to increases of the relative amounts of both EPA and DHA, whereas calcium deficiency decreased the levels of those PUFA...|$|R

40|$|Linseed, {{fish and}} microalgae are {{important}} sources of ù 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the omega 3 fatty acid supplied by linseed is the alfa-linolenic acid (LNA; C 18 : 3 n 3), which is poorly converted to the longer chain n 3 fatty acids by humans and poultry. Conversely, fish and microalgae supply directly long chain n 3 PUFAs, particularly the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C 20 : 5 n 3) and the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C 22 : 6 n 3).

40|$|Marine fish larvae have a {{requirement}} for large quantities of n − 3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22 : 6 n − 3), and dietary deficiencies of these induce a range of pathologies in fish including behavioural abnormalities. Therefore, {{there is a growing}} demand for natural lipids highly enriched in DHA as nutritional supplements during larval development. In the present study, DHA-rich products were obtained from fish neural tissues by a procedure involving ensiling in organic acids followed by neutralisation, drying, milling and sieving to produce the final paniculate, crumbed products. Lipid content varied in the neural tissue silages from 5. 5 % to 46. 5 % but all lipid contained high percentages of DHA and high DHA:EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid; 20 : 5 n − 3) ratios ranging from 3. 5 to 5. 4. Tuna eye silage was a high lipid, high triacylglycerol (90. 6 % of total lipid) product and was particularly effective in increasing <b>DHA</b> <b>content,</b> outperforming a commercial product, in rotifer (Brachionus plicatilis) enrichment. Cod brain/eye silage had an intermediate content (18. 2 %) of lipid, which contained almost 50 % as phospholipid, and proved as effective as a commercial enricher in increasing <b>DHA</b> <b>content</b> in Artemia nauplii. Moreover, Artemia nauplii, enriched with the cod brain/eye silage were more effective than nauplii enriched with a commercial enricher in increasing the <b>DHA</b> <b>content</b> of larval turbot brain.
