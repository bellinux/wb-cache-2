40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the extent of specialized training and competence in family-based <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related counseling among family counselors, and identify variables that predict counselor competence. A comprehensive measure of specialized competence was created. Variables measured and investigated in relation to competence included demographic information, personal <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related experience, professional <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related training and experience. <b>and</b> personal <b>death</b> competency. All survey items and instruments were implemented into an on-line survey. A sample of 147 family counselors participated in this study. Descriptive results indicated that the majority of participants reported moderate to high levels of perceived family <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related counseling competence <b>and</b> personal <b>death</b> competency. However, the majority of participants rated their specialized <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related training within their counselor preparation program as less than adequate. Factor analysis revealed four factors of family-death and grief-related counseling knowledge and skills-based competence: (1) advanced family grief counseling skills, (2) basic grief counseling skills, (3) developmental aspects of grief counseling, and (4) the ability to utilize resources in grief counseling. Additionally, factor analysis supported the previously hypothesized two subscales of Bugen's (1980 - 1981) Coping with Death Scale. which measured personal death competency, with some modifications. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated the following significant results consistent with hypotheses: (a) personal <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related loss positively impacted family <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related counseling personal competencies. (b) professional <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related training and experience positively impacted family <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief related counseling knowledge and skills-based competencies, (c) perceived adequacy of <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related training positively impacted personal death competency, (d) family <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related personal competencies positively impacted personal <b>death</b> competency, <b>and</b> (e) personal <b>death</b> competency positively impacted family <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related counseling knowledge and skills. Study results suggest that family counselors who have participated in adequate specialized <b>death</b> <b>and</b> grief-related training experiences are more likely to cope well with personal issues related to <b>death</b> <b>and</b> dying, and have stronger knowledge and skills in counseling grieving families. Implications for further counseling research, training, and practice to continually improve counseling services offered to grieving clients are provided...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates a {{relationship}} between the nineteenth-century attitude toward <b>death</b> <b>and</b> its ethico-political implications through reading a cultural event and literary works. The nineteenth-century attitude toward death, “beautiful death” named by Philippe Aries, has two main characteristics, beautification of dead bodies <b>and</b> <b>death</b> itself, <b>and</b> the elimination of death in the living world. In the political area, beautification of death was sometimes appropriated to unify the individuals as part of a nation by the celebration of the deaths of national figures. As an illusionary perception of <b>death</b> <b>and</b> the dead bodies by the living, beautification of <b>death</b> <b>and</b> the dead bodies accompanies neglecting the unknowable characteristics of <b>death</b> <b>and</b> concealing the decomposition of the dead bodies. Such a tendency, in terms of ethics, reflects the desire for eliminating the alterity of the Other and extending the Sameness to the Other. Even if chapters two and three focus on <b>death</b> <b>and</b> politics, and chapters four <b>and</b> five on <b>death</b> <b>and</b> ethics, this study attempts to show the close relatedness of ethics and politics. ...|$|R
