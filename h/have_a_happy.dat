5|$|One day, {{the entire}} family along with Hasini attends a {{marriage}} ceremony. A cheerful Hasini cheers up the ceremony with her playful nature. Coincidentally, Kanaka Rao {{who happens to be}} around, recognizes Siddhu as the drunken young man whom he encountered on an earlier occasion. Hasini realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their face, Siddhu admonishes Hasini for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Hasini moves out of the house saying that she does not find Siddhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Siddhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Aravind on Siddhu's choices and wants. In the process, Siddhu opens up his heart, leaving Aravind to repent on his over-protectiveness. Siddhu requests Subbulakshmi and her parents to call off the marriage. While they relent, Aravind manages to convince Kanaka Rao about Siddhu and Hasini's love. When Kanaka Rao disagrees to get the two lovers married, Aravid suggests letting Siddhu stay with them for a week and the story returns to the pre-credits scene. The viewers are left to assume that the two lovers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> union.|$|E
25|$|Not much {{is known}} about Alice's {{personal}} life outside of {{the walls of the}} University, partially because her personal endeavors were so entrenched in the care and keeping of her pupils. She was described as being tall with strong features, yet despite this she would never marry. Her parents in comparison appeared to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> courtship filled with love letters. Her younger sister, Anna would also come to marry. Nevertheless, Alice was the godmother to many of her friends' children and took great interest in her pupils, turning the professional into the personal.|$|E
25|$|Most {{children}} who have their clefts repaired early enough are able to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> youth and social life. Having a cleft palate/lip does not inevitably lead to a psychosocial problem. However, adolescents with cleft palate/lip are at an elevated risk for developing psychosocial problems especially those relating to self-concept, peer relationships and appearance. Adolescents may face psychosocial challenges but can find professional help if problems arise. A cleft palate/lip may impact an individual’s self-esteem, social skills and behavior. There is research dedicated to the psychosocial development of individuals with cleft palate.

25|$|The plays The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare both {{influenced}} Breaking Dawn.

His friend, production designer Richard Sylbert, took the book's manuscript to producer Robert Evans. The film rights to the novel had been optioned by Paramount Pictures, with Evans slated to produce the film, John Frankenheimer hired to direct and Hjortsberg acting as screenwriter. Frankenheimer was later replaced by Dick Richards, and Dustin Hoffman was [...] considered for the lead role. After Paramount's option expired, Hjortsberg discussed the project with Robert Redford and wrote two drafts. Hjortsberg felt that no film studio was willing to produce his script.

He {{eventually}} lost his kick return duties to Danieal Manning, but began receiving more playing time as a wide receiver. Between Week 12 and 15, Hester caught 17 passes for 250 yards and one touchdown. David Haugh of the Chicago Tribune regarded Hester as the team's [...] "biggest threat in the passing game." [...] He concluded the season by catching 51 passes for a team high 665 yards. Unlike his previous two seasons in the NFL, Hester did not record a single touchdown return and only averaged 6.2 yards per punt return. Lovie Smith commented on Hester {{at the end of}} the season by saying, [...] "I know his returns dropped off a little bit this year, but his plate was full there for a while.

500|$|Frederick William {{was born}} in the New Palace at Potsdam in Prussia on 18 October 1831. He was a scion of the House of Hohenzollern, rulers of Prussia, then the most {{powerful}} of the German states. Frederick's father, Prince William, was a younger brother of King Frederick William IV and, having been raised in the military traditions of the Hohenzollerns, developed into a strict disciplinarian. William fell in love with his cousin Elisa Radziwill, a princess of the Polish nobility, but his parents felt Elisa's rank was not suitable for the bride of a Prussian prince and forced a more suitable match. The woman selected to be his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar, had been raised in the more intellectual and artistic atmosphere of Weimar, which gave its citizens greater participation in politics and limited the powers of its rulers through a constitution; Augusta was well-known across Europe for her liberal views. Because of their differences, the couple did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> marriage and, as a result, Frederick grew up in a troubled household, which left him with memories of a lonely childhood. He had one sister, Louise (later Grand Duchess of Baden), who was eight years his junior and very close to him. Frederick also had a very good relationship with his uncle, King Frederick William IV, who has been called [...] "the romantic on the throne".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} met with great praise from critics.

[...] Leah Collins of the Dose.ca lamented the video for its typical fairytale element even though the plot ended with a blissful marriage. She {{concluded}} her review by writing, [...] "Swift happens to include dirty diapers and recreating scenes from The Notebook." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV described the video as [...] "a coming-of-age story" [...] where Swift is depicted to endure [...] "many adult life cycle events and major milestones." [...] In a different perspective, James Montgomery of MTV compared the music video with Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream," [...] writing that although both videos are [...] "essentially about the same thing: the fantasies of young, thoroughly modern women," [...] the fantasies are [...] "about as different as the women presenting them." [...] The Improper reviewer also compared the music video with Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] and noticed that the two music videos presented two contrasting end points, writing [...] "for Swift, it’s a marriage, a home and babies. For Perry, it's independence and the ability to define your own life." [...] To date, the video has over 243 million views on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|The {{focus of}} the episode is Lady Gaga's song [...] "Born This Way", which she {{approved}} for use in Glee before the song premiered. This will be the second episode to highlight Gaga's music, the first one being season one's [...] "Theatricality". According to Monteith, the focus of [...] "Born This Way" [...] is the characters [...] "embracing the things about selves that [...] don't like and tailoring [...] performances around that." [...] It features homophobic Dave Karofsky starting {{to come to terms}} with his homosexuality. The plot arc, which began in the season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed", is intended by series creator Ryan Murphy to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending. He explained that, while someone like Karofsky could turn to drugs or alcohol or commit suicide, Glee is [...] "by nature optimistic", so he plans to conclude the storyline positively. For fellow closeted character Santana, [...] "Born This Way" [...] set up the final three episodes of the season, which will increase focus on her love for her best friend Brittany. The episode additionally marked the first appearance of guest star Dr. Shane, [...] "a very smart, cool and kind psychiatrist" [...] who may become a recurring character. Other characters seen in [...] "Born This Way" [...] include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans and Lauren Zizes, Kurt's boyfriend Blaine Anderson, school bully Azimio (James Earl), Principal Figgins, and Karofsky's father, Paul (Daniel Roebuck).|$|E

500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful.

500|$|As their {{relationship}} progresses, Audrey invites Lewis {{to move in}} with her. Nicholls told Suzanne Byrne of RTÉ Ten that Lewis appears to brush Audrey off, before eventually agreeing to move in. Nicholls said, [...] "And then in his usual charming style he brings her breakfast in bed on her birthday, which she adores him for. He's clever like that, he knows how to bring the balance back to the relationship." [...] In May 2010, the Daily Mirror's Brian Roberts reported that a new plot for Audrey and Lewis could see them leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Greece. The couple go on holiday to a Greek island and Audrey is taken with Lewis' idea of opening a hotel and living a glamorous life out there. Roberts likened the plot development to that of the 1989 film, Shirley Valentine. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury noted that Lewis seemed uncomfortable with the plan; Nicholls said that Audrey is unaware of his doubts. Laws also compared the plot to a similar one in another ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, involving Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) and Charlie Haynes (George Costigan), and predicted that both storylines would end in heartache. Nicholls wanted Audrey and Lewis to leave together and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending, and wanted to see a spin-off series focusing on the pair and their new life in Greece. Olivia Buxton from the Daily Mirror questioned whether Lewis would go through with the plan; she wrote that two endings to his story arc had been filmed, one of which showed him making a dramatic exit.|$|E

Sam (Chord Overstreet) offers to take Rory home with him to show him a true American Christmas. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) announces that New Directions has been asked to create a holiday special for the local PBS station, with Artie (Kevin McHale) as director. The station manager agrees to Artie's concept—a black-and-white homage to both Star Wars Holiday Special and the [...] "Judy Garland Christmas Special", to feature hosts Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss) welcoming their friends for suave banter and happy, cheerful songs.

500|$|Davies {{discussed}} the episode's climax {{in detail in}} the show's companion series Doctor Who Confidential. The climax—a Dalek ray shooting the Doctor and his consequent regeneration—was written by Davies as a pastiche of romance fiction. He compared the reunion between Rose and the Doctor to [...] "the biggest romance [...] has ever seen" [...] and joked that seminal films such as Gone with the Wind should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead, and intensified the scene's emotional impact through Piper's cameos throughout the fourth series. Tennant described the Doctor's wounding as a [...] "moment of high emotion" [...] and lamented that [...] " [...] can't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> moment, especially with a cliffhanger needing to be written". The episode ended during the regeneration because Davies wanted to create the [...] "biggest, most exciting cliffhanger in Doctor Who", and to differentiate the scene from previous regenerations, which were always completed {{at the end of}} serials. He considered its resolution—the regeneration process being halted by the Doctor, who siphoned the excess energy into his severed hand after his injuries were healed—legitimate because the hand was an important plot device in [...] "Journey's End"'s climax. The production team realised the halted regeneration and creation of a new Doctor would create a debate amongst fans about whether one of the Doctor's twelve regenerations were used up. The production team originally declined to comment to avoid the debate; Davies later said that he believed that because the process wasn't completed, the Doctor did not use one of his regenerations. However, the 2013 Christmas special The Time of the Doctor, which was the last regular story for the Eleventh Doctor, confirmed that this regeneration did indeed count, as the Tenth Doctor was described as having [...] "vanity issues at the time".|$|E
500|$|Although the {{characters}} were separated on screen, they had gained a fan {{base on the}} Internet that believed Martha should be with Jack and wanted the pair to reunite. Gordon herself backed the pairing, stating that she believed they should be together. She said: [...] "I actually love Jack and Martha together, I'm a sucker for romance so, I want {{want them to be}} together [...] I want them to continue on, [...] the timing is not right, they are not mature enough. Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things {{getting in the way of}} them getting back together all the time." [...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique". They said [...] "Bring {{the characters}} together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility that they could get back together. It has worked for Days of Our Lives John Black and Marlena Evans".|$|E
500|$|Goddard {{compared}} the romance between Lily and Cane to Lady Chatterley's Lover since both characters grew and {{learned from the}} relationship. Cane developed an attraction to Heather Stevens (portrayed by Vail Bloom) while with Lily; Goddard noted it would [...] "come down to what Cane needs" [...] when choosing between the two women. The storylines written for the lovers included a controversy with the characters' age gap, a miscarriage, and a love rectangle with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). Within the love rectangle story, Chloe tricks Cane into thinking they conceived a child together. To make the storyline work, the writers scripted Cane as less intelligent, a strategy they used previously during his storyline with Amber. To keep the character from looking bad, Goddard said he made acting choices to justify Cane's actions. Despite the lessening of the character's intelligence, Goddard said he liked the story because of the originality of the plot. Love triangles and questioned paternity happen regularly in soap operas, but he felt that former head writer Maria Arena Bell managed to make those conventions fresh and new. Khalil stated that she [...] "loved" [...] the storyline, also saying she loved the actors involved in it. Khalil said she thought it [...] "was a possibility" [...] for Lily and Cane to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending, and that Lily [...] "can see the hope, and they can adapt and love {{each other in a}} more mature and honest way". Cane married Lily in 2009, and the following year, Global BC called Lily the love of Cane's life. In 2011, Lily divorced Cane after he continued to lie to her about his faked death. However, she eventually discovered Cane was trying to protect her, and they were remarried. Goddard commented that their relationship [...] "had come full circle" [...] and [...] "was being done well". Of Cane and Lily's second wedding, Goddard stated that Cane and Lily have [...] "certainly had a lot of ups and downs", but he thought through all of that their fans [...] "stayed true and they have expressed their desire for what they want to see". Goddard also thought their wedding of [...] "this caliber" [...] would make their fans [...] "very, very happy and that is what this is about".|$|E
