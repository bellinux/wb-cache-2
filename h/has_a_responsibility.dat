25|$|The Government decides {{on general}} {{national}} strategies and priorities and proposes bills {{to be discussed}} by the parliament. Health care policy is primarily the field of Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The Ministry also directs and guides the development and policies of social protection, social welfare and health care. Due to the decentralized public administration, municipalities decide themselves how the local services are provided. Every municipality <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> to offer health care services to their residents and it is usually provided municipal health care centers.|$|E
25|$|In the Islamic conception, {{every human}} being <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> towards oneself. Since human life is sacred and {{initially}} created by divine rather than human agency, people are responsible for trying to keep their bodies and souls healthy, and not causing themselves spiritual or physical harm. Consequently, sport has obvious attractions in Islam: traditions record that Muḥammad raced with his wife 'Ā'ishah, and that he encouraged parents to teach their children swimming, riding and archery. Persian miniatures show Muslim women jointly playing polo with men in the same field. In the twenty-first century, some Muslim sociologists even argue {{that it should be}} obligatory for Muslim females to participate in sport of some kind.|$|E

25|$|On Earth, Eben and Martha Kent find Kal-El in the {{spacecraft}} and pull him from {{it before it}} explodes. The Kents decide to raise him as their own and name him Clark. Clark is shown learning about his abilities as he grows up, displaying great strength and speed, x-ray vision, super hearing and super durability. Once Clark is an adult, Eben explains how he and Martha found him and that Clark <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> to use his powers wisely and justly {{in the interest of}} truth, tolerance and justice. They agree that the world needs him and that he must leave their farm and go where he is needed. Clark states that he will pursue a job that will keep him close to world events, so he can be aware of emergencies immediately. Martha gives Clark a uniform made from the blankets they found him in and he decides to take on the secret identity Superman. The Kents die shortly after this conversation and Clark moves to Metropolis.|$|E

500|$|The 1988 Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act removed {{international}} trade barriers and amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, designating the metric system as [...] "the Preferred system of {{weights and measures}} for United States trade and commerce". The legislation stated {{that the federal government}} <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement. Exceptions were made for the highway and construction industries; the Department of Transportation planned to require metric units by 2000, but this plan was cancelled by the 1998 highway bill TEA21. However, the US military uses the metric system widely, partly because of the need to work with armed services from other nations. Although overall responsibility for labelling requirements of consumer goods lies with Congress and is therefore covered by federal law, details of labelling requirements for certain commodities are controlled by state law or by other authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Waylett of The Advocate {{was more}} critical, saying [...] "Madonna {{delivers}} the worst performance {{in recent memory}} as the heroine of an attempt at screwball comedy. Watching her try to look like Marilyn Monroe and sound like Betty Boop, though, is {{a sure sign that}} this film was a disaster in the making. At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone would sit down and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' who want to be like Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl? The answer provided by the box-office receipts was, alas, 'The same one who appeared in Shanghai Surprise and bored us to death'." ...|$|E
