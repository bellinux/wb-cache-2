40|$|Abstract. Mature oocytes of Drosophila {{are arrested}} in {{metaphase}} of meiosis I. Upon activation by ovulation or fertilization, oocytes undergo {{a series of}} rapid changes {{that have not been}} directly visualized previously. We report here the use of the Nonclaret disjunctional (Ncd) microtubule motor protein fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to monitor changes in the meiotic spindle of live oocytes after activation in vitro. Meiotic spindles of metaphase-arrested oocytes are relatively stable, however, meiotic spindles of in vitro–activated oocytes are highly dynamic: the spindles elongate, rotate around their long axis, and undergo an acute <b>pivoting</b> <b>movement</b> to reorient perpendicular to the oocyte surface.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known to the {{researchers}} that choosing a variable having the most negative reduced cost as the entering variable is not the best choice in the simplex method as shown by Harris (1975).

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a dynamic control method of multi ngered hands <b>for</b> <b>{{pivoting}}</b> {{an object in}} contact with the environment. This pivoting operation is often observed when a human moves a large or heavy object such as furniture on the oor. Di erent from the conventional manipulation of the object by only ngers, the characteristics of the pivoting operation is that we can use the reaction force from the environment. By using this reaction force, we can expect the magnitude of the forces applied to the object by the ngers is smaller than the conventional manipulation of the object by only ngers.

Experimental results on spoken language translation show that this hybrid method significantly improves the translation quality, which outperforms the method using a source-target corpus of the same size. In addition, we propose a system combination approach to select better translations from those produced by various pivot translation methods. This method regards system combination as a translation evaluation problem and formalizes it with a regression learning model. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvement over individual translation outputs. ...|$|R

50|$|Lacrosse cleats are {{characterized}} by having a high support for the ankle, and appear most similar to American Football cleats. A raised platform material surrounding the ankles is specific to the motions of players in the game. These motions include stopping and starting, and quick changes of direction as the game of play can rapidly change directions to {{either end of the}} field, necessitating ankle stability for such direction change. Lacrosse cleats contain a typical, standard toe cleat in the front and beneath the toes, for gaining traction off the toe. This is utilized for forward running, as well as potential <b>pivot</b> <b>movement</b> from the toe. Lacrosse cleats again differ from American Football cleats in that their cleats are placed to the edges of the foot sole whereas for Football the cleat spikes are found beneath the sole of the foot.|$|R
5000|$|In 1936, Rudolph Bannow (1897-1962) {{conceived}} {{of a major}} improvement to the milling machine. His company commenced manufacturing a new knee-and-column vertical mill in 1938. This was the Bridgeport milling machine, often called a ram-type or turret-type mill because its head has sliding-ram and rotating-turret mounting. The machine became so popular that many other manufacturers created copies and variants. Furthermore, its name came to connote any such variant. The Bridgeport offered enduring advantages over previous models. It was small enough, light enough, and affordable {{enough to be a}} practical acquisition for even the smallest machine shop businesses, yet it was also smartly designed, versatile, well-built, and rigid. Its various directions of sliding and <b>pivoting</b> <b>movement</b> allowed the head to approach the work from any angle. The Bridgeport's design became the dominant form for manual milling machines used by several generations of small- and medium-enterprise machinists. By the 1980s an estimated quarter-million Bridgeport milling machines had been built, and they (and their clones) are still being produced today.|$|R

Neuromuscular onset succession was captured by surface electromyography of relevant muscles of the an-terior and posterior muscle chain in 16 high-level gymnasts during intentional accelerating movement phases while performing 18 different gymnastics elements (in various body posi-tions to forward and backward, performed on high bar, parallel bars, rings and trampoline), as well as during non-sport specific <b>pivot</b> <b>movements</b> around the longitudinal axis.
