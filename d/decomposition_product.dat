25|$|It wasn't until 1962 {{until the}} first {{isolation}} of orellanine was done. The first methanolic extraction and isolation of orellanine was done by Stanisław Grzymala and isolated from the mushroom Cortinarius orellanus. Along with the isolation of orellanine, Grzymala was also able to demonstrate the nephrotoxicity of Cortinarius orellanus and determine various {{physical and chemical properties}} of orellanine. He found that the toxicity of the mushrooms was linked to delayed and acute renal failure, as well as when the isolated white crystalline substance was heated above 150 ̊C it began to slowly decompose. After this first isolation of orellanine, the structure of orellanine was first discovered by Antkowiak and Gessner in 1979. Orellanine’s structure was found to be 3,3',4,4'-tetrahydroxy- 2,2'-bipyridine-l,l'-dioxide. Antkowiak and Gessner were also able to determine that orellanine was the mono-N-oxide of orelline, which was the <b>decomposition</b> <b>product</b> of orellanine. It was also found that orelline was non-toxic. The first successful synthesis of orellanine was done in 1985. Tiecco, M. et. Al. completed a total synthesis of orellanine using commercially available 3-hydroxypyridine. After the first successful synthesis, the structure was confirmed in 1987 by Cohen-Addad et al. in 1987 by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{functional}} groups on TNT influences {{the ability to}} adsorb into soil.

An algorithm to compute the detonation products of energetic materials using four different concepts along with the computation of oxygen balance, elemental composition, and molecular weight has been developed and described in this paper.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{decomposition}} {{characteristics of a}} new type of environmentally friendly insulating gas C 6 F 12 O and N 2 mixed gas under AC voltage. The breakdown behavior of 3 % C 6 F 12 O and N 2 mixed gas in quasi-uniform field was investigated through a breakdown experiment. The self-recovery of the mixed gas was analyzed by 100 breakdown experiments. The <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> of C 6 F 12 O and N 2 under breakdown voltage were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Finally, the decomposition process of the products was calculated by density functional theory, and the ionization energy, affinity, and molecular orbital gap of the <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> were also calculated. The properties of the <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> were analyzed from the aspects of insulation and environmental protection. The experimental results show that the 3 % C 6 F 12 O and N 2 mixed gas did not show a downward trend over 100 breakdown tests under a 0. 10 MPa breakdown voltage. The <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> after breakdown were CF 4, C 2 F 6, C 3 F 6, C 3 F 8, C 4 F 10, and C 5 F 12.
