40|$|The {{measurement}} {{of water in}} soil on a potential, gravimetric or volumetric basis is considered, with studies concentrating on the {{measurement of}} water by dielectric and neutron moderation methods. The ability of the time-domain reflectometry technique to measure water content simultaneously at different spatial locations is an important advantage of the technique. The reported apparent dielectric by the TRASE� time-domain reflectometer and Pyelab time-domain reflectometry systems is sensitive to change in extension cable length. In some soil, e. g. a commercial sand, the response to increasing extension length of extension cable is linear. For other soil a linear response occurs for certain lengths of cable at different moisture contents. A single model accounting for clay content, extension cable length, time-domain reflectometry system, probe type and inherent moisture conditions explained 62. 2 % of variation from the control (0 m extension) cable. The extension cable causes {{a decrease in the}} returning electromagnetic-wave energy; leading to a decline in the slope used in automatic end-point determination. Calibration for each probe installation when the soil is saturated, and at small water contents is recommended. The ability of time-domain <b>reflectometry,</b> <b>frequency-domain</b> and neutron moderation techniques in measuring soil water content in a Brown Chromosol is examined. An in situ calibration, across a limited range of water contents, for the neutron moderation method is more sensitive to changing soil water content than the factory supplied 'universal' calibration. Comparison of the EnviroSCAN� frequency-domain system and the NMM count ratio indicates the frequency-domain technique is more sensitive to change in soil water conditions. The EnviroSCAN� system is well suited to continuous profile-based measurement of soil water content. Results with the time-domain reflectometry technique were disappointing, indicating the limited applicability of time-domain reflectometry in profile based soil water content measurement in heavy-textured soil, or soil with a large electrical conductivity. The method of auguring to a known depth and placement of the time-domain reflectometry probe into undisturbed soil is not recommended. A time-domain reflectometry system is adapted for in situ measurement of water in an iron ore stockpile. The laboratory calibration for water content of the processed iron ore compares favourably to a field calibration. In the field study, the 28 m extension cable used to connect the probes to the time-domain reflectometry affected the end-point determination of the time-domain reflectometry system. To account for this, 0. 197 should be subtracted from the reported apparent dielectric before calculation of volumetric moisture content...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Distributed fibre sensors {{based on}} the frequency-domain {{analysis}} of Rayleigh backscattered light are well established. They exhibit excellent performance in both sensitivity and spatial resolution, but their application can be limited due to their cost and {{the complexity of the}} analysis. This work presents a system based on coherent optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry</b> used in Rayleigh distributed sensors, but with some modifications to the fibre and the implementation of signal-conditioning algorithms that enable the use of more readily available components and simplified analysis. A sensing fibre is prepared by printing uniformly spaced (in this instance), ultra-low reflectivity points. When swept-wavelength light is introduced into the fibre, the reflections from the ultra-low reflectivity points interfere with the reflection from the tip of the fibre. These reflections can be processed with the techniques used in coherent optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry,</b> providing information {{about the state of the}} fibre with regards to a parameter (such as temperature) between the reflective points. The function of the ultra-low reflectivity points is to provide stronger reflections than those produced by Rayleigh backscatter. The ultra-low reflectivity points are fibre Bragg gratings that act as reflectors and not as sensors per se. They are manufactured to reflect the same wavelength and, because of their low reflectivity, they also have a wider reflective spectral range than commonly used high-reflectivity fibre Bragg gratings. This removes the need for specialised detection equipment. Use of a reference interferometer and signal-processing algorithms (linearisation and phase fixing) makes it possible to replace a high-precision linearly tuneable laser with a standard tuneable laser or even a distributed feedback laser diode as the optical source. A novel technique is also presented for identifying the initial phase in the signal, post-acquisition, by means of a fibre Bragg grating in the reference interferometer. In combination with the linearisation and phase fixing algorithms, this locks the phase of the signal prior to analysis, dispensing with the need for precise synchronisation between the optical source and signal acquisition. The best spatial resolution that can be achieved by the system is 0. 36 mm, and the best temperature resolution achieved (with a spatial resolution of 60 mm) had a standard deviation of [...] . M.

Both Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (B-OTDR) and optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry</b> (OFDR) sensing techniques were used for cable interrogation, yielding results that were in good qualitative agreement with finite-element calculations.

The real part of dielectric permittivity was assessed from the 380 – 440 MHz, while the bulk electrical conductivity was calculated from the 165 – 325 MHz range. The FDR technique allows determination of bulk electrical conductivity from the imaginary part of the complex dielectric permittivity, without disregarding the dielectric losses. The soil salinity status was determined using the salinity index, defined as a partial derivative of the soil bulk electrical conductivity with respect to the real part of the soil complex dielectric permittivity. The salinity index method enables determining the soil water electrical conductivity value. For the five sandy mineral soils that have been tested, the relationship between bulk electrical conductivity and the real part of dielectric permittivity is essentially linear. As a result, the salinity index method applied for FDR measurements may be adapted to field use after examination of loam and clayey soils...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{interrogation}} {{technique for}} fully distributed linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating (LCFBG) strain sensors with simultaneous high {{temporal and spatial}} resolution based on optical time-stretch <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry</b> (OTS-FDR) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. LCFBGs is a promising candidate for fully distributed sensors thanks to its longer grating length and broader reflection bandwidth compared to normal uniform FBGs. In the proposed system, two identical LCFBGs are employed in a Michelson interferometer setup with one grating serving as the reference grating whereas the other serving as the sensing element. Broadband spectral interferogram is formed and the strain information is encoded into the wavelength-dependent free spectral range (FSR). Ultrafast interrogation is achieved based on dispersion-induced time stretch such that the target spectral interferogram is mapped to a temporal interference waveform that can be captured in real-time using a single-pixel photodector. The distributed strain along the sensing grating can be reconstructed from the instantaneous RF frequency of the captured waveform. High-spatial resolution is also obtained due to high-speed data acquisition. In a proof-of-concept experiment, ultrafast real-time interrogation of fully-distributed grating sensors with various strain distributions is experimentally demonstrated.

40|$|Measurement {{and control}} of the fluid {{parameters}} play a very important role in industry applications such as in the petrochemical industrial processing, where there is an increasing demand for real-time determination of dielectric parameters in relation to the product quality. Furthermore, in such a context, additional stringent requirements frequently deal with the spatial localization of non-miscible-layered liquids, like water layers often present in the bottom of tanks during the refinery industrial processing. Recently, reflectometry has become a very attractive method for monitoring applications, thanks to its accuracy and flexibility performance. In this paper, the design of a suitable probe configuration and an associated calibration structure, both leading to an optimal experimental set-up for practical reflectometry measurements in petrochemical industrial applications, are illustrated. Moreover, starting from <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry</b> data, a robust optimization procedure is implemented and experimentally tested, thus allowing the accurate evaluation of the frequency-dependent dielectric properties and of multiple levels in different stratified liquids. Results derived through the simple time-domain technique are compared with those achieved through two different frequency-domain approaches, involving the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) of time-domain reflectometry (TDR) data and direct vector network analyzer (VNA) measurements, respectively. It is demonstrated that the frequency-domain approaches can significantly enhance the measurement accuracy, allowing the estimation of fuel level with an uncertainty lower than 0. 5 mm. Furthermore, it is also shown that a low-cost TDR system, combined with an appropriate FFT-based algorithm, can be successfully adopted for the simultaneous measurement of permittivity and levels, without substantially affecting the measurement accuracy performance when compared to the direct frequency-domain VNA measurements...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{capabilities}} of hybrid polarimetric synthetic aperture radar are investigated to estimate soil moisture on bare and vegetated agricultural soils. A new methodology based on a compact polarimetric decomposition, together with a surface component inversion, is developed to retrieve surface soil moisture. A model-based compact decomposition technique is applied to obtain the surface scattering component under the assumption of a randomly oriented vegetation volume. After vegetation removal, the surface scattering component is inverted for soil moisture (under vegetation) by comparison with a surface component modeled by two physics-based scattering models: The integral equation method (IEM) and the extended Bragg model (X-Bragg). The developed algorithm, based on a two-layer (random volume over ground) scattering model, is applied on a time series of hybrid polarimetric C-band RISAT- 1 right circular transmit linear receive data acquired from April to October 2014 over the Wallerfing test site in Lower Bavaria, Germany.

We then used these data to determine how soil moisture varies on diet, seasonal and multi-year timescales, and to better understand the quantitative and mechanistic relationships between soil moisture and forest evapotranspiration. The mean annual precipitation at the site was over 1900 mm. The field capacity was approximately 0. 53 m 3 m - 3 and was nearly uniform with soil depth. Soil moisture decreased at all levels during the dry season, with the minimum of 0. 3 g m 3 m - 3 at 3 in beneath the surface. The moisture in the upper 1 m showed a strong diel cycle with daytime depletion due to evapotranspiration. The moisture beneath 1 m declined during both day and night due to the combined effects of evapotranspiration, drainage and a nighttime upward movement of water. The depth of active water withdrawal changed markedly over the year. The upper 2 m of soil supplied ∼ 56 % of the water used for evapotranspiration in the wet season and ∼ 28 % of the water used in the dry season. The zone of active water withdrawal extended to a depth of at least 10 m. The day-to-day rates of moisture withdrawal from the upper 10 m of soil during rain-free periods agreed well with simultaneous measurements of whole-forest evapotranspiration made by the eddy covariance technique. The forest at the site was well adapted to the normal cycle of wet and dry seasons, and the dry season had only a small effect on the rates of land-atmosphere water vapour exchange.

40|$|International audienceThe {{capability}} of measuring the spectral and temporal phase of an optical signal is of fundamental {{importance for the}} advanced characterization of photonic and optoelectronic components, biochemical sensors, structural monitoring sensors and distributed sensor networks. To address this problem, several techniques have been developed (frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER), stepped-heterodyne technique, laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) and Doppler optical coherence tomography (OCT)). However, such techniques often lack of versatility for the mentioned applications. Swept-wavelength interferometric techniques and, among these, optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry</b> (OFDR) are flexible and highly sensitive tools for complete characterization of amplitude and phase of target devices. In this work, we investigate the spectral and temporal phase measurement capabilities of OFDR. Precise characterization of spectral phase information is demonstrated by retrieving the phase response of a commercial optical filter, the Finisar Waveshaper 1000 S/X, programmable in attenuation and phase over C+L band (1530 - 1625 nm). The presented results show accurate retrieval of group delay dispersion (GDD) and discrete phase shift as well as filter attenuation profile. Although some intrinsic accuracy limitations of OFDR phase measurements may be encountered (and herein specified), we show that information encoded in OFDR reflectogram data is very rich when adequately exploited. In addition to previously published results, we demonstrate the high sensitivity of the technique to Doppler effects. From practical point of view, such sensitivity can be beneficially exploited for the characterisation of dynamical aspects of samples under test. Unlike LDV, OFDR allows the simultaneous retrieval of the temporal position of several localised reflecting target along the beam path. All these aspects make OFDR a highly promising candidate {{for the study of}} both static and dynamic aspects of complex photonic components or to probe a parallel sensor network, as needed for future application...|$|E

SALTIRSOIL calculates the composition of the soil solution, mainly saturation extract, given an irrigation water composition and amount, crop type, climate features and basic physical and chemical soil data. The lower Palancia river basin, in the limit between València and Castelló provinces in Spain, was selected as study area in order to test the model. This agricultural area is interesting because several factors that cause soil salinization, such as high evapotranspiration to rainfall ratios and high salinity irrigation waters, meet. Five experimental plots have been monitored in this area since late spring 2007. The plots were selected in order to test SALTIRSOIL under the four combinations resulting from the following two factors: irrigation water salinity: low or high, and irrigation technique: drip or basin. Soil sampling in different places within the plots, four depths down to 90 cm and throughout the year has been performed, and saturated soil pastes prepared and analysed, {{in order to have a}} representative soil salinity dataset from each plot. Irrigation waters have also been sampled and analysed regularly. Furthermore, soil solution ceramic vacuum extractors have been installed at three depths (30, 60 and 90 cm) at the water inlet and outlet in basin irrigated plots and close to selected drip emitters in those drip irrigated. Soil solution from these vacuum extractors has been sampled and analysed every time an irrigation or rainfall event has occurred.

This thesis studies the properties of fiber tapers {{for the purpose of}} making tapered-based devices and sensors in aerospace related application where small size and light weight are critical. This thesis includes theoretical derivation and experimental verifications of distributed mode coupling in tapered single-mode fibers (SMFs) with high-resolution optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry</b> (OFDR) technique. The studies are realized with OFDR through phase detection of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), which measures local refractive index change relative to the reference arm. The wavelength shifts converted by the phase change give the group index differences between the fundamental mode and higher-order modes of fiber tapers. The energy re-distribution is observed in Rayleigh backscatter amplitude as a function of fiber length with a ~ 13 µm resolution over the entire fiber taper, and group index difference between core and cladding modes is measured with a spatial resolution of ~ 2 cm by using autocorrelation data processing. The thermal and mechanical properties of fiber tapers have also been characterized with OFDR. The cross-correlation wavelength shift is related to the refractive index change of the modes. It is shown that residual stress induced by the tapering process results in the inhomogeneous thermal property, which can be significantly reduced by an annealing treatment. A fiber taper with a waist diameter of ~ 6 µm has a force sensitivity of ~ 620. 83 nm/N, ~ 500 times higher than that of SMF. Furthermore, polarization-preserving character of tapered polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) is evaluated by OFDR-based distributed birefringence along tapered PMFs. Three tapered-based micro-fiber devices have been used as effective mode selecting components to build narrow-linewidth tunable Erbium-doped fiber ring lasers.

Distributed vibration sensor based on all-polarization-maintaining configurations of the phase-sensitive optical {{time domain reflectometry}} (OTDR) is developed to achieve high frequency response and spatial resolution. Signal fading and noise induced by polarization change can be mitigated via polarization-maintaining components. Pencil-break event is tested as a vibration source and {{the layout of the}} sensing fiber part is designed for real applications. The spatial resolution is 1 m and the maximum distance between sensing fiber and vibration event is 18 cm. Wavelet denoising method is introduced to improve the performance of the distributed vibration sensor based on phase-sensitive OTDR in standard single-mode fiber. Noise can be reduced more effectively by thresholding the wavelet coefficient. Sub-meter spatial resolution is obtained with a detectable frequency up to 8 kHz. A new distributed vibration sensor based on time-division multiplexing (TDM) scheme is also studied. A special probe waveform including a narrow pules and a quasi-continuous wave can combine the conventional phase-sensitive OTDR system and polarization diversity scheme together in one single-mode fiber without crosstalk. Position and frequency of the vibration can be determined by these two detection systems consecutively in different time slots. Vibration event up to 0. 6 MHz is detected with 1 m spatial resolution along a 680 m single-mode sensing fiber. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is investigated to study the non-stationary vibration events measured by our phase OTDR system. The CWT approach can access both frequency and time information of the vibration event simultaneously. Distributed vibration measurements of 500 Hz and 500 Hz to 1 kHz sweep events over 20 cm fiber length are demonstrated using a single-mode fiber. Optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry</b> (OFDR) for vibration sensing is proposed for the first time. The local Rayleigh backscatter spectrum shift in time sequence could be used to determine dynamic strain information at a specific position of the vibrated state with respect to that of the non-vibrated state.

In most cases, however, early detection of the phenomenon allows avoiding dramatic accidents. Developing monitoring techniques capable of detecting ongoing internal erosion with sufficient advance represents therefore a significant step towards a higher level of flood safety. Temperature measurements performed in embankment dams have been proven to be effective in identifying leakages consequent to internal erosion. This work investigates the effectiveness of distributed fibre-optic temperature sensing for the early detection of internal erosion in river and sea dikes. The attention is focused on dikes prone to backward erosion piping, a mechanism that affects the foundation layer of structures resting on sandy soils. The measurements performed in a large-scale piping test are presented and discussed. The test enabled the recognition of the main factors that influence the onset of thermal anomalies in regions affected by piping. Subsequently, the effect of the above-mentioned factors was quantitatively studied with the aid of finite element modelling and dimensional analysis. It was discovered that early detection of piping cannot completely rely on the propagation of a thermal front (hot or cold depending on the season) that moves from the waterside to the landside with different speed in intact and eroded regions. Indeed, depending on the permeability and thickness of the sandy layer and {{on the size of the}} embankment, the duration of the flood event might not be sufficient for the front to reach a pipe not yet fully developed. However, another mechanism is exploitable for detection: the effect of the flow velocity on the natural vertical temperature gradient. Since this gradient decreases with depth, the effectiveness of this mechanism depends on the depth at which piping occurs. The thesis also contains some tips for an effective numerical modelling of the advection-diffusion equation in permeable soils, both intact and affected by piping. Finally, the thesis describes a small-scale setup that was developed to investigate the temperature distribution in the surroundings of a pipe. The model incorporates a distributed fibre-optic sensor with a sub-centimetre spatial resolution. Such resolution was achieved adopting a novel sensing technology, in which the spectral shift of the Rayleigh backscatter is measured using optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry.</b> Preliminary results show how the cross-sensitivity of the sensor to temperature and strain influenced the measurements and how this was partially overcome. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis proposes and {{develops}} a novel optic configuration, Kerr phase-interrogator, which investigates the phase-shift between two sinusoidally modulated optical signals (SMOS) utilizing Kerr effect. The Kerr phase-interrogator {{gives birth to}} an entirely new technique for measuring the phase-shift between two light-waves. Taking advantage of all-optical signal processing, ultrafast responses, and being free from the coherent properties of a laser source, the Kerr phase-interrogator based technique for measuring the phase-shift is a promising novel approach for monitoring and sensing applications. The thesis begins with theoretically demonstrating the operation of Kerr phase-interrogator. As the core of optical process occurs in Kerr phase-interrogator, nonlinear interactions between two SMOSs in the Kerr medium are theoretically analyzed utilizing the models of nonlinear phase-modulation and four-wave mixing (FWM). The phase-modulation-based model is intuitive and allows for conceptual understanding of {{the operation of the}} Kerr phase-interrogator. However, this model does not account for the impact of chromatic-dispersion (CD) of the Kerr medium on the operation of the Kerr phase-interrogator. Compared with the former model, the FWM-based model is essential for acquiring insight into Kerr phase-interrogator, and can explain the CD impact of the Kerr medium. The analytical solution {{of the power of the}} first order sideband as a result of the nonlinear interaction is obtained in both theoretical models. The obtained solution shows sinusoidal dependence of the power on the phase-shift of the SMOSs. Utilizing this sinusoidal dependence, the phase-shift of two SMOSs can be acquired by measuring the power of the first-order sideband. Birefringence and CD are critical factors that affect the nonlinear interactions and thus impact the operation of Kerr phase-interrogator. In this work, vector analysis is performed on the nonlinear interaction between two SMOSs in a Kerr medium with randomly varying birefringence, and the effect of polarization-states of SMOSs on the operation of Kerr phase-interrogator is investigated. Impact of CD of Kerr medium on the operation of Kerr phase-interrogator is theoretically investigated using theory of FWM and is experimentally verified. Four typical applications, which comprehensively reflect the advantages of Kerr phase-interrogator, are proposed and experimentally demonstrated in this thesis. First, we present a novel approach for measurements of CD in long optical fibers using a Kerr phase-interrogator. The Kerr phase-interrogator measures the phase variation of a SMOS induced by CD in a fiber under test as the laser carrier wavelength is varied. This approach takes advantage of all-optical signal-processing based on Kerr effect to acquire the phase variation, and consequently removes the requirement of complex electrical signal-processors in existing techniques of CD measurement. CD measurement for several fibers is experimentally demonstrated. Second, a novel temperature sensor that utilizes temperature dependence of reflection group-delay in a linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating is presented. The reflection group-delay of chirped grating changes with temperature leading to a variation in the phase of a SMOS reflected from the grating. A Kerr phase-interrogator converts the phase-variation into power variation allowing for temperature sensing with a resolution of 0. 0089 oC and a sensitivity of 1. 122 rad/oC. Third, a Kerr phase-interrogator is applied for implementation of real-time CD monitoring. CD induces a phase-shift between two SMOSs carried by two different wavelengths. A Kerr phase-interrogator converts the phase-shift into power variation and CD monitoring is achieved by measurement of the power variation in real time with a resolution of 0. 196 ps/nm. This application takes advantages of ultrafast response of Kerr phase-interrogator and achieves the real-time monitoring. Lastly, a novel approach for incoherent optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometry</b> based on a Kerr phase-interrogator is presented. The novel approach eliminates the limitation of finite coherent length of the light source, and achieves measurement of long-range distance beyond the coherent length of the light source. Long-range detection of reflection points as far as 151 km at a spatial-resolution of 11. 2 cm is experimentally demonstrated...|$|E
