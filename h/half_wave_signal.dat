40|$|Gravitational wave {{astronomy}} is {{a rapidly}} growing field of modern astrophysics, with observations being made frequently by the LIGO detectors. Gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>signals</b> are often extremely weak and {{the data from the}} detectors, such as LIGO, is contaminated with non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise, often containing transient disturbances which can obscure real signals. Traditional denoising methods, such as principal component analysis and dictionary learning, are not optimal for dealing with this non-Gaussian noise, especially for low signal-to-noise ratio gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>signals.</b> Furthermore, these methods are computationally expensive on large datasets. To overcome these issues, we apply state-of-the-art signal processing techniques, based on recent groundbreaking advancements in deep learning, to denoise gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>signals</b> embedded either in Gaussian noise or in real LIGO noise.
