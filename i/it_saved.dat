5|$|The {{expansion}} fees {{themselves were}} a significant {{legacy of the}} expansion effort. Smith claims US$14 to $15 million was brought in and that <b>it</b> <b>saved</b> the league. A more modest assessment suggests expansion saved the Stampeders and Tiger-Cats—both teams were undeniably in distress during the era—and that the other Canadian teams were able to have maintain a semblance of stability.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{screening}} of the short for MGM executives, opinion was divided on whether Garland or Durbin should be retained. Finally, Louis B. Mayer, upon his return from a European trip, decreed that both girls should be kept. However, Durbin's contract option had expired by then. She was signed by Universal Studios, where her first picture, Three Smart Girls, was so successful that <b>it</b> <b>saved</b> Universal from bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|In {{pursuit of}} these funds he {{traveled}} to the Thracian Chersonese and attacked Selymbria. He plotted with a pro-Athenian party within the city and offered the Selymbrians reasonable terms and imposed strict discipline {{to see that they}} were observed. He did their city no injury whatsoever, but merely took a sum of money from it, set a garrison in it and left. Epigraphical evidence indicates the Selymbrians surrendered hostages until the treaty was ratified in Athens. His performance is judged as skillful by historians, since <b>it</b> <b>saved</b> time, resources, and lives and still fully achieved his goal.|$|E

5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money <b>it</b> <b>saved</b> studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
5|$|After {{interrogation}} by Doggett, Purnell {{confesses to}} snatching Billy in 1990 {{on behalf of}} someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. The police and the two FBI agents go to Jeppy’s home and find Josh in a compartment under {{the floor of his}} horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case. Scully believes it was justice from beyond the grave and that {{the important thing is that}} <b>it</b> <b>saved</b> Josh Underwood.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1896, Sorabji's {{father was}} back in Bombay, where he played a {{significant}} role in the development of India's engineering and cotton machinery industries, among other things. Although he provided his family with financial support, he spent much of his time abroad and on 17 June 1929 bigamously married Nobubai Visvonata Catcar, causing Sorabji and his mother a substantial loss of fortune. He died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, on 8 July 1932. In the same year, Sorabji travelled to India to settle matters related to his father's estate, but obtained nothing but money from a trust fund that his father had established in 1914. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>saved</b> him from having to earn a living, although his lifestyle was ascetic.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} Expediency Council, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money <b>it</b> <b>saved</b> by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, the government says it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E
5|$|Van Nistelrooy {{took the}} first penalty for Manchester United, {{in front of the}} United fans, and sent Lehmann the wrong way to give United the early advantage. Lauren then {{converted}} the next penalty for Arsenal, before Scholes stepped up to take United's second, only to see <b>it</b> <b>saved</b> by Lehmann, diving low to his right. The next six penalties were all scored – Ljungberg, Van Persie and Cole for Arsenal, Ronaldo, Rooney and Keane for Manchester United – leaving Vieira with the opportunity to win the FA Cup for his team. Although Carroll guessed the correct way to dive, Vieira's kick was just out of his reach, giving Arsenal their 10th FA Cup.|$|E
