5|$|In 1913–1914 two Kaiser-class ships, Kaiser and König Albert {{took part}} in a major {{overseas}} tour to South America and South Africa. The cruise was designed to demonstrate German power projection, as well as to test the reliability of the new turbine engines on long-range operations. Both ships <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> German bases in the North Sea by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E

5|$|In April, Bochco {{stated that}} he did not intend to kill off Smits' character, Simone. On L.A. Law, Smits <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> show for {{critically}} acclaimed guest appearances during sweeps episodes after leaving his regular role. Whether Smits' character would overlap with Schroder's character on screen was undetermined when Schroder was announced in June, but at the time Season 6 production was scheduled to commence on August 10, 1998. As of mid-July, Smits' departing episode was not scheduled to film until September.|$|E
5|$|In early October, UB-42 <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea, {{when she}} was ordered to deliver five Georgians with gold to finance a Georgian {{independence}} movement. While remaining in the Black Sea, UB-42 sank the sailing ships Agios Georgios on 10 October, and Francesco Patrino in November. On 22 November, she torpedoed the 1,086-ton Siracusy while the latter was at anchor off the Georgian coast. UB-46 also shelled Tuapse while in the northern Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1968, Vulcan B.2 XM604 crashed {{following}} {{a loss of}} control during an overshoot at RAF Cottesmore. The rear crew members were killed though both pilots ejected. The captain ejected at a very late stage and only survived because his deploying parachute was snagged by some power cables. The accident was caused by failure of an Olympus 301 LP turbine disc after the aircraft <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airfield following indications of a bomb-bay overheat.|$|E

5|$|Simeon's army quickly {{followed}} up {{the victory of}} Acheloos with another success. The Bulgarians sent to pursuit {{the remnants of the}} Byzantine army approached Constantinople and encountered Byzantine forces under Leo Phokas, who <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital, at the village of Katasyrtai in the immediate proximity of Constantinople. The Bulgarian regiments attacked and again defeated the Byzantines, destroying some of their last units before returning to Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|The first {{gendarmerie}} members {{arrived in}} Albania on November 10, 1913. They were soon {{faced with a}} peasant revolt. One International Gendarmerie officer was killed and many were imprisoned after the revolt erupted in June 1914. Dutch officers were gradually replaced by officers from Austria-Hungary and Germany, who arrived in Durrës on July 4. Soon, World War I broke out and by August 4, most of the Dutch officers <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. By September 19, 1914, the last two imprisoned officers were released.|$|E

5|$|When the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{reached the}} Platte in 1804, {{they found the}} Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living there. They {{were told that the}} band <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republican about ten years before (that is, before the {{conflict}} with the Omahas), but had recently moved to the Platte under pressure from the Kanzas. By 1806, however, the Kitkehahkis were at peace with the Kanzas, and were once again living on the Republican.|$|E
5|$|After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda {{began working}} on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As she had missed Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while {{checking}} {{in and out of the}} hospital. She did not get better, nor did she finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda was locked into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, European {{colonialism}} in Africa {{had reached}} its height. Having {{lost control of}} the vast territory of Brazil in South America, the Portuguese began to focus on expanding their African outposts. This brought them into direct conflict with the British. Since David Livingstone <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E

5|$|Captain Merrill T. Kinnecommander of the Port Chicago {{facility}} {{at the time}} of the explosionhad served in the Navy from 1915 to 1922 and <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Navy from civilian life in 1941 to be posted aboard a general cargo ship. Prior to his being sent to command Port Chicago, Kinne had no training in the loading of munitions and very little experience in handling them. White loading officers serving underneath Kinne had not been trained in supervising enlisted personnel or in handling munitions until they had been posted to Mare Island Navy Yard, after which they were considered adequate to the task by the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback, the {{expedition}} continued with Wild in command while Hussey returned to England with Shackleton's body. On 22 January, Worsley suffered a serious accident. Under sail, the Quest had been rolling heavily and ropes securing a lifeboat snapped. The lifeboat, full of stores, swung against the wheelhouse and crushed Worsley against the bridge. He broke several ribs {{and had to}} rest for several days. By the end of March, after being briefly trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea, the ship reached Elephant Island. The expedition then returned to South Georgia, where Hussey was waiting. Shackleton's widow had directed that he be buried on South Georgia and Hussey <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island in late February to fulfil her request.|$|E
5|$|However, Henry's army never progressed {{further than}} Leith; there the army could keep in {{physical}} {{contact with the}} supporting fleet. Henry took a personal interest in his convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen fishing in the Firth of Forth were to be paid £2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's campaign {{had been reduced to}} a 'war of words.' By 29 August, the English army <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side of the border.|$|E

5|$|Jeremy Wilkin as Virgil Tracy. David Holliday, the {{original}} voice of Virgil, <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States {{in the interim}} between the production of Series One and Thunderbirds Are Go. For the films and Series Two, the character was voiced by Wilkin, an English-born Canadian actor who emigrated back to London in the 1960s. Wilkin would maintain a professional relationship with the Andersons for seven years after the film, voicing the character of Captain Ochre in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, supporting roles in Joe 90 and The Bishop in The Secret Service, as well as making minor appearances in the live-action Anderson productions Doppelgänger, UFO and The Protectors.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{settled in}} San Juan in 1814. He {{had a new}} son, Pedro Cornelio, and {{maintained}} a simple life growing grapes. He awaited the final decision of Posadas, but the supreme director had a political crisis at the time. The Spanish king Ferdinand VII <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne and demanded the colonies {{to return to their}} former organization, the royalists at Upper Peru were still a threat, and José Gervasio Artigas opposed Buenos Aires as well, because of its high centralism. As a result, Carlos María de Alvear became the new supreme director, who would decide the final fate of Cornelio Saavedra.|$|E
5|$|Saint and Elliot {{returned}} to Ecuador to work among the Huaorani (1958-1960), establishing a camp called Tihueno near a former Huaorani settlement. Rachel Saint and Dayuma became bonded in Huaorani eyes through their shared mourning and Rachel's adoption as a sister of Dayuma, taking the name Nemo from the latter's deceased youngest sister. The first Huaorani to settle there were primarily {{women and children}} from a Huaorani group called the Guiquetairi, but in 1968 an enemy Huaorani band known as the Baihuari joined them. Elliot <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States in the early 1960s, so Saint and Dayuma worked to alleviate the resulting conflict. They succeeded in securing cohabitation {{of the two groups}} by overseeing numerous cross-band weddings, leading to an end of inter-clan warfare but obscuring the cultural identity of each group.|$|E
