5|$|Today {{herbs are}} {{typically}} {{thought of as}} culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they {{were considered to be}} any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics. Traditional cottage garden herbs included sage, thyme, southernwood, wormwood, catmint, feverfew, lungwort, soapwort, <b>hyssop,</b> sweet woodruff, and lavender.|$|E
5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with <b>hyssop.</b>|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and <b>hyssop,</b> which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time â€“ they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E

It especially favors subalpine larkspur (Delphinium barbeyi) and it serves as one of the plant's main pollinators.|$|R
5000|$|Agastache is a genus of {{aromatic}} flowering herbaceous {{perennial plants}} in the family Lamiaceae. It contains 22 species native to eastern Asia (one species) and North America (the rest).

It was not long before a Canadian Mountie, who was visiting the <b>Hyssop</b> Ranch, thought that one of the cowboys was just too young looking to be a {{seasoned}} cowpuncher and bronc peeler. The Mountie asked Earl Bascom just how old he was - he was 13 years old. Earl was returned to school. Attending school felt better after Earl's father, who had a school district transportation contract, gave him the job of driving an old stagecoach pulled by a team of Bascom horses each day to the surrounding ranches transporting fellow students to and from school.|$|E
25|$|Traditional absinthes obtain their green colour {{strictly}} {{from the}} chlorophyll of whole herbs, which is {{extracted from the}} plants during the secondary maceration. This step involves steeping plants such as petite wormwood, <b>hyssop,</b> and melissa (among other herbs) in the distillate. Chlorophyll from these herbs is extracted in the process, giving the drink its famous green colour.|$|E

50|$|The closest living {{relatives}} of Agastache {{are believed to}} be two very different lineages: One is a group of mostly Asian and usually strongly aromatic and rather robust plants, which contains the typical dragonheads (Dracocephalum), true <b>hyssops</b> (Hyssopus), West Asian dragonheads (Lallemantia), and Japanese catnip (Schizonepeta). By contrast, the other lineage unites the largely scentless and low-growing genera Glechoma and Meehania which occur widely across the Holarctic. These three lineages form a tight-knit radiation; as of 2016, it is not resolved with certainty which of the other two lineages is the sister taxon of Agastache, but most data place the aromatic group slightly closer. The genus Agastache seems to have originated as a North American/trans-Beringian offshoot of its radiation about 25 million years ago, in the Late Oligocene.|$|R
25|$|According to the Mishnah, the {{ceremony}} {{of the burning}} of the red heifer itself {{took place on the}} Mount of Olives. A ritually pure kohen slaughtered the heifer, and sprinkled of its blood {{in the direction of the}} Temple seven times. The Red Heifer was then burnt on a pyre, together with crimson dyed wool, <b>hyssop,</b> and cedar wood. In recent years, the site of the burning of the Red Heifer on the Mount of Olives has been tentatively located by archaeologist Yonatan Adler.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} juniper, known as savin, was {{mentioned}} frequently in European writings. In one case in England, a rector from Essex {{was said to}} have procured it for a woman he had impregnated in 1574; in another, a man wishing to remove his girlfriend of like condition recommended to her that black hellebore and savin be boiled together and drunk in milk, or else that chopped madder be boiled in beer. Other substances reputed to have been used by the English include Spanish fly, opium, watercress seed, iron sulphate, and iron chloride. Another mixture, not abortifacient, but rather intended to relieve missed abortion, contained dittany, <b>hyssop,</b> and hot water.|$|E
25|$|Food {{was also}} flavored by plants, most {{native to the}} region and either {{cultivated}} or gathered in the wild, although a few spices were imported. Garlic and onions, and possibly fenugreek, were used to season cooked foods, {{as well as being}} eaten as vegetables. Herbs and spices included capers, coriander, cumin and black cumin, dill, dwarf chicory, <b>hyssop,</b> marjoram, mint, black mustard, reichardia, saffron and thyme. Some seasonings were imported, such as myrrh, galbanum, saffron and cinnamon, but their high cost limited their widespread use. Spices for special feasts were imported by the wealthy and royalty from Arabia and India, and were highly valued. These included various types of pepper, and ginger.|$|E
500|$|The {{plant in}} front of John the Baptist has aspects of both <b>hyssop</b> and cornflower, yet is most likely a <b>hyssop</b> because it grows from a wall.

There is a citron tree in the background, which represents the Cedar of Lebanon. Michelangelo uses the <b>hyssop</b> and tree as a visual representation of a quote by Rabanus Maurus, [...] "From the Cedar of Lebanon to the <b>hyssop</b> which grows on a stony wall we have {{an explanation of the}} Divinity which Christ has in his Father and of the humanity that he derives from the Virgin Mary."

500|$|This factor {{also worked}} in reverse; while Hannah de Rothschild was keen to marry Rosebery, {{she was also}} aware of many obstacles, the {{foremost}} being that she was devoted to her faith, and to leave {{it would be a}} severe moral wrench. Another obstacle was the Rothschild family itself: it was their custom to marry cousins to keep their fortune within the family. Ironically, Hannah herself had opposed the marriage of her cousin Annie de Rothschild to the Christian Eliot Yorke, the son of the Earl of Hardwicke, in 1866. In fact, she was to be the third daughter of the family's English branch to marry outside of the Jewish faith, but such was the fame of the bridegroom and the resultant publicity that the Jewish elders and press felt an example needed to be made. The Jewish Chronicle announced its [...] "most poignant grief" [...] at the prospect, and cryptically added, [...] "If the flame seize on the cedars, how will fare the <b>hyssop</b> on the wall: if the leviathan is brought up with a hook, how will the minnows escape," [...] demonstrating what a threat to the social fabric of the Jewish faith the Jewish elders saw in the prospect of such a marriage. The quotation, originally from the Babylonian Talmud, can be taken to mean that the elders and respected members and more notable members of the Jewish faith should set a good example by strictly following the teachings of the Jewish articles of faith which frown upon marriage to members of other religions.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} when the priest had {{finished}} the sprinkling, he wiped {{his hand on the}} body of the cow, climbed down, and kindled the fire with wood chips. But Rabbi Akiva said that he kindled the fire with dry branches of palm trees. When the cow's carcass burst in the fire, the priest took up a position outside the pit, took hold of the cedar wood, <b>hyssop,</b> and scarlet wool, and said to the observers: [...] "Is this cedar wood? Is this <b>hyssop?</b> Is this scarlet wool?" [...] He repeated each question three times, and the observers answered [...] "Yes" [...] three times to each question. The priest then wrapped the cedar wood, <b>hyssop,</b> and scarlet wool together with the ends of the wool and cast them into the burning pyre. When the fire burned out, they beat the ashes with rods and then sifted them with sieves. They then divided the ashes into three parts: One part was deposited on the rampart, one on the Mount of Olives, and one was divided among the courses of priests who performed the Temple services in turn.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{adopting}} sweeping EU {{food and}} beverage regulations in 1988 that effectively re-legalised absinthe, a decree was passed that same year that preserved the prohibition on products explicitly labelled as [...] "absinthe", while placing strict limits on fenchone (fennel) and pinocamphone (<b>hyssop)</b> in an obvious, but failed, attempt to thwart a possible return of absinthe-like products.

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses the ritual for {{cleansing}} {{one with a}} skin disease.

2500|$|Rabbi Isaac noted two red threads, one in {{connection}} with the Red Cow in [...] and the other {{in connection}} with the scapegoat in the Yom Kippur service of [...] (which [...] indicates was marked with a red thread). Rabbi Isaac had heard that one required a definite size, while the other did not, but he did not know which was which. Rav Joseph reasoned that because (as [...] explains) the red thread of the scapegoat was divided, that thread required a definite size, whereas that of the Red Cow, which {{did not need to be}} divided, did not require a definite size. Rami bar Hama objected that the thread of the Red Cow required a certain weight (to be cast into the flames, as described in [...] ). Rava said that the matter of this weight was disputed by Tannaim (as explained below). Abaye objected (based on [...] ) that they wrapped the red thread together with the cedar wood and <b>hyssop.</b> Rav Hanin said in the name of Rav that if the cedar wood and the red thread were merely caught by the flame, they were used validly. They objected to Rav Hanin based on a Baraita which taught that if the thread caught fire in midair, they brought another thread to prepare the water of lustration. Abaye reconciled the two opinions by interpreting the Baraita to speak of a flame that blazed high above the cow, and interpreting Rav Hanin to speak of a subdued flame that consumed the thread near the burning cow. Rava explained the dispute among Tannaim about the weight of the red thread {{in connection with}} the Red Cow. [...] Rabbi taught that they wrapped the cedar wood and <b>hyssop</b> together with the red thread so that they formed one bunch. Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Simeon said that they wrapped them together so that they had sufficient weight to fall into the midst of the burning cow.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), {{a person who}} was clean was to add fresh water to ashes of the Red Cow, dip <b>hyssop</b> it in the water, and {{sprinkle}} the water on the tent, the vessels, and people who had become unclean. The person who sprinkled the water was then to wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be clean at nightfall. Anyone who became unclean and failed to cleanse himself was to be cut off from the congregation. The person who sprinkled the water of lustration was to wash his clothes, and whoever touched the water of lustration, whatever he touched, and whoever touched him were to be unclean until evening. The Israelites arrived at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, and Miriam died and was buried there. The people were without water, and they complained against Moses and Aaron. Moses and Aaron fell on their faces at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and the Presence of God appeared to them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the Passover festival antedate the Exodus. The Passover ritual, prior to Deuteronomy, is widely thought to have its origins in an apotropaic rite, {{unrelated}} to the Exodus, to ensure the protection of a family home, a rite conducted wholly within a clan. <b>Hyssop</b> was employed to daub the blood of a slaughtered sheep on the lintels and door posts to ensure that demonic forces could not enter the home. A further hypothesis maintains that, once the Priestly Code was promulgated, the exodus narrative took on a central function, as the apotropaic rite was, arguably, amalgamated with the Canaanite agricultural festival of spring which was a ceremony of Unleavened Bread, connected with the barley harvest. As the Exodus motif grew, the original function and symbolism of these double origins was lost. Several motifs replicate the features associated with the Mesopotamian Akitu festival. [...] Other scholars, John Van Seters, J.B.Segal and Tamara Prosic disagree with the merged two-festivals hypothesis.|$|E

If, after seven days, the plague had spread, the priest was to order the stones with the plague to be pulled out and cast outside the city. The house was then to be scraped, the stones replaced, and the house replastered. If the plague again broke out, the house was to be torn down. If the plague did not break out again, the priest was to pronounce the house clean.
