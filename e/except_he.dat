25|$|Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) {{sources are}} used {{primarily}} for cation {{analysis of a}} wide array of sample types. In this source, a plasma that is electrically neutral overall, but that has had a substantial fraction of its atoms ionized by high temperature, is used to atomize introduced sample molecules and to further strip the outer electrons from those atoms. The plasma is usually generated from argon gas, since the first ionization energy of argon atoms is higher than the first of any other elements <b>except</b> <b>He,</b> O, F and Ne, but lower than the second ionization energy of all except the most electropositive metals. The heating is achieved by a radio-frequency current passed through a coil surrounding the plasma.|$|E

25|$|The {{expression}} of intent {{of a person}} who has no capacity to make juridical acts is void. An expression is also void which is made by a person who, though not without capacity to make juridical acts, in a condition of unconsciousness or mental disorder.

Aubrey slashed Peckinpah's budget early in production, refusing {{to allow him to}} reshoot crucial footage, pushing back the release date to Memorial Day, and editing out nearly 20 minutes of the film.

2500|$|Blacks in the South were a core {{element of}} the Republican Party and their ministers had {{powerful}} political roles that were distinctive since they did not depend on white support, in contrast to teachers, politicians, businessmen, and tenant farmers. Acting on the principle as stated by Charles H. Pearce, an AME minister in Florida: [...] "A man in this State cannot do his whole duty as a minister <b>except</b> <b>he</b> looks out for the political interests of his people," [...] over 100 black ministers were elected to state legislatures during Reconstruction, {{as well as several}} to Congress and one, Hiram Revels, to the U.S. Senate.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{forbidden}} {{to celebrate the}} full Divine Liturgy on weekdays during Great Lent.

[...] On the previous Sunday, during the Divine Liturgy the priest will have consecrated an extra Lamb for each Presanctified Liturgy that will be served in the coming week. [...] He then moistens the extra Lambs with the Blood of Christ, just as he did for the Communion of the sick, <b>except</b> <b>he</b> does not cut the Lambs into small pieces.

2500|$|Campese was {{involved}} in the biggest controversy of the World Cup Final in the 69th minute. English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. Moore was reported after the Test to have said, [...] " [...] sets himself up as the saviour of rugby. Yet {{when it comes down to}} it he's as cynical as anyone. I wouldn't criticise Campese <b>except</b> <b>he</b> called me mad as a hatter earlier this week." [...] Moore writes in Beware of the Dog: Rugby's Hard Man Reveals All that, ‘I have no issue with what Campese did; I would have done the same, and he got away with it. The point I make about what he did is that, as he has been shown to be as cynical as the rest of us, I don’t now want to hear lectures from him about the spirit of the game.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, sportswriter Joe Posnanski, {{writing for}} Sports Illustrated, named Paige as the hardest thrower {{in the history}} of baseball. He based this, in part, on the fact that: [...] "Joe DiMaggio would say that Paige was the best he ever faced. Bob Feller would say that Paige was the best he ever saw. Hack Wilson would say that the ball looked like a marble when it crossed the plate. Dizzy Dean would say that Paige's fastball made his own look like a changeup." [...] Posnanski further noted that: for most of his career Satchel Paige threw nothing but fastballs. Nothing. Oh, he named them {{different}} names—Bat Dodger, Midnight Rider, Midnight Creeper, Jump Ball, Trouble Ball—but essentially they were all fastballs. And he was still unhittable {{for the better part of}} 15 years. One pitch. It's a lot like Mariano Rivera, <b>except</b> <b>he</b> wasn't doing it for one inning at a time. He was pitching complete games day after day. That had to be some kind of incredible fastball.... perhaps the most precise pitcher in baseball history—he threw ludicrously hard. And he also threw hundreds and hundreds of innings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for Sight & Sound magazine, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, [...] "Perhaps {{the major problem}} is that despite Cage and Dern's best efforts, Lynch is {{ultimately}} interested only in iconography, not characters at all. When it comes to images of evil, corruption, derangement, raw passion and mutilation (roughly in that order), Wild at Heart is a veritable cornucopia". Richard Combs in his review for Time wrote, [...] "The result is a pile-up, of innocence, of evil, even of actual road accidents, without a context to give significance to the casualties or survivors". Christopher Sharrett in Cineaste magazine wrote, [...] "Lynch's characters are now so cartoony one is prone to address him more as a theorist than director, <b>except</b> <b>he</b> is not that challenging ... One is never sure what Lynch likes or dislikes, and his often striking images are too often lacking in compassion for us to accept him as a chronicler of a moribund landscape a la Fellini". However, Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "Starting with the outrageous and building from there, he ignites a slight love-on-the-run novel, creating a bonfire of a movie that confirms his reputation as the most exciting and innovative filmmaker of his generation".|$|E
