40|$|<b>De</b> <b>facto</b> states, {{defined as}} {{entities}} that possess {{control over a}} defined territory, population, and government, but without recognition from other states, have become increasingly important {{over the past three}} decades. Although the universe of cases is small (there have been 24 <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states since the 1960 s), <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states {{play an important role in}} regional security and stability. Despite this relevance, we still know little about why <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states emerge, how their preferences are formed, and what shapes their behaviour and decision-making. Shedding light on these overlooked issues will allow us to better understand the role of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states in regional and international politics. The existing literature, although insightful, does not fully explain the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. In particular, the literature has fallen short in explaining the behaviour of Iraqi Kurdistan. In order to better understand the behaviour of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states, this thesis asks the following questions: what are the factors that shape and influence <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state preferences and behaviour? What are the factors that determine if a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state will declare independence or preserve the status quo? More specifically, in terms of the cases under examination, why did Kosovo and South Sudan declare independence, while Iraqi Kurdistan has not? The goal of this dissertation is to identify the conditions under which a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state may declare independence and when it may preserve the status quo. To address these questions, this thesis employs international relations theories and adopts a comparative analysis method to the behaviour of Kosovo, South Sudan, and Iraqi Kurdistan. Following extensive fieldwork in Iraqi Kurdistan, the thesis argues that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states will forgo independence when the parent state furnishes the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state with autonomy and offers sufficient economic incentives. Other mitigating factors include the domestic environment of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state and the parent state, the role of regional and international governments, and the presence or absence of the old regime of the parent state. The main point is that the preference for independence is neither fixed nor inevitable...|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{the concept of}} <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> (by fact) statelessness, often conceptualised as ineffective citizenship, from being included within the statelessness discourse.

By drawing upon the example of the stateless Estonians of Russian origin, the dangers of not recognising the centrality of the legal bond of citizenship, seen in attempts to incorporate <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statelessness into the statelessness debate, are reflected upon. <b>De</b> <b>facto</b> 'statelessness' is shown not only to underutilise the plethora of human rights conventions available, but also to threaten the statelessness conventions themselves...|$|R

The {{end of the}} Cold War {{has given}} rise to the number of non-state political actors such as <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states. While scholarly attention has been given to the concept of sovereignty and to empirical analyses of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statehood, <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states as influential non-state political actors remained theoretically under-studied. This dissertation tackles the research question of how an issue that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states causes affects the likelihood of conflict between a parent and an external state. I examine the “opportunity and willingness” pre-theoretical framework of Most and Starr (1989) in order to comprehend how <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states cause inter-state military conflict. I argue that the process of fighting for <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> statehood and the outcome of becoming a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> state both create opportunity for the parent and external states. Moreover, internal dynamics in a state are important to understand whether the states are willing to exploit the interaction opportunity <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states generate. I especially examine regime type and levels of democracy in parent, external and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> states and argue that when these are all democracies, v likelihood of militarized disputes decrease. Using the comparative method and most similar systems design, I analyze two cases: Kurdistan Regional Government, Iraq, Turkey and South Ossetia, Georgia, Russia. Both cases support the arguments of the dissertation. I conclude with a brief summary and implications of the findings for future scholarship. Özpek, Burak BilgehanPh. D...|$|R
