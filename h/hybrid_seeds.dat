40|$|In 1957, 1567 {{acres of}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>seed</b> corn were {{approved}} for certification. This was the smallest annual number of acres reported {{during the period}} 1948 through 1957. Two of the factors responsible for this decline were:(1) intensive price competition between certified grower-sellers had resulted in low prices and elimination of many certified growers, and (2) most of the certified grower-sellers had very small seed volumes and could not finance adequate advertising and sales promotion programs. The marketing problems of certified growers were discussed during {{the annual meeting of}} Nebraska Certified <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Seed</b> Corn Producers Association in March 1958 and in June 1958 the Nebraska <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Seed</b> Growers Association was formed and incorporated as a marketing cooperative of certified growers. The objectives of this study are: To describe the marketing system of <b>hybrid</b> <b>seed</b> corn in Nebraska, including the channels of distribution for certified <b>hybrid</b> <b>seed</b> corn and commercial <b>hybrid</b> <b>seed</b> corn, and the importance of the various distributors. To describe the <b>hybrid</b> <b>seed</b> corn market in Nebraska with respect to: its structure, supply and demand, production, processing, and marketing cots, average seed prices, and marketing margins. To evaluate the success of the Nebraska <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Seed</b> Growers Association in resolving the marketing problem of certified <b>hybrid</b> <b>seed</b> corn growers. Certified growers have been doing an excellent job of producing and processing <b>hybrid</b> <b>seed</b> corn. Although the quality of the certified growers’ processing operations is high, costs could be reduced by hiring custom operators to perform these operations. In addition, marketing operations of some of the certified grower-sellers have not been too effective. From the limited marketing information obtained in the survey of certified growers, there were indications that small volume (200 to 1000 bushels) certified grower-sellers still have marketing problems which were prevalent in 1957. Larger volume certified grower-sellers apparently have solved some of their marketing problems, and have been more effective than small volume certified grower-sellers in marketing their <b>seed.</b> The Nebraska <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Seed</b> Growers Association, established in 1958 to market <b>hybrid</b> <b>seed</b> corn for its certified grower-members, has encountered and apparently solved some of the marketing problems. However, other marketing problems remain for future solution. Since the Association has been in operation only two years, its success in resolving the marketing problems of certified grower-members cannot be substantiated at this time. Advisor: C. J.

2500|$|By {{the time}} {{scientific}} assessment of conduciveness to grow corn in the United States was undertaken by Meriwether Lewis in 1804, the immigrant settlers had already spread its growth {{in many parts}} of the country due to its suitability to grow in varying climatic and soil conditions. Once the suitability of land in the central part of the country, the Midwestern United States, was scientifically established as fertile and rich by [...] Lewis and Clark, the settlers moved to the area in large numbers and started growing corn in a big way, reaping large benefits. Over the centuries, the crop varieties underwent changes to get better yields while farming methods were improved. As a result, the fertile belt soon came to be known as [...] "the Corn Belt". Hybrid cropping techniques were widely practiced from the late 1880s, and the hybrid varieties developed with cross and re-cross breeding techniques developed by university research. This ushered a new age of agriculture. The 1% area devoted to hybrid varieties in 1934 rose to 78% in the 1940s and continued to rise thereafter. In the 1950s, Henry A. Wallace, former Vice President and former Secretary of Agriculture, and an early developer of <b>hybrid</b> <b>seeds,</b> observed that [...] "the Corn Belt had developed into the most productive agricultural civilization the world has ever seen."

[...] Wallace, by his own account, learned about this institution by reading a Columbia University doctoral dissertation by an ardent Confucian propagandist, Chen Huan-chang. [...] Arthur M.

Farmers had been devastated by depression. H.A.'s ambition was to restore the farmers' position in the national economy. He sought to give them the same opportunity to improve income by controlling output that business corporations already possessed. In time he widened his concern beyond commercial farming to subsistence farming and rural poverty. For the urban poor, he provided food stamps and school lunches.

The project introduced 25 new HYV with improved grain quality from IRRI in the Philippines and China for preliminary tests at the Viet Nam Agricultural Science Institute.
