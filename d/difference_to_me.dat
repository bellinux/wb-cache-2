It really doesn't make a <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E

2500|$|The Israeli Forum for the Promotion of Equal Share in the Burden {{threatened}} {{to boycott the}} fashion chain Fox if they hired Refaeli. The two sides reached a compromise in which Refaeli agreed to visit injured IDF soldiers whenever she is in Israel, and actively encourage enlistment in the army. Refaeli later said, [...] "I don't regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That's {{just the way it}} is: celebrities have other needs. I hope my case has influenced the army." [...] She also said: [...] "Israel or Uganda, what difference does it make? It makes no <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Why is it good to die for our country? What, isn't it better to live in New York? Why should 18-year-old kids have to die? It's dumb that people have to die so that I can live in Israel." ...|$|E

60|$|Jodd {{struck a}} bell, once only, {{which was the}} signal for the messenger. He came and {{received}} his orders. Then followed a pause, since Heliodore and Martina were in a place close by and must be sent for. During this time Irene began <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> of sundry general matters. She compared the view that might be seen from this house in Lesbos to that from the terrace of her palace on the Bosphorus, and described its <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> She asked <b>me</b> as <b>to</b> the Caliph Harun-al-Rashid, whom she understood I had seen, inquiring as to the estimate I had formed of his character. Lastly, with a laugh, she dwelt upon the strange vicissitudes of life.|$|R
2500|$|Their {{second album}} {{entitled}} The Truth {{was released on}} May 13, 2008. In a promotional interview, member Fallon said of the album, [...] "The biggest <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{is the fact that}} you grow artistically whenever you're being creative and we've been creative {{for the past couple of}} years. Our artistry has grown. When we wrote The Truth, we named the album The Truth because basically every song on the album is from personal experiences and we wanted to get personal with our fans. We want everybody to know that they're not alone going through these things and we're here." [...] The album was released in the UK on May 12, while the Japanese release is on May 14 and featured two bonus tracks, [...] "Do It to It" [...] (Rap Remix) and [...] "Silly". In the US, the album only sold 13,000 copies in the first week of release, which led to it debuting at number 40 on the Billboard 200. In Japan, the album debuted at number 98 on the official album chart, and has sold only 2,300 copies in that country to date. As of 2011, the album has sold only 30,000 copies in the United States. A second single from the album was released, titled [...] "Amnesia". The single failed to make an impact, however, missing the Billboard Hot 100 entirely. It did peak at number 61 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart, though.|$|E

30|$|Summarizing, the {{refinancing}} {{sequence of}} the firm’s debt {{is a major factor}} influencing the tax shield value. Depending on the firm’s actual choice of k, using the ME or MM financing policy may result in significant deviations from the levered firm value that matches the actual refinancing {{sequence of the}} debt issue. While for shorter maturities, the <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ME</b> case could be regarded as relatively small, an application of the MM policy would result in a significant overvaluation of the tax savings of debt.|$|R

60|$|For the Scripture {{asserts that}} those who wrote it were moved by the Spirit of God; {{that it is a}} record of God's {{dealings}} with men, which certain men were inspired to perceive and to write down: whereas the tendency of modern criticism is, without doubt, to assert that Scripture is inspired by the spirit of man; that it contains the thoughts and discoveries of men concerning God, which they wrote down without the inspiration of God; which <b>difference</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> (and I hope to others) utterly infinite and incalculable, and to involve the question of the whole character, honour, and glory of God.|$|R

I would describe the goddess, Venus as the best form. I have drawn an anatomy character {{and it was an}} accident that I drew both gonads.

500|$|The police gave Brown £5,000 in 1993 and an {{additional}} £590 in January 2011 toward his rent; they also paid for credits for his mobile phone {{so that they could}} reach him, and paid to have his car put through an MOT test (an annual roadworthiness test). The court heard that Brown had also been also [...] "made aware" [...] by police that the Sun newspaper had offered a £100,000 reward.

5000|$|Question: Do {{you believe}} that the public will {{formulate}} the same idea about that person's involvement in criminal activity upon hearing the term [...] "person of interest"? Is this just a euphemism, just another way of saying [...] "suspect"?Jewell: I'd say so. The public knows what's going on. Because of what happened <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> things have changed. It has definitely changed the way the media in Atlanta refer to people that are arrested or are suspects. And I've seen it on some of the national channels like Fox News, NBC and CNN. They've all changed. Go back before 1996, at a shooting or a murder and see how they refer to the person whom they're arresting in the incident. Compare that with something that's recent and look at the <b>difference.</b> What happened <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is a factor in that change.|$|R

5000|$|..... was {{undertaken}} {{at a time}} when I was saddled with a huge debt, at the age of 26, for a splendid house that I had bought. There would have been no way to pay the house off by writing science fiction in that long-ago era, when $2500 was a lot to earn from a novel that might take months to write, so I turned out a slew of quick sex novels. I never concealed the fact that I was doing them; it made no <b>difference</b> at all <b>to</b> <b>me</b> whether people knew or not. It was just a job. And it was, incidentally, a job that I did very well. I think they were outstanding erotic novels.|$|R
60|$|So {{much for}} why I am an anti-vivisectionist; and I {{should like to}} say, in conclusion, that all other anti-vivisectionists of my {{acquaintance}} weaken their case infinitely by forming this attack on a scientific speciality in which the human heart is commonly on their side, with attacks upon universal human customs in which the human heart {{is not at all}} on their side. I have heard humanitarians, for instance, speak of vivisection and field sports {{as if they were the}} same kind of thing. The <b>difference</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> simple and enormous. In sport a man goes into a wood and mixes with the existing life of that wood; becomes a destroyer only in the simple and healthy sense in which all the creatures are destroyers; becomes for one moment to them what they are to him--another animal. In vivisection a man takes a simpler creature and subjects it to subtleties which no one but man could inflict on him, and for which man is therefore gravely and terribly responsible.|$|R
