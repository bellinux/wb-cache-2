25|$|The bullet time {{effect is}} similar but {{slightly}} more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so {{that rather than}} appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion. The cameras' positions and exposures were previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect. When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a <b>frame</b> <b>frequency</b> of 12,000 per second, {{as opposed to the}} normal 24 frames per second of film. Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side. To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.|$|E

40|$|Evidence for {{two types}} of {{relatively}} large amplitude MHD waves upstream and downstream of quasi-parallel forward and reverse interplanetary shocks is presented. The first mode is an Alfven wave with frequencies (in the spacecraft frame) {{in the range of}} 0. 025 to 0. 07 Hz.

The second is a fast MHD mode with frequencies in the range of 0. 025 to 0. 17 Hz, right-hand polarization and propagating along the magnetic field. These waves are detected principally in association with quasi-parallel shock.
