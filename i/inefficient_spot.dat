40|$|This paper studies how the {{possibility}} to acquire information before signing a long-term contract in a typical hold-up problem can affect {{the terms of the}} contract and the efficiency in relationship-specific investments. We consider a situation in which, after being offered a long-term contract, the seller can incur a cost to acquire information about the future state of nature. Conditions are identified under which, when contracts have to be simple, the ability of the seller to acquire information may lead to the use of <b>inefficient</b> <b>spot</b> contracts and result in under-investment. In contrast to several recent papers, the result restores hold-ups as a serious problem in inter-firm relationships. It also gives an explanation for why we see a shortage of beneficial long-term contracts in the real world...|$|E
40|$|A rich {{literature}} {{argues that}} interorganizational networks foster learning and coordinated adaptation among their constituents, but embedded ties between organizations are not ubiquitous. What explains this heterogeneity? Acknowledging {{the influence of}} agency relationships within organizations can help refine the scope of embeddedness arguments. This idea is explored in an in-depth qualitative examination of sourcing practices in drug development. The outsourcing of central laboratory services is characterized by repeated interactions, relationship-specific investments, and fine-grained information transfer between buyers and suppliers. In contrast, embedded relationships with contract research organizations have failed to materialize, despite the repeated efforts of exchange partners. Drawing on fieldwork conducted at six pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, I explain why outsourcing deals {{take the form of}} embedded relationships in the first setting, and of seemingly <b>inefficient</b> <b>spot</b> contracts in the second setting. The evidence suggests that the structure of constituent firms ’ internal labor markets powerfully shapes and constrains the scope of interorganizational networks...|$|E
5|$|As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light {{features}} {{a variety of}} firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player uses in combat. The game's protagonist, Artyom, also {{has the ability to}} kill an enemy directly with his melee weapon. Artyom has three weapons slots. Players can put any weapon into these slots without restriction. Players have access to four different secondary weapons, including throwing knives, claymores, incendiary grenades, and hand grenades. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack the player in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to the player. The player can knock out or kill most human enemies instead of shooting them, using stealth to avoid detection. As enemies are <b>inefficient</b> in <b>spotting</b> the player character in darkness, players can turn off oil lamps and light bulbs to gain an advantage over their opponents.|$|R
40|$|Tag {{scanning}} is {{an important}} issue to dynamically manage tag IDs in radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. Different from tag identification that collects IDs of all the tags, tag scanning first verifies whether or not a responding tag has already been identified and retrieves its ID when the answer is yes, and collects the tag's ID only when it is unidentified. In this paper, we present the first study on spot scanning with a handheld reader, which aims to scan tags in the reader's interrogation range at an arbitrarily specified position in the system. Existing studies mainly focus on continuous scanning, and they are highly time <b>inefficient</b> in performing <b>spot</b> scanning. The inefficiency stems from the small overlap between tag populations in different spot scanning operations, in which case existing solutions cannot efficiently recognize unidentified tags. We develop a novel technique called LOCK to efficiently recognize unidentified tags even when the overlapped tags are few. LOCK does not simply use a tag's reply slot index but also compact short responses from tags to efficiently distinguish unidentified tags from identified ones. The valuable compact short responses are firstly investigated, which are the keys for efficient tag identification in the paper. Based on LOCK, three tag scanning protocols are proposed to solve the spot scanning problem. Simulation results show that, for spot scanning, our best protocol reduces per tag scanning time by up to 70 percent when compared with the state-of-the-art solution. Moreover, the proposed protocols can also be employed to perform continuous scanning with better time efficiency than the best existing solutions. Department of Computin...|$|R
30|$|CoCrMo alloys are {{contraindicated}} for allergy sufferers. For these patients, uncemented and cemented prostheses made of {{titanium alloy}} are indicated. Knee prostheses machined from that alloy, however, may have poor tribological behavior. Therefore, for allergy sufferers, knee replacements {{in form of}} cemented high-strength oxide ceramic prostheses which reveal excellent tribological behavior are suitable. In addition, the rate of particle induced aseptic loosening may be reduced. For adhesion of bone cement, the smooth ceramic surface, however, exposes <b>inefficient</b> mechanical retention <b>spots</b> as compared with a textured metal surface. Undercuts generated by corundum blasting, which in the short and intermediate term are highly efficient on a CoCrMo surface, are not appropriate on a ceramic surface due to the brittleness of ceramics. The corresponding textures may initiate cracks which will weaken {{the strength of a}} ceramic prosthesis. Due to the lack of textures, mechanical retention is poor or even not existent. Micromotions are facilitated and early aseptic loosening is predictable. Instead silicoating of the ceramic surface will allow specific adhesion and result in better hydrolytic stability of bonding, thereby preventing early aseptic loosening. Silicoating, however, presupposes a clean and chemically active surface which may be achieved by atmospheric plasma or thermal surface treatment. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} silicoating, the bond strengths of atmospheric plasma versus thermal surface treated and silicoated ZPTA (zirconia platelets toughened alumina) surfaces were compared with “as-fired” surfaces by utilizing TiAlV probes (diameter: 6 mm) for traction–adhesive strength test. After preparing samples for traction–adhesive strength test (sequence: ceramic substrate, silicate layer and penetrated silane, protective lacquer (PolyMA), bone cement, TiAlV probe), they were aged up to 150 days at 37 °C in Ringer’s solution. The bond strengths observed for all aging intervals were well above 20 MPa and much higher and more hydrolytic stable for silicoated compared with with “as-fired” ZPTA samples. Silicoating may be effective for achieving high initial bond strength of bone cement on surfaces of oxide ceramics and is also suitable to stabilize bond strengths in the long term under hydrolytic conditions as present in the human body. Activation by atmospheric plasma or thermal surface treatment seems to be effective prior to silicoating. Due to the proposed silicate layer migration, micromotions and debonding should be widely reduced or even eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Irrigation is the {{application}} of water to soil {{for the purpose of}} supplying moisture necessary for the growth of a crop. Irrigation has been practiced since the beginning of civilization and its importance in the present world is well recognized as a means of developing a profitable agriculture. The rapid growth in the world population and the consequent need for additional food supplies are making irrigation absolutely necessary in the world today. In surface irrigation by flooding, two general methods are used; uncontrolled flooding or controlled flooding. In irrigating by uncontrolled flooding, or wild flooding, water is applied to an area which has undergone no prior land preparation. In most cases, this unsystematic method produces <b>inefficient</b> irrigation. Low <b>spots</b> in the field are over-irrigated whereas high areas are under-irrigated. In the controlled flooding method, predetermined rates and quantities of water are applied to areas which have been prepared for irrigation. This method of irrigation includes border dyke, border ditch, and border check systems. For proper design of these systems, the size of stream is balanced against the intake rate of the soil, the total depth of water to be stored in the root zone, and the area to be covered by the stream. With the completion of the South Saskatchewan Dam, it is expected that the irrigated acreage of the province will increase substantially. Further, it is expected that most of the new area coming under irrigation will be irrigated by some surface irrigation method. One of the most common and diversified of the surface irrigation methods, which is adaptable to both close growing and row crops, is the border dyke or border strip method. In this method, water is introduced to land which is bounded by low, flat levees or dykes which extend {{in the direction of the}} steepest slope. The present procedures used in design of border dyke systems 2. are empirical. The experimental data reported in the literature were obtained from systems whose soils, topography and other conditions differ widely from those which will be encountered in the South Saskatchewan River Development Project. Thus, it is questionable whether these data can be applied directly to the design of systems in Saskatchewan. There is a great need for experimental data from systems installed on areas which are similar to those that will be encountered under the proposed project. The study reported in this thesis was undertaken in an attempt to satisfy some of these needs. Experimental data collected from existing border dyke systems located in Saskatchewan are presented. In addition, a rational approach for evaluating several factors affecting the design of these systems for example, soil intake rate, is given...|$|R
