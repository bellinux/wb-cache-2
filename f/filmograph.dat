40|$|A partir de uma análise estético-política do filme Solaris, e de uma investigação sobre a vida pessoal e artística de Andrei Tarkovsky, dentro de um contexto histórico-político situado na União Soviética dos anos 1960 até a década de 1990, propõe-se, nesta pesquisa, destacar o embate entre esse artista e o Estado soviético, com o objetivo de demonstrar uma presença política da obra de Tarkovsky. Os escritos do próprio Tarkovsky, os conceitos filosóficos e estéticos de Gilles Deleuze, as noções políticas de presença política da obra e estetização da política, trazidas pelo Prof. Miguel Chaia, dão embasamento para a fundamentação deste trabalho, possibilitando: uma discussão sobre as concepções de arte e cinema do artista Tarkovsky; um recorte analítico do filme Solaris, mostrando as questões estéticas, políticas, históricas envolvidas na obra; um {{panorama}} da indústria cinematográfica soviética, problematizando a relação entre o artista Tarkovsky e a burocracia autoritária do Estado soviético, assim como os efeitos disso enquanto ato político de resistência por parte do cineasta através de sua filmografiaBased on an esthetical-political {{analysis of}} the film Solaris, and an investigation on the personal and artistic life of Andrei Tarkovsky, within a historical and political context situated in the Soviet Union from the 1960 s through the 1990 s, it s proposed in this research to emphasize the shock between this artist and the Soviet State, with the purpose to demonstrate a political presence in Tarkovsky s work.

Para isso, toma como fontes documentais tanto objetos fílmicos remanescentes quanto documentação e bibliografia diversas existentes sobre o assunto. Um primeiro capítulo será dedicado aos processos de colorização existentes no cinema silencioso, de uma forma geral, e a questões técnicas e estéticas relacionadas a esses processos: o contexto histórico em que surgiram as técnicas de colorização no cinema, suas origens em meios diversos, as características dessas técnicas de colorização e sua presença nos mercados cinematográficos mais conhecidos, as questões suscitadas pelo uso da cor e seus desdobramentos. No segundo capítulo, tentaremos mapear nossa prática e nossas discussões acerca da cor nos filmes do período silencioso: quais são as informações acerca das técnicas que utilizamos e da real presença de filmes coloridos em nossas sessões cinematográficas e da cor nos filmes que estávamos produzindo? Como as questões colocadas internacionalmente ecoaram no Brasil e quais foram as questões específicas que surgiram aqui? No último capítulo, trataremos mais especificamente da análise de filmes de nossa filmografia, ou seja, dos materiais em nitrato de época colorizados ainda existentes e inspecionados para esta pesquisa.
