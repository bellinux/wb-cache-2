5000|$|The {{most common}} way of engine rating {{is what is}} known as the brake power, {{measured}} at the flywheel, and given in kilowatts (metric) or horsepower (Imperial/USA). This is the actual mechanical power output of the engine in a usable and complete form. The term [...] "brake" [...] comes from the use of a brake in a <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> to load the engine. For accuracy, it is important to understand what is meant by usable and complete. For example, for a car engine, apart from friction and thermodynamic losses inside the engine, power is absorbed by the water pump, alternator, and radiator fan, thus reducing the power available at the flywheel to move the car along. Power is also absorbed by the power steering pump and air conditioner (if fitted), but these are not installed for a power output test or calculation. Power output varies slightly according to the energy value of the fuel, the ambient air temperature and humidity, and the altitude. Therefore, there are agreed standards in the USA and Europe on the fuel to use when testing, and engines are rated at 25 ⁰C (Europe), and 64 ⁰F (USA) at sea level, 50% humidity. Marine engines, as supplied, usually have no radiator fan, and often no alternator. In such cases the quoted power rating does not allow for losses in the radiator fan and alternator. The SAE in USA, and the ISO in Europe publish standards on exact procedures, and how to apply corrections for deviating conditions like high altitude.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cars were}} rated very {{conservatively}} at [...] and 450 lbft Nm of torque. Actual output was well over [...] Some people have claimed it to produce 600 or more horsepower, citing extensive testing {{to prove the}} results, though nothing has been actually proven. However, {{it is very easy}} to coax such power out of the semi-hemi engine due to it being factory de-tuned for street-ability purposes. These horsepower claims have been proven from many <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> results over the years with factory stock engines; some rebuilt to factory specs, and others pulled directly from the cars themselves immediately after purchase, though specific output tends to vary per engine due to testing parameters. The 429 Drag Pack option from Ford at the time (which was a normal 429 SCJ and not the Boss version which made more power) had , which was quite impressive for the time, however {{it should be noted that}} these ratings were strictly engine crank horsepower, and not actual wheel horsepower figures. The manufacturers and dealers only listed [...] because of legal issues and rising insurance costs so customers would be lured into buying these cars without the stiff fees from an insurance company, though no manufacturer has ever stated this to be true, assumingly so to prevent possible lawsuits. Despite the high horsepower and torque ratings, the car was at home in the high RPM range (the engine is said to be able to rev up to 9,000rpm for extended periods of time, which is impressive given the engines massive 7.0L displacement, though were factory limited to 6,200rpm for insurance purposes [...] ), and suffered a (poor by today's standards) 0-60 time because of this. However, it quickly made up for that once it got moving. The car unrestricted is said to be able to exceed speeds of up to 175mph, [...] though no actual claim has been proven due to the rarity, value and collectibility of the car, making anyone who owns one reluctant to try it.|$|E
