Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E

5|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss.

This interdisciplinary field <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known as science and technology studies.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as it <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck {{at the rate of}} a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed to what <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{known as the}} High Victorian style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, {{and the use of}} polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E
5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative {{style that}} draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter. However, over time, the novel <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{considered one of the}} most important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E

After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known as the Shield nickel.|$|E
