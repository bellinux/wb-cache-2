5000|$|The {{introduction}} of inflationary expectations {{into the equation}} implies that actual inflation can feed back into inflationary expectations and thus cause further inflation. The late economist James Tobin dubbed the last term [...] "inflationary inertia," [...] because in the current period, inflation exists which represents an <b>inflationary</b> <b>impulse</b> {{left over from the}} past.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{inflation}} {{had been much}} higher than in previous decades, getting above 6% briefly in 1970 and persisting above 4% in 1971. U.S. President Richard Nixon imposed price controls on August 15, 1971. This was a move widely applauded by the public {{and a number of}} Keynesian economists. [...] The 90-day freeze was unprecedented in peacetime, but such drastic measures were thought necessary. Also motivating the controls, on the same date that the controls were imposed, 15 August 1971, Nixon also suspended the convertibility of the dollar into gold, which {{was the beginning of the}} end of the Bretton Woods system of international currency management established after World War II. It was quite well known at the time that this would likely lead to an immediate <b>inflationary</b> <b>impulse</b> (essentially because the subsequent depreciation of the dollar would boost the demand for exports and increase the cost of imports). The controls aimed to stop that impulse. The fact that the election of 1972 was on the horizon likely contributed to both Nixon's application of controls and his ending of the convertibility of the dollar.|$|E
40|$|An {{inflation}} target {{can serve}} as a nominal anchor, aiming at coordinating in-flation expectations. As a nominal anchor, an inflation target also provides a commitment mechanism that increases the accountability of the monetary policy authority. The inflation target communicates to the public the inflation rate at which the central bank will aim in the future. It thus serves as a refer-ence point against which the central bank can be judged. In January 1993 the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, specified that the objective of monetary policy would henceforth be to limit the annual in-crease in the headline consumer price index (CPI) in 1995 and beyond to 2 per-cent, with a tolerance of plus or minus 1 percentage point. This objective corre-sponded to the so-called underlying rate of inflation when the target was announced. In 1993 and in 1994 as well, monetary policy aimed at preventing the <b>inflationary</b> <b>impulse</b> (which was deemed unavoidable) due to a large deprecia-tion of the krona and changes in indirect taxes from causing a persistent increase in the underlying rate of inflation. The experience of the first years of inflation targeting in connection with the most recent amendments to the 1988 Riksbank Act, which came into force on January 1, 1999, and prescribe an explicit objective for monetary policy, gave reasons to clarify the formulation of monetary policy. Maintaining Price Stability The principles on which monetary policy decisions in Sweden are based can be formulated as a simple rule of thumb. 2 If the inflation forecast, based on a...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid 1990 s {{competition}} policies within developing economies {{have become}} increasingly evident. Competition policies are hailed as the means of enabling a competitive environment and an improved welfare position. The extent to which this holds true for African economies is assessed using regression analysis. The results suggest that competition policy does indeed reduce <b>inflationary</b> <b>impulses,</b> however policy is ineffective in economies that have a poor record of governance. The comparatively high incidence of corruption within African economies makes competition policy an ineffective instrument. Public policy would therefore be better directed at bringing about improved governance prior {{to the implementation of}} any welfare-intending public policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{objective of the}} work concerns the analysis of long-term trends in the differences in price levels between provincial capitals in Italy. The aim is deliberately limited to defining their character, {{as well as to}} analysing the pattern of spread and transmission between the different Italian regions in the inflationary process. The author discusses the dispersion between the various cities in the annual rate of inflation. Then {{the extent to which the}} relative prices (compared to the national average) of each city are stable in the long run is verified. After aggregating economically significant individual cities into macro-regions, the major trends in the cost of living differentials are summarised. Finally, the results of an econometric exercise are presented in which the transmission of <b>inflationary</b> <b>impulses,</b> among macro-regions, is considered.     JEL Codes: E 31, O 52  </p...|$|R
40|$|Two propositions are discussed, {{the first}} to be {{attributed}} to the monetarists ("the variations of the monetary base determine those of prices"), the second to certain Keynesian economists ("the variations of prices ultimately depend on the rate of unemployment"). The author argues that both propositions are wrong. As for the former, it is maintained that <b>inflationary</b> <b>impulses</b> do not originate from the quantity of money but from the activity of firms, which, however, can be influenced by the policy of the central bank. As for the latter, the rate of unemployment appears to be only one of several vari-ables affecting the behaviour of wages and prices. A critical reappraisal of the explanation of inflation is now particularly important since the European Central Bank will become operative at the be-ginning of the next year.     JEL Codes: E 31, E 32  </p...|$|R
40|$|Aggregation of {{international}} prices in empirical work is generally based on well known index number formulas. However, {{a common practice}} applying such formulas {{is the use of}} price indices rather than price levels for which data across countries are rarely available.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} analyse price {{inflation}} under oligopoly capitalism. Its central {{argument is that}} under oligopoly capitalism, price inflation is a structural phenomenon. For {{a greater understanding of}} that phenomenon, the adoption of the inter-industrial approach for its analysis seems essential. According to this approach, price inflation can be initiated in a single industry or in an industry group. The initiating factor may be an increase in the mark-up, an increase in the money wage rate or an increase in the foreign currency price of an imported input. It can also be initiated by devaluation. The input-output matrix, the core of the economic system, {{is the key to the}} transmission of <b>inflationary</b> <b>impulses</b> (in the form of higher unit cost) from one industry to another. Real wage resistance, rigid mark-up resistance, and rigid foreign resistance do no more than perpetuate or worsen the inflationary experience. The inflationary process itself has a dual role to play. It acts as a mechanism for shifting income distribution in favour of one section of the society against another and as a mechanism for changing the price structure. The author argues that the abandonment of the macroeconomic approach to the analysis of price inflation and its replacement by the inter-industrial approach is the first step for serious analysis of that structural phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} whether {{capacity utilization}} in manufacturing is a reliable inflation indicator {{over and above}} economy-wide indicators of inflationary pressure and examines different theories on the propagation of inflation by testing their implications {{for the relationship between}} capacity utilization and inflation. Three mechanisms whereby shocks to manufacturing can impact on inflation are explored: First, direct pressure on producer prices in manufacturing arising from bottlenecks and a slowdown in productivity growth at high operating rates, second, spill-overs of manufacturing-sector wage increases into inflationary wage growth in the service sector, and finally, investment in manufacturing capacity that stimulates expansion, capacity pressures, and inflation on an economy-wide basis. We find that manufacturing capacity utilization has marginal predictive power for inflation in seven out of 15 major OECD economies and that the inflationary impact of an increase in manufacturing operating rates tends to be sizable. The links between capacity utilization and inflation that we uncover suggest that the mechanisms that propagate <b>inflationary</b> <b>impulses</b> differ widely among nations. In the U. S. there is strong evidence that changes in manufacturing activity impact on inflation through unit labor costs and finished goods producer prices. By contrast, wage contagion appears to be a crucial element of the inflation process in Japan. It also plays a role in Europe, particularly in Germany. Finally, only in Germany of the major capital-goods producing economies, does capital goods prices unambiguously play a role in transmitting manufacturing-sector shocks to economy-wide price indices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address some {{important}} questions surrounding the determinants of Irish inflation. As a backdrop, the international theoretical literature on inflation is selectively reviewed, with a view towards assessing its relevance to Ireland. Subsequently, the relevant Irish empirical literature is assessed in order to highlight the main outstanding areas of disagreement surrounding the determination of Irish inflation. This is contrasted with the widespread agreement which prevailed prior to our entry into the EMS. Following on from this, an empirical model of aggregate Irish inflation is formulated with a view towards specifically addressing the roles of (i) the exchange rate, (ii) wages and (iii) foreign factors in the determination of Irish inflation. Our overall results, obtained using the Johansen multivariate cointegration technique, highlight the long-run interrelationships between Irish prices, wages and the nominal effective exchange rate. In addition, it is shown that the purchasing power parity model is an acceptable long-run framework within which to consider price determination in Ireland. However, the results also support the view that excessive wage pressure, or domestic <b>inflationary</b> <b>impulses</b> in general, can exert upward pressure on Irish prices as long as the exchange rate is free to move. * The authors would like to thank John Frain, Tom O’Connell and other colleagues in the Central Bank for helpful suggestions on an earlier draft.
