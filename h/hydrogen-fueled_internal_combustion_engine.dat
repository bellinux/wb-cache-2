40|$|<b>Hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> are a {{possible}} solution to make transportation more ecological. Only emissions of {{oxides of nitrogen}} (NOx) occur at high loads, being a constraint for power and efficiency optimization. A thermodynamic model of the engine cycle enables a cheap and fast optimization of engine settings. It needs to accurately predict the heat transfer in the engine because the NOx emissions {{are influenced by the}} maximum gas temperature. However, the existing engine heat transfer models in the literature are developed for fossil fuels and they have been cited to be inaccurate for hydrogen. We have measured the heat transfer inside a spark ignited engine with a thermopile to investigate the heat transfer process of hydrogen and to find the differences with a fossil fuel. This paper describes the effects of the compression ratio, ignition timing and mixture richness on the heat transfer process, comparing hydrogen with methane. A convection coefficient is used to separate the effect of the temperature difference between the gas and the wall from the influence of the gas movement and combustion. The paper shows that the convection coefficient gives more insight in the heat transfer process in a <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> despite the assumptions involved in its definition.

Hydrogen engines with external mixture formation have a significantly lower power output than gasoline engines. The main causes are the lower volumetric energy density of the externally formed hydrogen-air mixture and the occurrence of abnormal combustion phenomena (mainly backfire). Two engine test benches were used to investigate different means of compensating for this power loss, while keeping oxides of nitrogen (NO x) emissions limited. A single cylinder research engine was used to {{study the effects of}} supercharging, combined with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Supercharging the engine results in an increase in power output. The combination with EGR permits stoichiometric operation and thus low NO x emissions because of the resulting high aftertreatment efficiency. Furthermore, the power output can be varied through the supercharging pressure and the EGR percentage, enabling throttle-less operation and thus higher engine efficiencies. A four-cylinder production gasoline engine was converted to bi-fuel operation and was used to study the effects of continuously variable intake valve timing on power output, efficiency, emissions and the occurrence of backfire when operated on hydrogen. The engine efficiency on hydrogen is compared to gasoline operation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> (H 2 ICEs) are an affordable, {{practical}} and efficient technology {{to introduce the}} use of hydrogen as an energy carrier. They are practical as they offer fuel flexibility, furthermore the specific properties of hydrogen (wide flammability limits, high flame speeds) enable a dedicated H 2 ICE to reach high efficiencies, bettering hydrocarbon-fueled ICEs and approaching fuel cell efficiencies. The easiest way to introduce H 2 ICE vehicles is through converting engines to bi-fuel operation by mounting a port fuel injection (PFI) system for hydrogen. However, for naturally aspirated engines this implies a large power penalty due to loss in volumetric efficiency and occurrence of abnormal combustion. The present paper reports measurements on a single cylinder hydrogen PFI engine equipped with an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system and a supercharging set-up. The measurements were aimed at increasing the power output to gasoline engine levels or higher, while maximizing efficiency and minimizing emissions. Two strategies were tested: one using stoichiometric mixtures, with or without EGR, where a three way catalyst (TWC) was relied upon for aftertreatment of oxides of nitrogen (NOx); and a second one using lean mixtures limiting engine-out NOx emissions so that aftertreatment was not needed. Test results are reported for varying supercharging pressure and engine speed, it is shown that both strategies allow power outputs exceeding gasoline levels. The brake thermal efficiencies for both strategies are compared, to derive the best operating strategy {{as a function of}} torque demand and engine speed.

40|$|Hydrogen's {{most likely}} {{role as a}} {{potential}} alternative to fossil fuels {{is that of a}} transport fuel, and conversion of hydrogen's chemical energy into mechanical or electrical work in vehicles will almost certainly make use of either a hydrogen fuel cell or a <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine.</b> While fuel cells generally offer higher peak efficiencies, hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines are in many ways better suited for integration into vehicles, particularly as hybridisation becomes more widespread. This work thus investigates the performance of hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines, by looking in turn at vehicle performance, engine performance, and finally fundamental combustion phenomena. The cost and carbon-mitigation potential of conventional and hybridised hydrogen-fueled vehicles is investigated via comparison with conventional and hybridised fossil-fueled vehicles as well as battery-electric vehicles. This analysis focuses on Australian market conditions, and considers both embodied and in-service energy consumption and emissions, as well as the total cost of ownership over several timeframes. The hydrogen-fueled vehicles were in general found to be more expensive than the fossil-fueled vehicles, but in most cases offered a lower cost of carbon-mitigation than the plug-in hybrid and battery-electric alternatives. A significant contributor to this result is the cost and embodied energy associated with the larger batteries required for the more highly electrified vehicles. With confirmation that hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines can be a competitive technology for carbon mitigation, the performance of a production, gasoline-fueled engine converted for hydrogen-fueled operation is then investigated in more detail. A transient engine dynamometer was used to study the effects of engine design parameters [...] including valve timings, throttling, air-fuel ratio, injection timing, compression ratio and turbocharging [...] on combustion stability, emissions, thermal efficiency and performance. Results showed that peak efficiencies were generally obtained during throttle-free operation when 2 <lambda< 3, and that valve timings and air-fuel ratio should be used to control torque to minimise reductions in efficiency. Testing at higher-compression ratios did not result in the expected increases in efficiency. However, it was possible to confirm that preignition and autoignition did not contribute to performance limitations at the ratios tested. In order to link the observed engine behaviour and performance limits to physical phenomena, a combined experimental and numerical model was developed to quantify energy flows through the engine. Particular attention was paid {{to some of the most}} significant challenges in the modelling of hydrogen-fueled engines, specifically the effects of compression ratio, wall temperatures and large variations in air-fuel ratio on in-cylinder heat transfer and combustion behaviour. The modelling of energy flows through the engine was able to link the efficiency peaks observed with respect to lambda to increased in-cylinder heat transfer on the rich side, and increased exhaust enthalpy and decreased combustion rates and stability on the lean side. The modelling also indicated that higher compression ratio tested produced lower exhaust enthalpy flows, but increases in in-cylinder heat transfer of a similar magnitude, resulting in modest changes in efficiency. Further investigation revealed the significance of increased piston surface area, and suggested that a low-area chamber design could offer improved results. Finally, combustion analysis using turbulent flame theory showed that low laminar flame speeds relative to the turbulence intensity in the chamber were the likely cause of the increased combustion variability and fractions of unburned fuel observed as Î» increased. Additionally, it appears that at very lean conditions, in-engine hydrogen combustion may deviate from the wrinkled laminar and flamelets in eddies turbulent flame regimes commonly assumed in spark-ignition engines, and tend towards conditions suggestive of the broken reactions and distributed reactions regimes.

The Advanced <b>Combustion</b> <b>Engine</b> R&D Sub-Program supports this mission by removing the critical technical barriers to commercialization of advanced <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty highway vehicles that meet future Federal and state emissions regulations. The primary objective of the Advanced <b>Combustion</b> <b>Engine</b> R&D Sub-Program {{is to improve the}} brake thermal efficiency of <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> from 30 to 45 percent for light-duty applications by 2010; and 40 to 55 percent for heavy-duty applications by 2012; while meeting cost, durability, and emissions constraints. R&D activities include work on combustion technologies that increase efficiency and minimize in-cylinder formation of emissions, as well as aftertreatment technologies that further reduce exhaust emissions. Work is also being conducted on ways to reduce parasitic and heat transfer losses through the development and application of thermoelectrics and turbochargers that include electricity generating capability, and conversion of mechanically driven engine components to be driven via electric motors. This introduction serves to outline the nature, current progress, and future directions of the Advanced <b>Combustion</b> <b>Engine</b> R&D Sub-Program.
