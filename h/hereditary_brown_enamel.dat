50|$|Since that time, the {{position}} of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On August 21, 1941, under , Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.The insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar 3/8 in wide and 1 in long, rounded at the ends with <b>brown</b> <b>enamel</b> on top and a latitudinal center of gold 1/8 (0.32 cm) inch wide. The insignia for chief warrant officer was a gold bar 3/8 in in width and 1 in in length with rounded ends, <b>brown</b> <b>enamel</b> on top with a longitudinal center stripe of gold 1/8 in wide.

2500|$|It was at {{the studio}} on Stretensky Boulevard that Kabakov’s {{unofficial}} work took a new turn. Previously, his work consisted of relatively modest-sized drawings of approximately 8 x 11inches. Here, he began to create considerably larger works. [...] The Russian Series, 1969, consists of three paintings. [...] All are 49 x 77inches and are covered with a sandy brown. Within each, there are minute details and objects alternatively on the surface or hidden beneath the sandy color.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to address and {{investigate}} {{some of the main}} challenges in the fields of cariology and caries management. In the first two Chapters, available literature on the formation and remineralisation of carious enamel lesions at different structural levels of enamel including microscopic tissue level, rod level and crystal level were reviewed. In Chapter 3, an approach was developed to provide quantitative and qualitative information of the carious enamel lesions in a non-subjective manner based on x-ray micro computed tomography, image de-noising and visualisation techniques. In chapter 4, a systematic study of natural fissural enamel lesions was performed using X-ray micro computed tomography and image processing methods revealing the exclusive pattern and quantifying the structural features of fissural lesions. In Chapter 5, the study of natural <b>brown</b> spot <b>enamel</b> lesions revealed the different structure and mineral pattern of brown spot lesions compared to white spot enamel lesions. Two distinguishable shapes including reverse triangular and trapezoid were the common patterns in <b>brown</b> spot <b>enamel</b> lesions. In Chapter 6 a method using high pressure homogenisation, for the preparation of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, was developed and the efficacy of produced hydroxyapatite nanoparticles for remineralisation of artificial enamel lesions was evaluated.

40|$|Objectives We {{report the}} mineral (hydroxyapatite) density {{of sound and}} opaque areas in DMH molars with sound parts of (carious) {{deciduous}} teeth serving as controls. Methods Twenty-nine extracted second primary molars obtained from 15 children were studied. Thirteen of these molars were DMH molars with yellow opacities, seven were DMH molars with white opacities, three DMH molars with brown opacities and eleven were molars without DMH. Prior to microCT scanning, the teeth were mounted in impression material (Impregum®) and stored in water with a thymol crystal. Spot analysis and line scans were performed in areas with opacities and in sound areas. An ANOVA test and t-tests were used to test if {{there were significant differences}} between the groups. Results The average densities of the hydroxyapatite in yellow and brown opacities (1368 mg HA/cm 2 and 1407 mg HA/cm 2, respectively) were significantly lower than in clinically unaffected enamel (1747 mg HA/cm 2) of DMH molars or of sound molars (1758 mg HA/cm 2). The mineral density in white opacities (1737 mg HA/cm 2) was not different from that in the enamel of sound molars. The mineral density values in yellow and <b>brown</b> <b>enamel</b> opacities were in between those of dentine (1018 mg HA/cm 2) and enamel. Conclusions DMH molars with yellow or brown opacities had a 20 - 22 % lower mineral density in the hypomineralised enamel compared with sound molars. White opacities do not show a lower mineral content. The reduction in enamel mineral content in DMH molars stressed the need for a preventive approach in DMH...|$|R
40|$|Dental {{fluorosis}} {{is caused}} by excessive uptake of fluoride, characterized by <b>brown</b> <b>enamel</b> mottling that starts with white spots, while bones and virtually every organ can be affected by well-known anti-thyroid characteristics of the flourine. The aim of our work, was to establish {{the relationship between the}} consumption of fluoride-rich water and the prevalence of dental fluorosis in school children aged between 6 and 12 years old in Djidja (Benin). Methods: An investigation of fluorosis case-finding was conducted by a dentist and water points near the schools were collected to determine their fluoride concentration. Results: A prevalence of 20. 53 % (115 over 560 school children sample) were reported to have severe dental fluorosis, a. The fluorine content analysis of the water sample collected from the seven water points close to each school or residence in the target population revealed an average fluoride ion content of 2. 20 mg/L in the drinking water of schoolchildren in the study area. The values vary from 1. 51 mg/L to 3. 02 mg/L and largely higher than the recommendations of WHO (0. 7 mg/L to 1. 2 mg/L). From this study, it should be remembered that fluorosis does not vary with sex. The highest frequencies are obtained with schoolchildren in the 8 to 11 age group, and fluorine water levels vary from place to place. These results are in fact consistent with the results of a good number of authors. In addition, body surfaces between 1501 and 1520 have the highest prevalence of dental fluorosis in our study population. It is therefore urgent to treat these waters in order to reverse the thorny public health problem of dental fluorosis...|$|R
40|$|Salivary macromolecules {{infiltrate}} {{white and}} <b>brown</b> spot <b>enamel</b> lesions and adsorb onto hydroxyapatite. Calcium-binding salivary proteins such as statherin hinder remineralization of these lesions. We assessed whether bleaching agents can remove salivary components that have infiltrated and bound to experimental subsurface lesions in bovine enamel prepared by immersing specimens in acid and then human saliva. Transversal microradiography showed that such demineralized lesions mimicked incipient carious lesions. Bound proteins {{to the experimental}} and untreated control specimens were eluted in a stepwise manner with phosphatebuffered saline, 0. 4 M phosphate buffer, and 1 M HCl. SDS-PAGE of dialyzed extracts showed that specific salivary proteins bound to the lesions, while virtually no protein bands were detected if the specimens were bleached. Western blotting showed that even statherin, which was more firmly bound than other proteins, was removed. In-office bleaching agent {{may be useful in}} treating enamel lesions for removing proteins bound to these lesions...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Quarter Horses {{drinking}} water artificially fluoridated at 0. 9 to 1. 1 ppm {{over long periods}} of time developed dental fluorosis. Even when the horses had not been exposed to artificially fluoridated water (AFW) during formation of <b>enamel,</b> <b>brown</b> discoloration occurred and progressed. Pronounced loss of tooth-supporting alveolar bone with recession of bone and gingiva was also present as more severe signs of chronic fluorosis than enamel changes alone. The scene of these events was a lowland part of Texas just above sea level. AFW at these low concentrations can obviously induce chronic fluorosis in its own right without the support of high altitude. With a change to low fluoride (0. 1 ppm) well water, a remarkable improvement was observed in the general health of the horses in a very short time. Most notably, bothersome episodes of colic promptly ceased...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A {{decreased}} {{resistance to}} infection and impairments of immunity {{are common in}} obese humans and in rodents with <b>hereditary</b> obesity. Since <b>brown</b> fat thermogenesis is also suppressed in obese rodents, we hypothesized that obesity leads to a decreased febrile responsiveness. METHODS: We compared the fever responses to intravenous E. coli lipopolysaccharide (10 mg=kg) between Zucker fa=fa (obese due to a defective leptin receptor) and Fa=? (lean) rats and between Otsuka Long – Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF; obese due to the lacking cholecystokinin-A receptor) and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (lean) rats. Obesity of Zucker fa=fa and OLETF rats was verified by increased body mass and fat content, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. RESULTS: Neither fa=fa nor OLETF animals exhibited a decreased febrile responsiveness; if anything, their fevers tended {{to be higher than}} those in their lean counterparts. CONCLUSION: Obesity per se does not lead to antipyresis...|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} driers are litharge, sugar of lead, patent driers, sulfate of zinc and {{manganese}} dioxide. Liquid driers, such as terebene, {{are also in}} use. Litharge, an oxide of lead, is in most general use. Sugar of lead is used, ground in oil, for light tints. Sulfate of zinc and manganese driers are used for paints in which zinc white is the base, which would be injured by lead driers. Pigments are preparations of metallic, earthy or animal origin mixed into paint to give it color. For oil paint they are usually ground in oil; for distemper they are sold as a finely ground powder. The ordinary pigments are white lead, zinc white, umbers, siennas, ochres, chromes, Venetian red, Indian red, lampblack, bone black, vegetable black, ultramarine, Prussian blue, vermilion, red lead, oxide of iron, lakes and Vandyke <b>brown.</b> The term <b>enamel</b> paint was first given to a compound of zinc white, petrol and resin, which possessed on drying a hard glossy surface. The name is now applied to any colored paint of this nature. Quick-drying enamels are spirit varnishes ground with the desired pigment. For slow-drying enamels oil varnishes form the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Franklin D Roosevelt on line 9 {{received}} the first paneling makeover in 1952, {{to be followed}} by five other stations between 1954 and 1958, each featuring slightly different prototypes: Saint-Paul and Franklin D. Roosevelt on line 1, Opéra and République on line 3, and Chaussée d'Antin on line 9. Experiments were also conducted on the closed Arsenal station, which had been shuttered with about a dozen other stations {{at the onset of the}} Second World War. Public reception was favourable, and so the programme was extended to many other stations, with the prototype at République becoming the standard after some further slight modifications. The standard style eventually adopted throughout the network featured light yellow paneling with forest green accents, complemented by <b>brown</b> and yellow <b>enamel</b> station nameplates. Between 1960 and 1968 approximately 70 stations were paneled in this style. Because the Nord-Sud had used different sized advertising poster frames than the CMP in constructing its stations, carrossage also presented an opportunity to harmonize the poster frames on lines 12 and 13 with the rest of the network (and indeed, with the rest of the country: the CMP poster frame size had become a national standard). All but seven stations on lines 12 and 13 {{received the}} carrossage makeovers, with line 12 the most extensively remodeled line on the network.|$|R
