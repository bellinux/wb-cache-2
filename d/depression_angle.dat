The range to the target is determined by taking the cotangent of the <b>depression</b> <b>angle</b> d times {{the height of the}} instrument OM, to yield the range MP. But due to the curvature of the earth, the true range is MT''''. To achieve this, the DPF instrument adjusts the observer's height from OM to ON, and then correctly measures the range as NT.

The instrument is a 20-1100 MHz UWB SAR, {{mounted on a}} boom that travels, at 1 km/h, over a precisely measured range. The SAR is mounted on a 30-ton boom-lift platform, such that it can reproduce, consistently, the <b>depression</b> <b>angles</b> and swath of a representative airborne SAR.

A 6.5 mm machine gun was mounted on the main turret. Two addition turrets gave Type 95 yet more firepower: one Type 94 3.7 cm tank cannon was mounted in one auxiliary turret, and the second auxiliary turret featured a 6.5 mm machine gun.|$|E
50|$|To {{preserve}} return-signal strength, Quill’s {{range from}} its target areas had been minimized {{by using an}} unusually steep <b>depression</b> <b>angle.</b> The resulting images therefore had slant-range scales that were much foreshortened versions of the ground-range (mapping) scale of level terrain. While slant-range images provide a realistic perspective of terrain elevation variations, users of imagery usually prefer map-like images having nearly matching scales in both ground-range and along-track directions. Because the optical processor of that time {{did not have the}} capability to make full expansions to ground-range scale, only partially expanded images were made during processing of the original images.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} major advantages: high gun {{placement}}, smaller turret size and simpler fitment of an autoloader. High gun placement allows for better <b>depression</b> <b>angles,</b> reduces the exposed {{part of the}} tank when using hull down positions, and reduces the vertical gap between line of sights and line of the gun. The fact that fully elevated gun does not cross the turret ring allows to reduce turret ring diameter hence width of the vehicles hull and/or mounting the more powerful gun. Autoloader mechanism is simpler and works more reliably when the gun is not moving relative to it.|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} subjects {{ability to}} track a constant altitude {{as a function}} of the structure in the optical flow field. Optic flow was manipulated by using four different types of ground texture (splay angle, <b>depression</b> <b>angle,</b> random dot, and block textures) crossed with two global optical flow (GOF) rates (0 and 3 eyeheights/s). The subjects were asked to maintain a constant altitude while wind disturbances randomly perturbed them on vertical, lateral, and fore-aft axes. The critical independent variables were texture type and GOF rate. Texture type was a within-subjects variable while GOF rate was a between-subjects variable. The main dependent variables included RMS height error and the correlation between subjects stick activity and the three wind disturbances. For both dependent variables, an interaction was found in that the <b>depression</b> <b>angle</b> texture provided superior performance in a hover or 0 GOF rate condition. The splay angle texture provided a constant level of performance for both GOF rates, being superior to <b>depression</b> <b>angle</b> in the higher GOF rate. These results are consistent with Flach et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (1992) hypothesis that the ability to pick-up altitude information from the optic flow field depends upon the amount of optical activity that is specific to changes in altitude (signal) rather than specific to changes in lateral or fore-aft position (noise). This hypothesis provides a higher order explanation for previous results on the control of altitude which had been thought to be inconsistent...|$|E

40|$|FOREWORD [...] [...] This {{report is}} an {{enlarged}} and {{revised version of}} an original study [...] conducted by one of us (HERMAN, 1960). Several additional emissions of [...] the auroral spectrum are studied. In order to ascertain and clarify some [...] unexpected results of the original study the spectroscopic data has been [...] re-classified into three well defined groups which are analysed separately. [...] Data of questionable quality are removed. It appears that this new study [...] resolves ambiguities present in the original results and allows revised [...] and new interpretations to be advanced. The behavior of prominent auroral emissions has been studied statistically [...] using the IGY patrol spectrograms obtained at College, Alaska during the International [...] Geophysical Year. Results are presented {{in the form of}} mean diurnal [...] intensity variations and in the form of correlation tables. Both presentations [...] suggest the occurrence of two types of auroras. One is relatively weak, has a [...] broad intensity maximum around magnetic midnight, and contains the hydrogen [...] Balmer emissions. The other gradually increases in intensity until magnetic [...] midnight and thereafter maintains a high intensity level until dawn. Its spectrum [...] is usually characterized by the presence of the first positive bands of N 2. [...] The mean diurnal intensity variation of the sodium emission suggests that [...] the twilight enhancement of the sodium D-lines persists to much greater solar [...] <b>depression</b> <b>angles</b> than those previously reported. Some evidence is found for [...] a small auroral contribution to the sodium emission. This contribution is however [...] erratic and does not correlate well with any specific auroral emission. [...] The (OI) 6364 A emission shows, as expected, a strong twilight enhancement [...] persisting to large solar <b>depression</b> <b>angles.</b> No enhancement is observed for [...] the (OI) 5577 A emission.

The goals of this work are to positively identify the 8446 A emission in the twilight airglow and to determine the intensity decay {{as a function of}} solar <b>depression</b> <b>angle.</b> Also, a study of the relative triplet line strengths is performed in hopes of establishing the importance of the primary excitation mechanisms (photoelectron impact or Bowen fluorescence) during the twilight period. Although absent in most of the data, a distinct auroral influence is also found to contribute considerably, on occasion, to the emission over Millstone Hill. The ratio of the combined 8446. 26 A and 8446. 38 A intensities to the 8446. 76 A intensity varies as 0. 13 +/- 0. 03 per degree of solar <b>depression</b> <b>angle,</b> indicating that secondary excitation mechanisms are becoming increasingly important as evening twilight progresses.
