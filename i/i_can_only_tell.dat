5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too {{sure that it is}} right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E
500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't tell you what it really is/ <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> you what it feels like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 2006, Rae {{applied for}} {{membership}} in the Liberal Party of Canada. His candidacy for the federal party leadership was supported by Greg Sorbara and George Smitherman, former Chrétien aides Eddie Goldenberg and Rae's brother John, as well as former top Martin advisor John Webster and others associated with the Martin camp. He announced his candidacy on April 24, 2006. At his campaign launch he responded to his critics by saying, [...] "I made mistakes before I was in politics, I made mistakes when I was in politics, I made mistakes as premier... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>tell</b> you I have learned from those mistakes and I am the wiser for them." [...] Rae's predecessor as premier, David Peterson who was supporting Michael Ignatieff, criticized Rae's entry into the race due to his record as NDP provincial premier, though insisting that he did not hold a personal grudge against Rae.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this most}} welcome word, the young man’s heart exulted; {{and in the}} hope, pride, and {{self-esteem}} that kindled with {{the very thought of}} service, he forgot to dwell upon the lady’s jest. ‘Can you ask?’ he cried. ‘What is there that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do? <b>Only</b> <b>tell</b> me that.’ ...|$|R
60|$|There is one puzzling {{thing about}} these prehistoric {{memories}} of mine. It is the vagueness {{of the time}} element. I lo not always know the order of events;--or <b>can</b> <b>I</b> tell, between some events, whether one, two, or {{four or five years}} have elapsed. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> roughly <b>tell</b> the passage of time by judging the changes in the appearance and pursuits of my fellows.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I say," [...] said Bastin, [...] "that my most earnest {{desire is}} to be clear of the whole thing, which wearies and perplexes me more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>Only</b> <b>I</b> {{am not going to}} run away, unless you think it {{desirable}} to do so too, Lady Yva. I want you to understand that I am not in the least afraid of the Lord Oro, and do not for one moment believe that he will be allowed to bring about disaster to the world, as I understand is his wicked object. Therefore on the whole I am indifferent and quite prepared to accept any decision at which the rest of you may arrive." ...|$|R

6000|$|A {{gentleman who}} heard the {{conversation}} afterwards {{told me the}} following anecdote. A friend of his had long been an unsuccessful suitor {{in one of the}} higher courts of the kingdom. They met one day in the street, when the other told him that an unsealed letter, which he held in his hand, contained an offer of a pair of carriage-horses to the wife of the judge who had the control of his affair. On being told he dare not take so strong a step, M. de ----, my informant, was requested to read the letter, to seal it and {{to put it in the}} boîte aux lettres with his own hands, in order to satisfy himself of the actual state of justice in France. All this was done, and [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> add," [...] continued M. de ----, [...] "that I afterwards saw the horses in the carriage of Madame ----, and that my friend gained his cause." [...] To this anecdote <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> it exactly as I heard it, and that M. de ---- is a deputy, and one of the honestest and simplest-minded men of my acquaintance. It is but proper to add, that the judge in question has a bad name, and is little esteemed by the bar; but the above-mentioned fact would go to show that too much of the old system remains.|$|R
40|$|What is {{the impact}} of {{software}} engineering research on current practices in industry? In this paper, I report on my direct experience as a PhD/post-doc working in software engineering research projects, and then spending the following five years as an engineer in two different companies (the first one being the same I worked in collaboration with during my post-doc). Given a background in software engineering research, what cutting-edge techniques and tools from academia did I use in my daily work when developing and testing the systems of these companies? Regarding validation and verification (my main area of research), the answer is rather short: as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>only</b> FindBugs. In this paper, I report on why this was the case, and discuss all the challenging, complex open problems we face in industry and which somehow are ``neglected'' in the academic circles. In particular, I will first discuss what actual tools I could use in my daily work, such as JaCoCo and Selenium. Then, I will discuss the main open problems I faced, particularly related to environment simulators, unit and web testing. After that, popular topics in academia are presented, such as UML, regression and mutation testing. Their lack of impact on the type of projects I worked on in industry is then discussed. Finally, from this industrial experience, I provide my opinions about how this situation can be improved, in particular related to how academics are evaluated, and advocate for a greater involvement into open-source projects...|$|R
6000|$|... "How much I love you, Alice," [...] Jasper Dale was saying, unafraid, with no shyness {{in voice}} or manner. [...] "I {{wonder what you}} would say if you knew. You would laugh at me--sweet as you are, you would laugh in mockery. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>tell</b> you. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> dream of <b>telling</b> you. In my dream you are {{standing}} here by me, dear. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see you very plainly, my sweet lady, so tall and gracious, with your dark hair and your maiden eyes. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> dream that <b>I</b> tell you my love; that--maddest, sweetest dream of all--that you love me in return. Everything is possible in dreams, you know, dear. My dreams are all I have, so I go far in them, even to dreaming that you are my wife. I dream how I shall fix up my dull old house for you. One room will need nothing more--it is your room, dear, and has been ready for you a long time--long before that day I saw you under the pine. Your books and your chair and your picture are there, dear--only the picture is not half lovely enough. But the other rooms of the house {{must be made to}} bloom out freshly for you. What a delight it is thus to dream of what I would do for you! Then I would bring you home, dear, and lead you through my garden and into my house as its mistress. I would see you standing beside me in the old mirror {{at the end of the}} hall--a bride, in your pale blue dress, with a blush on your face. I would lead you through all the rooms made ready for your coming, and then to your own. I would see you sitting in your own chair and all my dreams would find rich fulfilment in that royal moment. Oh, Alice, we would have a beautiful life together! It's sweet to make believe about it. You will sing to me in the twilight, and we will gather early flowers together in the spring days. When I come home from work, tired, you will put your arms about me and lay your head on my shoulder. I will stroke it--so--that bonny, glossy head of yours. Alice, my Alice--all mine in my dream--never to be mine in real life--how I love you!" ...|$|R
