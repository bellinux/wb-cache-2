5|$|Deep Blue is {{the first}} alien to return, taking {{the form of a}} human boy and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> within him. Quiche, Pie, and Tart arrive later to remove humans from Earth and allow the {{remaining}} aliens to return. After Deep Blue is destroyed, and they are defeated, the aliens return to their own planet with the remaining mew aqua to change their world into a place as beautiful as Earth.|$|E
5|$|In autumn, Granpa and Emily went fishing, and {{imagined}} of catching a whale that haled {{them through the}} Thames and through London. At bedtime, Granpa tells Emily the story of The Three Knights, of which was imagined on a bed covers. Though as he reads, he begins to slow up as he begins to drop off. So he end it with his own version, just as Emily was finally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, {{the crew}} {{became the first}} shuttle crew to ever testify live from orbit in a United States Senate hearing. Barbara Mikulski, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, and former {{astronaut}} Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, spoke with the crew {{about the importance of}} spaceflight and the repair of Hubble. The first person to give testimony from space was John L. Phillips, who testified before the House Science Committee, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics in June 2005 while a member of Expedition 11 on board the International Space Station. The crew of Atlantis later spoke with reporters from the major networks CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E

5|$|For a {{time after}} the fourth night, Robert cannot find the Number Devil in his dreams; later, however, on the fifth night, Robert finds himself at a desert where the Number Devil teaches him about {{triangular}} numbers {{through the use of}} coconuts. On the sixth night, the Number Devil teaches Robert about the natural occurrence of Fibonacci numbers, which the Number Devil shortens to Bonacci numbers, by counting brown and white rabbits as they reproduce multiple times. By this dream, Robert's mother has noticed a visible change in Robert's mathematical interest, and Robert begins <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> earlier to encounter the Number Devil. The seventh night brings Robert to a bare, white room, where the Number Devil presents Pascal's triangle and the patterns that the triangular array displays. On the eighth night, Robert is brought to his classroom at school. The Number Devil arranges Robert's classmates in multiple ways, teaches him about permutations, and what the Number Devil calls vroom numbers (factorials).|$|E
5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E

25|$|The church {{encourages}} {{its members}} to make prayer a part of everyday life. Thus, prayer before various activities, such as taking meals and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> are commonly practiced. Prayers recited in rote repetition are not observed.|$|E
25|$|Raymond and Debra's {{marriage}} {{is fraught with}} conflicts. Raymond prefers sports television over discussions with Debra on marital matters. Like his father, Raymond works full-time, leaving most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife; he often has to be forced into helping around the house. One of the show's recurring elements finds the couple having a long discussion in bed each night before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{he listened}} again. Some {{of the men}} were speaking, and asking each other who it was that had {{suddenly}} spoken. No one replied; and some of them gave vent to angry threats, against whoever it might be who had just disturbed them from <b>going</b> off <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 60. THE BIG BAD DREAM Paz and Dog {{are staying}} at Pappy's {{house for a}} sleep-over. After playing games and singing songs, Paz is ready for bed, but Dog doesn`t want <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Finally Dog admits to Paz {{that as much as}} he likes sleeping, he's never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> again - because last night he had a bad dream about a monster chasing him. Paz helps Dog {{understand}} that monsters aren`t real, that Paz himself has had bad dreams, but that not all dreams are scary. They agree to keep the night-light on, and fall asleep with their good dreams dancing over their heads.|$|R

"It {{was enough}} to pottle you handsomely, however," [...] said the page--"And then, instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> off your liquor, must you sit singing your roistering songs about popes and pagans, till you have got your eyes almost {{switched}} out of your head; and but for my interference, whom your drunken ingratitude accuses of deserting you, yon galliard would have cut your throat, for he was whipping out a whinger as broad as my hand, and as sharp as a razor--And these are lessons for an inexperienced youth!--Oh, Adam! out upon you! out upon you!" ...|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile Thornton had strolled the North Barracks between 21:00 on the 24th and 02:00 on Christmas Day {{observing the}} ongoing partying, before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at 02:00. He {{was awakened by}} loud yells and, once out of his room, was {{attacked}} by two cadets. Thornton then put cadet William P.N. Fitzgerald (New York) under arrest for brandishing a weapon. Fitzgerald retreated from Thornton, then told two cadets in room No. 29 about the arrest.|$|E
25|$|Also, Cramer has National Football League yellow {{penalty and}} red coach's {{challenge}} flags that he throws whenever he believes a company has behaved unethically (penalty) {{or when he}} questions a stock decision (coach's challenge), respectively. He will also throw the flag when a caller unethically uses the national television audience to promote a stock for self-interest. If a caller rambles on about a stock, Cramer will {{lie down on the}} floor of the set with a pillow and blanket and act as if he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cognitive load {{also plays}} a role in ironic control theory. Studies have shown that a greater {{cognitive}} load results in an increased possibility of dream rebound occurring. In other words, when one tries to retain a heavy load of information before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> there is a high chance of that information manifesting itself within the dream. There is a greater degree of dream rebound in those with a higher cognitive load opposed to those whose load was absent. With the enhancement of a high cognitive load, ironic control theory states thought suppression is more likely to occur and lead to dream rebound.|$|E
6000|$|... "Philippa Blair, can {{you believe}} it's yourself?" [...] I said mentally. [...] "Here you are, lying on a brush bed on a western prairie {{in the middle of}} the night, at least twenty miles from any human being except another frail {{creature}} of your own sex. Yet you're not even frightened. You are very comfy and composed, and you're <b>going</b> right <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> again." ...|$|R
60|$|And now the {{question}} of bed had to be considered. Grant settled {{it as far as}} he was concerned by throwing himself down on a pile of brushwood that lay in a corner, pillowing his head on a three-legged stool, and <b>going</b> off <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at once. Fred and Sam looked at the two beds. They were extremely dirty, and it was evident that straw was the bedding.|$|R
60|$|We lay in Yokohama harbour for two weeks, {{and about}} all we saw of Japan was its drinking-places where sailors congregated. Occasionally, some {{one of us}} varied the monotony with a more {{exciting}} drunk. In such fashion I managed a real exploit by swimming off to the schooner one dark midnight and <b>going</b> soundly <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> while the water-police searched the harbour for my body and brought my clothes out for identification.|$|R
25|$|Some {{societies}} {{display a}} fragmented sleep pattern {{in which people}} sleep at all {{times of the day}} and night for shorter periods. In many nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies, people will sleep on and off throughout the day or night depending on what is happening. Plentiful artificial light has been available in the industrialized West since at least the mid-19th century, and sleep patterns have changed significantly everywhere that lighting has been introduced. In general, people sleep in a more concentrated burst through the night, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> much later, although this is not always the case.|$|E
25|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a common}} term {{for all of the}} {{behaviors}} which relate to the promotion of good sleep. These behaviors are used as the basis of sleep interventions and are the primary focus of sleep education programs. Behaviors include the use of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. Exercise can be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to the time that you are planning on <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or distressful thoughts from view.|$|E
25|$|The Ave Regina Caelorum (Hail, Queen of Heaven) is {{an early}} Marian antiphon, praising Mary, the Queen of Heaven. It is {{traditionally}} said or sung after each of the canonical hours of the Liturgy of the Hours. The prayer is used especially after Compline, the final canonical hour of prayer before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> It is prayed from the Feast of the Presentation (February 2) through the Wednesday of Holy Week. It used to be sung on {{the feast of the}} Assumption of Mary. The Ave Regina Caelorum dates back in a different musical intonation to the 12th century. Today's version is slightly different from a 12th-century intonation. The Ave Regina Caelorum has four parts: Ave, Salve, Gaude and Vale (in English: hail, rejoice, farewell). It was used for processions in honour of the Queen of Heaven. The Ave Regina Caelorum received numerous musical versions, a famous one of which was composed in 1773 by Joseph Haydn.|$|E
50|$|Shaun, {{a mischievous}} sheep {{living with his}} flock at Mossy Bottom Farm, is bored with the routine {{of life on the}} farm.

However, the caravan in which they put the farmer to bed accidentally rolls away, taking him all the way into the city. Bitzer, the farmer's dog, chases after him.|$|R

25|$|In 156, Pius turned seventy. He found {{difficult}} to keep himself upright without stays. He started nibbling on dry bread {{to give him the}} strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. As Pius aged, Marcus would have taken on more administrative duties, more still when the praetorian prefect (an office that was as much secretarial as military) Gavius Maximus died in 156 or 157. In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Perhaps Pius was already ill; in any case, he died before the year was out. Two days before his death, the biographer records, Pius was at his ancestral estate in Lorium. He ate Alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited; he had a fever the next day. The day after that, he summoned the imperial council, and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. He ordered that the golden statue of Fortune, which had been in the bedroom of the emperors, should go to Marcus' bedroom. Pius turned over, as if <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and died. It was 7 March 161. Marcus was now emperor.|$|E
25|$|In May 1902, MÃ©liÃ¨s {{made the}} film A Trip to the Moon which was {{loosely based on}} Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon and H. G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon. In the film, MÃ©liÃ¨s stars as Professor Barbenfouillis, a {{character}} similar to the astronomer he played in The Astronomer's Dream in 1898. Professor Barbenfouillis is the President of the Astronomer's Club and proposes an expedition to the Moon. A space vehicle {{in the form of}} a large artillery shell is built in his laboratory, and he uses it to launch six men (including himself) on a voyage to the Moon. The vehicle is shot out of a large cannon into space and hits the Man in the Moon in the eye. The group explores the Moon's surface before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> As they dream, they are observed by the Moon goddess Phoebe, played by Bleuette Bernon, who causes it to snow. Later, while underground, they are attacked and captured by a group of Moon aliens, played by acrobats from the Folies BergÃ¨re. Taken before the alien king, they manage to escape and are chased back to their spaceship. Then, with the aid of a rope attached to the spaceship, the men, along with an alien, fall from the Moon back to Earth, landing in the ocean (where a superimposed fish tank creates the illusion of the deep ocean). Eventually the spaceship is towed ashore and the returning adventurers are celebrated by the townspeople. At 14 minutes, it was MÃ©liÃ¨s' longest film up to that date and cost 10,000 francs to produce.|$|E
