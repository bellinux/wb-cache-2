50|$|As the gingival tissue swells, it {{no longer}} {{provides}} an effective seal between the tooth and the outside environment. Vertical space is created between the tooth and the gum, allowing new bacterial plaque biofilm to begin to migrate into the sulcus, or space between the gum and the tooth. In healthy individuals, the sulcus {{is no more than}} 3 mm deep when measured with a periodontal probe. As the gingivitis stage continues, the capillaries within the sulcus begin to dilate, resulting in more bleeding when brushing, flossing, or at dental appointments. This is the body's attempt to clear the infection from the tissues. Thus, bleeding is generally accepted as a sign of active oral infection. The swelling of the tissue may also result in deeper reading on periodontal probing, up to 4 mm. At a depth of 4 mm or greater, the vertical space between the tooth and surrounding gum becomes known as a periodontal pocket. Because tooth brush and floss cannot reach the bottom of a <b>gum</b> <b>pocket</b> 4-5 mm deep, bacteria stagnate in these sites and have the opportunity to proliferate into periodontal disease-causing colonies.|$|E

40|$|Processing Australian {{hardwood}} plantations into rotary veneer {{can produce}} more acceptable marketable product recoveries compared to traditional processing techniques (e. g. sawmilling). Veneers resulting from processing trials from six commercially important Australian hardwood species {{were dominated by}} D-grade veneer. Defects such as encased knots, <b>gum</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>gum</b> veins, surface roughness, splits, bark pockets, and decay impacted the final assigned grade. Four grading scenarios were adopted. The first included a change to the grade limitations for <b>gum</b> <b>pockets</b> and <b>gum</b> veins, while the second investigated {{the potential impact of}} effective pruning on grade recovery. Although both scenarios individually had a positive impact on achieving higher face grade veneer qualities, the third and fourth scenarios, which combined both, had a substantial impact, with relative veneer values increasing up to 18. 2 % using conservative calculations (scenario three) or up to 22. 6 % (scenario four) where some of the upgraded veneers were further upgraded to A-grade, which attracts superior value. The total change in veneer value was found to depend on the average billet diameter unless defects other than those relating to the scenarios (gum or knots) restricted the benefit of pruning and gum upgrading. This was the case for species prone to high levels of growth stress and related defects...|$|R
40|$|Buccal cavity as a {{compound}} ecosystem {{has always been}} ignored in parasitic infection studies; however it seems that studying on mouth and tooth prevalent parasitic infections is of great importance. In this study, from 120 patients of both sexes referred to Faculty of Dentistry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, (2001 - 2002) 240 samples {{were taken from the}} plaques and calculus of depth of tooth and <b>gum</b> <b>pockets.</b> Wet-mount technique is regarded as the best and quickest diagnostic method for Trichomonas. tenax while Entamoeba. gingivalis is best diagnosed by Trichrome vitelli staining method using Bovin fixative. 41. 7 % and 9. 2 % of the cases were infected by Entamoeba. gingivalis and T. tenax, respectively, while 3. 3 % were infected by both parasitic protozoa. Infection to mouth amoeba was more prevalent in males at the age of 21 - 30 yr old while no relation was found between age/sex as to infection with Trichomonas. tenax. Accordingly, a direct relation was found between the frequency of the parasites and some factors such as periodontal tissue condition, degree of gum bleeding and inflammation, gum color and tooth decay...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease among pregnant women and also to evaluate the status of oral hygiene. The prevalence and severity of caries was evaluated, having estimated DMFS and DMFT. The prevalence of periodontal diseases and the degree of severity was evaluated by CPITN index, gums by Silness-Loė (GI) index, oral hygiene by OHI-S (according to Green-Vermillion) index. 1070 pregnant 15 - 45 years old women, visitors of Kaunas women and family clinics were examined. The prevalence of caries was 99. 9 %; DMFS 19. 47 ± 0. 316 (10. 33), DMFT 12. 065 ± 0. 106 (3. 485). The prevalence of periodontal diseases was 93. 09 %. The composition of CPITN: 6. 91 % healthy periodontium (code 0), 15. 14 % – bleeding on probing (code 1), 58. 60 % – supragingival and subgingival calculus (code 2), 18. 97 % – periodontal pockets 4 – 5 mm depth (code 3), 0. 37 % – <b>gum</b> <b>pockets</b> 6 mm and more depth (code 4). The oral hygiene of the examined women was satisfactory; the mean of OHI-S was 1. 51 ± 0. 017 (0. 542). The mean of Silness-Loė gum index was 1. 48 ± 0. 021 (0. 69) ...|$|R

Advice includes "A man should not try to dance in his stiff, heavy, working shoes," and admonishments to remove chewing <b>gum</b> from the <b>pockets</b> so "you will not be tempted to use it at the party. ...|$|R
50|$|Periodontal <b>pockets</b> {{occur when}} <b>gum</b> disease makes <b>pockets</b> around the teeth. Food gets caught in these pockets and causes even more decay. The disease {{progresses}} as {{the horse is}} unable to chew properly. It can lead to infection, abscesses in the mouth, and tooth loss. It should be corrected as early as possible, {{and it is very}} difficult to stop. If the disease is caught early it can be prevented.|$|R

Some of them run to the nearest cigar store to get a rope; but they find the last one has just been cut up and labelled. Hundreds of the excited mob press close to the cowering motorman, whose hand is observed to tremble perceptibly as he transfers a stick of pepsin <b>gum</b> from his <b>pocket</b> to his mouth.|$|R
5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up <b>gum</b> in Justin's <b>pockets.</b> Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|R
