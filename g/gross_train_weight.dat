50|$|Another {{consideration}} is the maximum <b>weight</b> of a <b>train.</b> A maximum length train in Europe, 750 m long can have 50 container cars {{with a total}} weight of 2250 t, and more if 20 ft containers are included. This is not {{so far from the}} limit using standard European couplers. Double-stacking requires allowing higher <b>train</b> <b>weight</b> to be meaningful, since it is higher <b>train</b> <b>weights</b> that saves costs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to find out the {{influence}} of <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> parallel with plyometric and cross training on speed endurance. To achieve this {{purpose of the}} study, forty-five men students studying CSSR & SRRM Degree College, Kamalapuram, YSR (D), Andhra Pradesh, India were randomly selected as subjects during the year 2015 - 2016. They were divided into three equal groups of fifteen subjects each. Group I underwent <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> parallel with plyometric training for three sessions per week for twelve weeks. Group II underwent <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> parallel with cross training for three sessions per week for twelve weeks. And group III acted as control group who did not participated in any of the special training programme. Speed endurance was only selected as dependent variable. <b>Weight</b> <b>training</b> parallel with plyometric <b>training</b> and <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> parallel with cross training were selected as independent variables. Speed endurance was measured by using 150 mts run. The data were collected at prior and immediately after the training programme on elastic power. The collected data were analysed statistically by using analysis of covariance. The scheffe’s post hoc test was used to find out paired mean differences, if any. The results of the study revealed that <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> with plyometric <b>training</b> and <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> with cross training groups significantly improved speed endurance when compared with control group.

This thesis {{assessed the}} effectiveness of <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> on improving the body image of body image disturbed college females. A quasi-experimental design was employed to compare the differences in body image between body image disturbed females participating in <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> and body image disturbed females not participating in <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> following a 13 -week training period using intact classes. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> is effective in improving body satisfaction of body image disturbed females. The methodology consisted of administering two body image questionnaires (Body Shape Questionnaire and Body Cathexis Scale) both prior to and following a 13 -week period either involving or avoiding <b>weight</b> <b>training.</b> All participants were also questioned regarding their exercise habits, more specifically, their experience with <b>weight</b> <b>training.</b> In addition, participants were pre- and posttested on both upper and lower body strength tests by determining their one-repetition maximum on the lateral pulldown and leg press. During the 13 -week period, participants took part in either a total-body <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> program supervised by one of two physical education staff or refrained from <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> completely. Statistical analysis of responses to the Body Cathexis Scale indicated that body image disturbed females who participated in <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> demonstrated greater improvements in body perception than body image disturbed females who did not participate in <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> (<b>weight</b> trainers M= 150. 20, SD= 27. 88 : controls M= 136. 06, SD- 21. 50). Forty-one percent of <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> participants displayed sufficient body image improvements that they were no longer classified as being ?body image disturbed. ? Weight trainers? body image disturbance mean scores dropped from 106. 87 fSD= 17. 74) to 95. 29 (?D= 21. 21). Improvements were also noted in both the upper and lower body strength of the weight trainers with gains in the maximum amount of weight lifted on the lateral pulldown (M= 89. 33 lbs., SD= 15. 30) and leg press (M= 350. 67 lbs., SD= 73. 69). The results of this study suggest that <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> is an effective method of improving body satisfaction of body image disturbed college females and may be useful in the treatment of this disorder.
