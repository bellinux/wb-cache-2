40|$|The {{analysis}} of the micro impacts of macroeconomic <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> is quite new. It developed out of the concern that <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> adopted by governments to correct macroeconomic imbalances have affected various groups in the economy differently. The experience of several countries who have undertaken <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> have indicated that these policies tended to be deflationary and {{that most of the}} adjustment costs have been borne by the more vulnerable groups. The predominantly deflationary nature of <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> led to depressed employment and real income resulting to higher poverty incidence. Moreover, some macro policies have direct negative effects on the welfare of these vulnerable groups (Cornia, Jolly and Stewart, 1987). In response to the search for alternative adjustment paths that would minimize the social costs, the Micro Impacts of Macroeconomic <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Policies</b> (MIMAP) Project was conceived. Under Phase I of the MIMAP Project, Lamberte et al (1991) developed a general framework for analyzing the micro impacts of macroeconomic <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies.</b> Their main finding was that there were many studies looking at the impacts of macroeconomic <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> on macro aggregates and also severa...|$|R

One such initiative is Creative Partnerships (CP). Funded predominantly from the Arts portfolio, CP brings creative practitioners into schools with the intention of bringing change to teaching and learning, and, more widely, of achieving whole school change. Using a corpus of policy texts and interviews, we examine the claims made within CP about innovation and indicate the rhetorical means by which the impression of radical change is married to the standards agenda. In particular, we highlight the ways in which texts re-work traditions of progressive change. We argue that this rhetorical recuperation of the ideals of an earlier period is a sign of a more <b>general</b> <b>policy</b> <b>adjustment</b> in English education. However, since it is combined with a continuing commitment to market-driven change, it cannot be said to be indicative of a new policy settlement. <br /...|$|R

Structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> affect women differently in their various roles :n development. Women face various constraints on the choice cf participating in the labour force.

This paper argue. :, that structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> are likely to negatively affect the employment position cf women. First, retrenchment has affected mainly sectors where women are concentrated like: social, personal and community services, finance, real estate and business services. Second, the public sector which has been an employer of the last resort will have very few new jobs during structural adjustment period. Women {{are likely to be}} affected because of their low levels of education. Third, women will join the informal sector in large numbers due to retrenchment arid liberalization policies.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} impact of <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the vulnerability of women and children to HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. A conceptual framework, composed of five different pathways of causation, is used for the evaluation. These five pathways connect changes at the macro level (e. g. removal of food subsidies) with effects at the meso (e. g. higher food prices) and micro levels (e. g. exposure of women and children to commercial sex) that influence the vulnerability of women and children to HIV/AIDS. Published literature on <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> and socioeconomic determinants of HIV/AIDS among women and children in sub-Saharan Africa was reviewed to explore the cause-effect relationships included in the theoretical framework. Evidence suggests that <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> may inadvertently produce conditions facilitating the exposure of women and children to HIV/AIDS. Complex research designs are needed to further investigate this relationship. A shift in emphasis from an individual approach to a socioeconomic approach in the study of HIV infection among women and children in the developing world is suggested. Given the potential for <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> to exacerbate the AIDS pandemic among women and children, a careful examination of the effects of these policies on maternal and child welfare is urgently needed...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the Korean {{government}} {{has sought to}} encourage rural young people to enter farming and older farmers to leave it. The government‟s tool for promoting this intergenerational change has been agricultural structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy,</b> which includes farm entry policy, farm exit policy, competitiveness policy, and rural development policy. However, {{the number of young}} farmers has decreased and number of old farmers has increased. This research investigates why agricultural structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> has failed, analyzing survey data on farm entry and exit using regression analysis, and with procedures enhanced by bootstrapping. The conclusions of the research are as follows. Agricultural structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> does not induce young people to enter farming mainly because: 1) Rural young people have as little enthusiasm for farming as their urban counterparts; and 2) Competitiveness policy cancels the effects of farm entry policy. Meanwhile, agricultural structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> has not induced old farmers to retire mainly because: 1) Older farmers are as reluctant to leave farming as younger ones; 2) Farm exit policy does not promote farm exit; and 3) Competitiveness policy and rural development policy, as well as farming conditions and farm exit barriers, cancel the effects of farm exit policy.

40|$|In Tanzania, fiscal <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> {{emphasized}} {{an increase}} in tax revenue and cuts in public spending to correct the fiscal deficit. However, <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> restricted the impact of fiscal policies in correcting fiscal deficit because they led to a low GDP growth and narrowed the tax base. The government overlooked {{the need to have}} an alternative tax base that could compensate for the fall in GDP growth. In that respect, the main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the impact of fiscal <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> in correcting the fiscal deficit in Tanzania in different adjustment periods in the 1973 - 2000 period. The thesis adopts a country study approach to analyse the effect of changes in the tax structure on the fiscal position using the primary balance as a proxy. The study also uses time series econometric methods to examine the impact of economic policy regime changes on public spending and GDP growth and the implications for fiscal policy in Tanzania. The study finds that changes in macroeconomic conditions either temporarily expanded or narrowed the tax bases and influenced the correction of the fiscal deficit in different years. Fiscal <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> were pro-cyclical, thus leading to low GDP growth. This limited the effect of changes in the tax structure in reducing the fiscal deficit. Lastly, policy regime changes led to public spending instability and a structural break in the GDP data series. This signified that economic policy reforms caused fundamental changes in the economy, with implications for macroeconomic and fiscal policies in Tanzania. In sum, the results suggest that pro-cyclical policies are harmful for countries pursuing fiscal <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> to correct a fiscal deficit...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{benefits}} of intergenerational risk-sharing through both private funded pensions and via the public debt. We use a multi-period overlapping generation model with a pay-as-you-go pension pillar, a funded pension pillar and a government. Shocks are smoothed via the public debt and variations in the indexation of pension entitlements and pension contributions. The intensity of these adjustments increases when the pension funding ratio or public debt gets closer to their boundaries. The best-performing pension arrangement is a hybrid funded scheme in which both contributions and entitlement indexation are simultaneously deployed as stabilisation instruments. We find that contribution and indexation <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> are substitutes {{and the same is}} the case for contribution and tax <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies.</b> By contrast, indexation and tax <b>adjustment</b> <b>policies</b> are complements.

40|$|Multivariate process {{adjustment}} {{in the presence}} of fixed adjustment costs is investigated in this paper. A fixed adjustment cost leads to a trade-off between adjusting a process continuously and allowing the process to drift until a bound is violated. The problem of determining the best bounded <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> and the optimal bounded adjustment parameter is addressed. Although the univariate bounded adjustment problem has received interest in the past, there has been little focus on the multivariate case in the literature. It has been shown that in the univariate case, the shape of the optimal <b>adjustment</b> <b>policy</b> is a dead band. Determining the shape of the optimal dead region and the parameter that defines this region in the multivariate case is a difficult problem. A State-Space model is formulated for the multivariate bounded process adjustment problem and a Kalman Filter based controller is used. With the help of simulation, the optimal bounded adjustment parameter is computed for two dead regionsubspace shapes.
