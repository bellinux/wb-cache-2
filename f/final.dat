5|$|A {{large number}} of {{spin-off}} video games have also been made for the <b>Final</b> Fantasy series.

Dissidia <b>Final</b> Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main <b>Final</b> Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} <b>Final</b> Fantasy III in 1990, Square {{planned to}} develop two <b>Final</b> Fantasy games—one for the Nintendo Entertainment System {{and the other}} for the forthcoming Super NES, to be known as <b>Final</b> Fantasy IV and <b>Final</b> Fantasy V respectively. Due to financial and scheduling constraints, Square dropped plans for the NES game and continued development of the SNES version, retitled <b>Final</b> Fantasy IV. A mock-up screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little other information exists about it. Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that the NES version was approximately 80% complete and certain ideas were reused for the SNES version.|$|E

5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, <b>Final</b> Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through <b>Final</b> Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several <b>Final</b> Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as <b>Final</b> Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as <b>Final</b> Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of <b>Final</b> Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was to take this one step further, and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E

Liverpool and Chelsea had previously met nine times in the FA Cup, including two semi-finals (most recently in 2006), although they had never met in the <b>final</b> before. Chelsea had {{the upper hand in}} those nine meetings, winning five times to Liverpool's four; however, Liverpool won both semi-finals between the two clubs, both on neutral grounds. The only domestic cup <b>final</b> to feature both teams was the 2005 League Cup <b>final,</b> which Chelsea won 3–2 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Artistic design, {{including}} {{character and}} monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from <b>Final</b> Fantasy through <b>Final</b> FantasyVI. Amano also handled title logo designs {{for all of}} the main series and the image illustrations from <b>Final</b> FantasyVII onward. Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's designs were more adaptable to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from <b>Final</b> FantasyVII through <b>Final</b> FantasyX; for <b>Final</b> FantasyIX, however, character designs were handled by Shukō Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. Nomura is also the character designer of the Kingdom Hearts series, Compilation of <b>Final</b> FantasyVII, and Fabula Nova Crystallis: <b>Final</b> Fantasy. Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and Akihiko Yoshida.

5|$|Both the Perfect Works and Ultimania {{books have}} focused {{primarily}} on Square and Square Enix's role-playing video game franchises, such as the <b>Final</b> Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series; over 45 of the 75 books are for games related to the <b>Final</b> Fantasy series.
