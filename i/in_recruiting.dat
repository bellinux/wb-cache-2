40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infestation and its related risk factors <b>in</b> the <b>recruits</b> at Hulunbuir pastureland and Ala Shan Desert. Methods　Nine hundred male recruits (16 - 24 years old) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. H. pylori infection was detected by 13 C-urea breath test, and the related risk factors were surveyed by using questionnaires. The data of risk factors for H. pylori infection were analyzed by using chi-square test and logistic regression. Results　The H. pylori infection rate was 47. 5 % <b>in</b> <b>recruits</b> located <b>in</b> Hulunbuir pastureland, while it was 44. 8 % <b>in</b> <b>recruits</b> located <b>in</b> Ala Shan Desert. The H. pylori infection rate was higher <b>in</b> <b>recruits</b> from the West China and Central China, and higher <b>in</b> the <b>recruits</b> from the rural area than those from city (P< 0. 05). The level of serum pepsinogen (PG I and PGⅡ) was elevated, but PGR (PGⅠ/PGⅡ) lowered <b>in</b> the <b>recruits</b> with H. pylori infection (P< 0. 05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors as hand-washing with soap, smoking, halitosis, and halitosis with acne were positively correlated with H. pylori infection. Conclusions　H. pylori infection rate of new <b>recruits</b> is lower <b>in</b> Inner Mongolia compared to the finding of previous studies.

40|$|Objective 　To {{observe the}} effects of {{systematic}} mental intervention, with combined centralized teaching, group interview and individual consulting, on mental health, personality and coping style <b>in</b> <b>recruits,</b> and explore an optimal intervention model for recruits' mental health. Methods 　Two thousand and sixteen <b>recruits</b> <b>in</b> one unit {{were involved in the}} present study, among them 1064 were allocated to study group, and the remaining 952 to control group. <b>Recruits</b> <b>in</b> study group received centralized teaching with battalion as a unit, and received group interview in squad or platoon as a unit, and meanwhile individual interview was conducted. Symptoms Checklist- 90 (SCL- 90), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) were filled one month after they were enlisted in the army and 3 days before the training ended. <b>Recruits</b> <b>in</b> control group undertook the same tests mentioned above only 3 days before the training ended. Results 　The total score and factor scores except hostility in SCL- 90 test were significantly lower after than before systematic mental intervention (P 0. 05). The total score and factor scores except paranoia in SCL- 90 test were significantly lower in study group than in control group after intervention (P 0. 05), the score of active coping was significantly higher (P< 0. 001), and of negative coping was significantly lower (P< 0. 001) after than before intervention.

He proposed a new training regime, with a national syllabus that {{increased the number of}} hours per week of training and the duration of training to twelve weeks. This led to strikes at the camps at Casula and Liverpool. Rioting soldiers clashed with police at Circular Quay and at Central Station striking soldiers were shot and one killed by soldiers sent to return them to Liverpool.

5|$|In Punjab, the CID, {{although}} {{aware of}} possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915. A dedicated force was formed, {{headed by the}} Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members Liaqat Hayat Khan (later head of Punjab CID himself). In February that year, the CID was successful <b>in</b> <b>recruiting</b> the services of Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan. Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able to infiltrate the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment. Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able {{to pass on the}} information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence. As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the mutiny day to the evening of 19 February, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day. No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Hayat Khan of the change of plans. Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to escape under the cover of answering the call of nature.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1626 the Tatars invaded again. With an army {{estimated}} at between 15,000 and 20,000, they raided and pillaged territories {{as far north}} as the Podole Voivodeship, passing Ternopil and Terebovlia, while some advanced units reached the cities of Lutsk, Volodymyr-Volynskyi and Lviv. In response, Koniecpolski gathered some 13,000 troops and moved to intercept the Tatars, but they refused to engage. Eventually Koniecpolski defeated the rear guard of the main Tatar army, which crossed the borders with much treasure and slaves. Later that year, fearing a repeat invasion, Koniecpolski violated a Sejm resolution <b>in</b> <b>recruiting</b> and fielding an army of 8,000 against an expected Tatar second wave. During this time, Koniecpolski was aided in a number of battles by a highly capable officer, Bohdan Khmelnytsky; Khmelnytsky would also score a major victory over the Tatars later that year, after Koniecpolski had departed north to a new battlefield near the Baltic Sea.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} cricketers, Hobbs did not {{immediately}} join the army, but worked in a munitions factory, possibly as a clerk. Writing later, Hobbs related that he was criticised for not joining up, but suggested he did not realise how serious the war would be, and was conscious {{of the need to}} care for his family. From March 1915 he found extra work as coach at Westminster School, and in May began to play on Saturdays as a professional for Idle in the Bradford Cricket League. The continuation of competitive cricket in Bradford, when all other such cricket had ceased, was controversial. Several clubs hired top-class professionals and matches became very popular. Although his arrival was eagerly anticipated, Hobbs never reached the expected heights, averaging 36.63 throughout the 1915 season. But his signing provoked an angry exchange of correspondence between the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke, who was highly critical of the employment of professionals, and John Booth, the president of the Bradford League. Hobbs never publicly commented on the matter, but was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>recruiting</b> Frank Woolley to play in the league. He continued to play for Idle in 1916, and was more successful, scoring 790 runs at 52.60 and taking 65 wickets at 6.27. But his conscription after the season into the Royal Flying Corps ended his regular cricket in the league.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, Bedri Pejani, the {{chairman}} of the Second League of Prizren, an organization created after the Italian surrender to advance the interests of Kosovo Albanians, proposed to Hitler that a force of 120,000–150,000 Kosovo Albanian volunteers be raised to fight the Yugoslav and Albanian partisans. Pejani asked the German leadership to give the Albanians equipment and supplies to fight the communist insurgency, and requested the expansion of the borders of the German puppet state of Albania {{at the expense of the}} German-occupied Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia and the German occupied territory of Montenegro. These requests were not fulfilled, but in April 1944 Himmler ordered the establishment of a new Albanian volunteer division, which was subsequently named after the medieval Albanian warrior George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. By this point, the Germans and some members of the Albanian puppet government believed that about 50,000 men could be recruited from Albanian-held territory to join the SS. The SS had initially envisioned a force of 10,000–12,000 men for an Albanian SS division. Himmler saw the Muslim Albanians as a potential source of manpower in Germany's war against the Yugoslav Partisans, who faced significant difficulties <b>in</b> <b>recruiting</b> Kosovo Albanians to join their ranks. The Germans found that Kosovo Albanians were more cooperative than Albanians in Albania itself. This was mainly because they feared a return to Yugoslav rule. Consequently, many of the division's recruits were Kosovo Albanians. The quality of most of these recruits was poor, and only 6,000 were considered suitable to receive training. Those that were accepted were a combination of about 1,500 former Royal Yugoslav Army prisoners of war, elements of the failed Albanian army and gendarmerie, volunteers from both pre-war and expanded Albania, and conscripts from families that had more than two sons. The enlistment of Albanian civilians was organized in close cooperation with the Albanian puppet government.|$|E
