5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause <b>damping</b> <b>off</b> or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi {{are less likely to be}} the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} the Tasmanian waratah provide ample nectar and hence are a food source for bird {{visitors}} to the garden. The species can be propagated by seed, though seedlings may succumb to <b>damping</b> <b>off.</b> Growing in a natural shady location delays flowering by two to four weeks, while growing in a cooler conditions (due either to latitude or altitude) can delay flowering by up to six weeks. Pruning flower heads can promote subsequent growth of leaves and branches. It grows best in a cool climate with ample water and good drainage, and has done well in cultivation in England. The Royal Horticultural Society gave it an Award of Merit in 1934 and a First Class Certificate in 1938. The relationship between light duration and intensity, temperature, vegetative growth and flower production is poorly known. Yellow forms in cultivation were originally propagated from a plant found on Mount Wellington.|$|E

40|$|During the 2012 growing season, several {{thousands}} of acres of corn in southern Iowa were replanted in late May because of poor stands caused by seedling disease. Many of the fields affected were planted between April 23 and 27.

Approximately, one week later, <b>damped</b> <b>off</b> seedlings were reported in the area...|$|R

Summer watering aids in growth. The plant may take several years to flower, although plants grown from cuttings may flower in two years. Banksia serrata is also used in bonsai.|$|E

5000|$|Pythium aphanidermatum is {{responsible}} for pre and post emergence <b>damping</b> <b>off.</b> Pre-emergence <b>damping</b> <b>off</b> is when the seed is infected prior to germination.

[...] P. aphanidermatum can also cause root rot. Symptoms of root rot include stunted growth, chlorotic leaves, leaf drop, and wilting. The infection begins at the root tip, and can cause the infected region to lose its protective outer layer, exposing the inner root to other pathogens ...|$|E

5000|$|Pythium irregulare is an oomycete {{that causes}} pre- and post-emergence <b>damping</b> <b>off,</b> {{as well as}} root rot. Pre-emergence <b>damping</b> <b>off</b> occurs when P. irregulare infects seeds before they emerge, causing them to rot and turn brown, thus {{preventing}} successful growth. Alternatively, post-emergence <b>damping</b> <b>off</b> occurs when the oomycete infects just after the seed has germinated. This usually causes infection in the roots and stem which appears as water soaking and necrosis. Depending on the severity, plants may collapse or be severely stunted. In plants that are older and more established, P. irregulare causes root rot. This will initially cause necrotic lesions, which leads to chlorosis, reduced yield, poor growth, and stunting due to inadequate water and nutrient acquisition by the roots. Additionally, P. irregulare is often found coinfecting with other Pythium species. All three of these diseases caused by P. irregulare {{can be caused by}} other pathogens as well, so a disease diagnosis is not necessarily indicative of P. irregulare ...|$|E

5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been <b>damped,</b> turning <b>off</b> the heat source.|$|R

50|$|In {{a chimney}} flue, a <b>damper</b> closes <b>off</b> the flue {{to keep the}} weather (and birds and other animals) out and warm or cool air in. This is usually done in the summer, but also {{sometimes}} in the winter between uses. In some cases, the damper may also be partly closed to help control the rate of combustion. The damper may be accessible only by reaching up into the fireplace by hand or with a woodpoker, or sometimes by a lever or knob that sticks down or out. On a wood-burning stove or similar device, it is usually {{a handle on the}} vent duct as in an air conditioning system.

5000|$|Providing {{fresh air}} and {{removing}} firedamp from pits with a single shaft was a problem as explosive gases accumulated. An early solution was to send a collier or fireman, swathed in wet rags and armed with a long pole with a lighted candle, into the workings to explode any accumulated gases before work began, a practice that did not always work. At Haigh in 1688 it was recorded that [...] "the fiery <b>damp</b> went <b>off</b> twice, but did little hurt". A system of coursed air circulation in the workings {{was introduced in the}} 1760s using walls and doors leading to the employment of trappers, children as young as six or seven, working in darkness who opened and closed the doors.Braziers or fire baskets suspended in the shaft, and by the late 1700s underground furnaces, in combination with stoppings and doors improved the air flow. These methods were not without danger from fires or explosions.|$|R
50|$|The {{seat of the}} {{explosion}} was found by Mr Foster to be an underground engine used to haul coals to the pit base. The engineman had added fresh coal to the fire and closed the <b>damper</b> before going <b>off</b> shift at 16:00. The damper should have remained slightly open to allow burnt gas from the fire to escape up the chimney. It was supposed that the damper had been closed fully and partial combustion had occurred effectively generating town gas ("acting as a retort"). The gas eventually escaped and the resultant explosion caused major damage to the boiler and flue.|$|R
