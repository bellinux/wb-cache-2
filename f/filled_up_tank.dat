40|$|During {{the last}} thirty years a bundle of {{accidents}} in large size tank beds for carbon storage was fixed. In spite of it there is not any existed method for effective detection of faults and cracks in <b>filled</b> <b>up</b> <b>tank</b> beds. In this article a variety of emergency situations with tank beds for oil products storage was analyzed and new technical decisions were suggested. These decisions are based on usage of devices of nondestructive testing for localization of fatigue cracks in the circumference weld of large size tanks and organization of monitoring of deflected mode of an object by way of finding moment of cracks formation. The devices applied in this method are ultra-sonic thickness gauge and highly sensitive magnetoelastic sensor. The last one was developed by author. This cracks determination method practically allows to find out cracks and defects of I, II and III type. It also allows to decrease financial, temporal and technological investments for investigation of tank beds for oil products storage without oil products removal and completely prevent emergency situations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} the minimization of water wastage at the overhead tank due to overflow and prevents the motor from running continuously and consumes power unnecessarily. Two conditions are always {{necessary for the}} motor to run. The overhead tank {{to be filled with}} water should be dirt free and there should be enough water at the source from which water is to be drawn. When this two condition are satisfied the motor will run and start <b>filling</b> <b>up</b> the <b>tank.</b> After the water touch a certain level {{at the top of the}} overhead tank, the motor will stop running automatically and prevent the overflow of water. Water level will decrease due to the utilization of water but the motor will still be in off mode state. When the level reached down a certain level at the bottom than the motor will run again and start <b>filling</b> <b>up</b> the overhead <b>tank.</b> Water level indicator is also incorporated along with the work. This work is designed, implemented and simulated as shown in section III. This can be use in any organization, educational institute or domestic house. The main objective of this paper is cost minimization to build the circuit and making it work efficiently...|$|R

25|$|Electrical {{immersion}} heaters may heat water immediately {{adjacent to the}} heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the <b>tank,</b> progressively <b>filling</b> <b>up</b> the <b>tank.</b> This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the immersion heater is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|R

When it came for the weigh-in, Fernanda was representing the White team, Tanya for the Red team and Hap for the Blue team. Hap lost 13 pounds (3.37% of weight lost), but when Fernanda stepped on the scale, she only lost two pounds (0.84% weight lost) Tanya needed to lose more than two pounds to keep the Red team safe, and she loses four (1.63% weight lost). This meant that the White Team has lost the weigh-in again and Fernanda fell below the red line and was automatically eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Beneath Venezuelan soil lies {{an ocean}} of crude—the world’s largest reserves—an oil patch that shaped {{the nature of the}} global energy business. Unfortunately, a {{dysfunctional}} anti-American, leftist government controls this vast resource and has used its wealth to foster voter support, ultimately wreaking economic havoc. Crude Nation reveals the ways in which this mismanagement has led to Venezuela’s economic ruin and turned the country into a cautionary tale for the world. Raúl Gallegos, a former Caracas-based oil correspondent, paints a picture both vivid and analytical of the country’s economic decline, the government’s foolhardy economic policies, and the wrecked lives of Venezuelans. Without transparency, the Venezuelan government uses oil money to subsidize life for its citizens in myriad unsustainable ways, while regulating nearly every aspect of day-to-day existence in Venezuela. This has created a paradox in which citizens can <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> the <b>tanks</b> of their SUVs for less than one American dollar while simultaneously enduring nationwide shortages of staples such as milk, sugar, and toilet paper. Gallegos’s insightful analysis shows how mismanagement has ruined Venezuela again and again over the past century and lays out how Venezuelans can begin to fix their country, a nation that can {{play an important role in}} the global energy industry...|$|R
