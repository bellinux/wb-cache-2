This computational view entails that there are distinct forms in which confidence is represented and used in the brain, including distributional confidence, pertaining to neural representations of probability distributions, and summary confidence, pertaining to scalar summaries of those distributions. Summary confidence is, normatively, derived or “read out” from distributional confidence.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a layout driven {{synthesis}} approach for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The approach attempts to identify alternative wires and alternative functions for wires that cannot be routed {{due to the}} limited routing resources in FPGA. The alternative wires (in the logic level) that can be routed through less congested areas substitute the unroutable wires without changing the circuit’s functionality. Allowing the logic blocks to have alternative functions also increases the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>routing.</b> The redundancy addition and removal techniques are used to identify such alternative wires. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach. For a set of randomly selected benchmark circuits, on the average, 30 %- 50 % of wires have alternative wires. These {{results indicate that the}} routing flexibility can be substantially increased by considering these alternative wires. Our prototype system successfully completed the routing for two AT&T designs that cannot be handled by an FPGA router alone. The proposed synthesis technique can also be applied to standard cell and gate array designs to reduce the routing area. ...|$|E

P 2 P systems are fundamentally characterized by: {{a large number of}} geographically distributed nodes that require little infrastructural support from the under-lying network; an unbounded number of nodes (a permanently evolving set of nodes); and consequently no process/node with global knowledge of the system structure. Interesting features of such networks in-clude the fact that they allow a rich set of nodes to act as relay points for other nodes, and a rich set of overlay paths (selected by peers) to be constructed. These features have traditionally made overlay routing – where end hosts have the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> traffic to their destinations through the desired choice of intermediate overlay nodes (unlike in IP routing) – a very attractive approach for end-to-end performance optimizations in P 2 P networks.

The classical Dial-a-ride problem enables to assign users to vehicles by minimization of a cost function under constraints. However, the projected itinerary of the vehicles is calculated on a global approach considering automatically each new users independently and a dispatcher tests a match between the user and all available service vehicles. Thus, matching calculation time is restricting for the large operational services. The objective {{of this paper is}} a reformulation of the problem with more flexibility and an aggregated solution to optimize calculation time. This modelling is based on a mobility system of transit vehicles with their own dispatcher and station infrastructures. The vehicles are shared dynamically and make extra-stops to collect travelers with various destinations. In addition, the users of the service have not any transfer and are transported directly to their destination stations. We constructed an agent-based model which maximizes the utility of each vehicle while satisfying its own constraints. The minimum travel and waiting times of the users and maximum occupancy of vehicles are the default ones. We propose then a new formulation of the problem on the maximization of the vehicle utility. Passengers’ assignment to vehicles is controlled directly by the vehicle drivers on an aggregated level by origin destination pair. A case study illustrates the theoretical model and compares the efficiency of several service choices. A fleet of small vehicles seems to minimize the user waiting time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{fragility}} and {{the poor}} resilience of the Internet are manifested by the severe impact of network activities and the slow recovery after an earthquake damaged undersea cables and disrupted telephone and Internet access in East Asia in December 2006. Except the inefficiency of routing protocols, lack of efficient network monitoring mechanisms and lack of economic incentives to encourage service providers (SPs) to act cooperatively and promptly are other important reasons. In this paper, we build a trust-based economic framework called TRECON to address these open problems in Internet routing. The novelty of TRECON is combining an adaptive personalized trust model with an economic approach to provide independent trust-based routing among SPs. TRECON provides flexible policy support based on the trust-based economic mechanism so that autonomous organizations with varied interests and optimization criteria can be smoothly integrated together to achieve better adaptiveness and self-management. Through introducing the economic model, TRECON explores {{a new way to}} solve the economic problems and incentives issues in the collaboration among SPs. To show the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> policies support, we propose four typical routing policies under the TRECON framework. We evaluate our approach by comparing these four trust-derived routing policies with the classical global shortest path routing approach. We find that the policy based on trustworthiness performs much better than all other policies under different network topologies in terms of delay, success delivery rate, and economic effects.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a genetic algorithm-based job-shop scheduler for a flexible multi-product, parallel machine sheet metal job shop. Most {{of the existing}} research has focused only on permutation job shops in which the manufacturing sequence and routings are strictly in a predefined order. This effectively meant that only the jobs shops {{with little or no}} flexibility could be modeled using these models. The real life job shops may have <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> and sequencing. Our paper proposes one such model where variable sequences and multiple routings are possible. Another limitation of the existing literature was found to be negligence of the setup times. In many job shops like sheet metal shops, setup time may be a very sizable portion of the total make-span of the jobs, hence setup times will be considered in this work. One more flexibility type arises as a direct consequence of the routing flexibility. When there are multiple machines (parallel machines) to perform the same operation, the job could be routed to {{one or more of these}} machines to reduce the make-span. This is possible in situations where each job consists of a pre-defined quantity of a specified product. In other words, same job is quantity-wise split into two or more parts whenever it reduces the makespan. This effectively assumes that the setup cost is negligible. This model has been implemented on a real-life industry problem using VB. Net programming language. The results from the scheduler are found to be better than those obtained by simple sequencing rules. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Network {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by allowing multipath, adaptive routing. Adaptive routing allows more freedom in paths taken by messages, spreading the load over the physical channels in a network more evenly. However, the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> adaptive <b>routing</b> introduces new possibilities of deadlock. A variety <b>of</b> adaptive <b>routing</b> algorithms have been suggested to improve the network performance while preventing deadlock.

We describe a new adaptive routing algorithm, planar-adaptive routing, for low-cost and high-performance multicomputer networks. Planar-adaptive routing which is provably deadlock and livelock free, significantly reduces the hardware requirement for deadlock prevention by restricting adaptivity to two dimensions at a time. Planar-adaptive routing requires only three virtual channels for deadlock prevention in any dimensional mesh networks. Planar-adaptive routing can be extended to support fault tolerance. The extended algorithm allows networks to tolerate an arbitrary number of faults with small amounts of additional hardware. In addition, planar-adaptive routing can be extended to allow in-order packet delivery and out-of-order adaptive routing simultaneously. Planar...|$|R

This paper proposes a Static Routing strategy with an objective of extending {{its ability to}} adapt to logical network topology changes, equipment failures or network outages 'on the fly'. This strategy will involve discovery of all possible Static Routes from a specific source router to destination router, analyzing and ordering their applicability using optimality principle based Sink Tree approach. A random subnet composed of fifteen routers is simulated and mapped to Sink Tree and most obvious paths between random source and destination are analyzed. Static Routes are traced to extract information about hop count from source to destination. The hop count information is recorded for each Static Route trace and comparative analysis is performed. Based on this comparison the Static Route are sorted in order of preference as per optimality principle and are offered to router as secondary routes in event of failure of primary preferred Static Route, thereby retaining the benefits <b>of</b> Static <b>Routing</b> while still availing the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> Dynamic <b>Routing</b> to some extent...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} great {{advantages}} to using pneumatic conveying systems for transport of materials, {{one of these}} being <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> – a pneumatic pipeline can incorporate multiple changes of direction {{without the need for}} transfer points and additional drives which are needed everywhere a mechanical conveying system changes direction. However, one of the disadvantages of using bends in pneumatic conveyors is the wear of the bends, if the material being conveyed is at all abrasive e. g. if the particles are hard and angular such as minerals, coal, ash etc. Wear also often occurs in long straight sections just after pipe joints. This wear problem is often very costly, resulting in many unplanned stoppages for repair on systems conveying these materials, as well as producing severe mess from leakage of the material after a puncture. There are many different means of providing wear protection for bends and straight pipe sections, but they too can be costly, with the best wear resistant materials costing as much as 5000 per bend or even more to apply; and the wrong choice can lead to much wasted money if it does not give the protection hoped for. Other wear resistant solutions can severely increase the energy consumption of the conveyor, or limit its throughput, if applied too liberally. Hence {{it is very important to}} choose carefully the right means of wear protection. This paper will review the common sites and causes of conveying pipeline wear, and show that with the latest technology for characterising the erosiveness of the conveyed material, it is possible to choose a wear protection solution that will give cost-effective protection...|$|E

Logic blocks are composed of clusters with LUTs and flip flops. In particular for a logic cluster with I inputs and N K- input LUTs a set of N × K (I+N-K+ 1) : 1 multiplexers {{can be used to}} connect logic cluster input to LUT input. It can increase the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> FPGA <b>routing</b> resources. The flexibility can then be used to reduce the implementation area.

40|$|Architecture {{development}} for FPGAs has typically {{been a very}} empirical discipline, requiring the synthesis of benchmark circuits into candidate architectures. This is difficult {{to do in the}} early stages of architecture development, however, because there is no complete architecture to synthesize circuits into. The effort required to create prototype tools for nascent architectures is far too great for every new logic block or routing architecture idea, and so it would be extremely helpful to have a simple and intuitive FPGA interconnect model to guide the architect. In this paper we present such an interconnect model for island-style FPGAs, whose single output is the estimated routing demand (often referred to as W, the number <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> tracks per channel) for an FPGA as a function of several logic block, circuit and routing architecture parameters. The goal of this model is to be as simple as possible, while still accurate enough to be useful, to provide understanding and intuition on FPGA routing. Our methodology is empirical – we propose model forms based on empirical observations, intuition and some derivation, and then fit models to experimentally generated data. We show the development of the model in stages, beginning with a fully flexible FPGA, and gradually proceeding to one which includes the key parameters that control the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> FPGA <b>routing,</b> and one key parameter describing the logic block and another relating to the typical circuit.

40|$|The {{convergence}} on IP of a {{wide variety}} of traffic types has strengthened the need for service differentiation. Service differentiation relies on two equally important components: (i) resource allocation, i. e., what resources does a given service class have access to; and (ii) contention resolution, i. e., how is access to shared resources arbitrated between services classes. The latter has been well studied with numerous mechanisms, e. g., scheduling and buffer management, supporting it in modern routers. In contrast, relatively few studies exist on the former, and in particular on the impact <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> that determines the resources a given service class is assigned to. This is the focus of the paper, which seeks to investigate how routing influences a network’s ability to efficiently support different service classes. Of particular interest is the extent to which the ability to route service classes separately is beneficial. This question is explored for a base configuration involving two classes with either similar or entirely different service objectives (cost functions). The paper’s contributions are in demonstrating and quantifying the benefits that the added <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> different (dual) <b>routing</b> affords, and in developing an efficient heuristic for computing jointly optimal routing solutions.

Such isolation and time gap have become major limiting factors to fully utilize the manufacturing resources, and adversely impact on overall productivity. In Mass Customization environment, the isolation and time gap between process planning and production scheduling have become even more significant problems. The motivation to integrate process planning and production scheduling is developed to address such problems by unleashing the under-utilized resource <b>flexibility.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this research is to develop a novel framework to integrate process planning and production scheduling tasks in Mass Customization environment following make-to-order policy. In this framework, one novel data structure called 'Generic Production Capability' or GPC is proposed to model the production capabilities of resources on meta-level. Process planning in the framework will employ one declarative processing mechanism to generate process plans capturing all feasible production routings for the released customer orders on demand by linking and configuring proper sets of GPCs in sequence, but leave the selection <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> to production scheduling stage.

The obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (OARSMT) problem has become an important problem in the physical design stage of VLSI circuits. This problem has attracted a lot of attentions in research and several approaches have been proposed {{to solve this problem}} effectively. In this paper, we will present a heuristic maze routing based approach to solve this OARSMT problem. It is commonly believed that maze routing based approaches can only handle small scale problems and {{there is a lack of}} an effective multi-terminal variant to handle multi-pin nets in practice. We will show in this paper that maze routing based approaches can also handle large scale OARSMT problems effectively. Our approach is based on the searching process as in maze routing and can handle multi-pin nets very well in both solution quality, running time and memory space usage. We have compared our results with those of the previous works and can show that we can out-perform the best previous results on this problem [15] by giving an OARSMT with 2. 01 % less wire length on average and can make a 27. 04 % improvement in wire length in comparison with a lower bound of the optimal solution on average, while the running times are all very short and comparable to those in [15]. Besides, due to the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> maze <b>routing,</b> we can handle different kinds of obstacles with different convex or concave rectilinear shapes directly without a need to partition each blockage into a set of rectangular sub-blockages, which will increase the size of the problem.

However, most existing works only {{focus on how}} to satisfy the network-oriented QoS, such as throughput, delay, and packet loss rate rather than application-oriented QoS such as the userperceived video quality. Although there are some research efforts which use application-centric video quality as the routing metric, the calculation of video quality is based on some predefined rate-distortion function or model without considering the impact of video coding and decoding (including error concealment) on the network path selection and the resulting perceived video quality. Moreover, unlike network-centric routing metrics such as hop count, average delay, or average success probability of packet transmission, end-to-end video distortion cannot be calculated either additively or multiplicatively in a hop-by-hop fashion due to the dependency among packets introduced by error concealment algorithms. As a result, most existing works use either exhaustive search or heuristic methods to find the optimal path, which leads to high computational complexity and/or suboptimal solutions to the routing problem in video transmission.

While synthetic mobility models have been largely used to measure quantitative aspects <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> protocols, they are not sufficient as they do not capture reliably the properties of movement in the real life scenarios. In this paper we present some experimentation done in THE_ONE simulation environment, involving our M 2 MShare, a peer-to-peer (P 2 P) delay tolerant file sharing platform for mobile networks. For testing purposes we have chosen the Working Day Movement (WDM) model which is shown to make a good approximation of human mobility patterns and provides the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> configuring real life test scenarios.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> connection-oriented traffic in {{wireless}} ad-hoc networks with energy efficiency. We outlinethe trade-offs that arise by the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> wireless nodes totransmit at different power levels and define a framework forformulating the problem <b>of</b> session <b>routing</b> from the perspective ofenergy expenditure. A set of heuristics are developed for determiningend-to-end unicast paths with sufficient bandwidth and transceiverresources, in which nodes use local information in order to selecttheir transmission power and bandwidth allocation. We propose a setofmetrics that associate each link transmission with a cost andconsiderboth the cases of plentiful and limited bandwidth resources, thelatter jointly {{with a set of}} channel allocation algorithms. Performance is captured by call blocking probability and averageconsumed energy. A detailed simulation model has been developed andused to evaluate the algorithms for a variety of networks...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{definitions}} <b>of</b> vehicle <b>routing</b> problems {{often lack}} handling of uncertain parameters and <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> constraints. The most popular approaches to these aspects are probability distributions for uncertainty and penalty-based goal function for flexibility. In this paper a di#erent view is proposed: fuzzy sets framework, modeling both imprecision and flexibility. Theoretical considerations are presented and some practical implications are shown...|$|R
40|$|Routers are {{probably}} the most important component of a NoC, as the performance of the whole network is driven by the routers’ performance. Cost for the whole network in terms of area will also be minimised if the router design is kept small. A new application specific processor architecture for implementing NoC routers is proposed in this master thesis, which will be called µNP (Micro-Network Processor). The aim is to offer a solution {{in which there is a}} trade-off between the high performance of routers implemented in hardware and the high level <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> that could be achieved by loading a software that routed packets into a GPP. Therefore, a study including the design of a hardware based router and a GPP based router has been conducted. In this project the first version of the µNP has been designed and a complete instruction set, along with some sample programs, is also proposed. The results show that, in the best case for all implementation options, µNP was 7. 5 times slower than the hardware based router. It has also behaved more than 100 times faster than the GPP based router, keeping almost the same degree <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> for <b>routing</b> purposes within NoC...|$|R
40|$|There are {{generally}} eight common types <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> in manufacturing, and <b>routing</b> <b>flexibility</b> is one <b>of</b> them. As implementing routing flexibility {{is an expensive}} proposition, many system designers have therefore aimed at providing the optimum level <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> under certain operating conditions. This paper presents a framework based on a Taguchi experimental design for studying the effects of different levels <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> <b>flexibility</b> {{on the performance of}} a flexible manufacturing system. The system performances considered are makespan, lead time, and machine utilization. Other factors that will affect the system performance are also investigated, such as product mix, production volume, and random machine failure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — IP routers {{come with}} a very small set <b>of</b> unicast <b>routing</b> protocols. Network-wide {{optimization}} {{at the level of}} the IP is often frustrated by the characteristics <b>of</b> the legacy <b>routing</b> protocols. The current cycle of research, development, deployment, and standardization is a long and complex one, making it difficult to introduce changes to existing protocols. The goal of metarouting [1] is to allow network operators the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> defining their own routing protocols in a highlevel and declarative manner. Metarouting in [1] is based on the <b>Routing</b> Algebra formalism <b>of</b> Sobrinho [2], which is expressive enough to capture complex policy-based <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> the kind used with the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [3], [4], [5]. Routing algebras are equipped with preference orders (total preorders) that are used to select best routes. Sobrinho showed that distributed algorithms in the Bellman-Ford family will converg...|$|R
