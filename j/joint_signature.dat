In this paper, we propose an extension of existing mobile payment models to introduce an extended mobile payment service (EMPS) model, which is based on assumptions about the cooperation between mobile network operators and financial institutions to deal with different payment amounts ranging from micro to macro payment. The novel model focuses on enhancement of non-repudiation problem. Fair non-repudiation protocols are developed for not only payment phase but also other phases in a typical m-commerce transaction, including price negotiation and content delivery. <b>Joint</b> <b>signatures</b> method is used in protocols to overcome the limitations in mobile handheld device capability and to reduce the trust dependence totally on the payment service. As with the proposed non-repudiation protocols, EMPS plays the role of a semi-trusted third party and is an indispensable factor for creating the fairness property.

40|$|The {{structure}} {{signature of}} a system made up of $n$ components having continuous and i. i. d. lifetimes was defined in the eighties by Samaniego as the $n$-tuple whose $k$-th coordinate is {{the probability that the}} $k$-th component failure causes the system to fail. More recently, a bivariate version of this concept was considered as follows. The <b>joint</b> structure <b>signature</b> of a pair of systems built on a common set of components having continuous and i. i. d. lifetimes is a square matrix of order $n$ whose $(k,l) $-entry is the probability that the $k$-th failure causes the first system to fail and the $l$-th failure causes the second system to fail. This concept was successfully used to derive a signature-based decomposition of the joint reliability of the two systems. In {{the first part of this}} paper we provide an explicit formula to compute the <b>joint</b> structure <b>signature</b> of two or more systems and extend this formula to the general non-i. i. d. case, assuming only that the distribution of the component lifetimes has no ties. We also provide and discuss a necessary and sufficient condition on this distribution for the joint reliability of the systems to have a signature-based decomposition. In the second part of this paper we show how our results can be efficiently applied to the investigation of the reliability and signature of multistate systems made up of two-state components. The key observation is that the structure function of such a multistate system can always be additively decomposed into a sum of classical structure functions. Considering a multistate system then reduces to considering simultaneously several two-state systems...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} method {{based on}} projective <b>joint</b> invariant <b>signatures</b> is presented for distributed matching of curves in a camera network. The fundamental projective joint invariants for curves {{in the real}} projective space are the volume cross-ratios. A curve in m-dimensional projective space is represented by a signature manifold comprising n-point projective joint invariants, where n is at least m + 2. The signature manifold {{can be used to}} establish equivalence of two curves in projective space. However, without correspondence between the two curves, matching signature manifolds is a computational challenge. In this paper we overcome this challenge by finding discriminative sections of signature manifolds consistently across varying viewpoints and scoring the similarity between these sections. This motivates a simple yet powerful method for distributed curve matching in a camera network. Experimental results with real data demonstrate the classification performance of the proposed algorithm with respect {{to the size of the}} sections of the invariant signature in various noisy conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—There {{have been}} {{increasing}} {{concerns about the}} security issues of wireless transmission of multimedia in recent years. Wireless networks, by their nature, are more vulnerable to external intrusions than wired ones. Many applications demand authenticating the integrity of multimedia content delivered wirelessly. In this work, we describe a framework for jointly coding and authenticating multimedia to be delivered over heterogeneous wireless networks. We firstly introduce a novel concept called unequal authenticity protection (UAP), which unequally allocate resources to achieve an optimal authentication result. We then consider integrating UAP with specific source and channel-coding models, to obtain optimal end-to-end quality by the means of joint sourcechannel-authentication analysis. Lastly, we present an implementation of the proposed joint coding and authentication system on a progressive JPEG coder. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is indeed able to achieve the desired authentication of multimedia over wireless networks.

40|$|Keywords: A novel {{method is}} {{presented}} for distributed matching across different viewpoints. The fundamental perspective invariants for curves {{in the real}} projective space are the volume cross-ratios. Probabilistic analysis of projective invariants shows {{that they are not}} unique and therefore not discriminative. However, a curve in m-dimensional Euclidean space is completely prescribed by the <b>signature</b> manifold of <b>joint</b> invariants generated by taking all possible combinations of n points on the projective curve where n is at least m + 2. Furthermore, submanifolds given by the projection of the signature manifold also represent the curve uniquely. Sections of the sub-manifolds that admit large enough variation of cross ratios are found to be sufficient, statistically, for matching of curves. Such sectional signatures allow fast computation and matching of features while keeping the descriptors compact. These features are computed independently at cameras with different viewpoints and shared, thereby achieving the matching of objects in the image. Experimental results with simulated as well as real data are provided. Camera networks, correspondence-less matching, <b>joint</b> projective invariant <b>signatures</b> 2 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the duration of load factor for metal-plate-connected (MPC) truss joints subjected to various cyclic loading conditions. Heel and tension-splice joints from a standard 30 -foot span Fink truss constructed from nominal 2 x 4 Douglas-fir lumber were tested. A testing frame similar to that developed by Gupta and Gebremedhin (1990) was used to test the joints under several different loading conditions. A static ramp load of 780 lbs. /min. was applied to ten joints (both tension-splice and heel joints) until failure was reached. This test group served as the control group for comparison with joints tested under several cyclic loading regimes, with ten joints (per joint type) in each sample group. At the end of these cyclic loadings, the joints were ramped to failure (if they survived the cyclic loading). Results were evaluated by comparing the ultimate loads and stiffnesses from the control group specimens to those from the cyclic loading groups. An evaluation of the damage resulting from the cyclic loads is also discussed. Reductions in the stiffness and strength of the joint after the cyclic loading are related to the number of cycles, and the amplitude of the cycles. The results of this research show that the current duration of load factor of 1. 6 for earthquake loading used in the design of MPC <b>joints</b> is adequate. <b>Signature</b> redacted for privacy.
