The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had <b>just</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to escape, as the hijackers {{did not realize that}} the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E

25|$|The planned {{demonstration}} of the DH.110 on that day was nearly cancelled when the aircraft at Farnborough, WG 240, an all-black night fighter prototype, became unserviceable. It was de Havilland's second DH.110 prototype, and had been taken supersonic over the show on the opening day. Pilot John Derry and onboard flight test observer Anthony Richards left Farnborough to collect WG 236, the first prototype, and flew it from Hatfield, Hertfordshire to Farnborough with <b>just</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to start their slot.|$|E
25|$|Often {{the making}} of conserves can be trickier than making a {{standard}} jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for <b>just</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and liquify. This process can also be achieved by spreading the dry sugar over raw fruit in layers, and leaving for several hours to steep into the fruit, then just heating the resulting mixture only {{to bring to the}} setting point. As a result of this minimal cooking, some fruits are not particularly suitable for making into conserves, because they require cooking for longer periods to avoid issues such as tough skins. Currants and gooseberries, and a number of plums are among these fruits.|$|E

Cole and Nix work to charge the RFI, while Laroche {{and most of his}} followers sacrifice themselves to hold back the Beast.

Activating the device, Cole kills himself, Kuo, the Beast, and thousands of other Conduits, even those who had not yet developed their powers.

While Gothel, reprimanding Rapunzel when she asks, forbids this, she agrees to Rapunzel's request to take a three-day-long journey to retrieve art supplies for Rapunzel, giving her <b>just</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to escape the tower, aided by a wanted thief named Flynn Rider.

The attack went in around 18:00, led by the advanced guard of the 'forlorn hope'. This force of 80 English grenadiers from the 1st English Foot Guards, led by Viscount Mordaunt and Colonel Richard Munden, was designed to draw the enemy fire and thus enable the Allied commanders to discern the defensive strong points. The main force followed closely behind. [...] "The rapidity of their movements, together with their loud yells, were truly alarming", recalled la Colonie, who, in order to drown out the shouts and hurrahs, ordered his drummer to beat charge [...] "so as to drown them with their noise, lest they should have a bad effect upon our people." ...|$|E
500|$|After meeting motor transport, the {{battalion}} {{moved back to}} Ay Dhimitrios, which they began to prepare to defend {{in order to help}} seal off the exit of the Olympus pass. The withdrawal continued, though, and on 19 April the Māori Battalion was called upon conduct a delaying action {{as the rest of the}} 5th Infantry Brigade pulled back through Larisa towards Lamia, [...] south. Along roads packed with vehicles and civilian traffic they withdrew amidst considerable confusion. Upon arrival at Thermopylae {{the battalion}} had had <b>just</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to dig in before receiving the order that they were to move their position in order to make way for the 6th Infantry Brigade. They completed this move by 21 April, taking up the same positions that Leonidas and his army had defended against Xerxes in 480 BC, according to legend. Here they took up position in a marsh and as they made preparations for its defence, on 22 April, in Athens, the decision was made that the units of the British Commonwealth forces would be withdrawn from the country.|$|E

On average, female forewing length lies between [...] Females are larger than males and live for a year, a time just long enough to produce a brood, whereas the males die in only a few days, <b>just</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to impregnate a female.

On average, males weigh 95mg and females are far heavier, at 256mg, probably because of the additional weight of the ovaries, developing eggs and nutritional reserves. Nevertheless, the ratio between flight muscle mass and body mass is the same for both sexes.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Langensalza was a near {{disaster}} in the Hanoverian campaign for the Prussians.

5000|$|... "Walk-back sprinting" [...] is {{one example}} of {{interval}} training for runners, in which one sprints a short distance (anywhere from 100 to 800 metres), then walks back to the starting point (the recovery period), to repeat the sprint a certain number of times. To add challenge to the workout, each of these sprints may start at predetermined time intervals - e.g. 200 metre sprint, walk back, and sprint again, every 3 minutes. The time interval is intended to provide <b>just</b> <b>enough</b> recovery <b>time.</b> A runner will use this method of training mainly to add speed to their race and give them a finishing kick.|$|R

2500|$|At 12:25pm on 22 September 1907 {{the nearly}} {{completed}} Principessa Jolanda was launched before a large audience of onlookers, {{government officials and}} foreign journalists. After travelling down the slipway, the ship immediately became unstable and heeled sharply to port. Efforts by tugboats and shipyard workers to rescue the situation, including lowering the anchors to starboard to counteract the movement, were unsuccessful. After 20 minutes the vessel's list was such that it began taking on water through openings in the upper decks. She soon capsized with her funnels a few metres above and parallel to the water.

2500|$|Casting {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} principal photography began. Etheredge-Ouzts sought a racially diverse cast of handsome {{men who were}} [...] "regular guys" [...] who didn't [...] "play gay". Because the shooting schedule was so tight, actors were cast who did not require rehearsal time. Casting concluded two days before principal photography began, leaving <b>just</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> to costume the actors. Although the lead character, Eddie, {{was intended to be}} Latino, none of the other characters had been written with an ethnicity in mind. However, {{only a small number of}} racial and ethnic minority actors auditioned for the film, and none of them had the requisite acting skills. At one point, Etheredge-Ouzts claimed, 30 non-white actors were scheduled to audition and none of them showed up. This left the production with an all-white cast. The director attributed the lack of interest by minority actor to an unwillingness to play a gay character. Dylan Fergus was cast just two days before principal photography began. Although unhappy with Fergus' haircut, the production team decided against cutting his hair. If the haircut didn't turn out right, there was no time for his hair to grow back.|$|E

Five minutes into the descent, Buzz Aldrin gave the computer the command 1668 which instructed it to calculate and display DELTAH (the difference between altitude sensed by the radar and the computed altitude). This added an additional 10% to the processor workload, causing executive overflow and a 1202 alarm. After being given the [...] "GO" [...] from Houston, Aldrin entered 1668 again and another 1202 alarm occurred.
