5|$|His third studio album, titled Mockingbird (2005), was {{released}} on December 26, 2005. The album touches on subjects such as politics, social justice, and war. Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate discussion and engage people to bring about changes in {{what he sees as}} some of the greatest problems the world is facing today. In order to broaden this <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> people less inclined to purchase his album, beginning September 1, 2006, Webb offered Mockingbird for free on the website Free Derek Webb (no longer exists), where it was available for download until December 8, 2006. Over 80,000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time.|$|E
5|$|It {{took two}} hours of intense <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> elect the {{presidium}} of the Seimas. Jonas Basanavičius, officially nonpartisan, was elected as the chairman and Steponas Kairys, leader of the Social Democrats, was chosen as vice-chairman. Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for the assembly; this initial agenda was vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding hearings on the current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates from rural areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight. The most important question was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|The away team scans Armus' energy field, {{finding that}} when Armus engulfs {{the shuttle and}} speaks to Troi, expressing his remorse and pity, the field disrupting their {{transporter}} signals is weakened which could allow them to beam Troi and the pilot out of the shuttle. After Armus toys with Troi by completely engulfing Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Captain Picard beams down to speak to Armus directly, sending {{the rest of the}} away team to the ship. Picard engages Armus in a heated <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> discover its motive, which is to seek revenge on those that abandoned it on Vagra II. Armus is riled to a point where the energy field is dissipated enough, allowing for Picard, Troi and the pilot to be safely beamed back to the Enterprise. After destroying the shuttlecraft from orbit, Picard orders a quarantine on Vagra II.|$|E

25|$|Logical {{notions of}} higher order: While Tarski {{confined}} his <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> operations of first-order logic, {{there is nothing}} about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic.

However, the authorities did not follow through with reforms as hoped, leaving an uncertain future for IMF-backed cooperation.

25|$|In April 1964, the Directory of Democratic-Social Action (Acção Democrato-Social - ADS) {{presented}} {{a political solution}} rather than a military one.

The Commission also receives letters of recommendation and other background information on the candidates. Once the interviews are complete, the commission enters into <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> reduce the list to the top six to eight nominees.

Edward and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, were taken to the Tower of London, and the Princes in the Tower were never seen again. Who was responsible for their ultimate fate remains a topic of heated <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> this day.
