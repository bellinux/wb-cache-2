40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{introduces a}} new approach to model the non-linear relations among different design and manufacturing evaluation measures for multiobjective optimal concurrent design. In this approach, different design and manufacturing evaluation measures are mapped to comparable evaluation indices. The non-linear relation between an evaluation measure and its evaluation index is identified based on the least-square curve-fitting method. The weighting factors for different design and manufacturing evaluation indices, representing the importance measures of these indices in the multiobjective design optimization, are achieved using the pair-wise comparison method.

40|$|Decomposition {{synthesis}} in optimal {{design is}} the process of creating an optimal design model by selecting objectives and constraints {{so that it can be}} directly partitioned into an appropriate decomposed form. Such synthesis results are not unique since there may be many partitions that satisfy the decomposition requirements.

The article presents an integer programming formulation and solution techniques for synthesizing hierarchically decomposed optimal design problems.

50|$|The ADO16 (Amalgamated Drawing Office {{project number}} 16) was {{designed}} by Alec Issigonis. Following his success with the Mini, Issigonis set out to design a larger and more sophisticated car which incorporated more advanced features and innovations. In common with the Mini, the ADO16 was designed around the BMC A-Series engine, mounted transversely and driving the front wheels. As well as single piston swinging <b>caliper</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> at the front, which were not common on mass-produced cars in the early 1960s, the ADO16 featured a Hydrolastic interconnected fluid suspension system designed by Alex Moulton. The mechanically interconnected Citroen 2CV suspension was assessed in the mid-1950s by Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton (according to an interview by Moulton with CAR magazine in the late 1990s), and was an inspiration {{in the design of}} the Hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyre in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. Pininfarina, the Italian styling studio which had worked with BMC before on the Austin A40 Farina, was commissioned to style the car. ADO16 had comparable interior space to the larger Ford Cortina.|$|R
40|$|Asymmetry {{is applied}} to a {{heavy-duty}} commercial twin <b>caliper</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> rotor {{as a means to}} alleviate an undesirable high amplitude noise. The problematic frequency is 2400 Hz, the rotor blade exhibiting a 5 - diametric mode order of vibration. The asymmetry is introduced by drilling sets of radial holes into the disc rim. Modal analysis is carried out over a range of frequencies using added masses applied magnetically to the rim of the rotor. This shows the amplitudes at set frequencies to reduce considerably when asymmetry is introduced. When a set of 5 masses is added to the rotor the vibration amplitude at the troublesome frequency is seen to be considerably reduced. Finite element analysis complements the experimental results. The analysis of a plain disc initially shows the two normal modes at very close frequencies but when asymmetry is introduced, by drilling holes in the rim of the disc, there is a noticeable frequency decoupling of the 2 normal modes. This is also accompanied by a distinct positioning of the antinodes with the antinodes of one mode positioning at the sets of drilled holes, the other mode antinodes being between the holes. When an asymmetric disc is fitted to the vehicle the noise is eradicated. Significant testing of the vehicle has since been undertaken without noise being generate...|$|R

50|$|The R-100 models {{received}} a double <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> {{in the front}} wheel. For 1976 to 1979 models the front brake was a pivot <b>caliper</b> ATE <b>disc</b> actuated from the controls via cable to a brake master cylinder under the tank. From 1980 models onwards front brakes were changed to a Brembo <b>fixed</b> <b>caliper</b> brake, and the master cylinder was moved from undertank to the right handlebar. With the introduction of Monolever models in 1986, the Brembo <b>fixed</b> <b>calipers</b> were mounted on the fork tubes. The back brake was initially a drum brake.

2500|$|Unlike car <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> {{that are}} buried within the wheel, bike <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are in the}} {{airstream}} and have optimum cooling. Although cast iron discs have a porous surface which give superior <b>braking</b> performance, such <b>discs</b> rust {{in the rain and}} become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc [...] "floats" [...] on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a <b>fixed</b> <b>caliper.</b> A floating <b>disc</b> also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items. Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher center of mass:wheelbase ratio, so they experience more weight transfer when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sport bikes typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.|$|R

40|$|The out-of-plane {{vibration}} {{characteristics of}} a noisy brake are generally better understood than in-plane characteristics. The fundamental {{reason for this is}} that in-plane vibration was not considered a significant effect until recently when technology has allowed the in-plane vibration characteristics to be determined with some degree of confidence. Detailed investigations of the side views of out-of-plane holographic images indicated that the in-plane displacement could be quite significant and possibly larger than the out-of-plane displacement. It was because the fringe pattern could not be attributed solely to out-of-plane displacement that a study of in-plane vibration was initiated. The paper discusses the measurement of both out-of-plane and in-plane vibration of a twin <b>caliper</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> during noise generation. The technique makes use of a series of 11 time-related holograms recorded from three different viewing perspectives of the brake - a total of 33 holograms covering a single cycle of excitation. Each image records absolute displacement but as each of the three holograms view the brake from a different viewpoint then each comprises varying degrees of out-of-plane and in-plane vibration, dependant on their angular position. This varying degree of displacement allows their manipulation to identify and isolate the in-plane and out-of-plane contributions to the overall excitation so that each may be considered separately. The out-of-plane is represented as a three-dimensional image whereas arrows represent the in-plane amplitude as a "quiver" plot. The series allows a dynamic representation of each mode of vibration to be created separately and then combined to indicate the absolute vibration mode characteristics. The results indicate the disc modal behavior to be extremely complex for the two-caliper <b>brake,</b> the <b>disc</b> antinodes tending to ""index" between the two caliper...|$|R

50|$|A key {{safety feature}} was a novel braking system that {{consisted}} of an automotive <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> attached to the vehicles driveshafts. These brakes were held off by hydraulic pressure that was present whenever the vehicle was connected with guideway power and the on-board controller was commanding them off. In the event of loss of electrical power, the hydraulic pressure holding the brakes was lost and springs inside the cylinders forced brake fluid into the <b>calipers</b> of the <b>disc</b> <b>braking</b> system, ensuring that the vehicles did not simply coast to a stop. In order to provide for a controlled deceleration, a pendulum valve was located {{in line with the}} brake actuation cylinders. Pendulums inside the valve reacted to the deceleration profile of the vehicle and would partially close, reducing the pressure in the brake lines and moderating the deceleration so that the emergency stop was not dangerously abrupt.|$|R
