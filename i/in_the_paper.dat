25|$|The {{theory for}} this kind of {{avalanche}} transistor is described completely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> , which also shows that this semiconductor device structure is well suited for microwave power amplification. It can deliver several watts of radio frequency power at a frequency of several gigahertz and it also has a control terminal, the base. However, it is not widely used since it requires voltages exceeding 200 volts to work properly, while gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor FETs deliver a similar performance while being easier to work with. A similar device structure, proposed more or less in the same period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> , was the IMPISTOR, being a transistor with IMPATT collector-base junction.|$|E
