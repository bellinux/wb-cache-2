The visa proposal followed an appeal by the tourist boards of the partner states for a common visa to accelerate promotion of the region as a single tourist destination and the EAC Secretariat wanted it approved before November's World Travel Fair (or World Travel Market) in London. When approved by the EAC's council of ministers, tourists could apply for one country's entry visa which would then be applicable in all regional member states as a single entry requirement initiative.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{overview}} of <b>integration</b> <b>programmes</b> for immigrants in a selected group of EU member states. The main trends and similarities are assessed and broadly compared. As the paper argues, in the national arena {{there appears to be}} a distinct move in the direction of <b>integration</b> <b>programmes</b> with a mandatory character. Obligatory participation in such programmes is now a regular feature of both immigration and citizenship legislation, and a precondition for having access to a secure juridical status. In the first section, the paper mainly addresses the questions of: Who are the target groups and what is the scope of the <b>integration</b> <b>programmes?</b> What are the related enforcement mechanisms and sanctions? What is the link between immigration, integration and citizenship, and what effects (positive or negative) are emerging from that relationship? The second section looks at the evolving EU framework on the integration of immigrants, where a struggle is taking place in two parallel arenas. The first is over the competence to determine policy in this field – at the national versus the EU level (principle of subsidiarity). The second struggle concerns the overall approach, where substantial differences appear between the EU’s framework on integration and its Common Basic Principles for Immigrant Integration Policy (soft policy), and the actual legal acts involved (hard policy) ...|$|R

40|$|While {{the concept}} of migrant {{integration}} is a contested one, national, sub-national and local governments over the past forty to fifty years have professed support for integration in various forms. However, practical measures have been rare, with broad race-relations policies from the 1960 s being the primary means of ‘inclusion’. Under New Labour, refugees were identified as a migrant population with particular challenges {{and they have been}} the only migrant group subject to specific <b>integration</b> <b>programmes.</b> Nevertheless, policy and rhetoric about asylum seekers and refugees more generally have tended to operate against integration and have made it increasingly difficult for refugees to rebuild their lives. This paper examines refugee integration from the perspectives of the refugees themselves, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. It also looks at the governance of integration in Scotland and highlights Scottish distinctiveness vis-à-vis the UK. The article suggests that the consequences of broader UK Government policy around asylum and refugee issues negates any positive support in the form of refugee <b>integration</b> <b>programmes</b> and actively inhibits integration...|$|R

40|$|This thesis principally {{deals with}} issues of social {{identity}} management and integration amongst African refugee minorities in Norway. Employing an analytical strategy, the thesis explores varying complex and inter-related situations faced by indigenous African refugees in Norway and how these situations presents challenges in social identity management by the refugees. This piece of work specifically focuses on analyzing how the refugees in question employ social identity management variables like ethnicity, regionalism, language, religion, food, clothing, gender, music and imagined idealizations in managing their social identities. The thesis argues that different situations in the refugee`s host community and the camp environment have impacted into the refugees, dispositions to act differently depending with the objective and extricate demands of the varying situations. Integration as a practical concept has been equally co-opted into the thesis with a design to analyse the impact of <b>integration</b> <b>programmes</b> on refugee social identity management processes. The Kvæfjord Commune, in collaboration with some civil society organizations in its municipality has fashioned some <b>integration</b> <b>programmes</b> in an endeavor to integrate the refugees into the mainstream societal functionalisms. It is nevertheless argued that the outcomes of such integrative approaches has created complex and over-lapping conditions which have multi-directionally impacted on the refugee social identity management processes. Whilst recognizing and building on related works on ethnicity and social identity, the thesis finds a unique position by venturing into the study of a multi-nationalized inter-continental refugee camp set-up which has been minimally deliberated upon {{especially with regard to}} the social identity management arena...|$|R

40|$|Examining Board: Professor Rainer Bauböck, European University Institute (EUI Supervisor) Professor Kitty C. Calavita, University of California, Irvine Professor Andrew Geddes, University of Sheffield Professor Claire Kilpatrick, European University Institute. Defence date: 11 June 2013 In {{migration}} studies, it {{is taken}} for granted that states do not only attempt to control overall numbers of immigrants, but also establish different regulatory regimes for refugees, labour migrants, family reunification, co-ethnics and many other categories of migrants. In studies of immigrant integration, however, most analyses have assumed that each state pursues a single and coherent national approach. The aim of this dissertation is to challenge this assumption by examining how states pursue integration differently for different categories of migrants in post-enlargement Europe. In addition to third country nationals I consider also migrants who have a special cultural and historical bond with their host countries, such as emigrants and descendants of emigrants or migrants from the former colonies (co-ethnics), as well as European Union citizens from old and new member states. The dissertation builds on empirical evidence collected from 1985 to 2012 at national, regional and city levels in two new countries of immigration in Western Europe: Italy and Spain. The first main finding is that both Italy and Spain chose {{to distance themselves from}} the integration policies of the more traditional countries of immigration in Europe, which they classify as failures. Instead, the new immigration countries searched for their "own" integration strategy, which they consider a token of sovereignty just as much as immigration control. Secondly, both states have introduced different integration policies and integration requirements for different categories of migrants. Rather than pursuing only one integration strategy, the states examined use their resources and abilities to simultaneously pursue different integration strategies for European citizens, co-ethnics and third country nationals. These strategies range from less to more restrictive (from laissez-faire to mandatory, sanction-based policies, such as the Italian integration agreement and language test). European Union citizens enjoy many rights in when residing in other member states without being included in their <b>integration</b> <b>programmes,</b> while third country nationals enjoy far fewer rights which they risk to lose if they do not comply with demanding <b>integration</b> <b>programmes.</b> Co-ethnics in turn are included in <b>integration</b> <b>programmes</b> but have more rights than other third country nationals and, in some areas such as access to citizenship and enrolment in the army, they have even more rights than European citizens. Finally, this dissertation finds a negative correlation between immigrants' social class in the host society and their rights and integration requirements: the lower the socio-economic position of the immigrant group, the fewer its rights and the more demanding the integration requirements it faces...|$|R
