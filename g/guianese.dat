25|$|In 1882 George Wright took up cricket seriously {{again with}} the Longwood Cricket Club of Boston where he {{dominated}} local cricket sides with Isaac Chambers, the Longwood cricket pro and greenskeeper, holding up the other bowling end. In 1891 George Wright captained the Longwood Cricket Club against Lord Hawke's visiting English side. Wright's side surprised the visiting English first-class players with accurate bowling which kept the tourist in check. In 1892 George Wright donated cricket gear to British <b>Guianese</b> (Guyana) cricket players thereby starting a century old tradition of West Indian cricket in New England.|$|E
500|$|Leonie Turpeau {{was born}} on December 10, 1879, on a farm on the eastern banks of Bayou Teche near St. Martinville, St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, to Isabella Hill (née Regis or Reggis) and Michel Turpeau Jr. Her {{paternal}} grandfather, Michel Turpeau Sr. was a free man of color from Martinique who {{had worked as a}} ship hand and later on the Banker plantation, enabling him to buy a small parcel of land and bring his French <b>Guianese</b> wife, Odeline [...] "Dina", to Louisiana. Turpaeu's mother was the daughter of Maturin Regis, who had been a slave in Virginia, and Carrie Hill a Louisiana Creole woman. The marriage between Michael Jr. and Isabella caused disquiet from its beginnings, as Louisiana society typically did not approve of freedmen marrying former slaves.|$|E

He was killed fighting in France during the First World War.|$|E
60|$|But, if {{the idea}} of a {{universal}} Father and Maker came last in evolution, as a refinement, then, of course, it ought to be the newest, and therefore the most fashionable and potent of <b>Guianese</b> cults. Precisely the reverse {{is said to be the}} case. Nor can the belief indicated in such names as Father and Maker be satisfactorily explained as a refinement of ancestor-worship, because, we repeat, it occurs where ancestors are not worshipped.|$|E
6000|$|Beyond all doubt, savages {{who find}} {{themselves}} {{under the watchful eye}} of a moral deity whom they cannot 'square' will desert him as soon as they have evolved a practicable ghost-god, useful for family purposes, whom they can square. No less manifestly, savages, who already possess a throng of serviceable ghost-gods, will not enthusiastically evolve a moral Being who despises gifts, and only cares for obedience. 'There is a great deal of human nature in man,' and, if Mr. Im Thurn's description of the <b>Guianese</b> be correct, everything we know of human nature, and of evolution, assures us that the Father, or Maker, or Ancient of Days came first; the ghost-gods, last. What has here been said about the Indians of Guiana (namely, that they are now more ghost and spirit worshippers, with only a name surviving to attest a knowledge of a Father and Maker in Heaven) applies equally well to the Zulus. The Zulus are the great standing type of an animistic or ghost-worshipping race without a God. But, had they a God (on the Australian pattern) whom they have forgotten, or have they not yet evolved a God out of Animism? ...|$|E

By the end of 1941, ninety-five <b>Guianese</b> had joined the British Armed Forces, of whom twenty-two were in the Royal Air Force and forty-two were in the Royal Navy. The remaining thirty-one were recruited for other specialised work. Scores of <b>Guianese</b> were also working in the merchant navy.

50|$|British Guiana {{was a major}} {{supplier}} of high-grade bauxite to the United States during the war years. The aluminium produced from this bauxite {{was used by the}} American military for the production of aircraft. Significantly, roughly two-thirds of all Allied aircraft manufactured during the war years used aluminium made from <b>Guianese</b> bauxite. As a result of the demand for Guiana's bauxite, exports increased from 476,000 tons in 1939 to 1,902,000 tons in 1943. This enabled the <b>Guianese</b> economy to benefit greatly from the revenue obtained through these exports. The monetary worth of bauxite exports rose from approximately $2.9 million in the early 1940s to $6.7 million in 1947. This resulted from the developments in the Demerara Bauxite Company when it opened two mines at Mackenzie, thus creating more jobs in that sector for the <b>Guianese</b> people. At the end of the war, the <b>Guianese</b> Treasury had a surplus of more than $6 million, mainly due to the revenues earned by the bauxite industry.|$|E

5000|$|The {{importation}} of labor from the Indian subcontinent {{was part of}} a continuing search by <b>Guianese</b> planters for a labor force that was docile, reliable and amenable to discipline under harsh, tropical conditions.
