5|$|In Greco-Roman times saffron {{was widely}} traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. Their {{customers}} {{ranged from the}} perfumers of Rosetta, in Egypt, to physicians in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes, who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre. For the Greeks, saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the hetaerae. Large <b>dye</b> <b>works</b> operating in Sidon and Tyre used saffron baths as a substitute; there, royal robes were triple-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip, which gave a less intense purple hue.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{took up the}} {{practical}} art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He {{spent much of his}} time at Staffordshire <b>dye</b> <b>works</b> mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, such as the red derived from madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.|$|E

25|$|In 1865 {{more than}} 80 acres of Ripley's land holding were still undeveloped. The area was dotted with the Bowling Iron Company's former mine workings. Several old mine shafts had been {{converted}} to wells to provide the <b>dye</b> <b>works</b> with its soft water supply. Ripley Ville occupied most of the Broom Hall Estate: Broom Hall was a working farmhouse into the 1860s. The {{northern part of the}} estate had been acquired by the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR) to build the Bowling Curves that opened in 1867. The site chosen for Ripley Ville had the disadvantage being irregularly shaped with steep gradients. Its central street fell 40 feet over a distance of 300 feet but it was relatively free of old mine workings and contiguous to the urban development along Hall Lane which gave access to the town centre.|$|E
25|$|In 1896 the Midland Railway {{obtained}} {{an act of}} Parliament authorising it {{to build}} a through railway from its main line at Royston to connect with its existing tracks at Bradford Foster Square. The proposed line of railway passed under Ripley Ville. The Midland's cash offer of £6,000 {{for the purchase of}} Ripley property was unacceptable to the Ripley Trust who also felt that there was a direct threat to the soft water supply to the <b>dye</b> <b>works.</b> An Arbitration hearing in 1900 awarded the Ripley Trust £14,000 for 3 acres of land in Ripley Ville. This included 4 terraces of houses and a strip of land across Ladywell Fields. After another Act of Parliament in 1912 and several changes of plan the Midland Railway decided, in the changed economic circumstances after the Great War, to abandon the scheme. Bradford Corporation (who were wholly in favour of the scheme and deeply regretted its abandonment) agreed to buy all the land acquired by the Midland. This included, in addition to much land in the centre of the city, the four terraces of houses in Ripley Ville and Ladywell fields. Ladywell Fields were designated as a public park. Management of the four terraces of houses passed to the Borough's housing department.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the traffic}} along the canal transported coal from the many collieries that existed along its length, such as Outwood Colliery and Ladyshore Colliery.

[...] The canal also enabled the transport of salt from Cheshire to the many bleach and <b>dye</b> <b>works</b> in its area – hence the name of Salt Wharf on the Bolton arm of the canal. Tolls were easily calculated as milestones were placed along the towpath at ¼ mile (400m) intervals.

40|$|This output, a group exhibition, was {{curated by}} David Curtis, as an Illuminations {{production}} for Tate Britain (the project {{was supported by}} the AHRC Centre for British Film & Television Studies, University of the Arts, London and the British Film Institute). Dye was selected in recognition of his role as an experimental user of film in Britain during the 1970 s. In the past decade, <b>Dye’s</b> <b>work</b> in this area has attracted renewed curatorial attention. ‘A Century of Artists’ Film in Britain’ places <b>Dye’s</b> <b>work</b> {{in the context of an}} ambitious survey of work by 130 artists, which aims to reveal the full range, variety and originality of this history, from films made in the 1890 s, to work realised at the start of the twenty-first century. Dye has used the reconstruction of early media works to develop a series of masters and doctoral level workshops that provide new contexts for visual arts research. The emphasis is on the contrasting situation for experimental media in the 70 s and the age of digital technology. Dye’s current research involves a reconsideration of the notion of early- and late-career works, particularly in relation to new forms of gallery viewing. Dye’s media arts experience provided supervisory support for a doctoral project by Macmorran entitled: ‘Interactive and Digital Installation Works: new modes of reception and expression’ (completed 2007). <b>Dye’s</b> <b>work</b> in a Century of Artists’ Film in Britain was included in the British Artists Film and Video Study Collection at University of the Arts, London (Central St Martins College of Art).
