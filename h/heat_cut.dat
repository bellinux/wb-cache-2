50|$|The series {{marked the}} third {{consecutive}} year that the Heat and the Pacers faced off in the playoffs including the second consecutive time in the Conference Finals. The Heat won the previous two match ups against the Pacers and the Pacers would try to dethrone the Heat as Eastern Conference Champions. In Game 1, the Pacers finally started a series on the right foot by defeating the Heat, 107-96, as they took the series opener. The Pacers jumped to a 10-point lead early and they never looked back, leading {{by as much as}} 19. However, the Heat responded by taking Game 2, 87-83, and the home court advantage. LeBron James and Dwyane Wade led the Heat in the clutch, scoring the Heat's last 20 points. Lance Stephenson led the Pacers with 25 points but he was held to one field goal in the fourth quarter. The Heat would proceed to win Game 3, 99-87, to take a 2-1 series lead. The Pacers started strong, leading by as much as 15 in the second quarter before the <b>Heat</b> <b>cut</b> the lead to 4 by halftime. The Heat would eventually pull away in the fourth quarter with the help of Ray Allen's 16 points including four key three pointers in the final period. In Game 4, after scoring just a total of 27 points in the first three games, Chris Bosh finally broke out of his slump by scoring 25 points, almost matching his total from the first three games. James led the Heat with 32 points to give the Heat a wire-to-wire 102-90 victory that put them one game away from the NBA Finals.|$|E
50|$|In Game 1, the Celtics started poorly, scoring only 11 {{points in}} the first quarter. The Heat had a 10-point lead after 1. The Celtics were hot in the second, scoring 35 points en route to tying the game at halftime. Behind a big second half, the Heat {{eventually}} defeated the Celtics 93-79 to take a 1-0 series lead. Game 2 was very different, with the Celtics starting very strong. Midway through the second quarter, a Rondo jumper extended their lead to 15. However, the <b>Heat</b> <b>cut</b> it to 7 at halftime. Miami had another big 3rd quarter. With the Celtics up 71-66 with 4:24 left in the third, a block by Wade on Allen ignited a 15-4 run by the Heat to end the quarter, as they took a 6-point lead heading into the fourth. The fourth quarter was close. With Miami leading 99-96 with 34 seconds left, Allen made a 3 to tie it. It eventually sent the game to OT, with James missing two chances to win the game. Miami eventually won 115-111 to take a 2-0 series lead. Rondo led the Celtics with a career-high 44 points, along with 8 rebounds and 10 assists. There was controversy in regards to the officiating as the Heat shot 18 more free throws, the Celtics committed 33 fouls to the Heat's 18, as well as a play in overtime in a tie game where Rondo was hit in the head by Wade and no foul was called, leading to a fast break dunk for Udonis Haslem. In Game 3, the Celtics got strong performances from Rondo, Garnett, and Pierce. LeBron was also hot in the first quarter, scoring 16 points and making 7 of his first 9 shots. However, despite this performance, the second and third quarters were decisive, with the Celtics outscoring the Heat a combined 55-35 in the two quarters as they had an 85-63 lead heading into the fourth. Miami made a comeback, hitting 3's and dunks to cut the lead to 8. However, Boston held on for a 101-91 victory to make it 2-1. Game 4 was the same story, with the Celtics hitting several 3's and putting on a lead as big as 18. Miami tried another comeback in the third and fourth quarters. Unlike Game 3, they took the lead. Boston answered back, holding a 3-point lead in the final minute before James hit a 3 to tie it with 36 seconds left. This led to the second overtime game of the series. It was a low-scoring affair in OT, with both teams only making one field goal. With 4:22 left, Pierce fouled out, giving Miami a big chance. However, James fouled out with 1:51 left. The Celtics still held a 2-point lead in the dying seconds, but Wade missed a potential game-winning 3 at the buzzer, giving the Celtics a 93-91 win to tie the series going back to Miami. Celtics proceeded to lead the series, 3-2, with a 94-90 win in Game 5. In the game, Bosh returned {{for the first time since}} he got injured in Game 1 of the Heat-Pacers series but was not much of a help on the offensive end. He came off the bench in the game and scored 9 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in 14 minutes played. With the Celtics leading by 1 with less than a minute to go, Pierce knocked down a crucial three-pointer that gave the Celtics the lead for good. The Heat prevented a celebration from happening in Game 6 with a 98-79 blowout win at Boston to send the series back to Miami for a seventh and deciding game. James had one of his best playoff games, scoring 45 points and getting 15 rebounds, 30 of his 45 came in the first half alone.In Game 7, the Celtics started strong. In the second quarter, Garnett picked up his third foul, giving the Heat a chance to try and take a lead. However, Bass led a run that pushed the Celtics' lead to 11. The Celtics would still have a 7-point lead at halftime. The third quarter was decisive once again, letting the Heat tie the game going to the fourth quarter, which was even more decisive. With the Celtics leading by 1 with 8 minutes left, James had a dunk that gave the Heat the lead. It was soon followed by Bosh's third three-pointer of the night (a career-high three 3 pointers) that gave the Heat the lead for good. The Celtics never recovered as the Heat booked a return trip to the Finals with a 101-88 Game 7 win in Miami.|$|E

5000|$|Västerbotten cheese ( [...] , Västerbottensost) is {{a cheese}} from the Västerbotten region of Sweden. It {{is a hard}} cow's milk cheese with tiny eyes or holes and a firm and {{granular}} texture. As in Cheddar cheese, the curd is <b>heated,</b> <b>cut,</b> and stirred before the cheese is moulded and aged. Strong in flavour, its taste is described as somewhat like Parmesan cheese, salty, but with more bitter notes. It is light yellow in colour and has a fat content of 31%. Many Swedish people consider it the king of cheese and demand for it has often outstripped the limited supply. For this reason, it is roughly twice as expensive as other types of aged cheese. Västerbotten cheese must be aged for at least 12 months, but 14 months is more common.|$|R

40|$|Many {{operators}} of steamdrive projects {{will reduce the}} heat injection rate as the project matures. The major benefit of this practice {{is to reduce the}} fuel costs and thus extend the economic life of the project. However, there is little industry consensus on whether the <b>heat</b> <b>cuts</b> should take the form of: (1) mass rate reductions while maintaining the same high steam quality, or (2) steam quality decreases while keeping the same mass rate. Through the use of a commercial three-phase, three-dimensional simulator, the oil recovery schedules obtained when reducing the injected steam mass rate or quality with time were compared under a variety of reservoir and operating conditions. The simulator input was validated for Kern River Field conditions by using the guidelines developed by Johnson, et at. (1989) for four steamflood projects in Kern River. The results indicate that for equivalent heat injection rates, decreasing the steam injection mass rate at a constant high quality will yield more economic oil than reducing the steam quality at a constant mass rate. This conclusion is confirmed by a sensitivity analysis which demonstrates the importance of the gravity drainage/steam zone expansion mechanism in a low-pressure, heavy oil steamflood with gravity segregation. Furthermore, the impact of discontinuous silts and nonuniform initial temperatures within the steamflood zone was studied, indicating again that a decreasing mass rate injection strategy is a superior operating practice...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays wood {{modification}} is very-discussed and {{its importance}} is growing up. Wood plasticization alias a temporary change of wood properties makes subsequent processing possible. Plasticization is very suitable for subsequent mechanical compressing of wood. Instead steaming and boiling {{there is a}} microwave heating for wood plasticization. This kind of <b>heating</b> <b>cuts</b> down the time of plasticization from hours to seconds and also reduces energy consumption. Pressing of wood perpendicular to the gain in radial direction causes change of wood structure, increases wood density and due to this the wood has increased mechanical properties as bending strength and Young’s modulus of elasticity. Modificated wood has many positive properties, but also has number of negative properties. The high-temperature treatment eliminates these negative proeprties to the large extend. The high temperature causes changes in chemical structure and reduces number of soprtion places. Due to this the wood has lower equilibrium moisture content. Moisture content greatly affects physical and mechanical properties. The wood that was treated by high temperature (200 [*]°C) has lower moisture content coresponding to the equilibrium moisture content than the wood without high-tepmerature treatment (the wood only microwave plasticizated and mechanicaly compressed). Lower moisture content makes rising bending strength and Young’s modulus of elasticity. The aim {{of this article is}} to compare bending strength perpendicular to the gain in radial direction and Young’s modulus of elasticity of Spruce wood that was microwave, mechanical and modificated in high-temperature...|$|R

The alternative of irreversible covalent bond formation is, however, to be further developed. In this contribution, self-healing hyperbranched poly(aroyltriazole) s of PI and PII sharing such mechanism were developed. The polymers were synthesized by our developed metal-free click polymerizations of bis(aroylacetylene) s and triazide. They are processible and have excellent film-forming ability. High quality homogeneous films and sticks free from defects could be obtained by casting. The scratched films could be self-repaired upon general <b>heating.</b> The <b>cut</b> films and sticks could be healed by stacking or pressing the halves together at elevated temperature.
