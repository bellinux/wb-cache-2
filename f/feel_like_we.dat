I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> are sort of The Honeymooners, only I'm the Jackie Gleason character. Obviously, he irritates me on a significant basis, as everyone's significant other does.|$|E
500|$|Turner {{himself had}} this to say of the album, fully {{cognizant}} that it would be the band's last: [...] "I don't know if looking back many years from now if Wavering Radiant will be my favorite Isis record or not, but I certainly feel like it's the best record we were capable of making at the time, and I also <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> didn't compromise in any really significant way the spirit or ideology behind the band in making it. And sonically speaking, I think it sounds really good, so that makes me happy, too." ...|$|E

500|$|Oblivion {{was well}} {{received}} in the gaming press; there was no critical disappointment, no [...] "bump" [...] in popular expectations, {{that might have been}} expected for such a highly anticipated game. Metacritic, an aggregate review site, gave the game a 94% score; IGN, GameSpot and GameSpy each gave the game their own individual [...] "RPG of the Year" [...] award. Oblivion also sold well, selling 1.7 million copies by April 10, 2006. Additionally, 3 million copies were sold by January 18, 2007. Pete Hines was satisfied with the release: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> delivered on what people expected....I think the scores and awards reflect that we delivered on people's expectations." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Ryan of Uproxx {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, writing [...] "Newt Scamander {{is nothing like}} Harry, {{but it has to}} be this way. It all has to be different. And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to make us <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> are at home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E
500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had to put a photo on the cover, I {{wanted it to be}} more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
5000|$|Alyse Wax of Fear Net {{said that}} the show is [...] "consistently awesome". 'Craziness happens, and {{not only is it}} totally {{believable}} in this setting, you just want more.

500|$|... "High and Dry" [...] {{became a}} modest hit, but Radiohead's growing fanbase was {{insufficient}} {{to repeat the}} worldwide success of [...] "Creep". The Bends peaked at No. 88 on the US album charts, which remains Radiohead's lowest showing there. Nonetheless, Radiohead {{were satisfied with the}} album's reception. Jonny Greenwood later said: [...] "I think the turning point for us came about nine or twelve months after The Bends was released and it started appearing in people's [...] polls {{for the end of the}} year. That's when it started to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> made the right choice about being a band." [...] In later years, The Bends appeared in many publications' lists of the best albums of all time, including Rolling Stone's 2012 edition of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] at No. 111.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{uses the}} Extremis virus from Iron Man 3 as {{one source of}} power for the {{character}} of Mike Peterson. Executive producer Jeffrey Bell explained {{that the idea of}} using it came up independent of the film, but the crew realized {{that it would be a}} good opportunity to tie in with the films, and worked with Marvel Studios on the tie-in to ensure that [...] "they didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were just ripping off their idea." [...] Additional sources of power for the character include: Chitauri technology, from The Avengers and Item 47; and super-soldier serum, from [...] and The Incredible Hulk. The events of The Avengers are referenced numerous times throughout the episode, and archive footage from the film is briefly used in an opening montage. Also, Coulson's flying car is a working model of the prototype seen in Captain America: The First Avenger.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which O'Malley's colleagues were {{laughing}} at his funeral was one of Vernoff's favorite scenes. She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. And {{then there are the}} editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that’s what I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E

500|$|Colfer's {{performances}} {{have been}} well received by critics, particularly [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye" [...] in the episode [...] "Born This Way". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic stated that the song was [...] "absolutely stunning in every conceivable way". She {{thought that he had}} the emotional connection, the musicality, and the storytelling ability [...] "down pat". Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez also praised the rendition: [...] "Kurt apparently picked up a few helpful notes ... from his Warbler brothers and emerged an even better solo singer than I recall. ... Most enjoyable, however, was a tenderness Kurt added to the song that I don't think could have been duplicated by any other member of this ensemble." [...] In his review, Michael Slezak of TVLine commended Kurt's voice and gave the song an [...] "A": [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> haven’t had too many strong musical moments from Kurt this season, but this number, which pushed Chris Colfer’s countertenor to impressive heights, went a long way to erase the deficit." [...] Rolling Stone Erica Futterman wrote that it was [...] "a sweeter moment than last season's 'Rose's Turn', but the high notes and big vocals are still there".|$|E
500|$|The game's design {{came from}} Iwata, {{who was able}} to {{transport}} his original ideas directly into the game as far as the NES' graphical capabilities could be taken at that time. He said: [...] "the goal was really to try to pull off the best graphics on the NES to date. Simple graphics were more or less the standard on the NES at the time but I had this firm belief {{that it was possible to}} do something better, something prettier. I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> pulled it off and were able to show people what could be done [...] It left an impression around the office, and from what I've heard [...] influenced the work of other games that were later made by other NES developers as well." [...] The game's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft's staff and an outside composer, Naoki Kodaka, who had previously worked on scores for many of the company's other titles. Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that [...] "none of those people are working together anymore since they've all separated from Sunsoft [...] ".|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E

2500|$|A {{reviewer}} for GlobalGrind {{commented on}} the song's lyrics, suggesting that there is perhaps an underlying message in the song for ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, in the line [...] "We found love in a hopeless place". This further raised suspicion when Brown re-tweeted one of Rihanna's posts on Twitter, which read [...] "Sometimes it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> find love in the most hopeless place". Jessica Herndon of People magazine praised the song, saying that [...] "'We Found Love' had an amazing influence on people all across the world in 2012, {{becoming one of the}} most popular and most successful songs".|$|R
50|$|In an {{interview}} with M magazine, band member Betamax Killer said of the album:Channel The Spirits {{was meant to be}} a soundtrack to planet Earth’s doom. To stare death in the face and explore a symphony of human emotions. Panic, hope, defiance, fear, brotherhood and a release from cultural restrictions. We hoped to discover the underlying human power beneath the mundane day-to-day routines of modern life. Through the process of making the record we have been on a journey together through the distant realms of our collective mind. It <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> have become creative space explorers.|$|R
500|$|In June 1994, TLC {{shot the}} first video for [...] "Creep" [...] in their {{hometown}} Atlanta, Georgia {{but the result}} dissatisfied them. The following month, they flew to Los Angeles, California and filmed a second version with Lionel C. Martin, the director whom they had previously worked with on most of their early videos. [...] "It didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had evolved," [...] Thomas expressed. Reid and the trio decided to scrap both versions as they thought the two didn't show any of their growth as women, while the images being too [...] "grimy," [...] suffered from bad lighting problems, including the first one didn't even have enough footage to finish a song's verse. Martin long after released his version on Vimeo in early 2013. The [...] "blue-tinged" [...] clip shows the girls sneaking away from their unsuspecting boyfriends to cheat with others while other scenes show them performing in front of trucks and cars. Nevertheless, Fact magazine noticed the song's infidelity theme was loosely followed on the clip's narrative while Priya Elan from NME explained the clip overall might have been [...] "too urban" [...] for MTV. [...] "Not only is this 'Creep' more genre specific, it also feels more dated," [...] he added.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} also subject to less {{favorable}} reviews from critics who were {{disappointed with the}} gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of Time Out [...] "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that we <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} airing of this episode, Mrs. Krabappel names several different diseases Bart has faked {{in order to}} get out of taking his English test, one of which is Tourette's syndrome. After Bart claims that he is not over it, he begins barking and snarling and mutters, [...] "Shove it, witch!" [...] This scene garnered many complaints from people who thought it was tasteless of the writers to make fun of an actual condition and Joshua Smith, a boy in Renton, Washington began seeking legal action. Smith demanded that they [...] "not repeat the episode and have Bart Simpson befriend somebody with Tourette's on the show" [...] and include an apology from Bart at the end. Executive producer Mike Reiss replied with an apology saying [...] "We kind of <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> made a mistake this time. We felt bad about this." [...] In a move that was unprecedented for the show, the producers agreed to remove the scene from future broadcasts. However, Smith's other requests went unfulfilled. In the version of the episode released on the season four DVD boxset, the part with Bart demonstrating his supposed Tourette's syndrome to Mrs. Krabappel was kept intact, but Krabappel's line about Bart having [...] "...that unfortunate bout of Tourette's syndrome" [...] was replaced with [...] "...that unfortunate bout of rabies." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{first began}} writing songs at their {{rehearsal}} space in their hometown of Minneapolis, which they nicknamed the [...] "Dungeon", {{due to its}} ability to [...] "suck the life and energy out of the band." [...] For Pierre, the album came at {{the brink of a}} transitional period for him, in which he began to seek treatment for alcohol abuse. He left the band during the writing stages for Los Angeles where he moved in with Epitaph founder Brett Gurewitz and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Afterwards, the band rejoined Pierre in Los Angeles to begin recording demos for a month; the change of scenery brought about new energy for the group, according to Pierre. Commit This to Memory would be the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. In addition, the band had more time and funds to spend time working on the album. [...] "It was also the first time we had a lot more time and money to go in and <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were making a real record this time, whereas I Am the Movie was recorded in little segments here and there and eventually pieced together," [...] said drummer Tony Thaxton.|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
