40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a serious}} {{condition}} that can be prevented by <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> taken by women who are postmenopausal. The decision to use <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy,</b> however, {{is often difficult to}} make. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared the effectiveness of the delivery of computer-tailored information with non-tailored information via a web site on women 2 ̆ 7 s intention to continue or to initiate use of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The study was based on Orem 2 ̆ 7 s Theory of Self-Care, the Health Belief Model, and the Elaboration Likelihood Model. Two hundred and eight women, ages 40 to 60, were enrolled in the study over an eight week period. All data were collected at one point of contact via the Internet. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the Health Belief Model variables of perceived barriers and confidence were predictors of current use of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> Women with high perceived barriers were less likely to use <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> and women with high confidence {{were more likely to be}} currently using <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> Beliefs about menopause, use of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy,</b> and receipt of non-tailored information were predictors of intention to continue to use or begin to use <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> Those women who believed that menopause was partially a medical problem, who used <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy,</b> and who received non-tailored information were more likely to intend to continue use or begin to use <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> The results contradicted expectations that tailored information would predict women 2 ̆ 7 s intention to continue to use or to begin use of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> Moreover, there were no significant differences in women 2 ̆ 7 s satisfaction with the web site and relevance of information between the tailored and non-tailored groups which was also an unexpected finding.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} whether <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> affects survival {{in women who}} have undergone bilateral salphingo-oophorectomy because of epithelial ovarian cancer. DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis by review of patients' notes and questionnaires completed by general practitioners to compare the overall survival and disease free survival in patients with ovarian cancer who {{did or did not}} receive <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> after diagnosis. Data were analysed by Cox regression, with <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> as a time dependent covariate because patients who received hormone replacement did so at different times after diagnosis. SETTING [...] Gynaecological oncology unit of Royal Marsden Hospital. PATIENTS [...] 373 patients aged 50 years or younger who attended the hospital from 1972 to 1988. All of the women had undergone bilateral salpingoophorectomy for epithelial ovarian cancer. In all, 78 had received <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy,</b> starting at a median of four months after diagnosis. INTERVENTION [...] A questionnaire was sent to the general practitioners of all patients who were not recorded as having received <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Overall survival and disease free survival. RESULTS [...] There {{was no significant difference in}} survival between women receiving <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> and those not receiving it after accounting for the effects of other known prognostic factors (stage of cancer, differentiation of tumour, histological results, and time to relapse). The relative risk of dying in those who received <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> was 0. 73 (95 % confidence interval 0. 44 to 1. 20). In addition, there was no significant difference in disease free survival (relative risk in those receiving <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> was 0. 90; 95 % confidence interval 0. 52 to 1. 54).

40|$|BACKGROUND. <b>Hormone</b> {{replacement}} <b>therapy</b> is {{used for}} the relief of menopausal symptoms. In the United Kingdom, guidelines have been developed for the use of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> in the prevention of osteoporosis, and in the United States of America its use has also been recommended for cardiovascular disease prevention. However, compliance {{has been found to be}} a problem, and rates of prescribing vary between general practitioners. AIM. This study set out to describe the prescribing of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> in one general practice, to enable doctors to plan future prescribing and promotion of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy,</b> taking into account constraints on its use. METHOD. The patient records of users of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> were examined to collect data on menopausal status, reason for use, length of use, breaks from therapy and reasons for stopping therapy. Women with a history of hysterectomy and with risk factors for osteoporosis were identified from the practice morbidity register. Their use of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> was recorded. RESULTS. Of women aged 40 - 59 years on the practice list, 348 were taking <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> (20 %). Of 107 women aged under 52 years who had had a hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy 76 were taking therapy (71 %). Of 158 women under the age of 52 years who had had a hysterectomy with preservation of the ovaries 39 were taking therapy (25 %). Among women taking <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> for the relief of menopausal symptoms, the highest rate of use was among those aged 50 - 54 years where 93 were on therapy (24 % of women in that age group in the practice). Twenty out of 47 women with a recorded risk factor for osteoporosis were taking therapy. More than three quarters of women using <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> appeared to be taking it continuously. CONCLUSION. The uptake of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> was found to be high for women with a surgical menopause, the group most easily identifiable as at risk of osteoporosis. Women who decided to take therapy appeared to take it continuously, and therefore effectively for prevention. Rate of uptake, rather than compliance, is more likely to constrain its use in prevention...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hormone</b> {{replacement}} <b>therapy</b> {{can successfully}} treat menopausal symptoms. A postal questionnaire {{was used to}} investigate the knowledge of and attitudes to <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> of an age-stratified, computer-generated, representative sample of 1500 women living in the Grampian region of Scotland. A response rate of 78 % was achieved. Comparisons were made between women of differing age, educational background and their current or past experience of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> The questionnaire also assessed their knowledge of osteoporosis, including the possible beneficial role of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> The results showed that women had a poor knowledge of the potential {{risks and benefits of}} oestrogen, lack of knowledge being greatest in the less educated and older women. The majority of women agreed with the view that because the menopause is brought on by diminished hormone levels, it should be viewed as a medical condition and treated as such, and also that a woman who experiences distressing menopausal symptoms should take <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> Despite this, relatively few postmenopausal women were currently taking <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> (9 %) or had taken the treatment in the past (7 %), although many had experienced menopausal symptoms for over six months. The most common reason for postmenopausal women never having taken <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> was that they had never considered the treatment (70 %) and had not discussed it with a doctor (79 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To survey current {{prescribing}} {{practice for}} <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> among general practitioners and to elicit {{their views on}} the role of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> in the prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease; to determine whether they would participate in randomised controlled trials to evaluate the long term beneficial and adverse effects of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> DESIGN [...] Postal questionnaires to general practitioners throughout the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS [...] 1268 general practitioners in the Medical Research Council's general practice research framework. RESULTS [...] 1081 (85 %) doctors in 220 (95 %) practices responded. The doctors were currently prescribing <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> to an estimated 9 % of their female patients aged 40 to 64, and 55 % of doctors were prescribing opposed <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> (oestrogen plus progestogen) to more patients than a year previously. Over half the doctors would consider prescribing <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> for prevention of osteoporosis (670, 62 %) and cardiovascular disease (611, 57 %) to asymptomatic women. Overall, 79 % of the doctors (851) would definitely or probably consider entering women who have had a hysterectomy into a randomised controlled trial comparing unopposed (oestrogen only) <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> with opposed <b>hormone</b> replacement therapy; 49 % (524) would enter patients with a uterus into such a trial. Among a subsample, 85 % (180 / 210) would consider entering patients without menopausal symptoms into a trial comparing <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> with no treatment (unopposed in patients who have had a hysterectomy, opposed in those with a uterus). CONCLUSION [...] There is considerable uncertainty among general practitioners as to the balance of beneficial and harmful effects of <b>hormone</b> replacement <b>therapy</b> in the long term, particularly relating to its use for prevention of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Most of these doctors would be prepared to participate in randomised controlled trials to determine the long term effects of this increasingly widely used treatment...|$|R
