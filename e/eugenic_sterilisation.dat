50|$|Both Mapother {{and then}} deputy Aubrey Lewis {{supported}} involuntary <b>eugenic</b> <b>sterilisation,</b> unequivocally recommending {{it to the}} Brock Committee in 1932. Lewis {{was a member of}} the Eugenics Society and a 1934 chapter he authored is 'remarkable for its total admiration for the German work and workers". With the spread of National Socialist (Nazi) laws in Germany from 1933, however, they decryed the Nazi conflation of therapy and punishment, a move partly attributed to political and funding expediency. The Maudsley maintained its links with Germany, taking on both pro-Nazis and Jewish emigres through fellowships provided by the Commonwealth Fund and, after 1935, large scale funds from the American Rockefeller Foundation. Eliot Slater continued to visit Munich through the 1930s and contributed to academic festivities honouring Nazi eugenicist Ernst Rudin. During this time, Maudsley psychiatry developed a distinctive combination of practical experimentation and intellectual scepticism.|$|E

50|$|The {{mental hygiene}} movement, {{related to the}} social hygiene movement, had at times been {{associated}} with advocating <b>eugenics</b> and <b>sterilisation</b> of those considered too mentally deficient to be assisted into productive work and contented family life. In the post-WWII years, references to mental hygiene were gradually replaced by the term 'mental health' due to its positive aspect that evolves from the treatment of illness to preventive and promotive areas of healthcare.|$|R

Z hlediska dějin se studie snaží objasnit základy, na nichž celá akce spočívala, především pojetí antropologie a legitimizaci celého eutanazijního programu. After a {{sterilisation}} of {{mentally and}} psychologically ill people, {{there is a}} program of "merciful" death but these killing methods including gas chamber, injections and starving out death are later as "efficient" used {{in the frame of}} the "Final Jewish and Gypsy solution" program and further on in the case of elimination of Slavic population, Soviet war captives, individuals considered as asocial, unable to work and people ill with tuberculosis. The Nazis had to deal with democracy, the Enlightment and Christianity within their way of thinking. The sterilisation enforced by state, euthanasia and other mass killing methods denied both the Enlightment human and philosophical ideals and against theological formulations about everybody's life right. Theories of euthanasia, <b>eugenics,</b> <b>sterilisation,</b> think tank, "terms" as Lebensunwerten Lebens in Germany are established and developed at universities and scientific departments that were neutral to this situation, under the democratic conditions of Weimar republic...|$|R
40|$|Pneumoencephalography, {{a medical}} {{procedure}} {{to show up}} the brain ventricles on an X-Ray-picture after the injection of air, is outdated in the modern medicine. However, it {{played an important role}} in the diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric diseases from the beginning of the 1920 s until the introduction of angiography and computed tomography in the 1970 s. Pneumoencephalography was the first medical imaging procedure to allow the examination of live patients’ brains. This paper explores the development, spreading and use of this procedure in Germany by means of historical documents and records. Ideological tendencies and other scientific controversies which played a role in its history will be represented. Pneumoencephalography was developed parallel and independently by the American Walter Edward Dandy and the German Adolf Bingel. Besides the diagnosis of braintumors and hydrocephalus, it served for the examination of psychiatric diseases, like schizophrenia. Against the background of <b>eugenics,</b> <b>sterilisation</b> and euthanasia in the Nazi Germany pneumoencephalography was also used to measure the worth of human life. Because the use of the pneumoencephalography was connected with severe complaints and health risks of the patients, the fundamental principle of the medicine, „primum nil nocere” strongly competed with the use of this medical procedure. This will be displayed by historical medical records of a neurological and psychiatric clinic for children in Berlin („Städtische Nervenklinik für Kinder und Jugendliche”). In this clinic children were examined by the pneumoencephalography systematically and in some cases experimentally...|$|R

50|$|The group saw {{the middle}} classes being {{squeezed}} by not only a growing labour movement but also by a government that was taking on an increasing role in economic life and banded together {{with the aim of}} protecting middle-class interests against both potential enemies. Its main pre-occupation was its opposition to socialism and in particular strike action, although it also became associated with the policies of <b>eugenics</b> and <b>sterilisation</b> programmes as a means to reduce the population and as a result reduce poverty. In opposing high taxation to pay for social reform the Union pre-empted the policies of the Anti-Waste League, a party formed in 1921 from a similar middle-class basis which briefly threatened the hegemony of the Conservative Party on the political right.|$|R

5000|$|Under Nazi rule in Germany, the {{dismantling}} of rights for LGBT individuals was approached in two ways. By strengthening and re-enforcing existing laws that had fallen into disuse, male homosexuality was effectively re-criminalised; homosexuality {{was treated as a}} medical disorder, but at a social level rather than individual level intended to reduce the incidence of homosexuality. The treatment was a program of <b>eugenics,</b> starting with <b>sterilisation,</b> then a system of working people to death in forced labour camps, and eventually refined by medical scientists to include euthanasia. The driving force was the elimination of perceived degeneracy at various levels - genetic, social, identity and practice, and the elimination of such genetic material in society. Lifton wrote about this in his book The Nazi Doctors: ...|$|R
5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of <b>eugenics</b> through the <b>sterilisation</b> of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|R
40|$|Estonia {{between the}} two world wars was among the few {{societies}} in Europe to have a strong eugenics movement (eugenics society was established in 1924) and to accept <b>eugenic</b> legislation (<b>Sterilisation</b> Law from the year 1936). The roots of the eugenics ideology reach into the pre-independence era, when, in the end of the 19 th {{and the beginning of the}} 20 th century the Estonian national discourse was notoriously biologized owing to the so-called small nation’s self perception, highlighting, and both the quality and quantity issues of the "national body". The birth of the eugenics ideology in Estonia can be linked to the developments in the local abstinence movement. The latter, which emerged in the 1880 s, became by the early 20 th century medically oriented and dominated by the leaders of the national movement who tried to use the initiative for political goals. The latter aspect gave the movement a paternalist accent, alienating the national elites from the masses involved in the movement. There was also a gap within the ideological framework of the movement itself, taking place between the proponents of the so-called direct and indirect anti-alcohol work. The first, representing mainly the modest and liberal section of the national elites, stressed the people’s free will and personal choice. The second wing, deriving from radical intellectuals, many of which later turned to solidarism, favoured the imposing of limitations and regulations by the society to keep people away from alcohol. This approach was criticized by the liberals for the paternalist approach it was containing, rendering human beings to plainly biological entities. This also played an important role in the increasing significance of the anti-alcohol movement in supporting the emergence of a eugenic society. The Estonian eugenics movement and the ideology it was carrying reached its peak in 1934 when the state followed an autocratic/totalitarian path of development. The concept supporting antidemocratic developments was “national entirety”, the latter containing a notorious degree of solidarist (biologized) approach. It was the era when the parallel histories of eugenics and the temperance movement started to move apart - the eugenics ideology being preferred by the state as it placed its own interests, rather than the interests of individual citizens, to the fore...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{justification}} for Nazi programs involving involuntary euthanasia, forced <b>sterilisation,</b> <b>eugenics</b> and human experimentation were {{strongly influenced by}} views about human dignity. The historical development of these views should be examined today because discussions of human worth and value are integral to medical ethics and bioethics. We should learn lessons from how human dignity came to be so distorted to avoid repetition of similar distortions. Discussion Social Darwinism was foremost amongst the philosophies impacting views of human dignity in the decades leading up to Nazi power in Germany. Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory was quickly applied to human beings and social structure. The term 'survival of the fittest' was coined and seen to be applicable to humans. Belief in the inherent dignity of all humans was rejected by social Darwinists. Influential authors of the day proclaimed that an individual's worth and value were to be determined functionally and materialistically. The popularity of such views ideologically prepared German doctors and nurses to accept Nazi social policies promoting survival of only the fittest humans. A historical survey reveals five general presuppositions that strongly impacted medical ethics in the Nazi era. These same five beliefs are being promoted in different ways in contemporary bioethical discourse. Ethical controversies surrounding human embryos revolve around determinations of their moral status. Economic pressures force individuals and societies to examine whether some people's lives are no longer worth living. Human dignity is again being seen as a relative trait found in certain humans, not something inherent. These views strongly impact what is taken to be acceptable within medical ethics.
