5|$|The medieval {{doctrine}} of divine simplicity also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties– these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as <b>good</b> <b>would</b> entail that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the {{doctrine of}} divine simplicity.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, {{intending}} to enter King's College, Cambridge later that year. When Britain entered {{the war against}} Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the Essex Regiment. He was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some <b>good</b> <b>would</b> come of it and he edited a privately issued collection of Oscar's letters home under the title Trusty and Well Beloved, released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing a poem about his experience afterwards—something {{he had been doing}} more frequently since Oscar's death—and a collection of his war poetry, Ballad of Ensign Joy, was published later that year.|$|E

5000|$|David McMullen's {{concept of}} {{decentralized}} non-market socialism advocates social {{ownership of the}} means of production, believing it to be far more efficient than private ownership. In his proposal, property titles would be replaced by [...] "usership" [...] rights, and the exchange of capital <b>goods</b> <b>would</b> no longer be possible. Market exchange in capital <b>goods</b> <b>would</b> be replaced by internal transfers of resources, but an internal and decentralized price system would be fundamental to this systems' operation.|$|R
25|$|Many polytheistic deities since prehistoric {{times have}} been {{assumed to be}} neither good nor evil (or to have both qualities). Thus dystheism is {{normally}} used {{in reference to the}} Judeo-Christian God. In conceptions of God as the summum bonum, the proposition of God not being wholly <b>good</b> <b>would</b> of course be an oxymoron.|$|E
25|$|Grimm was {{not made}} to be a politician, and also soon {{realized}} that the National Assembly was not getting anywhere (it was eventually dissolved without establishing a constitution), and so asked {{to be released from}} his duties and returned with relief to his former studies. His political career did not bloom into anything great, but it does illustrate his characteristics—his nationalism and his moralism. He believed that <b>good</b> <b>would</b> triumph in the Parliament, and pushed for human rights legislation just as he wished for a unified Germany.|$|E
25|$|Effective altruists {{argue that}} {{counterfactual}} reasoning {{is important to}} determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume {{that the best way}} to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services, but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing to work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much <b>good</b> <b>would</b> have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.|$|E

25|$|Bravery, {{self-reliance}} {{and strength}} {{are the greatest}} virtues. Underhandedness of any kind are dishonorable and at odds with Ulric's nature of directness and honor. Obey your military superiors and never refuse an order unless doing so would break another of Ulric's tenets. Never refuse a direct challenge. Modern weapons, such as gunpowder weapons, artillery, crossbows and fire-bombs, {{because they do not}} rely any physical strength are shunned. Followers of Ulric must never allow one of the fires of a shrine or temple to go out. Oppose Chaos wherever you see it. Never flee a fight unless facing overwhelming odds and the greater <b>good</b> <b>would</b> be served by such a flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{starting}} point of the scholarly controversy is the disputed meaning of the Greek concept of ousia. This is an ordinary Greek word and literally means 'being.' In philosophical contexts, it is usually translated by 'Being' or 'Essence.' Plato's Republic says that the Good is 'not ousia' but is rather 'beyond ousia' and surpasses it as an origin and in power. If this passage implies only that the essence or nature of the Good is beyond Being (but not the Good itself), or if the passage is just interpreted loosely, then the Form of the Good can retain its place inside {{the realm of the}} Forms, i.e., the realm of things with real Being. In this case the Good is not absolutely transcendent: it does not transcend Being and somehow exist above it. The <b>Good</b> <b>would</b> therefore have a place in the hierarchy of real Beings. According to this interpretation, the Good is not an issue for the two principles of the unwritten doctrines but only for the Theory of Forms. On the other hand, if the passage in the Republic is read literally and 'ousia' means 'Being,' then the phrase 'beyond Being' implies the Good actually transcends Being. According to this interpretation, Plato considered the Good to be absolutely transcendent and it must be integrated into the realm of the two principles.|$|E
500|$|Christian {{is desperate}} to find Aaron and locates his home {{address and phone}} number. Aaron's mother informs him that [...] "Thanks to you, my son took a razor to his wrists; thanks to you I have lost my son." [...] Believing that Aaron is dead, Christian spends {{the next few days}} {{thinking}} continually about Aaron. Julie discovers an entry about Christian's feelings in his cellphone journal and uses it as the basis for her new song. Christian travels to the Davis home in Idaho, where he tearfully returns Aaron's watch to his mother. During an encounter with Julie, she hesitantly shows him her new video, which upsets Christian, realizing that part of the lyrics came from his personal journal without his consent. Julie tells Christian that she hoped something <b>good</b> <b>would</b> come from it.|$|E
50|$|There were {{no further}} caravans {{because of the}} Dzungar wars. In 1762 Catherine {{replaced}} state caravans with free trade. Russian <b>goods</b> <b>would</b> be sold or bartered at Kyakhta.|$|R

25|$|A hike in {{the cost}} of raw <b>goods</b> <b>would</b> {{decrease}} supply, shifting costs up, while a discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.|$|R
500|$|A <b>good</b> <b>would</b> be {{considered}} [...] "used" [...] and not taxable if a consumer already owns {{it before the}} FairTax takes effect or if the FairTax has been paid previously on the good, which may {{be different from the}} item being sold previously. Personal services such as health care, legal services, financial services, and auto repairs would be subject to the FairTax, as would renting apartments and other real property. [...] Food, clothing, prescription drugs and medical services would be taxed. (State sales taxes generally exempt these types of basic-need items in an effort to reduce the tax burden on low-income families. The FairTax would use a monthly rebate system instead of the common state exclusions.) Internet purchases would be taxed, as would retail international purchases (such as a boat or car) that are imported to the United States (collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection).|$|E
500|$|Walras' law was {{introduced}} as a theoretical {{answer to the}} problem of determining the solutions in general equilibrium. [...] His notation is different from modern notation but can be constructed using more modern summation notation. [...] Walras assumed that in equilibrium, all money would be spent on all goods: every <b>good</b> <b>would</b> be sold at the market price for that good and every buyer would expend their last dollar on a basket of goods. [...] Starting from this assumption, Walras could then show that if there were n markets and n-1 markets cleared (reached equilibrium conditions) that the nth market would clear as well. [...] This is easiest to visualize with two markets (considered in most texts as a market for goods and a market for money). [...] If one of two markets has reached an equilibrium state, no additional goods (or conversely, money) can enter or exit the second market, so it must be in a state of equilibrium as well. [...] Walras used this statement to move toward a proof of existence of solutions to general equilibrium but it is commonly used today to illustrate market clearing in money markets at the undergraduate level.|$|E
2500|$|... were {{collected}} in the hope or expectation that some other and collateral <b>good</b> <b>would</b> be furthered as an incident, that, without more, would not make the act invalid. Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U.S. 506. This indeed is hardly questioned.|$|E
30|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>would</b> be sorted {{and taken}} the last mile to {{businesses}} {{through the use}} of bicycle couriers and electric vans, using a scheme similar to that used by GNewt Cargo (Sect.  2.6).|$|R
2500|$|Now lets use {{the same}} {{assumption}} that the end price to the consumer remains $25,000 {{and there are no}} taxes. All <b>goods</b> <b>would</b> be sold for $25,000 and no manufacturer has an advantage: ...|$|R
5000|$|Capital <b>goods</b> <b>would</b> {{be sold to}} {{industry}} on a [...] "lease-rental-depreciation" [...] plan of repayment to perpetuate employment. Profits arising from the rental of buildings would be abolished in the accounting system of private enterprise.|$|R
2500|$|Act utilitarianism {{not only}} {{requires}} everyone {{to do what}} they can to maximize utility, but to do so without any favouritism. Mill said, [...] "As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator." [...] Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. [...] "What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them." [...] As Shelly Kagan says, [...] "Given the parameters of the actual world, {{there is no question that}} …(maximally)… promoting the <b>good</b> <b>would</b> require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity…a life spent promoting the <b>good</b> <b>would</b> be a severe one indeed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, a joint-product model {{analyzes}} the collaborative effect of joining a private good {{to a public}} good. For example, a tax deduction (private good) can be tied to a donation to a charity (public good). [...] It can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good, {{as long as the}} private good is provided by a monopoly (otherwise the private <b>good</b> <b>would</b> be provided by competitors without the link to the public good).|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Nas {{announced}} that he would release collaboration albums with Mobb Deep, Common, and a third with DJ Premier. Common said of the project in a 2011 interview, [...] "At some point, we will do that. We'd talked about it and we had a good idea to call it Nas.Com. That was actually going to be a mixtape at one point. But we decided that we should make it an album." [...] Life is <b>Good</b> <b>would</b> be nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.|$|E
50|$|A {{good that}} is made {{available}} at zero price {{is not necessarily a}} free good. For example, a shop might give away its stock in its promotion, but producing these <b>goods</b> <b>would</b> still have required the use of scarce resources.|$|R
5000|$|The {{establishment}} of a protective tariff, a 20%-25% tax on imported <b>goods,</b> <b>would</b> protect a nation’s business from foreign competition. Congress passed a tariff in 1816 which made European goods more expensive and encouraged consumers to buy relatively cheap American-made goods.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the GST, goods could be purchased from suppliers offering duty-free pricing upon presentation of a current passport and airline tickets. The <b>goods</b> <b>would</b> then remain sealed until the passenger had passed through the customs area at an airport.|$|R
2500|$|Redpath {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as an affable individual. However, during player payment negotiations in 1974–75, despite record takings at the gate, the Australian Cricket Board refused any thought of a player pay rise. When Australian Cricket Board administrator Alan Barnes told a dressing room of Australian cricketers that there were 50,000 others who {{would be prepared to}} play for Australia for nothing, the normally mild mannered Redpath reacted. According to Ian Chappell, Redpath grabbed Barnes around the throat and had him up against a wall, saying [...] "You bloody idiot. Of course there are 500,000 out there who would play for nothing. But how bloody <b>good</b> <b>would</b> the Australian team be?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Seedman's {{role in the}} police's {{exit from}} the mosque was not known until a secret report was {{released}} in 1983, as Deputy Commissioner Benjamin Ward, who many officers blamed for the order to withdraw, {{was on the verge}} of becoming the city's first African American police commissioner. The secret report, known as the [...] "blue book", indicated that Seedman, not Ward, had given the order. Confronted with this by a Newsday reporter, who wanted to know why he had let Ward take the blame for so many years, Seedman said [...] "What <b>good</b> <b>would</b> it have done?" [...] With the truth now known, Ward became commissioner.|$|E
2500|$|According to Daniel Hallin, the {{dramatic}} {{structure of the}} uncensored [...] "living room war" [...] as reported during 19651967 remained simple and traditional: [...] "the forces of good were locked in battle once again with the forces of evil. What began to change in 1967... was {{the conviction that the}} forces of <b>good</b> <b>would</b> inevitably prevail." [...] During late 1967 MACV had also begun to disregard the decision it had made at the Honolulu Conference that the military should leave the justification of the war to elected officials in Washington. The military found itself drawn progressively into politics, {{to the point that it}} had become as involved in [...] "selling" [...] the war to the American public as the political appointees it served. This change would have far-reaching detrimental effects.|$|E
50|$|In Raffles, {{there was}} an {{agreement}} to ship goods on a vessel named Peerless, but each party was referring to a different vessel. Therefore, each party had a different understanding {{that they did not}} communicate about when the <b>goods</b> <b>would</b> be shipped.|$|R
