40|$|A two-hop {{wireless}} communication link {{in which a}} source sends data to a destination {{with the aid of}} an <b>intermediate</b> <b>relay</b> node is studied. It is assumed that there is no direct link between the source and the destination, and the relay forwards the information to the destination by employing the decode-and-forward scheme. Both the source and <b>intermediate</b> <b>relay</b> nodes are assumed to operate under statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints imposed as limitations on the buffer overflow probabilities. The maximum constant arrival rates that can be supported by this two-hop link in the presence of QoS constraints are characterized by determining the effective capacity of such links {{as a function of the}} QoS parameters and signal-to-noise ratios at the source and relay, and the fading distributions of the links. The analysis is performed for both full-duplex and half-duplex relaying. Through this study, the impact upon the throughput of having buffer constraints at the source and <b>intermediate</b> <b>relay</b> nodes is identified.
