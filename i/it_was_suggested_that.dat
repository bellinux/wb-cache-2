5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the brolga, sarus crane (Antigone antigone) and white-naped crane (Antigone vipio) {{formed a}} natural {{group on the}} basis of {{similarities}} in their calls. This was further confirmed by molecular studies of their DNA. These also showed that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped crane than it is to the morphologically more similar sarus crane.|$|E
5|$|Initially, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> tolling {{would cease}} once the {{original}} cost of construction plus accrued interest was repaid â€“ {{this was done}} in 1993 and it was planned that tolls would not be levied after May 1995. Instead legislation enabling the continued levying of tolls was renewed by Parliament (originally that of the UK but now the Scottish Parliament) in 1998, 2003 and 2006.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{seeks to}} examine the concept of mateship from the {{perspectives}} of consequentialist and virtue ethics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> mateship <b>is</b> a prominent concept in the way Australians think of themselves. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> mateship <b>is</b> linked to solidarity and commitment in time of war. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> what we should recognize mateship is one of the factors that facilitates and perpetuates war. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> mateship <b>is</b> also questionable as a character virtue, given what mateship entails. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> ultimately we need to examine more closely the consequences of the solidarity that we define as mateship, and we need to query more closely what we regard as virtues. Article The phenomenon of mateship is often claimed within public discourse to be a defining characteristic of what <b>it</b> means to <b>be</b> Australian. Recently there was a suggestion that there be a specific reference within the Australian Constitution to the value of mateship for Australians (Howard 1999). One could even suggest tha...|$|R

5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government. The ACT {{was the only}} other mainland territory, with a population greater than that of the Northern Territory that was growing faster, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, then it must also be appropriate for the ACT.|$|E

Bodkin had the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E

5|$|British Expeditionary Force {{commander}} General Douglas Haig and Second Army commander General Herbert Plumer both {{believed it}} necessary to expel the Germans from the captured positions. In view of the preparations for the Somme offensive, Haig {{did not wish to}} divert more forces than were necessary. Support was limited to a number of additional artillery units and an infantry brigade from the 20th (Light) Division. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the next counterattack be carried out with the infantry available, with a particularly large emphasis placed on artillery.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{representatives of}} the genus were {{assigned}} to the family Azotobacteraceae Pribram, 1933, but then were transferred to the family Pseudomonadaceae based on the studies of nucleotide sequences 16S rRNA. In 2004, a phylogenetic study revealed that A. vinelandii belongs to the same clade as the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and in 2007 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the genera Azotobacter, Azomonas and Pseudomonas are related and might be synonyms.|$|E
5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} minority populations. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> 'mainstream' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address the concerns of minority women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E

In February 1915, he was attached to the Royal Flying Corps and soon became No. 2 Squadron's senior observer. In August 1915, while on a photographic reconnaissance mission, his aircraft was shot down in northern France, near Lille.

5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
