5|$|The East Angles formed one of {{the seven}} kingdoms known to post-mediaeval historians as the Heptarchy, a scheme used by Henry of Huntingdon in the twelfth century. Some modern historians have {{questioned}} whether seven independent kingdoms <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> existed contemporaneously, and claim that the political situation was much more complicated.|$|E
5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister Sharif {{announced}} that it would open unconditional talks with the Taliban, declaring them stakeholders rather than terrorists. The PML-N's conservative hardliners also chose to blame the US and NATO for causing terrorism in Pakistan. The peace effort was encountering problems before it had <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> begun. The Pakistani Taliban's Supreme Council released demands for a cease-fire, to also include the release of all its imprisoned militants and the withdrawal of the Pakistani military from all tribal regions. Former and current government officials criticised Sharif for not yet laying out a clear vision of how the country should handle its more than 40 militant groups, many of them made up of violent Islamic extremists.|$|E
25|$|Monty Cranfield was a right-arm leg {{break and}} off break bowler and a {{right-handed}} lower-order batsman who played fairly regularly for Gloucestershire {{both before and}} after the Second World War without <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> being certain of his place in the team. As a spin bowler, he coincided for much of his career with off-spinner Tom Goddard and then later with the slow left-arm spin bowler Sam Cook, both Test players and inevitable first-choice bowlers. As a result, he never achieved 50 wickets in a single English season, and nor did he ever bowl as many as 500 overs in a single season. As a batsman, though he often made useful runs, he had only one season, when he was 37 years old, when he was anywhere close to a front-line batsman.|$|E

[...] New York magazine's Vulture.com ranked it number 6 on its list of 2015's top 10 music videos. As of November 2017, the video had received more than 870 million views on YouTube.

500|$|Delorentos' {{third album}} was {{released}} on 27 January 2012. It had been recorded over the summer of 2011 with producer Rob Kirwan in Grouse Lodge studios, Westmeath and Exchequer Studios Dublin. The album was different as Kirwan insisted on two weeks' Pre-production beforehand, something the band had not down before. The record was recorded over three months with engineer Colin Murphy, and Cenzo Townsend additionally mixing a number of tracks. The first single from the record, [...] "Did we <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> Try" [...] was released in October 2011 with an accompanying EP Magazine - written by the band with contributions from other artists and musicians. It reached number 10 on the charts, despite not being available in record stores, only the band's own [...] "pop-up stores".|$|E
500|$|Another common {{criticism}} {{was that the}} book was aimed at fans of The Simpsons and not a general audience. A preview in People said the bottom line was that the book is [...] "for die-hard fans only." [...] Bacchus concurred, saying [...] "Cartwright writes {{as if she were}} speaking to devotees of The Simpsons Fan Club, too often providing bland tidbits of background that only obsessives would <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> care about." [...] Rob Sheridan of the National Post also believes that the book is [...] "aimed squarely at rabid Simpsons fans", and criticized the writing, commenting that [...] "the chronology of her story is sometimes muddled, and a lot of sentences have that first-draft feeling [...] But none of this is anything to have a cow about." ...|$|E
500|$|Brandon Sanderson's {{review in}} The Official Time Waster's Guide cites the comic's world design, {{longevity}} and a discomforting setting where intelligent animals are killed as strengths. However, Sanderson also complained that Holbrook does not enforce this aspect {{in the main}} characters, saying, [...] "While Kell, Rudy, and others make kills every day, none of the main character herbivores <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> {{have to worry about}} being stalked and killed. When they are threatened (such as when Lindesfarne is stalked by some cougars near the beginning of the comic's run), the enemy predators are presented as dark, evil things to be defeated.…This sense of careless, off-handed killing gives the comic a lot of its humor—however, to maintain that air of humor, Bill never allows the society to work its everyday worst on any of the main characters." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The {{consensus}} among the music press was that Mariah's insistence on {{including the new}} material {{made all the difference}} in increasing sales figures more than expected. Including some new with the old in a greatest-hits package had been tried from time to time by other artists with varying degrees of success, but with the triumph of #1's, it would become a regular element in nearly all future greatest-hits albums. As such packages go, #1's was a solid retrospective of Mariah's chart hits, but because these songs were oversaturating the radio, including a favorite nonhit album track or two might have made a nice change. The new songs were a definite bones even though none <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> rose to the spectacular level of her best ... they added up to a nice touch but little more." ...|$|E
500|$|With S.H.I.E.L.D. being {{announced}} {{as a legitimate}} organization again, after working in secret {{since the end of}} the series' first season, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the reaction to this would be mixed, as [...] "there are people who, as we see with the senator, are outspoken against Inhumans and will be against any form of protection for them. There are also people who are afraid. The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the fun part about a genre TV show is you can speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our world right now. We get to do that with humans and Inhumans. We get to tackle those issues head-on without <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> talking about them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} largely {{neglected}} by the record label, which {{did little to}} no promotion in the US. Pearlman stated that [...] "there was actually no intention {{on the part of}} Columbia Records at all to promote it. (...) Basically the people wanted to work it and they were told not to work it". Roeser commented later that he did not [...] "think Sony’s <b>ever</b> <b>really</b> known how to sell us, from the beginning (...) and Columbia never felt that they knew how to market us". Imaginos fared better with CBS International, which distributed the album abroad and produced a music video for [...] "Astronomy" [...] in the UK, which aired in coincidence with the European tour dates of 1989. The video clip does not feature members of the band, but begins with the spoken introduction by Stephen King and focuses on the storyline narrated in the album.|$|E

"No," [...] {{answered}} Agatha reflectively, [...] "since {{you have}} compelled {{me to say}} it, I don't think now that I <b>ever</b> was <b>really</b> fond of him, though I don't know how I can make that quite clear to you.
