His novels {{captured}} the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family {{to pass through the}} lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

5|$|Charles' abdication had {{far-reaching}} {{consequences in}} imperial {{diplomatic relations with}} France and the Netherlands, particularly in his allotment of the Spanish kingdom to Philip. In France, the kings and their ministers grew increasingly uneasy about Habsburg encirclement and sought allies against Habsburg hegemony from among the border German territories; they were even prepared to ally {{with some of the}} Protestant kings. In the Netherlands, Philip's ascension in Spain raised particular problems; for the sake of harmony, order, and prosperity, Charles had not oppressed the Reformation as harshly there as did Philip, and Charles had even had tolerated a high level of local autonomy. An ardent Catholic and rigidly autocratic prince, Philip pursued an aggressive political, economic and religious policy toward the Dutch, resulting in their rebellion shortly after he became king. Philip's militant response meant the occupation of much of the upper provinces by troops of, or hired by, Habsburg Spain and the constant <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of Spanish men and provisions over the Spanish road from northern Italy, through the Burgundian lands, into and from Flanders.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of New Brunswick politics {{are different from}} those of other Canadian provinces. The lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province. In addition, the presence of a large Francophone minority dictates that consensus politics is necessary, even when there is a majority government present. In this manner, the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of New Brunswick provincial politics parallels the federal stage.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of {{closures}} of major industrial employers {{took place in the}} first half of the 20th century, due to the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of trade.

25|$|Various {{proposals}} for a fixed link across the Northumberland Strait {{can be traced}} {{as far back as}} the 1870s when the province's railway system was developed. Subsequent proposals arose during federal elections in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of public support for a fixed link was indirectly tied to the varying levels of federal investment in ferry and steamship connections to the province over the years, finally culminating in a proposal in the mid-1980s which resulted in the current bridge being constructed.|$|E

The 1528 AD (935 AH) Tomb of Babur in Kabul is much more modest in comparison, with a simple cenotaph exposed to the sky, laid out in the centre of a walled garden.|$|E
25|$|Slightly paralleled by A. L. Rowse, {{author of}} Shakespeare's Sonnets: The Problems Solved, lines 3-4 are {{interpreted}} as {{alluding to the}} youth's beauty as a contrast with his friends. As the youth's beauty wanes, so his friends wither, as he grows older; contrasting Sethna's view of the youth's beauty accentuating Shakespeare's lack of beauty. Rowse also suggests that this idea may also imply a further consistency; Shakespeare's concern with the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of things; their waxing and waning. Perhaps the influence of constant Ovidian thought.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the larval stage, the pupal stage seems {{much less}} variable.

Most importantly, though, through these devices, Nash reveals {{more and more}} of the contradictions and complexities at the core of his work: the instability generated by his obsessive examination of traditional R tropes – love, sex, money – from every possible angle; the frictions of his own fractured self-perception.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} ice ages {{are not fully}} {{understood}} for either the large-scale ice age periods or the smaller <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of glacial–interglacial periods within an ice age. The consensus is that several factors are important: atmospheric composition, such as the concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} methane (the specific levels of the previously mentioned gases are now able to be seen with the new ice core samples from EPICA Dome C in Antarctica over the past 800,000 years) changes in the earth's orbit around the Sun known as Milankovitch cycles, the motion of tectonic plates resulting in changes in the relative location and amount of continental and oceanic crust on the earth's surface, which affect wind and ocean currents, variations in solar output, the orbital dynamics of the Earth–Moon system, the impact of relatively large meteorites and volcanism including eruptions of supervolcanoes.|$|E

25|$|Many {{difficulties}} {{occurred in}} driving the piles which considerably retarded {{the progress of}} the work, and, among others, the peculiar effect of <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> during this operation is worthy of note. At flood-tide the sand became so hard as almost totally to resist the utmost efforts of driving, while at ebb the sand was quite loose, and allowed of doing so with facility. It was therefore found necessary to abandon the driving on many occasions during high water. The difference between high and low water is 11 feet 6 inches. Another difficulty arose from the quicksands beneath the foundations. Although the piles were driven to the rock bottom, the water forced its way up, baffling the attempts to fill in between them; this, however, was remedied by using a concrete made of broken stone and Roman cement, which was continually thrown in until the bottom was found to be secure.|$|E
25|$|This led to {{long periods}} of {{evolution}} in near complete isolation. The isolation of the island was not absolute, given {{the rise and fall}} of sea level caused by the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between Tasmania and its neighbour, mainland Australia. Thus new species came to Tasmania while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Birds and bats swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. Other seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of such types.|$|E
