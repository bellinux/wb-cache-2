40|$|The {{zero energy house}} project {{talks about}} sustainability. In general terms the house is {{designed}} to produce {{as much energy as}} it consume. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> to the house its possible to find several systems that takes as much profit as possible to the renewable energies like photovoltaic electricity production, geothermal energy used to run a heat pump or a well thought isolated house. First of all it’s possible to find general information about the topics in house, to make people understand how our project is working. Later on we will explain the main topics to discuss it and try to work with them. The first topic of the project consists of the study of the heat transfer between the house and the external environment and the heat transfer between the rooms of the house as well. The walls of the house will be studied. Every wall hasn’t the same seriousness inside the house, so, we will try to study and find the best options to improve the insulation system of the house in Kollum. The house in Kollum has a roof full of solar panels (photovoltaic panels). As it is said in the beginning, the house is supposed to produce the whole amount of energy consumed but, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> into the energy produced by the solar panels, you can realize that it’s possible {{to take advantage of the}} solar panels to produce more energy or simply waste less money. The heat pump uses the heat from the ground to provide the heating system and to supply some heat to the sanitary water. It is necessary to study how the heat pump works, to realize what are the inputs and outputs. After make the study it’s possible to see that the heat pump works, but you also can realize that the house could use a smaller heat pump. So, we will try to find a better solution for the heat production. The house uses a solar boiler to preheat the sanitary water. Depending on the period of the year the solar boiler will have different productions. Our goal is to improve the efficiency of the solar boiler to try to get the water as warm as possible without using the heat pump supply...|$|E

Tai ksenofobijos ir etninio nepakantumo augimas. Užuot bandydamos liberalizuoti migracijos įstatymus, Vakarų Europos valstybės pradeda vykdyti antiimigracinę ir ksenofobinę politiką. Tai dažniausiai daroma dešiniųjų populistinių partijų dėka, nes identiteto išsaugojimo klausimas yra jautrus, o populistinės partijos dažniausiai tuo ir naudojasi. Šiame darbe, be pateikto istorinio ksenofobijos konteksto, bandoma atsakyti į pagrindinį klausimą – kokiu būdu dešiniosios populistinės partijos naudoja ksenofobiją kaip priemonę savo politiniams tikslams pasiekti ir kiek tokios galimybės yra sėkmingos. 21 st {{century is}} called the century of democracy. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the {{contemporary}} political discourse and recent situation, {{it is evident that}} the real situation is far from the described above. “The resurgence of ideological and political turbulence in the late 1960 s, social conflicts rising in the early 1970 s, and the spread of mass protest by new social movements and citizen initiatives in the 1980 s were symptoms of a profound transformation of West European politics”. This transformation united xenophobia and the populist ideology into one strong phenomenon that became very popular among the European societies. “Populist parties are generally thought of as lacking grand visions on comprehensive ideological projects. Instead, they are presumed to appeal to common sense of common people, seek to divine mood swings of an increasingly volatile electorate, and to shape their political programs accordingly. ” Because of high popularity, radical right wing populism becomes stronger. The main purpose of today’s political and social elite is to stop or to prevent European societies from the possibility of becoming xenophobic nations full of fair and hatred. The way of preventing xenophobia and radical right wing populism is to create a unified and common European identity. “The future of radical right-wing populism ultimately depends on the degree on which it manages to incorporate the question of national identity into a coherent political program”. Since this question was successfully unified in the Western democracies, it is possible that these parties and xenophobic radicalism can come to new EU member states: to Lithuania as well...|$|E
