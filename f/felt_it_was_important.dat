5|$|The main {{character}} designer for the game, Tetsuya Nomura, had also worked on both Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The Tsviets were designed {{with the idea}} of creating a sense of balance for the warriors with which players would already be familiar; primarily Vincent, Cloud Strife and Sephiroth. Nomura initially had doubts when designing Shelke's ordinary clothes {{for the end of the}} game, but he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> for her to appear out of uniform so as to indicate she was truly free from Deepground. The character of G was based on the Japanese singer and actor Gackt, who wrote and performed the two theme songs of the game, and voiced G in the Japanese-language version of the game. Hideki Imaizumi, the producer of Crisis Core, liked the mysterious role of G so much, he decided to expand his character in that game. The character of Lucrecia Crescent, who features briefly in an optional quest in the original game, was redesigned so as to give her a similar appearance to her son, Sephiroth, based on portraits from guidebooks and in fan-art. Reeve Tuesti was also redesigned, as he only appears briefly in the original game as himself rather than through Cait Sith.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and written by Masato Kato. Ishii had previously produced or directed all of the previous Mana games, while Kato also wrote the stories for Children of Mana (2006) and Dawn of Mana (2006). The game was developed by Brownie Brown, who previously helped develop Sword of Mana (2003). Ishii created the overall design, and Brownie Brown worked directly with him to implement it. As the series creator, Ishii <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to be directly involved in all stages of development. Heroes of Mana was created as an RTS game to complement the other titles in the World of Mana project, which all offer a spin on the original Seiken Densetsu formula. Ishii stated that it was also to help expose Japanese gamers to real-time strategy games, a genre that is relatively obscure in Japan, while simultaneously satisfying players abroad with an RTS for an unconventional console, as most real-time strategy games are released for personal computers. To match this mission, the game was designed for more casual players than the typical fan of the traditionally role-playing game series. The Nintendo DS {{was chosen as the}} platform partially due to the system's multiplayer potential as well as giving the sensation of touching the game. The team found developing an RTS for the Nintendo DS to be difficult, and had to start development over at one point. Although prior to the World of Mana project Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, Heroes is explicitly set as a prequel to Seiken Densetsu 3 (1995), depicting battles between the nations present in that game. It is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3, with some characters noted as the parents of characters in the other game.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Reeve was in three roles for {{television}} {{in which he}} was cast as a villain. The most notable of these was Bump in the Night based on the novel by Isabelle Holland in which Reeve played a child molester who abducts a young boy in New York City. The movie got fair to positive reviews. Reeve <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> for parents of young children to see the film. It is on home video in the UK, but not in the US.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Uthman's caliphate, there was a {{perceived}} need for clarification of Quran reading. The Caliphate had grown considerably, expanding into Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Iran, bringing into Islam's fold many new converts from various cultures {{with varying degrees of}} isolation. These converts spoke a variety of languages but were not well learned in Arabic, and so Uthman <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to standardize the written text of the Quran into one specific Arabic dialect. Another reason for compiling the Quran was that many Muslims who had memorised the Quran in its entirety (huffaz) were dying, especially in battle.|$|E

500|$|Caldwell and Anderson {{deliberately}} did {{not meet}} before their reunion scene in [...] "Collision" [...] as they {{wanted it to be}} as authentic as possible. In the following episode, Hurley comments that he did not expect Rose's husband to be white, before Jack quickly changes the subject. The producers <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to address that they are an interracial couple, and that Hurley was saying what the audience would be thinking. Caldwell agreed with them and thought it would be odd if the issue was not addressed. Anderson also was glad that Hurley brought up the issue, and liked that Jack did not pay any attention.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of colonization, many European {{settlers}} were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares. Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash. European missionaries and others <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to [...] "civilize" [...] the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.|$|E

50|$|Len Evans <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> that wine <b>be</b> demystified, {{and that}} an {{appreciation}} and basic understanding of <b>it</b> <b>be</b> available to everyone, not just to an educated elite. To this end, he wrote a column for wine in The Australian Women's Weekly for years, discussing various wines, usually very reasonably priced, in an open, relatively jargon-free manner.|$|R
500|$|Foote based Sledge's {{victory over}} {{alcoholism}} on his observations of theater people {{struggling with the}} problem. He sought to avoid a melodramatic slant in telling that aspect of the story. Foote described his protagonist as [...] "a very hurt, damaged man... silence was his weapon". He chose the title Tender Mercies, from the Book of Psalms, for its relation to the Rosa Lee character, who he said seeks only [...] "certain moments of gentleness or respite, [...] grandness or largeness". Foote sought to portray each character as realistic and flawed, but not unsympathetic. Although the script conveyed a strong spiritual message with religious undertones, Foote <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to balance those religious elements {{with a focus on}} the practical challenges of everyday life.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} Jerry-centered episode arose {{when the}} writers decided one of the {{characters}} would get mugged. Muharrar said, [...] "Once we thought about it, it was obvious it had to be Jerry. He's the Parks Department punching bag, and it seemed like it was time for Jerry's revenge." [...] Muharrar said the script tried to convey that although his co-workers mock him, they do not hate him, and that Jerry does not take the jokes against him personally. Series co-creator Michael Schur said once it was established in the episode [...] "Practice Date" [...] that Jerry was the co-worker everyone else picked on, he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to write an episode that established the other characters actually liked Jerry, despite their jokes at his expense.|$|E
500|$|We {{all know}} that steel making has been {{important}} to south Wales, just as slate making has changed {{the landscape of the}} north. We have to use a special type of steel that won't go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool. For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a [...] "natural" [...] texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason I <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. â€”architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
5000|$|The Scottish Federation's most <b>important</b> {{initiative}} <b>was</b> the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service. Inglis <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> for {{the hospitals}} {{to have a}} neutral name {{in order to attract}} [...] "wide support from men and women".

2500|$|... "Firework" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Katy Perry {{from her}} third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). Perry co-wrote the song with Ester Dean and its {{producers}} StarGate and Sandy Vee. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a dance-pop self-empowerment anthem with inspirational lyrics, and Perry <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an <b>important</b> song for her on Teenage Dream. Capitol Records released it as the album's third single on October 26, 2010.|$|R

500|$|Araya {{described}} [...] "For this one, I {{just kind}} of got inspired by watching TV. That gave me {{a whole lot of}} ideas. The whole idea about the dude with Slayer in his arms was brought about because reality is scarier than anything you can make up." [...] The production of the album posed as a challenge to the record company, [...] "how to market a group whose gore-soaked, extreme music is anathema to radio programmers." [...] It is the company's first attempt to [...] "hit the thrash band's core-audience of rabid enthusiasts with a fan-orientated marketing assault." [...] Araya related: [...] "We decided to take more time to bring this one together. We actually went into the studio with more written material than the past. We completed three out of seven songs outside the studio. We all sort of <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to do it slowly.

Ticket prices were set at just DM 8 ( [...] , [...] ), {{because of the}} 50percent unemployment rate in the city. Bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo, but the city requested they hold the full PopMart show. Bono said, [...] "We offered to do a charity gig here, just turn up and do a scratch gig, but they wanted the whole fucking thing. They wanted the lemon!" [...] McGuinness added, [...] "we <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> that we treat this as another city on the tour, to pay them that respect. To come here and not do the whole show would have been rude."

500|$|The Pi Chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon ("Deke") {{was founded}} in 1853. [...] It was the fourth social {{fraternity}} at Dartmouth College. Eight brothers of Delta Kappa Epsilon were famously involved in a 1949 murder of a fellow Dartmouth student. [...] The men, after heavy drinking at three different fraternities, sought out {{a former member of}} the freshman football team. [...] Finding him asleep in his dormitory room, but wearing a letter sweater that the eight men felt he did not deserve to be wearing, they beat him and he soon thereafter died of the injuries. [...] Two Delta Kappa Epsilon brothers were brought to trial, fined, and given suspended sentences for the crime. [...] In response to the murder, College President John Sloan Dickey announced that he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to reduce the influence of the fraternity system on campus. [...] The organization was renamed Storrs House in 1970 before dissolving entirely.|$|E

Planners <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> for residents {{to live and work}} in the same satellite town so that Don Mills would not become a bedroom community. A sizable number of high residential densitiesâ€”rental townhouses and low-rise apartmentsâ€”was essential if the town were to attract a cross-section of residents working in local industries.|$|R
500|$|Amy {{is a happy}} {{character}} with a mischievous personality. As Amy grew up in foster care it shows in her persona. Though it is often {{hard for people to}} understand why she acts wayward, she also has the vulnerability factor. Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a [...] "hard exterior". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite [...] "out there" [...] in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's [...] "nice side" [...] and reminded them that she is good at [...] "lying and scheming". She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface.|$|E
500|$|British Airways was re-equipping {{several of}} its {{aircraft}} tug tractors, and the crew managed to purchase a 635 hp Hunslet ATT 77 tug to use as the armored personnel carrier. It initially weighed , and although the crew removed [...] of lead ballast, the power station floor had to be reinforced to support the weight. The crew used many [...] "junk" [...] items in the set designs, such as Ripley's toilet, which came from a Boeing707. Lockers, helicopter engines, and vending machines were used as set elements in the opening hypersleep scene. Production designer Peter Lamont was asked {{to reduce the cost}} of several scenes, including the not-yet-filmed space marine hypersleep sequence. Gale Hurd wanted to cut the scene altogether, but Lamont and Cameron <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to the sequence of the film. To save on cost, only four hypersleep chambers were created, and a mirror was used to create the illusion that there were twelve in the scene. Instead of using hydraulics, the chambers were opened and closed by wires operated by puppeteers.|$|E
500|$|The novel also {{deals with}} the issue of globalisation. Courteau {{observed}} that although Little Bee learns English from newspapers she acquires at the English detention centre, her reference points are still Nigerian, and thus through her narrative voice Cleave [...] "illustrates the forcible dislocations of a globalized world." [...] Cleave chose to explore the issue in The Other Hand as he believes that, although globalisation is frequently discussed, people rarely consider its meaning. He explained: [...] "money can move freely across national borders, but people can't. They're actively prevented from going where the money is. Capital is global, but labour isn't. I believe that's the cause of two major crises that we're involved in as a species â€“ one is a financial crisis and one is a refugee crisis. Imagine a world where money can't move, where capital is stuck in its country of origin, but people can freely move where the work is! That's an alternate interpretation of globalization that would solve a lot of problems." [...] Although Cleave did not intend for the novel to be heavily political, he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to raise the issue, given the refugee subject matter of The Other Hand.|$|E
