5|$|The {{island of}} Java {{is the most}} densely {{populated}} island on earth, and is vulnerable to both large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, due to its location near the Sunda Trench, a convergent plate boundary where the Australian tectonic plate is subducting beneath Indonesia. Three great earthquakes occurred {{in the span of}} three years to the northwest on the Sumatra portion of the trench. The 2004 M9.15 Sumatra–Andaman, the 2005 M8.7 Nias–Simeulue, and the 2007 M8.4 Mentawai earthquakes produced the largest release of <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> energy since the 1957/1964 series of shocks on the Aleutian/Alaska Trench.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Eric Snively and Anthony P. Russel {{published}} in 2003 {{also found that}} the tyrannosaurid arctometatarsals and elastic ligaments worked together in what he called a 'tensile keystone model' to strengthen the feet of Tyrannosaurus, increase the animal's stability and add greater resistance to dissociation over that of other theropod families; while still allowing resiliency that is otherwise reduced in ratites, horses, giraffids and other animals with metapodia to a single element. The study also pointed out that elastic ligaments in larger vertebrates could store and return relatively more <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> energy, which could have improved locomotor efficiency and decrease the strain energy transferred to the bones. The study suggested that this mechanism could have worked efficiently in tyrannosaurids as well. Hence, the study involved identifying the type of ligaments attached to the metatarsals, then how they functioned together and comparing it to those of other theropods and modern day analogs. The scientists found that arctometatarsals may have enabled tyrannosaurid feet to absorb forces such as linear deceleration, lateral acceleration and torsion more effectively than those of other theropods. It is also stated in their study that this may imply, though not demonstrate, that tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus had greater agility than other large theropods without an arctometatarsus.|$|E

Internal <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> evolve in a similar behaviour in the unreinforced AZ 31 and in both composites.

25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E
500|$|The jump is a three-stage process. First, the {{grasshopper}} fully flexes {{the lower}} part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specializations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed. [...] Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNeutron {{diffraction}} and synchrotron X-ray diffraction and imaging {{have been}} applied to study, in situ, the mechanical response to tensile and bending loading of polygranular Gilsocarbon nuclear grade near-isotropic graphite (grade IM 1 - 24). Digital image correlation of X-ray radiographs and digital volume correlation of tomographs allow measurement of bulk elastic moduli and examination of the heterogeneity of deformation in the microstructure. Both the neutron and X-ray studies show the application of tensile strain reduces the bulk elastic modulus. A permanent set is observed to develop with applied tensile <b>strain.</b> The <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> within the graphite crystals were measured by diffraction; a cross-correlation analysis method has been applied for greater speed, robustness and improved precision in the measurement {{of the change in}} basal plane separation distance. In compression, a linear relation is observed between the <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> in the graphite crystals and the applied strain. In tension, this relationship is non-linear.

40|$|Autofrettage is a {{treatment}} process that uses plastic deformation {{to create a}} state of permanent residual stress within thick-walled tubes by pressurizing them beyond the elastic limit. The present paper presents explicit analytical formulas for residual <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> within the tube wall derived {{on the basis of}} the classical elastic-ideally plastic solution. Then the problem is addressed of rational interpretation of the radial and hoop residual <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> measured at a fixed number of points. To this end, the mismatch between the experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of the residual <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> is represented in the form of quadratic functional, J, the minimum of which is sought in terms of the problem parameters, namely, the material yield stress, σ γ, and the radial position of the elastic-plastic boundary, c. It is shown that J shows an approximately parabolic variation in terms of either parameter when the other is fixed, and that therefore the global minimum of J can be readily found. This procedure is implemented and applied to a set of experimental data on neutron diffraction measurements (Venter, A. M., de Swardt, R. R., and Kyriacou, S., 2000, J. Strain Anal., 35, pp. 459 - 469). In conclusion, further applications of this family of interpretation approaches are discussed. Citation: Korsunsky, A. M. (2007).

A distinct elastic anomaly was observed at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields when crossing the phase boundary. A pronounced elastic softening {{as a function of}} magnetic field ($H$) appears across the boundary of the low-temperature magnetic phase below around 40 K, accompanied by a distinct hysteresis. In the high field region, however, these elastic constants exhibit an increase with increasing a magnetic field in the high-field region. The high-field magnetization measurement characterizing the magnetic state clarified a strong connection between <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> {{and magnetic}} moments. The new metamagnetic transition was found in the high-field region above 40 K, accompanied with no hysteresis.
