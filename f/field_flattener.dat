50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>flattener</b> lenses {{counteract}} the Petzval field curvature of an optical system. In other words, {{the function of}} a <b>field</b> <b>flattener</b> lens is to counter the field-angle dependence of the focal length of a system.|$|E

50|$|Esprit 80ED, 100ED, 120ED and 150ED Super APO {{refractors}} have a doublet <b>field</b> <b>flattener</b> {{to get a}} flat {{field and}} minimize aberration and distortion. Their wide 48mm opener ensures a larger and clearer aperture and also extremely minimized halation. Connect the triplet and doublet <b>field</b> <b>flattener</b> with a high precision thin thread to keep the optical axis perpendicular to the image.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the amateur}} {{astronomy}} field {{there are many}} types of commercial and amateur built telescopes designed for astrophotography labeled [...] "astrographs". Optical designs of amateur astrographs vary widely but include apochromatic refractors, variations of Cassegrain reflectors including Ritchey-Chretien and Dall-Kirkham designs, or Newtonian reflectors. Most optical designs do not produce large, flat, and well-corrected imaging fields and therefore require some type of optical correction by way of <b>field</b> <b>flatteners</b> or coma correctors. Amateur astrographs typically have purpose-built focusers, are constructed of thermally stable materials like carbon fiber and are paired with heavy duty mounts to facilitate accurate tracking of deep sky objects {{for long periods of}} time.|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{feasibility}} of the KISSpectrograph. The present technical design fulfills the requirements in respect to optical and mechanical performance. The combination of new materials with already space proven techniques {{has led to a}} design which is compatible to the Coordinated Instrument Package and fulfills the optical requirements for KISS. Based on the original design the optical performance of KISS has been improved by the use of - <b>field</b> <b>flatteners</b> in the telescope and; - a toroid field lens to improve image quality; - distributed feedback laser diodes for in flight-calibration and alignment; -carbon fibre materials for thermal stability; - high precision spindles and guidances; - flexural pivots with minimum wear out; - a structural housing to minimize distortion of the optics. Requiring of up to 5. 10 " 7 cycles life time (shutter) special attention has to be paid to AIV and product assurance, which are also part of this study.

50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>flattener</b> lens {{is a type}} of lens used {{in modern}} {{binocular}} designs (e.g. Canon 10 x 42 L IS WP, 18 x 50 IS All Weather and Swarovski EL 8.5 x 42, EL 10 x 42) and in astronomic telescopes.|$|E
50|$|The rover {{had three}} cameras: two {{monochrome}} cameras in front, and a color {{camera in the}} rear. Each front camera had an array 484 pixels high by 768 wide. The optics consisted of a window, lens, and <b>field</b> <b>flattener.</b> The window was made of sapphire, while the lens objective and flattener were made of zinc selenide. The rover was imaged on Mars by the base station's IMP camera system, which also helped determine where the rover should go.|$|E
50|$|The American {{astronomer}} and lens designer James Gilbert Baker {{first proposed}} a Cassegrain design for Bernhard Schmidt's Schmidt camera in 1940. The optical shop at Mount Wilson Observatory manufactured {{the first one}} during World War II {{as part of their}} research into optical designs for the military. As in the Schmidt camera, this design uses a spherical primary mirror and a Schmidt corrector plate to correct for spherical aberration. In this Cassegrain configuration the convex secondary mirror acts as a <b>field</b> <b>flattener</b> and relays the image through the perforated primary mirror to a final focal plane located behind the primary. Some designs include additional optical elements (such as field flatteners) near the focal plane. The first large telescope to use the design was the James Gregory Telescope of 1962 at the University of St Andrews.|$|E
50|$|Schmidt cameras {{have very}} {{strongly}} curved focal planes, thus requiring that the film, plate, or other detector be correspondingly curved. In {{some cases the}} detector is made curved; in others flat media is mechanically conformed {{to the shape of}} the focal plane through the use of retaining clips or bolts, or by the application of a vacuum. A <b>field</b> <b>flattener,</b> in its simplest form a planoconvex lens in front of the film plate or detector, is sometimes used. Since the corrector plate {{is at the center of}} curvature of the primary mirror in this design the tube length can be very long for a wide-field telescope. There are also the drawbacks of having the obstruction of the film holder or detector mounted at the focus halfway up the tube assembly, a small amount of light is blocked and there is a loss in contrast in the image due to diffraction effects of the obstruction and its support structure.|$|E

40|$|The MODS optical {{spectrograph}} uses a de-centered Maksutov-Schmidt {{camera with}} a clear aperture of ~ 300 mm. This large camera has two widely spaced elements, the corrector and the camera mirror, and a <b>field</b> <b>flattener</b> near the focal plane. This paper describes the truss system that supports the optical elements very rigidly, uses adjustable length links to provide a deterministic method for alignment of the optical elements, and uses material combinations which result in a camera with nearly zero focus shift due to changes in temperature. A novel joint design for terminating the truss links is described that has excellent stiffness and enhances ease of assembly and alignment. The MODS optical spectrograph is currently under construction for use on the LBT telescope. The spectrograph uses a Maksutov-Schmidt camera design which {{has the advantage of}} having only three optical elements, the corrector lens, the mirror, and the <b>field</b> <b>flattener.</b> The camera is a de-centered design with the entrance aperture offset from the optical axis of the camera by 220 mm.

40|$|We {{present the}} design of an all-reflective, bi-folded Schmidt {{telescope}} aimed at surveys of extended astronomical objects with extremely-low surface brightness. The design leads to a high image quality without any diffracting spider, along with a large aperture and field of view, with a small central obstruction which barely alters the PSF. As an example, we present {{the design of}} a high-quality, 36 cm diameter, fast (f / 2. 5) telescope working in the visible with a large field of view (1. 6 x 2. 6). The telescope can operate with a curved detector (or with a flat detector with a <b>field</b> <b>flattener)</b> and a set of filters. The entrance mirror is anamorphic and replaces the classical Schmidt entrance corrector plate. We show that this anamorphic primary mirror can be manufactured through stress polishing, avoiding high spatial frequency errors, and tested with a simple interferometer scheme. This prototype is intended to serve as a fast-track scientific and technological pathfinder for the future space-based MESSIER mission. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, 2 table...|$|E

40|$|Field correctors for a one-meter, f/ 15 cassegrainian {{telescope}} {{were designed}} {{as part of}} a NASA-funded study of an astronomical obervatory on board of the Space Shuttle. By means of a Gasgoigne corrector and a biconcave <b>field</b> <b>flattener,</b> astigmatism and field curvature are corrected in a 0. 6 deg field. Applicable wavelength ranges are limited by chromatic aberrations. The upper wavelength is selected to match a photocathode response limit. The lower wavelength limit is defined by a filter. Examples of usable wavelength ranges are: 210 nm - 1100 nm (multialkali photocathode, fused-silica corrector elements), 177 nm - 320 nm (cesium telluride photocathode, calcium fluoride correctors); and possibly 134 nm - 190 nm (cesium iodide photocathode, lithium fluoride correctors). Residual rms lateral color is smaller than 0. 02 arc sec, and axial color is smaller than 0. 25 arc sec (blur diameter at the ends of the wavelength range). The correctors introduce a small amount of coma. This is compensated by adjustment of the conic constants of the telescope mirrors...|$|E
40|$|The Palomar Transient Factory is an {{automated}} wide-field survey facility dedicated to identifying {{a wide range}} of transient phenomena. Typically, a new 7. 5 square degree field will be acquired every 90 seconds with 66 % observing efficiency, in g ' band when the sky is dark, or in R band when the moon is up. An imaging camera with a 12 Kx 8 K mosaic of MIT/LL CCDs, acquired from CFHT, is being repackaged to fit in the prime focus mounting hub of the Palomar 48 -inch Oschin Schmidt Telescope. We discuss how we have addressed the broad range of issues presented by this application: faster CCD readout to improve observing efficiency, a new cooling system to fit within the constrained space, a low impact shutter to maintain reliability at the fast observing cadence, a new filter exchange mechanism, and the <b>field</b> <b>flattener</b> needed to correct for focal plane curvature. The most critical issue was the tight focal plane alignment and co-planarity requirements created by the fast beam and coarse plate scale. We built an optical profilometer system to measure CCDs heights and tilts with 1 !m RMS accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a {{near-infrared}} wide-band high-resolution spectrograph jointly {{developed by}} the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute and the University of Texas at Austin. IGRINS employs three HAWAII- 2 RG Focal Plane Array (H 2 RG FPA) detectors. We present the design and fabrication of the detector mount for the H 2 RG detector. The detector mount consists of a detector housing, an ASIC housing, a <b>Field</b> <b>Flattener</b> Lens (FFL) mount, and a support base frame. The detector and the ASIC housing should be kept at 65 K and the support base frame at 130 K. Therefore they are thermally isolated by the support made of GFRP material. The detector mount is designed so that it has features of fine adjusting {{the position of the}} detector surface in the optical axis and of fine adjusting yaw and pitch angles in order to utilize as an optical system alignment compensator. We optimized the structural stability and thermal characteristics of the mount design using computer-aided 3 D modeling and finite element analysis. Based on the structural and thermal analysis, the designed detector mount meets an optical stability tolerance and system thermal requirements. Actual detector mount fabricated based on the design has been installed into the IGRINS cryostat and successfully passed a vacuum test and a cold test...|$|E
40|$|A 16 K x 16 K, 1 degree x 1 degree field, {{detector}} {{system was}} developed by ESO for the OmegaCAM instrument for use on the purpose built ESO VLT Survey Telescope (VST). The focal plane consists of an 8 x 4 mosaic of 2 K x 4 K 15 um pixel e 2 v CCDs and four 2 K x 4 K CCDs on the periphery for the opto-mechanical control of the telescope. The VST is a single instrument telescope. This placed stringent reliability requirements on the OmegaCAM detector system such as 10 years lifetime and maximum downtime of 1. 5 %. Mounting at Cassegrain focus required a highly autonomous self-contained cooling system that could deliver 65 W of cooling power. Interface space for the detector head was severely limited {{by the way the}} instrument encloses the CCD cryostat. The detector system features several novel ideas tailored to meet these requirements and described in this paper: Key design drivers of the detector head were the easily separable but precisely aligned connections to the optical <b>field</b> <b>flattener</b> on the top and the cooling system at the bottom. Material selection, surface treatment, specialized coatings and in-situ plasma cleaning were crucial to prevent contamination of the detectors. Inside the cryostat, cryogenic and electrical connections were disentangled to keep the configuration modular, integration friendly and the detectors in a safe condition during all mounting steps. A compact unit for logging up to 125 Pt 100 temperature sensors and associated thermal control loops was developed (ESO's new housekeeping unit PULPO 2), together with several new modular Pt 100 packaging and mounting concepts. The electrical grouping of CCDs based on process parameters and test results is explained. Three ESO standardized FIERA CCD controllers in different configurations are used. Their synchronization mechanism for read-out is discussed in connection with the CCD grouping scheme, the shutter, and the integrated guiding and image analysis facility with four independent 2 K x 4 K CCDs. An illustration of the data chain performance from CCD output to storage on hard-disk gives an impression of the challenge to shift 512 MB of data within 45 seconds via the standardized hierarchical ESO data acquisition network. Finally the safety and emergency features of the overall system are presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents several synchrotron-based biomedical X-ray imaging projects involving bent Laue silicon (Si) crystals. Log-spiral bent Laue analyzers (BLA) {{were made}} from 20 micron thick Si crystals to map manganese (Mn) fluorescence in the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging {{of the human brain}} with Parkinson's disease (PD). The BLA improved Mn specificity in XRF imaging and achieved a Mn detection limit of 0. 5 mM concentration and an energy resolution of 34. 5 eV. A novel method of three dimensional (3 D) confocal XRF imaging of iodine was designed based on the one dimensional (1 D) focusing ability of a log-spiral BLA made from 175 micron thick Si crystals. Combined with a pencil beam or a two dimensional (2 D) focused beam, a 3 D voxel of 100 × 100 × 124 cubic micron could be used to probe the 3 D elemental mapping of a sample. A cylindrical bent Laue monochromator (BLM) was made from 600 micron thick Si crystals to simultaneously prepare three beams for the three-energy K-Edge Subtraction (KES) imaging and KES Computed Tomography (CT). A novel three-beam chopper was made as the first beam chopper for fast switching among the three beams. The three-energy KES imaging was successfully used to track uptake of injected iodine with time in a live mouse. The first simultaneous dual-energy KES imaging and the first KES CT imaging were successfully performed in Canada at the Biomedical Imaging and Therapy (BMIT) beamline. A novel rat head restraint and its corresponding field flatteners were constructed using a rapid-prototyping machine for the KES project based on CT scan data of a rat. This type of animal restraint worked well to immobilize the animal and holds great promise in improving the image quality and repeatability while reducing stress on experimental animals. The <b>field</b> <b>flattener</b> improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the image at a cost of raised maximum exposure to some regions of the subject and reduced anatomical information in the images. In animal imaging applications, this method holds great promise to visualize low concentrations of contrast agents. Another cylindrical BLM was made to perform the novel Near Edge Spectral Imaging (NESI) and NESI CT. It showed high sensitivity for iodine with a measured detection limit of 2 microgram/centimetre square and a slightly better SNR performance than conventional KES imaging. The overwhelming impact of NESI is that it will bring together contrast imaging and elemental speciation imaging through X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) analysis which have been totally different realms...|$|E
