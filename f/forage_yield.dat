The self-supplied <b>forage</b> milk <b>yields</b> of eight dairy farmers in Hokkaido were calculated and used to categorize the farmers into three groups according to type of management: (i) dairy management which achieved high self-supplied <b>forage</b> milk <b>yield</b> through efficient use of self-supplied forage; (ii) dairy management which produced average self-supplied <b>forage</b> milk <b>yield</b> but high milk yield per delivered cow(i. e. a cow that has calved at least once) through use of purchased feed concentrates in addition to self-supplied forage; and (iii) dairy management which only produced low milk <b>yield</b> from self-supplied <b>forage.</b> Land is the most fundamental farming resource. In light of this, it is necessary to maximize the use of farmland by shifting to farm management based on self-supplied forage, which is resilient to changes in the external environment and therefore stable. To make this shift possible, efficient land use will be a priority management goal, of which self-supplied <b>forage</b> milk <b>yield</b> is a useful indicator.

40|$|The {{main task}} of {{breeding}} red clover, {{the second most}} important perennial forage legume, is to develop cultivars giving high <b>forage</b> <b>yields</b> of excellent quality. Goals set before red clover cultivar development are achieved by different breeding methods. Previous research has shown that the most important methods used in red clover breeding are mass selection, individual selection, recurrent phenotypic selection, the polycross method, hybridization, and polyploidy. Mass selection {{is one of the oldest}} methods and has proven highly effective in improving highly heritable traits. Individual selection and hybridization have been shown to be highly effective in increasing protein content. Recurrent phenotypic selection is very effective when breeding for resistance to some diseases and pests as well as when developing genotypes tolerant of the 2, 4 -D preparation. The main idea behind the polycross method is selection of clones with a good GCA to be used for developing improved synthetic cultivars.

40|$|Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> may {{be reduced}} by {{moderate}} levels of salinity. Increasing <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> in saline environments through plant breeding could ameliorate this problem. Selection for increased salt tolerance in alfalfa in cell culture, at germination, or during seedling growth with high NaCl levels has not resulted in agronomically relevant levels of salt tolerance. Different selection schemes were examined to identify alfalfa plants {{with the ability to}} germinate, establish, and regrow at salinity levels common in agricultural areas. Data from 'Sonora' and its parental ecotype African grown in a greenhouse and irrigated with 0, 30, 60, or 80 mM NaCl were used to simulate selection for increased <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> in each NaCl environment through five harvests. Predicted gains in <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> were highest in non-saline conditions and gains decreased as the NaCl level increased in the selection environment. Selection based on plant yield from regrowth harvests was predicted to be more efficient than that based on seedling harvest. Genetic and phenotypic relationships between plant performance at seed germination, seedling development, and post-harvest regrowth at 0 or 80 mM NaCl were also determined. The effect of NaCl on <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> of alfalfa regenerated from non-saline callus cultures was examined. This research showed that selection for increased <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> can be made at moderate NaCl levels in germplasm with ample variation for yield when grown in saline environments. Selection for increased <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> in non-saline conditions may eliminate potentially salt tolerant plants from a population. Selection for increased alfalfa <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> in saline environments at early stages of development is not necessarily optimum. Selection methods that include each critical growth stage may be required to develop alfalfa cultivars with increased <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> in saline environments.

In order to evaluate of morphphysiological characteristics and selection of superior accessions in tall fescue on 36 accessions a lattice square design with three replications was carried out in agricultural and natural resources research centre of Zanjan province. Result analysis of variance showed that different types of tall fescue had significant differences in wet and dry <b>forage</b> <b>yield,</b> heading and flowering dates, panicle length, 1000 -grain weight and seed maturity. Accessions of 6000 - 71 (Borujen-Iran origin) and 1061 (Belgium origin) had the most wet matter. In contrast 6000 - 70 (Borujen-Iran origin) was the lowest value. Moreover, 078 (California origin) had the highest and 6000 - 71 (Borujen-Iran origin), VIII (Russia origin), Sabalan (Ardabil origin) had the lowest total dry matter. Phonotypical correlation coefficient showed significant positive correlation between flowering date with heading date, date of seed maturity (r= 0. 618 **), (r= 0. 456 *), respectively, and between wet and dry <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> (r= 0. 437 *).

Meadow, steppe and tussock occupy 93. 3 % (125. 14 Tg C), and desert and swamp only accounts for 6. 7 % (8. 95 Tg C) of total <b>forage</b> <b>yield</b> carbon. <b>Forage</b> <b>yield</b> carbon is stored largely in temperate (38. 4 %, 51. 54 Tg C) and alpine regions (30. 4 %, 40. 78 Tg C), and to less extent in tropical regions (22. 1 %, 29. 66 Tg C).

40|$|Wheat serves {{three very}} {{important}} roles to producers in Texas and many {{states in the}} Great Plains. First, wheat {{is used as a}} cool season forage crop for livestock grazing. Second, wheat serves as a grain only crop. Third, wheat is used as both a forage and grain crop in the same season and is commonly referred to as a dual-use or dual-purpose crop. Previous research has demonstrated that planting date can significantly affect the success of these various production strategies. When wheat is planted early, more forage will be available for livestock; conversely, a delayed planting date should achieve a higher grain yield. The objective of this research was to determine the optimum seeding rate as planting date changes for wheat as a grain-only and dual-purpose crop in central Texas.
