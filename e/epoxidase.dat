50|$|EETS are epoxide eicosatrienoic acid {{metabolites}} of {{arachidonic acid}} (a straight chain Eicosatetraenoic acid, omega-6 fatty acid). Arachidonic acid has 4 cis double bonds (see Cis-trans isomerism which are abbreviated with the notation Z in the IUPAC Chemical nomenclature used here. These double bonds are located between carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15; arachidonic acid is therefore 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases attack these double bonds {{to form their}} respective eicosatrienoic acid epoxide regioisomers (see Structural isomer, section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)) viz., 5,6-EET (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid), 8,9-EET (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid), 11,12-EET (i.e. 11,12-epoxy-5Z,8Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid), or, as drawn in the attached figure, 14,15-EET (i.e. 14,15-epoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z-eicosatrienoic acid). The enzymes generally form both R/S enantiomers at each former double bond position; for example, cytochrome P450 <b>epoxidases</b> metabolize arachidonic acid to a mixture of 14R,15S-EET and 14S,15R-EET.|$|R
50|$|The EDPs are {{commonly}} {{made by the}} stimulation of specific cell types by the same mechanisms which produce EETs (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid). That is, cell stimulation causes DHA {{to be released from}} the sn-2 position of their membrane-bound cellular phospholipid pools through the action of a Phospholipase A2-type enzyme and the subsequent attack of the released DHA by CYP450 <b>epoxidases.</b> It is notable that the consumption of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets dramatically raises the serum and tissue levels of EDPs and EEQs in animals as well as humans. Indeed, this rise in EDP (and EEQ) levels in humans {{is by far the most}} prominent change in the profile of PUFA metabolites caused by dietary omega-3 fatty acids and, it is suggested, may be responsible for at least some of the beneficial effects ascribed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids.|$|R
5000|$|EDPs are epoxide {{eicosapentaenoic acid}} {{metabolites}} of DHA. DHA has 6 cis (see Cis-trans isomerism) Double bonds {{each one of}} which is located between carbons 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14, 16-17, or 19-20. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases attack any one of these double bounds to form a respective docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) epoxide regioisomer (see Structural isomer, section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)). A given epoxygenase may therefore convert DHA to 4,5-EDP (i.e. 4,5-epoxy-7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-DPA), 7,8-EDP (i.e. 7,8-epoxy-4Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-DPA), 10,11-EDP (i.e. 10,11-epoxy-4Z,7Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-DPA), 13,14-EDP (i.e. 13,14-epoxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,16Z,19Z-DPA), 16,17-EDP (i.e. 16,17-epoxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,19Z-DPA, or 19,20-EDP (i.e. 19,20-epoxy-4Z, 7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-DPA. The epoxygenase enzymes generally form both R/S enantiomers at each former double bound position; for example, cytochrome P450 <b>epoxidases</b> attack DHA at the 16,17-double bond position to form two epoxide enantiomers, 16R,17S-EDP and 16S,1517-EDP. [...] The 4,5-EDP metabolite is unstable and generally not detected among the EDP formed by cells.|$|R

In this alga, squalene is also converted into membrane sterols after 2, 3 -epoxidation. In the present study, cDNA clones of two distinct squalene <b>epoxidases</b> (BbSQE-I and -II) were isolated. Predicted amino acid sequences encoded on these genes are 45 % identical with each other. Introduction of BbSQE-I or -II into Saccharomyces cerevisie erg 1 mutants resulted in the complementation of ergosterol auxotrophy. The relative expression level of SQE-II increased 3. 5 -fold from the early stage to the middle phase of a culture period of 42 days, while that of SQE-I was almost constant throughout the culture period. Southern blot analyses suggested that these genes are single-copied genes. This is the first report on the isolation of functional SQEs that are encoded in duplicated loci in the algal genome...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} number of annotated bacterial genomes provides a vast resource for genome mining. Several bacterial natural products with epoxide groups {{have been identified as}} pre-mRNA spliceosome inhibitors and antitumor compounds through genome mining. These epoxide-containing natural products feature a common biosynthetic characteristic that cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) and its patterns such as <b>epoxidases</b> are employed in the tailoring reactions. The tailoring enzyme patterns are essential to both biological activities and structural diversity of natural products, and can be used for enzyme pattern-based genome mining. Recent development of direct cloning, heterologous expression, manipulation of the biosynthetic pathways and the CRISPR-CAS 9 system have provided molecular biology tools to turn on or pull out nascent biosynthetic gene clusters to generate a microbial natural product library. This review focuses on a library of epoxide-containing natural products and their associated CYPs, with the intention to provide strategies on diversifying the structures of CYP-catalyzed bioactive natural products. It is conceivable that a library of diversified bioactive natural products will be created by pattern-based genome mining, direct cloning and heterologous expression as well as the genomic manipulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPseudomonas oleovorans alkane ω-hydroxylase (AlkB) is an {{integral}} membrane diiron enzyme that shares a requirement for iron and oxygen for activity {{in a manner similar}} to that of the non-heme integral membrane desaturases, <b>epoxidases,</b> acetylenases, conjugases, ketolases, decarbonylase and methyl oxidases. No overall sequence similarity is detected between AlkB and these desaturase-like enzymes by computer algorithms; however, they do contain a series of histidine residues in a similar relative positioning with respect to hydrophobic regions thought to be transmembrane domains. To test whether these conserved histidine residues are functionally equivalent to those of the desaturase-like enzymes we used scanning alanine mutagenesis to test if they are essential for activity of AlkB. These experiments show that alanine substitution of any of the eight conserved histidines results in complete inactivation, whereas replacement of three non-conserved histidines in close proximity to the conserved residues, results in only partial inactivation. These data provide the first experimental support for the hypotheses: (i) that the histidine motif in AlkB is equivalent to that in the desaturase-like enzymes and (ii) that the conserved histidine residues play a vital role such as coordinating the Fe ions comprising the diiron active site...|$|R

40|$|Lipocalins are a {{group of}} {{proteins}} that have been characterized in bacteria, invertebrate, and vertebrate animals. However, very {{little is known about}} plant lipocalins. We have previously reported the cloning of the first true plant lipocalins. Here we report the identification and characterization of plant lipocalins and lipocalin-like proteins using an integrated approach of data mining, expression studies, cellular localization, and phylogenetic analyses. Plant lipocalins can be classified into two groups, temperature-induced lipocalins (TILs) and chloroplastic lipocalins (CHLs). In addition, violaxanthin de-epoxidases (VDEs) and zeaxanthin <b>epoxidases</b> (ZEPs) can be classified as lipocalin-like proteins. CHLs, VDEs, and ZEPs possess transit peptides that target them to the chloroplast. On the other hand, TILs do not show any targeting peptide, but localization studies revealed that the proteins are found at the plasma membrane. Expression analyses by quantitative real-time PCR showed that expression of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) lipocalins and lipocalin-like proteins is associated with abiotic stress response and is correlated with the plant's capacity to develop freezing tolerance. In support of this correlation, data mining revealed that lipocalins are present in the desiccation-tolerant red algae Porphyra yezoensis and the cryotolerant marine yeast Debaryomyces hansenii, suggesting a possible association with stress-tolerant organisms. Considering the plant lipocalin properties, tissue specificity, response to temperature stress, and their association with chloroplasts and plasma membranes of green leaves, we hypothesize a protective function of the photosynthetic system against temperature stress. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that TIL lipocalin members in higher plants were probably inherited from a bacterial gene present in a primitive unicellular eukaryote. On the other hand, CHLs, VDEs, and ZEPs may have evolved from a cyanobacterial ancestral gene after the formation of the cyanobacterial endosymbiont from which the chloroplast originated...|$|R

50|$|The {{xanthophyll}} cycle {{involves the}} enzymatic removal of epoxy groups from xanthophylls (e.g. violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, diadinoxanthin) to create so-called de-epoxidised xanthophylls (e.g. diatoxanthin, zeaxanthin). These enzymatic cycles {{were found to}} {{play a key role}} in stimulating energy dissipation within light-harvesting antenna proteins by non-photochemical quenching- a mechanism to reduce the amount of energy that reaches the photosynthetic reaction centers. Non-photochemical quenching is one of the main ways of protecting against photoinhibition. In higher plants, there are three carotenoid pigments that are active in the xanthophyll cycle: violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin. During light stress, violaxanthin is converted to zeaxanthin via the intermediate antheraxanthin, which plays a direct photoprotective role acting as a lipid-protective anti-oxidant and by stimulating non-photochemical quenching within light-harvesting proteins. This conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin is done by the enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase, while the reverse reaction is performed by zeaxanthin <b>epoxidase.</b>|$|E
