Using data for German manufacturing industries, the result is that, while controlling for other agglomeration forces, higher industrial concentration, measured by the Herfindahl <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> of sales, implies stronger spatial agglomeration, as measured by Ellison and Glaeser's (1997) <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration...</b>|$|E

We seek to define local <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentrations,</b> comparing the wealth of a region to its neighbours, where the spatial weights defining neighbourhood are formally equivalent to the components of a reversible Markov transition matrix. Second-order local concentrations are shown to generalize Moran or Geary autocorrelation indices, while first-order local concentrations can be constructed so as to not exceed their ordinary or global counterpart. Behaviour under aggregation and the Pigou-Dalton principle are further discussed within the proposed formalism, which is exemplified on wealth distribution among the Swiss cantons under the neighbourhood structure induced by inter-regional migrations.

The European Commission, in order to evaluate the impact, role and function of the CAP, has set up an annual survey on a sample of European farms belonging to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN).

These are compared for their relative advantages {{in a variety}} of analytical contexts. The concepts and tools used in de-veloping these eextensions are then employed in the derivation of indexes for pair-wise relative inequality between owners. Finally, the problem of the relationship between inequality and concentration is approached through the development of a concentration index which measures the degree of concentration relative to the level of inequality in the resource system. These various indexes are then put through their paces in an empirical example. n a recent article, Taagepera and Ray (1977) defined a generalized n‘h power <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> which pos-sesses a number of attractive properties.

40|$|There {{are in the}} {{literature}} on both industrial and regional economics many studies on local productive arrangements. Indeed, this kind of industrial/regional organization has become an important piece in the implementation of industrial, regional and technological policies. Accordingly, a significant part of empirical studies on this subject has been concentrated on the analysis of existing productive arrangements. In contrast, there are few studies that try (or are able to) identify the startup of these arrangements. Indeed, this fact raises huge difficulties for the understanding of both the nature and the pattern of development of these arrangements. From the perspective of the elaboration of development policies, this gap is relevant as it leads to favouring established arrangements in detriment of those that are in the early stages. Taking this into account, it is necessary to develop methodologies that are able to overcome this deficiency. This is the aim of this paper. The authors propose a methodology for the identification of potential local productive arrangements based on secondary data. Through the use of Principal Component Analysis, an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>Concentration</b> is elaborated, which is an indication of the potential of an industrial sector, in a specific region, to become a local productive arrangement.

We contribute to this literature by testing hypotheses {{about the relationship between}} neighbourhood-level concentrated affluence/disadvantage and child-level developmental outcomes in a study population of 37, 798 Kindergarten children residing in 433 neighbourhoods throughout the province of British Columbia, Canada. We utilise a previously-validated measure of neighbourhood socioeconomic composition [...] the <b>Index</b> <b>of</b> <b>Concentration</b> at the Extremes (ICE) [...] which not only allows for more precise estimation of the competing influences of concentrated affluence and disadvantage, but also facilitates examination of the potential impact of neighbourhood-level income inequality. Our findings show that increases in neighbourhood affluence are associated with increases in children's scores on the Early Development Instrument (EDI), a holistic measure of Kindergarteners' readiness for school. Particularly noteworthy is that, for four of the five EDI scales (physical, social, emotional, and communication) and the total score, results indicate a significant curvilinear relationship - whereby the highest average child-level outcomes are not found in locations with the highest concentrations of affluence, but rather in locations with relatively equal proportions of affluent and disadvantaged families. This finding suggests, first, that concentrated affluence may have diminishing rates of return on contributing to enhanced child development, and, second, that children residing in mixed-income neighbourhoods may benefit both from the presence of affluent residents and from the presence of services and institutions aimed at assisting lower-income residents. Implications and future directions are discussed.
