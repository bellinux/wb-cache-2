40|$|This study {{concerns}} a qualitative {{investigation of the}} views toward higher education and its importance to hospitality career success among hotel professionals in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. Existing literature supported the premise that education may be important to professional career success in several different ways, and that values concerning education may be passed {{from one person to}} another via social learning. However, the relevant theories had not previously been evaluated {{within the context of the}} hospitality industry. Professionals in reporting relationships at two Las Vegas hotels were interviewed to determine perceptions about higher education, the sources of those perceptions, and whether or not there are any similarities in views between individuals in a reporting relationship. Thematic analysis was utilized to <b>identify</b> <b>prevalent</b> <b>patterns,</b> and the data revealed support for the proposition that values may in fact be passed from leaders to followers through social interactions. Other conclusions included popularly perceived characteristics and limitations of the utility of higher education for hospitality professionals...|$|E
40|$|Although metal {{transfer}} (MTR) {{has been observed}} in total hip replacement, {{little is known about}} its effects on the wear phenomena of bearing surface materials. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of MTR on the bearing surface of, zirconia and Biolox® Delta ceramic femoral heads, to <b>identify</b> <b>prevalent</b> surface <b>patterns</b> and morphologies as well as to evaluate possible phase changes upon MTR, assessing the monoclinic zirconia content and quantifying the tetragonal → monoclinic zirconia transformation. Selected Biolox® Delta and zirconia femoral heads retrieved from patients after different implantation periods were analysed using a contact profilometer and micro-Raman spectroscopy. The roughness data showed that MTR significantly changed the contact surface of the coupling in the same manner for zirconia and Biolox® Delta. The micro-Raman analyses showed that in the border control areas the Biolox® Delta retrievals were characterised by significantly higher monoclinic content values than the ziconia retrievals. Upon wear, zirconia femoral heads underwent a higher increase in the monoclinic content than Biolox® Delta. The stress related to MTR appeared a particularly severe condition able to induce the phase transformation. In zirconia retrievals, the tetragonal→monoclinic transformation involved a thinner depth of material than for Biolox® Delta...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To <b>identify</b> {{the most}} <b>prevalent</b> <b>patterns</b> of {{technical}} errors in surgery, and evaluate commonly recommended interven-tions {{in light of}} these patterns. Summary Background Data: The majority of surgical adverse events involve technical errors, but {{little is known about the}} nature and causes of these events. We examined characteristics of technical errors and common contributing factors among closed surgical malpractice claims. Methods: Surgeon reviewers analyzed 444 randomly sampled sur-gical malpractice claims from four liability insurers. Among 258 claims in which injuries due to error were detected, 52 % (n 133) involved technical errors. These technical errors were further ana-lyzed with a structured review instrument designed by qualitative content analysis. Results: Forty-nine percent of the technical errors caused permanent disability; an additional 16 % resulted in death. Two-thirds (65 %) of the technical errors were linked to manual error, 9 % to errors in judgment, and 26 % to both manual and judgment error. A minority of technical errors involved advanced procedures requiring special training (“index operations”; 16 %), surgeons inexperienced with the task (14 %), or poorly supervised residents (9 %). The majority involved experienced surgeons (73 %), and occurred in routine, rather than index, operations (84 %). Patient-related complexities— including emergencies, difficult or unexpected anatomy, and previ-ous surgery—contributed to 61 % of technical errors, and technol-ogy or systems failures contributed to 21 %. Conclusions: Most technical errors occur in routine operations with experienced surgeons, under conditions of increased patient com-plexity or systems failure. Commonly recommended interventions, including restricting high-complexity operations to experienced sur-geons, additional training for inexperienced surgeons, and stricter supervision of trainees, are likely to address only a minority of technical errors. Surgical safety research should instead focus on improving decision-making and performance in routine operations for complex patients and circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Background: Substance use in {{patients}} with psychiatric disorder is an every-day seen. Detection of this comorbidity can significantly affect the treatment of these disorders, as well as substance use. Objectives: This study has been conducted to determine the prevalence and pattern of substance use in hospitalized psychiatric patients. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 210 hospitalized psychiatric patients were selected by simple randomization from all records of hospitalized patients. The instrument of gathering data was a demographic checklist including age, gender, marital status, education, type of disorder and substance abuse and duration of psychiatric disorder. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 16 using Fisher exact and Chi square tests. Results: The mean age of patients was 37. 9 years. Most of the patients were male, married and unemployed. The Prevalence of substance use was 36. 7. The most <b>prevalent</b> <b>pattern</b> of substance use was opium, opioid, methamphetamines and other substances (poly substance). The prevalence of substance use {{in patients}} with mood disorders {{was more than the}} other disorders and the most prevalent substance use in these patients was opium and opioid. Poly substance use was the most <b>prevalent</b> <b>pattern</b> of use (80) in psychotic and mood disorders due to substance. Significant difference was seen between genders, marital status, occupation, duration of illness and frequency of substance use (P < 0. 05), however no significant difference was seen between educational levels, age and substance use. Conclusions: The patients with mood disorders had the highest comorbidity with substance use and concurrent use of poly substance was the most <b>prevalent</b> <b>pattern</b> of use in these patients. Therefore, successful treatment of psychiatric disorders and substance use needs multimodal and more serious interventions. Regarding to the pattern of poly substance use in these patients, careful screening should be performed at admission. Â© 2014, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal...|$|R

We used the National Disease Surveillance Systems (NDSS) to <b>identify</b> <b>prevalent</b> and incident HIV diagnoses among adults with EHI and to determine the associated factors. The NDSS collect demographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics of case patients through physician reports and public health interviews. EHI was confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction assays, histopathology, or serology with documented liver abscess. We linked NDSS databases to <b>identify</b> <b>prevalent</b> and incident HIV diagnoses among noninstitutionalized Taiwanese adults with confirmed EHI during 2006 - 2013. Cox proportional-hazards analysis was used to determine associated factors. Of noninstitutionalized adults with EHI, we <b>identified</b> <b>prevalent</b> HIV diagnosis in 210 (40 %) of 524 males and one (1. 7 %) of 59 females, and incident HIV diagnosis in 71 (23 %) of 314 males. MSM accounted for 183 (87 %) and 64 (90 %) of prevalent and incident HIV diagnoses in males, respectively. From 2006 - 2009 to 2010 - 2013, the prevalence of HIV diagnosis increased from 32 % to 45 % (P =  0. 001) while the incidence of HIV diagnosis increased from 5. 4 to 11. 3 per 100 person-years (P =  0. 001) among males with EHI. Incident HIV diagnosis was independently associated with a younger age, residing in metropolitan areas, hospitalization, previous syphilis, and engagement in oral, anal, or oral-anal sex before illness onset. Prevalent and incident HIV diagnoses were increasingly identified among adult males in Taiwan, preferentially affecting younger urban MSM.
