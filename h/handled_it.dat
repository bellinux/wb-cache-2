From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|Miri Airport (IATA: MYY, ICAO: WBGR) is an {{important}} gateway to the northern region of Sarawak. It is located 11km south of Miri city. It serves as a hub for domestic, international, and rural air services. Miri Airport is the third busiest airport in Malaysia, in terms of aircraft movements and the fifth busiest in terms of passengers <b>handled.</b> <b>It</b> provides services to 2.2 million passengers in 2013. The airport has direct international flights to Singapore. It also receives flights from domestic destinations such as Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, Kota Kinabalu, Labuan, Kuching and other major towns in Sarawak. Miri Airport also caters flights to the Sarawak interior such as Bario, Ba'kelalan, Marudi, Lawas, Limbang, and Mukah through MASwings using DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. Currently, there are three airlines serving Miri airport, namely Malaysia Airlines, Air Asia, and MASwings.|$|E
5|$|With {{the devastating}} defeat at Yarmouk his empire was {{extremely}} vulnerable to Muslim invasion. With few military resources left {{he was no}} longer in a position to attempt a military come back in Syria. To gain time for the preparations of the defense of the rest of his empire, Heraclius needed the Muslims occupied in Syria. He sought help of the Christian Arabs of Jazira who mustered up a large army and marched against Emesa, Abu Ubaidah’s headquarters. Abu Ubaidah withdrew all his forces from Northern Syria to Emesa, and Christian Arabs laid siege to Emesa. Khalid was in favor of an open battle outside fort, but Abu Ubaidah rather sent the matter to Umar, who brilliantly <b>handled</b> <b>it.</b> Umar sent detachment of Muslim armies from Iraq to invade Jazira, homeland of the invading Christian Arabs, from three different routes. Moreover, another detachment was sent to Emesa from Iraq under Qa’qa ibn Amr, a veteran of Yarmouk who was sent to Iraq for the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah. Umar himself marched from Medina ahead of 1,000 men. The Christian Arabs, under this overwhelming response, abandoned the siege and hastily withdrew to Jazira. At this point Khalid and his mobile guard came out of Emesa and devastated their army, attacking them from rear.|$|E

McDonald's officials {{came to the}} hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, who examined the card under a jeweler's eyepiece, <b>handled</b> <b>it</b> with plastic gloves, and verified it as a winner. Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald's waived the rule and has made the annual $50,000 annuity payments, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's (see McDonald's Monopoly).|$|E
25|$|In September 1987, a {{radioactive}} accident {{occurred in}} Goiânia, Goiás, after a radiotherapy device {{was stolen from}} an abandoned hospital site in the city. As different people subsequently <b>handled</b> <b>it,</b> men, women, children, animals, and plants were contaminated. In the cleanup operation, topsoil {{had to be removed}} from several sites and entire houses were demolished, with their contents removed, examined and eventually destroyed. According to the official account, about 112,000 people were examined for radioactive contamination, 297 were found to have significant levels of radioactive material in or on their body, and 4 people died. However, these numbers are in dispute, as a victims’ association argues these statistics do not take into consideration the subsequent injuries and deaths resulting from the Goiânia accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{emancipation}} of the serfs came in 1770–1830, {{beginning with}} Schleswig in 1780. The peasants were now ex-serfs and could own their land, {{buy and sell}} it, and move about freely. The nobles approved for now they could buy land owned by the peasants. The chief reformer was Baron vom Stein (1757–1831), who was influenced by The Enlightenment, especially the free market ideas of Adam Smith. The end of serfdom raised the personal legal status of the peasantry. A bank was set up so that landowners could borrow government money to buy land from peasants (the peasants {{were not allowed to}} use it to borrow money to buy land until 1850). The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasants became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815. In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany <b>handled</b> <b>it</b> peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land as serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century.|$|E

He went as far as speaking in favor of a coalition government between Social Democrats and the PDS in Berlin after the 2001 state election.|$|E

500|$|The City of Denver was a {{streamlined}} {{passenger train}} {{operated by the}} Union Pacific Railroad between Chicago, Illinois and Denver, Colorado. It operated between 1936 and 1971.

Three versions of the Cybermat were made. The first was simply a [...] "stunt double" [...] which did not have teeth and was meant for being thrown around or laid still. The second was a cable-controlled [...] "close-up" [...] version that had teeth and thrashed, and was used for when the characters <b>handled</b> <b>it.</b> Smith broke this one when he hit it with a frying pan in the scene where Craig is being attacked, and it was subsequently repaired with tape. The third was radio-controlled to dash along the floor. The post-production special effects team The Mill created a computer-generated Cybermat that leapt up to attack Craig.|$|E

The BBC later revealed this was not an official statement from Eccleston, whom they had failed to contact before responding to press questions after the story broke; the mis-quote was re-used in other media. Eccleston later said, [...] "They <b>handled</b> <b>it</b> very badly, but they issued an apology and I dropped it" [...] in an 2010 interview. After it was announced that Eccleston was leaving the BBC said that they were in talks with David Tennant to take over the role and he became the bookmakers' favourite, with odds at 1/10 and William Hill refusing to take any more bets on who would be case as the new Doctor. A BBC spokesman said that they had [...] "hoped, rather than expected" [...] that Eccleston would continue in the role.|$|E
500|$|Fingerprint {{recovery}} {{from the surface of}} firearms is done with cyanoacrylate (more commonly known as superglue) fuming. Firearms are placed in a specially designed fume hood designed to evenly distribute fumes instead of removing them. Liquid superglue is placed in a container and heated until it is in a gaseous state. The circulating fumes adhere to the oils left behind by the fingerprint, turning the print white. The resulting white print can be enhanced with fingerprint powder to increase the contrast of the white print against the weapon's finish. While using the fuming technique on recovered guns is commonplace, the recovery of fingerprints from the surfaces of a firearm is challenging due to the textured grip and the general condition of recovered weapons. [...] If fingerprints are recovered, they can be processed through fingerprint databases such as the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). Various parts of the recovered weapon can also be tested for touch DNA left by whomever <b>handled</b> <b>it.</b> However, the low levels of DNA that can be recovered presents numerous issues such as contamination and analysis anomalies such as allele drop-out and drop-in.|$|E
