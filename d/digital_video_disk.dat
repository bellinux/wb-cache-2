Blended learning {{in the context of this}} study is defined as employing a variety of appropriate methods of delivery to enhance the teaching and learning process. DVD technology was used as an ingredient in this blended learning approach, since it is easily available and accessible to the majority of learners and the schools they attend. The study reported on here forms part of a larger study using action research methodology. This article reports on a single stage of the action research: implementing a change to improve the situation and observing the consequences of this action. Mathematics Incubator School Project (ISP) learners completed questionnaires with open-ended questions which pertained to their experiences of the blended learning approach. The observations of the facilitators were also recorded. A single school was used as a case study and the mathematics performance of learners who participated in the ISP was compared with that of those who did not. The findings suggest that use of DVD technology in this blended learning approach impacted on mathematics learning and enhanced the mathematics performance of learners.

Their robustness, size and weight make them easy to transport, but also to lose or misplace. They are inexpensive and are often given away as promotional items by organisations. Over the last few years there has been a dramatic increase in the storage capacity of these devices, going from a few tens of megabytes to a current capacity of around 64 gigabytes (equal to around 13 DVDs). The larger capacity and continued low cost has vastly increased the potential uses of the devices and also the volumes and types of data that they may contain.

The DVD was evaluated in {{a randomized}} controlled trial in which 108 men with hemophilia completed measures of readiness to self-manage pain (Pain Stages of Change Questionnaire) before and 6 months after receiving the DVD plus information booklet (n = 57) or just the booklet (n = 51). The effect of the DVD was assessed by comparing changes in Pain Stages of Change Questionnaire scores (precontemplation, contemplation, and action/maintenance) between groups. The impact on pain coping, pain acceptance, and health-related quality of life was tested in secondary analyses. Repeated-measures analysis of variance, including all those with complete baseline and follow-up data regardless of use of the intervention, showed a significant, medium- sized, group time effect on precontemplation, with reductions among the DVD group but not the booklet group. Significant use time effects showed that benefits in terms of contemplation and action/maintenance were restricted to those who used the interventions at least once.
