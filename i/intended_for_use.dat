5|$|The Assembly {{had already}} done {{significant}} work on a catechism between December 1643 and January 1647 containing fifty-five questions, before it decided to create two catechisms rather than one. The Larger Catechism was intended to assist ministers in teaching the Reformed faith to their congregations. The Shorter Catechism {{was based on the}} Larger Catechism but <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in teaching the faith to children. Parliament demanded scripture proofs for the catechisms as well. The Scots General Assembly approved both catechisms in 1648.|$|E
5|$|The O-class battlecruisers were {{designed}} in 1937 {{to supplement the}} s then planned for the new German fleet. The three ships were armed with six 38cm guns in three twin turrets, similar to {{the arrangement of the}} main battery of the s. They were <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as long-range commerce raiders, with the goal of forcing Great Britain to disperse its battleships as convoy escorts. The ships were never laid down due to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|The composited camera {{negative}} of Citizen Kane {{was destroyed}} in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s.

Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which Paramount released for then-owner Turner Broadcasting System, which earned $1.6 million in North America.|$|E

5|$|Their {{secondary}} armament comprised a dozen quick-firing (QF) 3-inch 20 cwt guns. Eight {{of these}} were on low-angle mounts <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> against torpedo boats and the remaining four were on high-angle mounts for anti-aircraft defence. They also mounted two submerged tubes, one on each broadside, and four above-water tubes, two on each broadside, for 21-inch torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|A logical {{extension}} of the humanist sans-serif concept is the font superfamily: a serif font and a matching humanist sans-serif with similar letterforms. Martin Majoor's FF Scala Sans is a popular example of this influenced by Gill's work, as are Charlotte Sans and Serif by Michael Gills for Letraset and Mr and Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko, {{which are based on}} Baskerville. Indeed, Monotype themselves released Joanna Sans in 2015, as a screen-optimised sans-serif font intended to complement (but not exactly match) Gill's serif design Joanna. It is <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> at smaller sizes than Gill Sans.|$|E
5|$|Each canvas {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Fresh {{worries about}} France, {{combined}} {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears about the security of the south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> against fast-moving enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E
5|$|Hela was the {{culmination}} {{in the development}} of the aviso type in the Imperial German Navy. German avisos were developed from earlier torpedo boats and were <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in home waters with the fleet. The first aviso, , was purchased from a British shipbuilder in 1875; seven more ships were built in German yards before Hela was laid down in 1893. The aviso type culminated in what would later be referred to as the light cruiser; Helas successors, the s, were the first true light cruisers built.|$|E
5|$|Locomotive tenders {{were also}} changed as new, {{improved}} designs became available. Some {{examples of the}} second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A tender, which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 gallons. Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, {{due to the fact}} that they were <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on longer runs in the north of the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members to mount the tender to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E

5|$|Scharnhorst was a {{passenger}} ship operated by Norddeutscher Lloyd in the 1930s. She {{was trapped in}} Japan after the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939. The Japanese Navy purchased the ship on 7 February 1942, under the agreement they would pay Norddeutscher Lloyd twice {{the value of the}} ship {{after the end of the}} war. The ship was <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as a troop ship, but after the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Midway, the Navy decided to convert her into an escort carrier.|$|E
5|$|Shemanski Fountain, {{also known}} as Rebecca at the Well, is an outdoor {{fountain}} with a bronze sculpture, located in the South Park Blocks of downtown Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The sandstone fountain was designed in 1925, completed in 1926, and named after Joseph Shemanski, a Polish immigrant and businessman who {{gave it to the}} city. Carl L. Linde designed the trefoil, which features a statue designed by Oliver Laurence Barrett. The sculpture, which was added to the fountain in 1928, depicts the biblical personage Rebecca. Shemanski Fountain includes two drinking platforms with three basins each, with one platform <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> by dogs.|$|E
5|$|The Minister Coachman (Taipu 太僕), {{also known}} as the Grand Coachman, was {{responsible}} for the maintenance of imperial stables, horses, carriages and coachhouses for the emperor and his palace attendants, and for the supply of horses for the armed forces. His latter duty entailed the supervising of large breeding grounds of frontier pastures, tended by tens of thousands of government slaves. By the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) these contained 300,000 warhorses <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in campaigns against the nomadic Xiongnu Confederation. Some of the Minister Coachman's subordinates managed stables outside the capital city. These stables housed Ferghana horses that were imported or gathered as tribute from Central Asian countries.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{majority}} of the shells to detonate may have had various causes. As the submarines fired armour piercing shells, <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> against steel ship hulls, the relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger the impact fuses. Sea water may have degraded the shells, which the Japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks. The age of the shells may also have been a factor; some of the shells recovered from the Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture; surplus munitions from World War I.|$|E

5|$|The {{secondary}} battery of the Alaska class {{was composed of}} twelve dual-purpose (anti-air and anti-ship) 5"/38 caliber guns in twin mounts, with four offset {{on each side of}} the superstructure (two on each beam) and two centerline turrets fore and aft. The 5"/38 was originally <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on only destroyers built in the 1930s, but by 1934 and into World War II it was being installed on almost all of the U.S.'s major warships, including aircraft carriers, battleships, and heavy and light cruisers.|$|E
