5|$|After the Armistice on the Western Front, Lenin {{believed}} that the breakout of European revolution was imminent. Seeking to promote this, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of Béla Kun's communist government in Hungary in March 1919, followed by the communist government in Bavaria and various revolutionary socialist uprisings {{in other parts of}} Germany, including that of the Spartacus League. During Russia's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's borders to aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government. In Europe, this resulted in the creation of new communist-led states in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, all of which were officially independent of Russia, while further east it {{led to the creation of}} communist governments in Georgia, and then in Outer Mongolia. Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into the Russian state; Lenin insisted that national sensibilities should be respected, but reassured his comrades that these nations' new Communist Party administrations were under the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authority</b> of Sovnarkom.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Europe, {{the collapse of}} papal authority in the Papal Schism allowed the Scottish Crown to gain effective control of major ecclesiastical appointments within the kingdom. This <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authority</b> over appointments was formally recognised by the Papacy in 1487. This led to the placement of clients and relatives of the king in key positions, including James IV's illegitimate son Alexander, who was nominated as Archbishop of St. Andrews {{at the age of}} 11, intensifying royal influence and also opening the Church to accusations of venality and nepotism. James IV used his pilgrimages to Tain and Whithorn to help bring the respective regions of Ross and Galloway, which lay on the edges of the kingdom, under royal authority. Relationships between the Scottish Crown and the Papacy were generally good, with James IV receiving tokens of papal favour. In 1472 St Andrews became the first archbishopric in the Scottish church, to be followed by Glasgow in 1492.|$|E
25|$|Unlike war crimes, {{crimes against}} {{humanity}} can be committed during peace or war. They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authority.</b> War crimes, murder, massacres, dehumanization, genocide, ethnic cleansing, deportations, unethical human experimentation, extrajudicial punishments including summary executions, use of WMDs, state terrorism or state sponsoring of terrorism, death squads, kidnappings and forced disappearances, military use of children, unjust imprisonment, enslavement, cannibalism, torture, rape, and political, racial, or religious repression may reach the threshold of {{crimes against humanity}} if {{they are part of}} a widespread or systematic practice.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of State {{published}} The Human Rights Report in 2011 {{where it}} is underlined that <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authorities</b> of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are supported by several thousand occupying Russian troops since 2008. The <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> Abkhaz <b>authorities</b> restricted the rights of ethnic Georgians {{to participate in the}} political process and to exercise basic rights. Since 2008 the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authorities</b> of South Ossetia have refused to permit ethnic Georgians expelled during and after the 2008 war to return to South Ossetia unless they renounced their Georgian citizenship and accepted a Russian passport. No international party was able to monitor the extent of the Russian military presence.

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{consolidation}} of <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authorities</b> established in a territory following an unlawful use of force and/or contempt {{of the rights of}} the involved peoples to self-determination, international law imposes obligations on third States. Treaties entered into with the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authorities</b> established on such territories on matters concerning them must ensure the interests of the people under their jurisdiction. Otherwise, these States must expect that these treaty relations will be criticized and eventually be denounced by national and international courts. Of the same concern is the origin of the distinction that international law establishes between the different acts of the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authorities</b> administering these territories. Administrative acts issued to safeguard the civil rights of the people within their jurisdiction will not be null and void unlike those that seek to allow the population to enjoy the benefits of international cooperation. This is a difficult distinction to establish and implement...|$|R
25|$|In 1472 St Andrews {{became the}} first archbishopric in the Scottish church, to be {{followed}} by Glasgow in 1492. The collapse of papal authority in the Papal Schism (1378–1418) allowed the Scottish Crown to gain effective control of major ecclesiastical appointments within the kingdom. This <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authority</b> over appointments was formally recognised by the Papacy in 1487. The Crown placed clients and relatives of the king in key positions, including James IV's (r. 1488–1513) illegitimate son Alexander Stewart, who was nominated as Archbishop of St. Andrews at the age of 11. This practice strengthened royal influence but it also made the Church vulnerable to criticisms of venality and nepotism. Relationships between the Scottish Crown and the Papacy were generally good, with James IV receiving tokens of papal favour.|$|E
25|$|While Assad did {{not rule}} alone, he {{increasingly}} had the last word; those with whom he worked eventually became lieutenants, rather than colleagues. None of the political elite would question a decision of his, {{and those who did}} were dismissed. General Naji Jamil is an example, being dismissed after he disagreed with Assad's handling of the Islamic uprising. The two highest decision-making bodies were the Regional Command and the National Command, both part of the Ba'ath Party. Joint sessions of these bodies resembled politburos in socialist states which espoused communism. Assad headed the National Command and the Regional Command as Secretary General and Regional Secretary, respectively. The Regional Command was the highest decision-making body in Syria, appointing the president and (through him) the cabinet. As presidential authority strengthened, the power of the Regional Command and its members evaporated. The Regional and National Commands were nominally responsible to the Regional Congress and the National Congress—with the National Congress the de jure superior body—but the Regional Congress had <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authority.</b> The National Congress, which included delegates from Ba'athist Regional Branches in other countries, has been compared to the Comintern. It functioned as a session of the Regional Congress focusing on Syria's foreign policy and party ideology. The Regional Congress had limited accountability until the 1985 Eighth Regional Congress, the last under Assad. In 1985, responsibility for leadership accountability was transferred from the Regional Congress to the weaker National Progressive Front.|$|E
500|$|The Linggadjati Agreement, {{brokered}} by the British {{and concluded}} in November 1946, saw the Netherlands recognise the Republic as the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>authority</b> over Java, Madura, and Sumatra. Both parties {{agreed to the}} formation of the United States of Indonesia by 1 January 1949, a semi-autonomous federal state with the monarch of the Netherlands at its head. The Republican-controlled Java and Sumatra would be one of its states, alongside areas that were generally under stronger Dutch influence, including southern Kalimantan, and the [...] "Great East", which consisted of Sulawesi, Maluku, the Lesser Sunda Islands, and Western New Guinea. The Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) did not ratify the agreement until February 1947, and neither the Republic nor the Dutch were satisfied with it. On 25 March 1947 the Lower House of the Dutch parliament ratified a stripped down version of the treaty, which was not accepted by the Republic. Both sides soon accused the other of violating the agreement.|$|E
