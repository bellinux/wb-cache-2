He declined the offer citing once again <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> play for Italy when he became eligible. He also stated <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> represent Italy at international level once he acquired an Italian passport.|$|E
5|$|As a Justice, Black {{held the}} view that the Court should {{literally}} enforce constitutional guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an ‘activist’ because of <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E
5|$|He {{was known}} for <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> apply an equal degree of {{scrutiny}} to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his own position.|$|E

5|$|In the Andean High Plateau, a cocalero group {{launched}} a guerrilla uprising {{under the leadership}} of Felipe Quispe; an ethnic separatist, he and Morales disliked each other, with Quispe considering Morales to be a traitor and an opportunist for <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> cooperate with White Bolivians.|$|E
5|$|The scandal grew {{to involve}} {{a slew of}} {{additional}} allegations against the President, ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes; Nixon repeatedly stated <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay any outstanding taxes due, and paid $465,000 in back taxes in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Bucer {{arrived in}} Augsburg on 30 March 1548 {{of his own}} volition. On 2 April, after he was shown the document, he {{announced}} <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> ratify it if certain changes were made; but the time for negotiations had passed, and Charles insisted on his signature. When he refused, he was placed under house arrest on 13 April, and shortly afterwards in close confinement. On 20 April, he signed the Interim and was immediately freed.|$|E
5000|$|Naka {{was praised}} by Tetsurō Watsuji, a leading critic, {{and also by}} Zhou Zuoren, for <b>his</b> rare <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> criticize Japanese nationalists.|$|R
5000|$|Freaky Trigger {{once said}} of Williams: [...] "He {{is a god}} among drummers due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{complete}} <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> create an entire beat based on doing rolls on the various toms in his kit." ...|$|R

5|$|Delaney {{played for}} Division I-AA's Northwestern State Demons from 1977 to 1980. After telling his coach of <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> play {{football}} at the collegiate level, Delaney {{switched to the}} running back position. He went on to be an All-American selection in 1979 and 1980. While at Northwestern State, Delaney met his future wife, Carolyn, and they had two children by his senior year.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his lifetime, Grinsell {{examined}} and catalogued around 10,000 barrows and advanced the archaeological understanding of such monuments. His use of non-excavatory fieldwork influenced much British archaeology {{in the latter part of}} his 20th century, while <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay attention to other sources of information, such as folklore and place-names, has been deemed to be ahead of his time.|$|E
5|$|Several hours later, Martha is {{frustrated}} {{to see her}} husband negotiating with terrorist Vladimir Bierko and <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> compromise Yuri Suvarov and his wife's safety. Aaron Pierce eventually saves her from the ambush on the Suvarovs' motorcade. Martha continues to question Logan's motives as her husband attempts to prevent her from finding out {{about his role in}} Palmer's death.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Kennedy {{expressed}} <b>his</b> strong <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> {{support a}} bill that was under consideration for {{the abolition of the}} death penalty. He argued that rising crime rates could be countered with more job and educational opportunities instead of with increased legal penalties.|$|R
60|$|The waiting man cursed {{himself for}} a craven coward; he fought back the benumbing sense; he steeled his heart. Was this <b>his</b> vaunted <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> share the Avenger's danger? His strong spirit rose up in arms; once more he was brave and fierce.|$|R
50|$|F-scale tests measure {{not only}} the subject's overall level of stress but also <b>his</b> or her <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> {{cooperate}} in the testing process.|$|R
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX {{announced}} <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> work {{with leaders of}} the civil rights movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for civil rights would keep the issue within the United States, while changing the focus to human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark {{and hired}} Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo {{had been a}} {{personal}} friend of Clark's and publicly stated being surprised and disappointed with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam {{expressed}} <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> {{consider a}} second term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election. However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes. He did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.|$|E
5000|$|... re. Lord Taylor [...] "We {{conclude}} that Lord Taylor's {{conversations with the}} journalists display <b>his</b> clear <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> breach the Code of Conduct by engaging in paid advocacy, and by failing to act on his personal honour, as required by paragraphs 4(c) and 4(b) of the Code." ...|$|R
50|$|Waring {{shows in}} all these works <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> simply <b>to</b> write {{beautiful}} music.

50|$|Corzo mainly {{plays at}} {{right back and}} is {{naturally}} right-footed, but he can also play at left back. He {{is known for his}} great stamina, <b>his</b> strong <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> help in the attack, and his aggressive style of defending. He also has good speed and control of the ball.|$|R
5|$|Because of <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> tackle {{such issues}} as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were {{initially}} met with disapproval. However, as the public's taste for realist fiction grew, this subsided. Moore began to find success as an art critic {{with the publication of}} books such as Impressions and Opinions (1891) and Modern Painting (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his literary work.|$|E
5|$|Calls by the {{legislature}} for Magoffin's resignation had begun as early as September 30, 1861. On August 16, 1862, Magoffin declared <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> resign {{on the condition that}} he be allowed to choose his successor. Because Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office in 1859, Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk was next in line for the governorship. Magoffin refused to accept Fisk as his successor, so Fisk resigned as speaker and the senate elevated Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, to speaker. Magoffin resigned as governor on August 18, 1862, and Robinson assumed the office of governor for the remainder of Magoffin's term.|$|E
5|$|General Henry Rawlinson {{served on}} Kitchener's staff during the advance on Omdurman, in 1898, {{and served with}} {{distinction}} in the Second Boer War, where he {{earned a reputation as}} one of the most able British commanders. Rawlinson took command of the British IV Corps in 1914 and then command of the Fourth Army in 1916, as the plans for the Allied offensive on the Somme were being developed. During the war, Rawlinson was noted for <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> use innovative tactics, which he employed during the battle of Amiens, where he combined attacks by tanks with artillery.|$|E
5000|$|Whig campaigners, who {{included}} Abraham Lincoln and Rutherford B. Hayes, talked up Taylor's [...] "antiparty" [...] {{opposition to}} the Jacksonian commitment to the spoils system and yellow-dog partisanship. In the South, they stressed {{that he was a}} Louisiana slaveholder, while in the North they highlighted <b>his</b> Whiggish <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> defer to Congress on major issues (which he subsequently did not do).|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the First World War, Repington {{joined the}} staff of the Daily Telegraph and {{subsequently}} published several books. These works, including The First World War in 1920 and After the War in 1922, were bestsellers, but cost Repington friendships for <b>his</b> apparent <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report what others considered to have been private conversations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{president}} of the Council owed his position to both his party's majority in the Legislature (and <b>to</b> <b>his</b> party's <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> support him in the Chamber) and to the Emperor, and these two sources of authority (parliamentary backing and imperial appointment) could sometimes come into conflict. 19th century abolitionist leader and historian Joaquim Nabuco said: ...|$|R
5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, the Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Cincinnati, Ohio. Six men were officially candidates for nomination at the convention, {{and several others}} also received votes. Of these, the two leading candidates were Major General Winfield Scott Hancock from Pennsylvania and Senator Thomas F. Bayard from Delaware. Tilden was not officially a candidate, but he wielded a heavy influence over the convention. Tilden was ambiguous about <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, she {{was working}} on her third novel, Beauty's Hour, and it is likely that Yeats read the manuscript, {{suggested}} revisions, and {{may have contributed to the}} characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the occult. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.|$|E
50|$|Secret of his success:Obedience only to {{the word}} and {{instructions}} of God. Sandwiched between <b>his</b> <b>willingness</b> and desire <b>to</b> do the will of God is obedience even when all things are working contrary to the word of God.|$|R
500|$|Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were {{formally}} engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, {{and married}} at St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick, on 22 March 1916. [...] In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for <b>his</b> wife's <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> marry {{a man with}} no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the events}} of [...] "Schism", Rogue chooses to be on Wolverine's team, noting to Cyclops that he has {{reached a point where}} <b>his</b> {{previous}} <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> question <b>his</b> decisions has been replaced by an inability to accept when he might be wrong. She returns to Westchester, New York with Wolverine's team to start the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.|$|R
