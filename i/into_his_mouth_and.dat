5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old. He used {{to let them go}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> he'd imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E
5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E
25|$|When Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom, in 1867 {{failed to}} answer a letter Tewodros II of Ethiopia had sent her, he took it as an insult and imprisoned several British residents, {{including}} the consul. An army of 12,000 was sent from Bombay to Ethiopia to rescue the captured nationals, {{under the command of}} Sir Robert Napier. The Ethiopians were defeated, and the British stormed the fortress of Magdala (now known as Amba Mariam) on April 13, 1868. When the Emperor heard that the gate had fallen, he fired a pistol <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> killed himself.

500|$|Unusual filming {{techniques}} were also used. Visual Effects Supervisor John Wash recalls, [...] "We devised a laser effect where a device is going <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> some other weird lens effects {{that were going}} over the scene to give it an alien, other-world-like quality." [...] On the subject of using not only a challengingly minuscule method of filming but also additional sound effects, supervising producer Paul Rabwin recounts, [...] "I had {{to set up a}} very, very highly magnified lens to try to get this little device coming right at us. It was very, very scary. We ended up putting some really cool sound effects in there, little servos and motors." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} broadcast, The Mirror {{reported}} that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than {{go ahead with the}} live transmission, as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast had worked so hard on it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots [...] "misfired". Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch. The script called for Wood to be sick, though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway, [...] "to get it all out". During a scene in which Roxy and Ronnie argued in the Minute Mart, Womack took a bottle of paint stripper from the shelves, but forgot to stop at the counter to pay for it before exiting.|$|E
500|$|Slovak was {{primarily}} influenced by hard rock {{artists such as}} Jimi Hendrix, Santana, and Led Zeppelin. [...] His playing method was markedly based on improvisation, a style commonly used in funk music. [...] He was also noted for his aggressive playing style; he would often play {{with such force that}} his fingers would [...] "come apart." [...] Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What is This?, with Slovak adopting a more fluid style featuring [...] "sultry" [...] elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques. [...] On Uplift, Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal. [...] His guitar riffs would often serve as the basis of the group's songs, with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work. [...] His melodic riff featured in the song [...] "Behind the Sun" [...] inspired the group to create [...] "pretty" [...] songs with an emphasis on melody. [...] Kiedis describes the song as [...] "pure Hillel inspiration". [...] Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as [...] "Green Heaven" [...] and [...] "Funky Crime", in which the sounds of his amplified guitar would be played through a tube <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> then back into a microphone, creating psychedelic, voice-like effects. [...] Slovak helped to incorporate new sounds in the group's work, including adding occasional drum machines. Despite the fact that the group billed itself as [...] "The Organic Anti-Beat Box Band", Kiedis states that Slovak showed the group that drum machines could be used as artistic instruments.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the next several years, Edogawa went on to write a number of other stories that focus on crimes and the {{processes}} involved in solving them. Among these stories are a number of stories that are now considered classics of early 20th-century Japanese popular literature: , which is about a woman who is killed in {{the course of}} a sadomasochistic extramarital affair, , which is about a man who kills a neighbor in a Tokyo boarding house by dropping poison through a hole in the attic floor <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> , which is about a man who hides himself in a chair to feel the bodies on top of him. Mirrors, lenses, and other optical devices appear in many of Edogawa's other early stories, such as [...] "The Hell of Mirrors".|$|E
2500|$|What {{followed}} was chaotic. Some {{people in the}} room left to call for help. Among those that stayed, some pleaded with Dwyer to surrender the gun while others tried to approach him and seize the weapon. Dwyer warned against either action, exclaiming, [...] "Don't, don't, don't, this will hurt someone." [...] A moment later, Dwyer fired one shot <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> collapsed to the floor, dead. [...] Witnesses screamed and cursed as five news cameras recorded the events. One of the cameras remained focused on Dwyer and captured close up footage of the aftermath of the shooting; as his lifeless body slumped to the floor, blood streamed from the exit wound {{in the back of his}} head as well as from his nostrils. A shaken Horshock took the podium and asked the media to leave and for someone to call for medical assistance and the Pennsylvania Capitol Police.|$|E
2500|$|On his {{birthday}} in March, Ron accidentally eats Amortentia-infused Chocolate Cauldrons (actually meant for Harry). After being cured by Slughorn, he then consumes poisoned mead (which Draco Malfoy actually intended for Dumbledore). Harry saves his life by forcing a bezoar, a poison antidote, <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> Ron {{is transferred to}} the hospital wing. A panic-stricken Hermione arrives, forgetting her past anger. While sitting by his bed, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and the twins hear Ron mutter Hermione's name in his delirium, although they do not hear {{what he is saying}} and ignore it. Conversely, Ron feigns sleep when Lavender visits him. Upon recovering, Ron and Hermione reconcile, and a little while later, Ron and Lavender break up. Rowling in an interview said that she [...] "really enjoyed writing the Ron/Lavender business, and the reason that was enjoyable was Ron up to this point has been quite immature compared to the other two, and he kind of needed to make himself worthy of Hermione....he had to grow up emotionally and now he's taken a big step up." ...|$|E

It was pathetic to see. Turning to the landlady for an explanation, she said the man was Chief Black Thunder, and she had given him the bread because she could not bear to see him suffering from hunger and cold. He was eighty-four and nearly blind from trachoma. In the brick building across the parade ground, a short distance from the eating place, stood the agency office, and nearby was the commissary and storehouses of the government, representing the nearly two billions of money and property belonging to the Indians, administered by the more than five thousand agents, employees, superintendents and welfare experts of the Indian Bureau, on salaries high and low, much of which was taken from the ...|$|E

Rabbi Leazar combined all these views, teaching that [...] "Judah came near to him" [...] ready for battle, conciliation, or prayer. Rabbi Jeremiah ben Shemaiah taught that Judah exclaimed that he would only need to utter one word (dabar) and bring a plague (deber) upon the Egyptians.
