5|$|Between 1843 and 1927, the King <b>George</b> <b>III</b> Museum was {{a museum}} within King's College London which housed the {{collections}} of scientific instruments of <b>George</b> <b>III</b> and eminent nineteenth-century scientists (including Sir Charles Wheatstone and Charles Babbage).

5|$|The Falkland Islands, off {{the south}} coast of Argentina, were {{simultaneously}} claimed for Louis XV of France, in 1764, and <b>George</b> <b>III</b> of the United Kingdom, in 1765, though the French colony was ceded to Charles III of Spain in 1767. By 1833, however, the islands were under full British control. The South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were discovered by Captain James Cook for <b>George</b> <b>III</b> in January 1775, and from 1843 were {{governed by the}} British Crown-in-Council through the Falkland Islands, an arrangement that stood until the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were incorporated as a distinct British overseas territory in 1985. The monarch is represented in these regions by Nigel Phillips, who is both the Governor of the Falkland Islands and the Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.|$|E

5|$|The <b>George</b> <b>III</b> Fringe Tiara is a circlet {{incorporating}} brilliant diamonds {{that were}} formerly owned by <b>George</b> <b>III.</b> Originally commissioned in 1830, the tiara has been worn by many queens consort.

In Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting The First of May, completed in 1851, Victoria can be seen wearing it as she holds Prince Arthur, the future Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. In a veiled reference to the adoration of the Magi, the Duke of Wellington is seen presenting the young prince with a gift.|$|E
