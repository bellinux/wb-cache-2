5000|$|Coupling {{between two}} or more qubits is {{essential}} to implement many-qubit gates. The two basic coupling mechanisms are the direct inductive coupling and coupling via a microwave resonator. In the direct coupling, the circulating currents of the qubits inductively affect one another - clockwise current in one qubit induces counter-clockwise current in the other. In the Pauli Matrices formalism, a [...] term appears in the Hamiltonian, essential for the controlled NOT gate implementation. The direct coupling might be further enhanced by kinetic inductance, if the qubit loops are made to share an edge, so that the currents will flow through the same superconducting line. Inserting a Josephson junction on that joint line will add a Josephson inductance term, and increase the coupling even more. To implement a switchable coupling in the direct coupling mechanism, as required to implement a gate of finite duration, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coupling</b> loop may be used. The control magnetic flux applied to the coupler loop switches the coupling on and off, as implemented, for example, in the D-Wave Systems machines. The second method of coupling utilizes an intermediate microwave cavity resonator, commonly implemented in a coplanar waveguide geometry. By tuning the energy separation of the qubits to match {{the one of the}} resonator, the phases of the loop currents are synchronized, and a [...] coupling is implemented. Tuning the qubits in and out of resonance (for example, by modifying their bias magnetic flux) controls the duration of the gate operation.|$|E

40|$|It is {{expected}} that at weak to <b>intermediate</b> <b>coupling,</b> d-wave superconductivity can be induced by antiferromagnetic fluctuations. However, one needs to clarify the role of Fermi surface topology, density of states, pseudogap, and wave vector of the magnetic fluctuations on the nature and strength of the induced d-wave state. To this end, we study the generalized phase diagram of the two-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model {{as a function of}} interaction strength U/t, frustration induced by second-order hopping t^'/t, and temperature T/t. In experiment, U/t and t^'/t can be controlled by pressure. We use the two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC), valid from weak to <b>intermediate</b> <b>coupling.</b> We first calculate as a function of t^'/t and U/t the temperature and wave vector at which the spin response function begins to grow exponentially. D-wave superconductivity in a half-filled band can be induced by such magnetic fluctuations at weak to <b>intermediate</b> <b>coupling,</b> but only if they are near commensurate wave vectors and not too close to perfect nesting conditions where the pseudogap becomes detrimental to superconductivity. For given U/t there is thus an optimal value of frustration t^'/t where the superconducting T_c is maximum. The non-interacting density of states plays little role. The symmetry d_x^ 2 -y^ 2 vs d_xy of the superconducting order parameter depends on the wave vector of the underlying magnetic fluctuations in a way that can be understood qualitatively from simple arguments...|$|E

We study the greybody factors for the non-minimally coupled scalars which originate from the gravitons and R-R antisymmetric tensor particles polarized along the 5 -brane, with one index along the string {{and the other}} transverse to the string. These scalars, which we call <b>intermediate,</b> <b>couple</b> to the black holes differently from the minimal and the fixed scalars which were studied previously. Analysis of their fluctuations around the black hole reveals a surprising mixing between these NS-NS and R-R scalars. We disentangle this mixing and obtain two decoupled scalar equations.

The results agree with corresponding calculations in the effective string model provided one of the <b>intermediate</b> scalars <b>couples</b> to an operator of dimension (1, 2), while the other to an operator of dimension (2, 1).
