5|$|The helmet of {{the arms}} was not {{specified}} in the charter, but the engraver sketched out a peer's <b>helmet</b> <b>on</b> the final design, which is used. This {{is contrary to the}} heraldic rules, as a society or corporation normally has an esquire's helmet; it is thought that either the engraver was ignorant of this rule, which was not strictly adhered to until around 1615, or that he used the peer's helmet as a compliment to Lord Brouncker, a peer and the first President of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|One of Parcells first {{decisions}} as coach was to replace Simms {{as the starting}} quarterback with Brunner. Simms asked to be traded after the benching, but his request was ignored. During the sixth game of the Giants' 1983 Season, Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles. On his second drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the thumb on his throwing hand hit a player's <b>helmet</b> <b>on</b> his follow-through. The injury was reported as a dislocation, {{but according to the}} book, Simms to McConkey, written by Phil McConkey, Simms, and Dick Schaap, the injury was much more severe, with the thumb literally hanging off after impact, and the bone sticking out through the skin.|$|E

5000|$|After {{leaving the}} Dodgers, Rickey {{was offered the}} {{position}} of general manager for the Pittsburgh Pirates. During the 1953 season, the Pirates became {{the first team to}} permanently adopt batting <b>helmets</b> <b>on</b> both offense and defense. These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass [...] "miner's cap". This was the mandate of Rickey, who also owned stock in the company producing the helmets. Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field. The helmets became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of <b>helmets</b> <b>on</b> defense, partly because of their awkwardly heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded the <b>helmets</b> <b>on</b> defense, the trend disappeared from the game.|$|R

5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech <b>helmet</b> <b>on</b> the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E
5|$|Andrei is {{once again}} at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow {{companion}} in silence. Several refugees discuss the problems in their respective home towns, and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir. He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his {{time away from the}} monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance. A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka is too simple minded to remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier's shining breastplate. The group taunt and play with her, but the soldier takes a liking to her, putting his horned <b>helmet</b> <b>on</b> her head and dressing her as a bride, finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars. Kirill talks to Andrei {{for the first time since}} they both left the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be in any danger, as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck, and she will be let go. Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.|$|E
5|$|Mulder uses a {{government}} source {{to find a}} secret T3 line in Fairfax County, Virginia, one that the AI uses to access the Internet. He also finds the trailer that {{is connected to the}} T3 line. Meanwhile, Esther forces Scully to drive to David's house. However, they find that the house has been destroyed. Esther admits that she and David had been planning to transfer their consciousness into cyberspace to enter the AI. Gelman, however, thought the idea was too dangerous. Esther also admits that she and David were in love, and were having an affair behind Gelman's back. Meanwhile, Mulder finds much computer hardware inside the trailer. He also finds David’s dead body, with a virtual reality <b>helmet</b> <b>on</b> his head. Suddenly, Mulder is constrained by moving cables and wires, and experiences a strange vision in which he is in a hospital where nurses threaten to amputate his limbs unless he reveals Kill Switch's location. Meanwhile, the AI locates Scully and Esther driving near a swing bridge. They become trapped on the bridge after the AI manipulates its drawing mechanism, causing Scully to persuade Esther to throw the laptop into the water. Just as it hits the water it is destroyed by the defense satellite's laser strike.|$|E

In the plant, Gordon finds two people, an anchorman and a pediatrician tied to chairs with <b>helmets</b> <b>on</b> their heads that will send an electric shock that one will die. The GCPD arrives to help but Tetch turns the <b>helmets</b> <b>on,</b> killing them both while telling Gordon that an old friend will tell him what to do next.|$|R

Wilson and Walker have fifteen rifles attached to poles and are marching up and down behind a wall. Frazer pushes Jones onto the bank, but he cannot get the flap open, and falls back in the river. However, the Eastgate platoon are distracted by Mainwaring's second diversion: Walker and Godfrey have put tin <b>helmets</b> <b>on</b> a flock of sheep and have taken them up to the mill. The Verger and Square are fooled into believing that the platoon are dressed up as sheep with tin <b>helmets</b> <b>on!</b> ...|$|R
25|$|The Summerville High School {{basketball}} team, {{of which}} Captain Louis Mulkey {{was an assistant}} coach, was presented with a custom memorial fire helmet by the Charleston Fire Department.

25|$|The helmet {{is usually}} made of two main parts: the bonnet, which covers the diver's head, and the corselet which {{supports}} {{the weight of}} the <b>helmet</b> <b>on</b> the diver's shoulders, and is clamped to the suit to create a watertight seal. The bonnet is attached and sealed to the corselet at the neck, either by bolts or an interrupted screw-thread, with some form of locking mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{appointed}} day, Square is looking {{out from his}} vantage point in the windmill as is his (unidentified) sergeant. Mainwaring signals via field telephone to Pike, who is dressed as a scarecrow, to start the diversion using a bird warbler. However, although Godfrey then sends a flock of sheep with tin <b>helmets</b> <b>on</b> into the field within Square’s field of vision, Pike is quickly surrounded by many birds, which have been attracted by the warbler. The Verger, again spying for Square, rings {{to tell him that}} Mainwaring’s men are apparently dressed as sheep with tin <b>helmets</b> <b>on,</b> only to be off-handedly dismissed by the upper-crust officer, who then remarks (to his sergeant, perhaps) that “he’s had too much communion wine!” ...|$|R
50|$|The rally cap {{has also}} been used {{recently}} in the National Hockey League in shootout situations.

25|$|Dating {{to around}} AD 700/800-900, Grave 5 {{contained}} fifteen skeletons {{and a number}} of grave goods. Interred in the seated position, the primary skeleton (15) was originally housed in a “makeshift hut,” that had long since decomposed. His grave goods included a carved whale tooth pendant, stone mirror backs, gold or tumbaga greaves, cuffs, plaques and a <b>helmet.</b> <b>On</b> the floor were stone slabs, tortoise shells and various ceramics.|$|E

50|$|Screws {{were used}} in the 15th century to {{construct}} screw-cutting lathes, for securing breastplates, backplates, and <b>helmets</b> <b>on</b> medieval jousting armor—and eventually for multiple parts of the emerging firearms, particularly the matchlock.

25|$|Unlike some {{breaches}} of Law 41, a No ball only {{attracts the}} No ball penalty (e.g. one run), {{there are no}} provisions in the Law or in common regulations for five penalty runs to be awarded to the batting team, {{and there are no}} incidents when five penalty runs are awarded that would require a No ball to be called, although scenarios exist in which five penalty runs might be awarded when the ball is in play and would count in the over, were it not a No ball for the reasons given here, for example: repeated damage to the wicket by the fielding team during a No ball, or the ball hits a <b>helmet</b> <b>on</b> the ground during a No ball.|$|E
25|$|The Women's Memorial was {{designed}} by Glenna Goodacre for {{the women of the}} United States who served in the Vietnam War. The original winning entry of the Women's Memorial design contest was deemed unsuitable. Glenna Goodacre's entry received an honorable mention in the contest and she was asked to submit a modified maquette (design model). Goodacre's original design for the Women's Memorial statue included a standing figure of a nurse holding a Vietnamese baby, which although not intended as such, was deemed a political statement, and it was asked that this be removed. She replaced them with a figure of a kneeling woman holding an empty <b>helmet.</b> <b>On</b> November 11, 1993, the Vietnam Women's Memorial was dedicated. There is a smaller replica of that memorial at Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park in Angel Fire, New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{fragments}} {{represent all}} known instances {{of the second}} design, accounting for its placement on a like number of panels. It is surmised to have originally appeared twelve times on the helmet, although this theory assumes that the unidentified third design—which occupies one of the twelve panels—was a replacement for a damaged panel. Assuming so, the pattern occupied eight spaces on the lowest row of the skull cap (i.e., all but the two showing design 1), and two panels, one atop the other rising towards the crest, in the centre of each side. All panels showing design 2 {{appear to have been}} struck from the same die. The horse and rider thus move in a clockwise direction around the helmet, facing towards the rear of the <b>helmet</b> <b>on</b> the dexter side, and towards the front on the sinister side.|$|E
