50|$|Horizontal {{deformation}} in mid-latitude cyclones concentrates temperature gradients—cold {{air from}} the north and warm {{air from the}} south. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> has two effects on an air parcel; it tends to rotate the parcel (think of placing a wheel at a point in space and as the wind blows, the wheel rotates) and deform the parcel through stretching and shrinking. In the end, this can also tighten temperature gradient, but most importantly, this rotates a concentrated temperature gradient for example, from the x-axis to the y direction. Within a mid-latitude cyclone, these two key features play an essential role in frontogenesis. On the west side of a typical mid-latitude cyclone, there are northerly winds (associated with cold air) and east of the cyclone, southerly winds (associated with warm air); resulting in <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> deformation. In the end, this results to concentrate a cyclonic shear along a line of maximum shear (which in this case is the birth of a cold front). On the eastern side of a cyclone, horizontal deformation is seen which turns into confluence (a result of translation + deformation). Horizontal deformation at low levels is an important mechanism for the development of both cold and warm fronts (Holton, 2004).|$|E

5000|$|The Highland Boundary Fault {{runs from}} Lochranza on the Isle of Arran {{in the south}} and west through the Isle of Bute and Helensburgh, then forms the {{northern}} boundary of Strathmore before reaching Stonehaven in the north east. The fault was active during the Caledonian orogeny, [...] a plate tectonic collision which took place from Mid Ordovician to Mid Devonian periods (520 to 400 million years ago), during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. The fault allowed the Midland Valley to descend as a major rift by as much as 4000 metres and there was subsequently vertical movement. This earlier vertical movement was later replaced by a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a {{transverse}} shear {{force is applied}} to a structure, such as a beam, the result is variation in bending normal stresses {{along the length of the}} beam. This variation necessitates an internal <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> stress within the beam that varies with position y' from the neutral axis in the beam. The concept of complementary shear then dictates that a shear stress also exists along the front face of the beam. As described above, in thin-walled structures the variation with thickness can be neglected, and the shear stress along the front face of the structure can be examined as shear flow, or the shear stress multiplied by the thickness of the element.|$|E
500|$|Wind shear (or windshear), {{sometimes}} referred to as wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and/or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere. Atmospheric wind shear is normally described as either vertical or <b>horizontal</b> wind <b>shear.</b> Vertical wind shear is a change in wind speed or direction with change in altitude.

30|$|Thus, the PSASI imager data {{reveal that}} both nights had similar wave structure, {{which can also}} cause {{temperature}} perturbations. The occurrence of ripple-type structures seen on both the nights suggests that the atmospheric conditions are conducive for dynamical instabilities, which are {{likely to occur in}} the presence of strong <b>horizontal</b> <b>shears.</b> As discussed in the above paragraph, the ripple-type structures appear to propagate in meridional direction with a component in the zonal direction. This implies the possibility of existence of large <b>horizontal</b> wind <b>shears</b> that are required for Es formation (Whitehead, 1989). This is consistent with the ISR observations of sporadic-E layer on both the nights. Recent studies by Fytterer et al.

50|$|At present, it is {{believed}} that the Highland Boundary Fault was active during two main orogenic events associated with the Caledonian orogeny : the Grampian orogeny in the Early Ordovician and the Acadian orogeny in the Middle Devonian. The fault allowed the Midland Valley to descend as a major rift by up to 4000 m and there was subsequent vertical movement. This earlier vertical movement was later replaced by a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear.</b> A complementary fault, the Southern Uplands Fault, forms the southern boundary for the Central Lowlands.The age of the Highland Boundary Fault has been inferred to be between Ordovician to middle Devonian and through several generations it has been interpreted as a graben-bounding normal fault, a major sinistral strike-slip fault, a northwest-dipping reverse fault or terrane boundary. The reason the precise nature of the fault is still unknown is because there is little evidence of a continuous fault plane on the surface. More recently, seismic activities marking the fault line have been analysed to show that the 2003 Aberfoyle earthquake had a hypocentre at 4 km depth and was caused by an oblique sinistral strike-slip fault with normal movement. The fault plane was estimated to be dipping at 65° NW.|$|E
50|$|Frontogenesis is a {{meteorological}} {{process of}} tightening of horizontal temperature gradients to produce fronts. In the end, {{two types of}} fronts form: cold fronts and warm fronts. A cold front is a narrow line where temperature decreases rapidly. A warm front is a narrow line of warmer temperatures and essentially {{where much of the}} precipitation occurs. Frontogenesis occurs {{as a result of a}} developing baroclinic wave. According to Hoskins & Bretherton (1972, p. 11), there are eight mechanisms that influence temperature gradients: <b>horizontal</b> deformation, <b>horizontal</b> <b>shearing,</b> vertical deformation, differential vertical motion, latent heat release, surface friction, turbulence and mixing, and radiation.

40|$|AbstractIn {{previous}} work [Meese et al. (1995). Vision Research, 35, 2879 – 2888) ] {{we showed that}} one dimensional (1 D) speed gradients are sufficient to produce a compelling impression of surface slant. Summing a 1 D vertical shearing gradient or, less intuitively, a 1 D <b>horizontal</b> <b>shearing</b> gradient with a random field of horizontally translating dots produces perceived slant about a horizontal axis. Similarly, a 1 D vertical or horizontal compression gradient produces perceived slant about a vertical axis. Appropriately combining orthogonal 11) shears or compressions produces a purely deforming flow pattern. Here we asked whether both the vertical and horizontal components in such a stimulus contribute to perceived slant. Using a matching technique we found that for surfaces inclined about a vertical axis, this was indeed the case and that horizontal and vertical compression gradients contributed roughly equally to perceived slant. Similarly, for surfaces inclined about a horizontal axis, both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>shearing</b> gradients contributed to the perceived slant, though here the horizontal gradient was given less weight than the vertical. We conclude that under appropriate conditions, the human visual system combines orthogonal speed gradients prior to the computation of slant from retinal flow...|$|R

50|$|The <b>{{horizontal}}</b> <b>shear</b> {{and horizontal}} deformation direct to concentrate the pole-equator temperature gradient {{over a large}} synoptic scale (1000 km). The quasi-geostrophic equations fail in the dynamics of frontogenesis because this weather phenomenon is of smaller scale compared to the Rossby radius; so semigeostrophic theory is used. Generally, Rossby number—ratio of inertial to coriolis terms—is used to formulate a condition of geostrophic flow. Across the front, the Rossby number is {{on the order of}} udu/dx/fv = (10 m/s)^2/(1000 km)/(1e-4 s-1)/(1 m/s) = 1; this shows we cannot ignore the inertial term (one must take into account the ageostrophic wind). Along the front, the Rossby number is on the order of udv/dx/fu = (10 m/s)/(1000 km)*(1e-4 s-1)*(10 m/s) = 0.01, which means it is in geostrophic and thermal wind balance. Finally, looking at a cross section (y-z) through the confluent flow, using Q-vectors (Q pointing toward upward motion), on the warm side (bottom of confluent schematic), there is upward motion and on the other hand, the cold side (top of confluent schematic), there is downward motion.The cross-section points out convergence (arrows pointing towards each other) associated with tightening of horizontal temperature gradient. Conversely, divergence is noticed (arrows point away from each other), associated with stretching horizontal temperature gradient. Since the strength of the ageostrophic flow is proportional to temperature gradient, the ageostrophic tightening tendencies grow rapidly after the initial geostrophic intensification.|$|E
40|$|The <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> {{strength}} of the interface between prestressed concrete hollow core slabs and cast-in-place concrete topping slabs was evaluated {{through a set of}} 24 push-off experiments. The push-off test specimens featured segments of dry-mix and wet-mix hollow core slabs with a variety of surface treatments including machine finished, sandblasted, broom roughened, rake roughened and grouted. A cast-in-place slab was poured on top of the hollow core specimens to form a 15 inch by 15 inch interface between the two materials. Results indicate the average <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> {{strength of}} the push-off specimens was 227 psi. Higher shear strength and slip capacity was observed in specimens that were broom roughened in the direction transverse to the applied shear force and in grouted dry-mix specimens. Specimens with machine finished surfaces had lower average <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> strength than those with intentionally roughened surfaces, but still exceeded the shear strength of 80 psi specified in the ACI 318 - 08 code. A method to comparatively quantify the surface roughness of the hollow core slabs with different surface treatments was adapted from an existing ASTM standard for pavements. This standard specifies the procedure to determine mean texture depth that can be correlated to <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> {{strength of the}} push-off specimens. Analytical studies were also performed to estimate the maximum <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> stresses that can be expected in composite hollow core slabs under normal construction conditions.

30|$|From Table  7 and Fig.  10, it {{can also}} be found that the {{interface}} preparation method influenced the <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> stress of composite beam effectively. This highlights the importance of aggregate interlock action for interface shear capacity. It can also be found that there is no obvious trend that can be established to describe the influence of concrete strength on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> stress of composite beams, which was consistent with the results from Patnaik (2001). The higher <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of composites beams with the target slab concrete strength of 40  MPa may be associated with its higher splitting tensile strength as shown in Table  3. With the increasing of clamping stress (from 0 to 0.60  MPa), {{there is no doubt that}} specimens with higher clamping stress got a higher value of interface shear stress. However, when the clamping stress increased from 0.60 to 1.21  MPa, interface shear stress decreased. A possible explanation for this unusual phenomenon may be the non-simultaneous shear failure of interface. As discussed in Part 4.2, this resulted in the shear capacity of interface reinforcements cannot reach yielding simultaneously and this unusual appearance had also been found in the recent research (Sneed et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2016). These indicate the necessity for retaining an upper limit for <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> stress. Higher clamping stress would not certainly promote the interface shear capacity. Without reaching interface shear failure, Beam R- 40 - 17 and Beam S- 40 - 17 reached a higher <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> capacity. On the other hand, higher slab concrete strength and higher clamping stress caused a larger slip at <b>horizontal</b> <b>shear</b> failure.|$|E
