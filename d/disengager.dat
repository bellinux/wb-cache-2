30|$|Stone & Webster Company (USA) {{developed}} a riser terminal device named the Rams horn separator (axial separator). It {{can reduce the}} oil gas residence time in the <b>disengager</b> (from 15 – 51 to 4 – 9  s by recorded data), decrease the pressure drop and accelerate the gas solid separation (Gauthier et al. 2005). This system uses centrifugal force generated by 180 ° rotation of the oil/gas mixture and catalysts. So it can prevent catalyst particles from entering the fractionating tower and enables easy operation. As a result, the reaction temperature in the <b>disengager</b> can be lowered by 10  % with light oil yield increasing by about 2  %; meanwhile, the dry gas yield and coke formation can be decreased.|$|E

Some technologies have already been applied to the industry production, and remarkable results have been achieved. These quick separation systems include the vortex <b>disengager</b> stripper (VDS) system and vortex separation system (VSS) from UOP Company (Gilbert 1995), the Rams horn system from the Stone & Webster Company and the closed cyclone technology from Mobil Company.|$|E
30|$|Currently, the {{separation}} efficiency of rough cyclone separators {{is more than}} 98  %. Research has reduced the oil gas residence time by extending a rough vortex standpipe adjacent to the top cyclone entrance. The rough vortex dipleg operates with a positive pressure, which means part of the oil gas is also discharged through the dipleg with the pressure impact (the pressure in the dipleg is greater than that in the <b>disengager)</b> besides the dense-phase catalysts. The oil gas moves upward with a velocity of 0.1  m/s, through the 10  m of trip, and then enters the top cyclone.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses Braithwaite's motivational posturing {{framework}} {{to explain how}} individuals react to encounters with regulatory authorities. Of interest is whether procedural justice can reduce defiance and improve self-reported compliance among individuals who are either resistant or dismissive of regulatory authority. Using longitudinal survey data collected from tax offenders (Study 1), and individuals who had a recent police-citizen interaction (Study 2), it will be shown that procedural justice can promote compliance behavior. Procedural justice is also found to be effective for reducing resistant forms of defiance over time, but not dismissive defiance. Further, the results reveal that neither resistant defiance nor dismissive defiance moderate the effect of procedural justice on compliance, suggesting procedural justice works equally well for both low and high resisters and low and high <b>disengagers.</b> Finally, an unexpected result reveals that resistance, but not dismissive defiance, mediates the effect of procedural justice on self-reported compliance behavior. The findings have implications for procedural justice research and for the regulation of defiance. Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Criminology and Criminal JusticeNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the factors driving interest in two agroforestry practices, riparian buffers and forest farming. Because agroforestry is outside main stream commodity production in US agriculture, {{the purpose is}} to evaluate a framework to understand attitudes. The framework incorporates Pierre Bourdieu's notions of "habitus" and "field" along with individual economic and demographic characteristics of farm operators' traditionally used in adoption studies. Four attitudes are analyzed: <b>disengagers,</b> conservatives, lifestyle, and accumulators. A Logit regression measures the effects of respondents' attitudes, and other internal and external factors to assess interest in each practice. The data used is from a household survey of 364 farm-operators from the Fox Wyaconda watershed in northeast Missouri and Scott County in southeast Missouri gathered in 1999. Findings show that a conservative or a lifestyle attitude, are significant, with high probability of being interested in riparian buffers. Those with an accumulator or a lifestyle attitude have a significant and high probability of being interested in forest farming. Other variables also significant in riparian buffer interest are knowledge of agroforestry, and interest in alternative farming practices, and especially having perceptions of erosion problems. In forest farming, a high value of farm and assets has a negative effect, while belonging to informal groups has a positive effect pointing to characteristics that do not belong to traditional farmers. adoption, attitudes, forest farming, habitus, interest, riparian, Institutional and Behavioral Economics,...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Through a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{simulation}} of the particle laden {{flow of the}} two stages of a Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) High Temperature Regenerator (HTR), new designs for the particle distributor in the combustor stage and the arm <b>disengagers</b> in the regenerator stage that improved the HTR performance were proposed. The simulations involved 580 thousand cells for the combustor and 1. 5 million cells for the regenerator and were conducted with the commercial CFD software package Fluent 15. 0 using an Euler-Euler model and a phase-coupled SIMPLE algorithm. Athorough analysis of a 298 -hole air distributor conducted prior to the combustor simulation, set the air flow boundary conditions of the 22 m high and 3. 2 m diameter combustor. After the evaluation of several drag models available in the literature, the Modified model with cluster diameters of 400 m and 200 m for the dense and dilute phases, respectively, reproduced the theoretical characteristics of the turbulent bed that is typical of HTR combustors. The same drag model also reproduced the bubbling bed that is reported for the regenerator stage of HTRs. An analysis of the solid distribution showed that when solids enter the reactor through simple inlets located at opposite locations, the solid distribution is poor. However, when a two-arm, solid distributor that includes six lateral and a central inlet is implemented, the solid distribution improves, as the mal-distribution coefficient (Mf) decreases from 0. 31 to 0. 22 in the most critical region of the dense phase. Improvements in {{the characteristics of the}} Residence Time Distribution (RTD) {{and the size of the}} bed are also evidence of the benefits that the new proposed combustor design gives to the HTR performance. For the regenerator stage of the HTR the CFD simulation revealed the existence of a high-velocity field surrounding the solid disengangers that transport the solid from the combustor. This high velocity contributed to a relatively high solid flow through the cyclones, 42...|$|R
30|$|Fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC), {{one of the}} most important conversion processes used in petroleum refineries, transforms the low-value heavy crude oil into a variety of high-value-added light oil products. Up to now, the total capacity of FCC units (FCCUs) in China has reached 150 Mt/a, of which the outputs roughly account for 70  %, 40  % and 30  % of gasoline, propylene and diesel pools, respectively. However, in recent years, the reaction temperature and cracking degree have increased to a large extent with the feedstocks becoming heavier and inferior. As a result, the incidental high coke formation rate may threaten the operation safety in some refineries. Two factors contribute to the coke formation: (1) long residence time of the mixture of oil, gas and catalysts in the separator and (2) the severe back-mixing of oil gas in the <b>disengager</b> (Li et al. 2011; Karthika et al. 2012; Xu 2014; Gao et al. 2013; Dong et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2016). To solve these problems, a series of efficient separation systems at the riser outlet have been developed. These separation systems concentrate on separating the production and catalysts as soon as possible. Besides, they should reduce the residence time of oil gas in the reaction systems (gas–solid separation unit and <b>disengager)</b> simultaneously. Technologies which can simultaneously realize quick mixture separation and reduce oil gas residence time in the reaction system have been studied. Results show that the separation systems have brought huge economic benefit for chemical industries all around the world.|$|E
40|$|This study extends our {{understanding}} of relationship dissolution by conceptualising the link between national culture and dissolution communication strategies. A single case study of the management of relationship dissolution with Chinese partners was conducted, from an interpretive Western perspective, focusing on the German disengaging company and an Australian pilot survey. Results suggest that even minimal cultural sensitivity to the disengagee {{may result in a}} less damaging dissolution outcome for the <b>disengager</b> by avoiding blaming the disengagee and discussing issues collectively. International managers need to employ culturally sensitive dissolution strategies when dealing with international partners in order to minimise negative impacts and leave options open for a future re-establishment of the relationship, thereby achieving a "culturally sensitive dissolution"...|$|E
30|$|The {{residue fluid}} {{catalytic}} cracking unit (RFCCU) of Khartoum Refinery Company (KRC) uses conradson carbon residue and metal-contaminated feedstocks (such as atmospheric residue or mixtures of vacuum residue and gas oils) to produce more valuable products (especially gasoline) using active zeolite catalyst in a circulating fluidized bed [1]. In the RFCCU, the oil feed and dispersion steam enter the catalytic riser reactor together with the regenerated catalyst, where cracking of vacuum residue into lighter hydrocarbons starts as it contacts the hot regenerated catalyst from the regenerator. The regenerated catalyst is made to rise by steam introduced {{at the base of}} the riser reactor between the regenerator and the feed inlet point. The vaporized feed and the catalyst pass through the riser reactor into <b>disengager</b> for cracked products and catalyst separation. During the cracking process, coke is deposited on the catalyst, and the spent catalyst flows down by gravity into the regenerator, where air is used to burn off the coke deposited on the catalyst in a combustion environment so that it is returned to a stable state for catalysing the cracking reaction. The hot regenerated catalyst is then re-injected into the base of the riser reactor [2]. The complexity of the typical FCCU feed makes it extremely difficult to characterize and describe the inherent kinetics at a molecular level. In this way, similar components are grouped into lumps. Therefore, lumping scheme has been used to study the reactions involved in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. To give an insight into a comprehensive prediction of products’ distribution, there is an increasing number of lumps of the proposed models for catalytic cracking reactions [3]. In the first kinetic model of Weekman [4, 5] for catalytic cracking of heavy oil, three lumps were identified as gas oil (feedstock), gasoline, and light gas[*]+[*]coke as products, without incorporating diffusion characteristics of solid and gas phases. Lee et al. [6, 7] modified the three-lump model by splitting the light gas[*]+[*]coke lump into two different lumps of C 1 –C 4 gas and coke; therefore, resulting in the four-lump model for catalytic cracking of heavy oil. Corella and Frances [8] developed a five-lump model, in which the gas oil lump was divided into its heavy and light fractions. Different modified versions of five-lump model were developed by Dupain et al. [9], Kraemer et al. [10], and Ancheyta et al. [11]. Other proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil include: 6 -lump [1, 12, 13, 14, 15], 8 -lump [16], 10 -lump [17, 18], 11 -lump [19], 13 -lump [20], 14 -lump [21], and 19 -lump [22], without taking cognisance of diffusion resistance. A comprehensive review was presented by Pinheiro et al. [23] on the subject of {{fluid catalytic cracking}} process modelling, simulation, and control. Obviously, the number of lumps of the proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil may be increased to obtain more detailed descriptions of the catalytic cracking reactions and product distribution [24, 25]. However, sparing kinetic investigations have been carried out with the incorporation of diffusion resistances. Taking into account mass and heat transfer resistances between the reacting fluid and solid phases helps with conceiving the lump concentration on the catalyst surface as well as temperature profiles of the fluid and solid phases. Flinger et al. [26] considered mass transfer between the fluid and solid phases in the FCCU-riser reactor model equation. Gupta and Subba Rao [27] and Nayak et al. [28] applied the relationship for Sherwood number proposed by Ranz and Marshall [29] in their model to demonstrate the effects of mass transfer. The lump concentration within the catalyst is reduced by intraparticle mass transfer. In this way, the presence of an internal concentration gradient reduces the average rate of cracking [30]. Pruski et al. [31] validated adsorption coefficients for the four-lump model of catalytic cracking of gas oil. Bidabehere and Sedran [32] set up a model to investigate the impacts of diffusion, adsorption, and reaction at high temperature inside commercial FCC catalyst pellets and analysed the significance of these phenomenon. Dupain et al. [9] discussed external and internal mass transfer relationships utilised for FCC riser.|$|E
