25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their <b>job,</b> <b>I</b> doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

At the age of13, he co-wrote a rough draft of Superbad with childhood friend Evan Goldberg, whom he had met at bar mitzvah classes. Based on their teenage experiences, Rogen and Goldberg spent the rest of their time in high school polishing the script. They initially worried that American Pie (1999) had beaten them to the idea for the movie, but they decided that the film [...] "managed to totally avoid all honest interaction between characters... which is what we're going for." ...|$|E

General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting {{a little bit more of}} a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better <b>job...</b> <b>I</b> can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win.
