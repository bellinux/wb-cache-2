5|$|His mysticism is {{informed}} by the influences of Böhme and Franckenberg {{as well as of}} prominent writers Meister Eckhart (1260–1327), Johannes Tauler (–1361), Heinrich Suso (–1366), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293/4–1381). Critic and literary theorist Georg Ellinger surmised <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> Silesius that his poetry was influenced by loneliness (especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life), ungoverned impulsivity, and lack of personal fulfillment, rendering much of his poetry confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle {{outlined}} the approaches, conclusions and models Gottesman used <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenia. He co-wrote {{the book with}} James Shields, who died before it was published. The book introduces methods for diagnosing schizophrenia in a research setting, taking into account national differences in how the disorder was defined, debunked myths such as the mother transmitting schizophrenia, and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range.|$|E
5|$|Willard Spiegelman, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> Romantic poetry, {{suggests}} that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator's reluctance to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation. Some critics provide other explanations, and William Ober claims that Keats's description of indolence may have arisen {{from the use of}} opium.|$|E

5|$|They {{are named}} after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German {{engineer}} who pioneered {{the study of}} machines for translating one type of motion into another, and who used Reuleaux triangles in his designs. However, these shapes were known before his time, for instance by the designers of Gothic church windows, by Leonardo da Vinci, who used it for a map projection, and by Leonhard Euler <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> constant-width shapes. Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, pencils, and drill bits for drilling square holes, {{as well as in}} graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.|$|E
5|$|Under {{this new}} ownership, Mary Celeste sailed {{mainly in the}} West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, {{regularly}} losing money. Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of St. Helena, where she had called to seek medical assistance for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging {{the idea that the}} ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold the Mary Celeste to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship's port of registration changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{spent the}} summer after college in the San Juan {{volcanic}} field of Colorado working with volcanologist Pete Lipman <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> two extinct calderas. This work became {{the inspiration for the}} first phase of his graduate work at the University of Washington in Seattle, in which he focused on the Oligocene Cimarron andesitic volcanic complex in the western San Juans. Johnston's reconstruction of the eruptive history of the extinct volcanoes prepared him to study active volcanoes. Johnston's first experience with active volcanoes was a geophysical survey of Mount Augustine in Alaska in 1975. When Mount Augustine erupted in 1976, Johnston raced back to Alaska, shunting his former work on the Cimmaron Volcano into a master's thesis, and making Mount Augustine the focus of his Ph.D. work. He graduated in 1978 with his Ph.D., having shown that (1) the emplacement mechanism of the pyroclastic flows had changed over time, as they became less pumaceous, (2) the magmas contained high quantities of volatile water, chlorine, and sulfur, and (3) underground mixing of the felsic (silicic) magmas with less-viscous mafic (basaltic) magmas could have triggered eruptions. Mount Augustine was also the site of an early near-disaster for Johnston, when he became trapped on the mountain during an eruption after high winds grounded the first two evacuation aircraft.|$|E

25|$|John Mather {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} multijet. Loosely speaking, a multijet is a finite list of jets over different base-points. Mather proved the multijet transversality theorem, which he used <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> stable mappings.|$|E

25|$|He cites Fritz Leiber, an {{important}} sword and sorcery pioneer, {{as an author}} who writes fantasy that is not escapist and contains meaningful themes. These views can be found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> epic fantasy, Wizardry and Wild Romance (Gollancz, 1987) which was revised and reissued by MonkeyBrain Books in 2004—its first U.S. edition catalogued by ISFDB.|$|E

25|$|With Elmer Rees, Atiyah {{studied the}} problem of the {{relation}} between topological and holomorphic vector bundles on projective space. They solved the simplest unknown case, by showing that all rank 2 vector bundles over projective 3-space have a holomorphic structure. Horrocks had previously found some non-trivial examples of such vector bundles, which were later used by Atiyah <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> instantons on the 4-sphere.|$|E

25|$|Even <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> medicine, {{and through}} his {{clinical}} course, Schweitzer pursued {{the ideal of}} the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work, he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911. His medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus, The Psychiatric Study of Jesus. In June 1912, he married Helene Bresslau, municipal inspector for orphans and daughter of the Jewish pan-Germanist historian Harry Bresslau.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with their Korean counterparts, executions {{committed by the}} Chinese are rather few in number. But according to author Kevin Mahoney <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the PVA, executions of POWs did occur during {{the heat of the}} battle. Most of the executions appear to be committed by the lower commands without the upper echelons' knowledge, and it is often carried out to prevent the future escapes or rescues of the POWs.|$|E
