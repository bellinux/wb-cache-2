2500|$|That autumn, in {{an attempt}} to save his marriage, Frédéric {{returned}} to Paris with Alice; he was unsuccessful. Alice visited Frédéric's mother: revealing that {{she was in love with}} de Trafford, she asked her help in obtaining a divorce. Her mother-in-law advised her to think of her two daughters and do nothing she might later regret. Alice soon returned to Kenya and her lover. Hoping to keep Alice's extramarital affair from becoming a scandal, her mother-in-law loaned Alice a <b>furnished</b> <b>flat</b> in a quiet street in Paris to use as a [...] "love nest" [...] with de Trafford. Under pressure by his family, Frédéric quickly sued for divorce.|$|E
60|$|While the {{mistress}} of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, {{take a look at}} the home. A <b>furnished</b> <b>flat</b> at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.|$|E
60|$|The fourth {{address was}} a <b>{{furnished}}</b> <b>flat</b> without a kitchen, {{in a house}} with a general restaurant. The fifth was a furnished house. At the sixth a pathetic widow and her pretty daughter wanted to take a family to board, and would give them a private table at a rate which the Marches would have thought low in Boston.|$|E

Still to {{the man at the}} bottom of a pit the fellow on top, in the sunlight, is a king, and to Crane my brother and I were at least dukes.|$|E

We shall {{not have any}} trouble. We can easily find some one who is going South for the winter and {{will be glad to}} give up their flat 'to the right party' at a nominal rent. That's my notion. That's what the Evanses did one winter when they came on here in February. All but the nominality of the rent." ...|$|E
2500|$|The large {{influx of}} Sudanese {{refugees}} in Egypt {{beginning in the}} late 1990s led to an increase in rent prices and a higher cost of living for refugees as well as social tensions between the natives and Sudanese not experienced during the past influxes in the 1980s. [...] The increased rent prices burdened the Sudanese refugees particularly because they must pay for more expensive <b>furnished</b> <b>flats,</b> unlike natives who have the right to own property.|$|R

6000|$|The {{lady who}} {{followed}} him also {{told us a}} sad story of misplaced trust. She also was comic--so the programme assured us. The humorist appears to have no luck. She had lent her lover {{money to buy the}} ring, and the licence, and to <b>furnish</b> the <b>flat.</b> He did buy the ring, and he <b>furnished</b> the <b>flat,</b> but it was for another lady. The audience roared. I have heard it so often asked, [...] "What is humour?" [...] From observation, I should describe it as other people's troubles.|$|R
60|$|The Maxwells went to New York {{early in}} October, {{and took a}} little <b>furnished</b> <b>flat</b> for the winter on the West Side, between two streets among the Eighties. It was in a new apartment-house, rather fine on the outside, and its {{balconies}} leaned caressingly towards the tracks of the Elevated Road, whose trains steamed back and forth under them night and day. At first they thought it rather noisy, but their young nerves were strong, and they soon ceased {{to take note of}} the uproar, even when the windows were open.|$|E
60|$|Through the curtained {{windows of}} the <b>furnished</b> <b>flat</b> which Mrs. Horace Hignett had rented for her stay in New York, rays of golden {{sunlight}} peeped in like the foremost spies of some advancing army. It was a fine summer morning. The hands of the Dutch clock in the hall pointed to thirteen minutes past nine; those of the ormolu clock in the sitting-room to eleven minutes past ten; those of the carriage clock on the bookshelf to fourteen minutes to six. In other words, it was exactly eight; and Mrs. Hignett acknowledged the fact by moving {{her head on the}} pillow, opening her eyes, and sitting up in bed. She always woke at eight precisely.|$|E
6000|$|It was, after all, an {{unrecorded}} tragedy. In {{an obscure}} {{corner of the}} morning papers one learned the next day that a Frenchman, who had apparently {{come to the end}} of his means, had committed suicide in a <b>furnished</b> <b>flat</b> in Shaftesbury Avenue. Two foreigners were deported without having been brought up for trial, for being suspected persons. A little languid interest was aroused at the inquest when one of the witnesses deposed to the deceased having been a famous French criminal. Nothing further transpired, however, and the readers of the halfpenny press for once were deprived of their sensation. For the rest, Peter received, with much satisfaction, a remarkably handsome signet ring, bearing some famous arms, and a telegram from Sogrange: [...] "Well done, Baron! May the successful termination of your enterprise nerve you for the greater undertaking which is close at hand. I leave for London by the night train.--SOGRANGE." ...|$|E

And then a fool took me out the wrong way to show me a special line in sleeping-socks. I told him I was not {{requiring}} any. He said he didn't want me to buy, he only wanted me to see them. No wonder the drapers have had to start luncheon and tea-rooms. They'll fix up small <b>furnished</b> <b>flats</b> soon, where a woman can live for a week." ...|$|R

30|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{campaign}} was announced and the first conservation tools bag handed out on February 10, 2004. A {{total of more than}} 34  million conservation tools were distributed to around 18  million residents, which is equivalent to 80  % of occupied residences (MOWE 2012). The water conservations tools bag includes water saving showerheads and faucets, 3 -l sized toilet-tank-bank replacement bags, and leak detection pills. This campaign is considered to be the largest water conservation campaign {{of its kind in the}} world in terms of quantity and quality. The average savings have been 30  % of house water consumption, which is estimated to be 524, 000  m 3 /day (MOWE 2012). The expected annual financial saving resulting from the installation of these tools is estimated at about SAR 900 million (MOWE 2012). The second stage that targeted public sector facilities such as government buildings, schools, mosques, parks, and airports was inaugurated on March 15, 2005. Almost 2.1 million conservation tools were distributed and installed (MOWE 2012). The third stage that targeted the private sector facilities such as hotels, <b>furnished</b> <b>flats,</b> and residential compounds was inaugurated on September 21, 2005. More than 2.5 million conservation tools were distributed and installed (MOWE 2012). In the fourth stage, private sector facilities such as hotels, <b>furnished</b> <b>flats,</b> and residential compounds were targeted. A number of sale points were opened for distributing the water saving showerheads at a nominal price to encourage their usage by the public. More than 592, 000 water saving showerheads have been distributed and installed (MOWE 2012).|$|R
60|$|When {{you have}} taken your <b>furnished</b> <b>flat,</b> the same agency will provide you a cook at ten or twelve dollars a month, a maid at seven dollars, a lady's maid at eight or nine dollars, and so on; the cook will prefer to sleep out of the house. Then will come the {{question}} of provisions, and these seem really to be dear in Rome. Meats and vegetables both are dear, and game and poultry. Beef will be forty cents a pound, and veal and mutton in proportion; a chicken which has been banting for the table from its birth will be forty cents; eggs which have not yet taken active shape are twenty-five and thirty cents throughout winters so bland that a hen of any heart can hardly keep from laying every day. I am afraid I am no authority on butter and milk, and groceries I {{do not know the}} prices of; but coffee ought to be cheap, for nobody drinks anything but substitutes more or less unabashed.|$|E
60|$|They {{went to a}} quiet hotel far down-town, {{and took}} a small {{apartment}} which {{they thought they could}} easily afford for the day or two they need spend in looking up a <b>furnished</b> <b>flat.</b> They were used to staying at this hotel when they came on for a little outing in New York, after some rigid winter in Boston, {{at the time of the}} spring exhibitions. They were remembered there from year to year; the colored call-boys, who never seemed to get any older, smiled upon them, and the clerk called March by name even before he registered. He asked if Mrs. March were with him, and said then he supposed they would want their usual quarters; and in a moment they were domesticated in a far interior that seemed to have been waiting for them in a clean, quiet, patient disoccupation ever since they left it two years before. The little parlor, with its gilt paper and ebonized furniture, was the lightest of the rooms, but it was not very light at noonday without the gas, which the bell-boy now flared up for them. The uproar of the city came to it in a soothing murmur, and they took possession of its peace and comfort with open celebration. After all, they agreed, there was no place in the world so delightful as a hotel apartment like that; the boasted charms of home were nothing to it; and then the magic of its being always there, ready for any one, every one, just as if it were for some one alone: it was like the experience of an Arabian Nights hero come true for all the race.|$|E
6000|$|Oh if {{you could}} only have the real right thing to {{miraculously}} propose to me, you and Miss Bradley, when I see you on Tuesday at 4.30! For you see, by this bolting in horror and loathing (but don't repeat those expressions!) from Rye for the winter, my situation suddenly becomes special and difficult; and largely through this, that having got {{back to work and}} to a very particular job, the need of expressing myself, of pushing it on, on the old Remingtonese terms, grows daily stronger within me. But I haven't a seat and temple for the Remington and its priestess--can't have here at this club, {{and on the other hand}} can't now organize a permanent or regular and continuous footing for the London winter, which means something unfurnished and taking (wasting, now) time and thought. I want a small, very cheap and very clean <b>furnished</b> <b>flat</b> or trio of rooms etc. (like the one we talked of under the King's Cross delusion--only better and with some, a very few, tables and chairs and fireplaces,) that I could hire for 2 or 3--3 or 4--months to drive ahead my job in--the Remington priestess and I converging and meeting there morning by morning--and it being preferably nearer to her than to me; though near tubes and things for both of us! I must keep on this place for food and bed etc.--I have it by the year--till I really have something else by the year--for winter purposes--to supersede it (Lamb House abides, for long summers.) Your researches can have only been for the unfurnished--but look, think, invent! Two or three decent little tabled and chaired and lighted rooms would do. I catch a train till Monday, probably late. But on Tuesday! ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{has seemed}} to me that there are not so many hotels garnis in Rome as there used to be in Italian cities, but they, too, abound in {{pleasant}} streets, and the stranger who has a fancy for lodgings with breakfast in his rooms, and likes to browse about for his luncheon and dinner, will easily suit himself. If it comes to taking a furnished apartment for the season, there is much range in price and much choice in place. The agents who have them to let will begin, rather dismayingly, [...] "Oh, apartments in Rome are very dear." [...] But you learn on inquiry that a <b>furnished</b> <b>flat</b> in the Ludovisi region, in a house with a lift and full sun, may be had for two hundred dollars a month. From this height the rents of palatial apartments soar to such lonely peaks as eight hundred and sink to such levels as a hundred and twenty or a hundred; and for this you have linen and silver and all the movables and utensils you want, as well as several vast rooms opening wastefully from one to another till you reach the salon. The rents of the like flats, if vacant, would be a quarter or a third less, though again the agents begin by telling you that there is very little difference between the rents of furnished and unfurnished flats. The flats are in every part of the old town and the new; and some are in noble sixteenth and seventeenth century palaces, such as we are accustomed to at home only in the theatre. My own experience is that everybody, especially in houses where there are no lifts, lives on the top floor. You pass many other floors in going up, but you are left to believe that nobody lives on them. When you reach the inhabited levels, you find them charming inside for their state and beauty, and outside for their magnificent view, which may be pretty confidently relied upon to command the dome of St. Peter's. That magnificent stone bubble seems to blow all round the horizon.|$|E

He had indeed some moments of regret that Lady Harman wouldn't {{go into that}} picture. She was different--if only in her simplicity. There was something about these others that put them whole worlds apart from her, who was held so tethered from all furtive adventure by her filmy tentacles of responsibility, her ties and strands of relationship, her essential delicacy. That momentary vision of Ellen as the Countess Martin broke up into absurdities directly {{he looked at it}} fully and steadfastly. From thinking of the two women as similar types he passed into thinking of them as opposites; Thérèse, hard, clear, sensuous, secretive, trained by a brilliant tradition in the technique of connubial betrayal, was the very antithesis of Ellen's vague but invincible veracity and openness.

40|$|Renormalizable SO(10) grand unified {{theories}} (GUTs), {{extended by}} O(N_g) _F family gauge symmetry, generate minimal supersymmetric Standard Model flavour structure dynamically via vacuum expectation values of "Yukawon" Higgs multiplets. For concrete illustration and calculability, {{we work with}} the fully realistic minimal supersymmetric GUTs based on the 210 ⊕ 126 ⊕ 126 GUT Higgs system - which were already parameter counting minimal relative to other realistic models. SO(10) fermion Higgs channels 126, 10 (120) extend to symmetric(antisymmetric) representations of O(N_g) _F, while 210, 126 are symmetric. N_g= 3 dynamical Yukawa generation reduces the matter fermion Yukawas from 15 to 3 (21 to 5) without (with) the 120 Higgs. Yukawon GUTs are thus ultraminimal in parameter counting terms. Consistent symmetry breaking is ensured by a hidden sector Bajc-Melfo(BM) superpotential {{with a pair of}} symmetric O(N_g) multiplets ϕ,S, of which the latter's singlet part S_s breaks supersymmetry and the traceless part Ŝ <b>furnishes</b> <b>flat</b> directions to cancel the O(N_g) D-term contributions of the visible sector. Novel dark matter candidates linked to flavour symmetry arise from both the BM sector and GUT sector minimal supersymmetric Standard Model singlet pseudo-Goldstones. These relics may be viable light(< 50 GeV) cold dark matter as reported by DAMA/LIBRA. In contrast to the new minimal supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory (NMSGUT) even sterile neutrinos can appear in certain branches of the flavour symmetry breaking without the tuning of couplings.
