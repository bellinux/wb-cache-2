25|$|The Soviet {{plan called}} for the 5th and 6th Guards Armies, and the 53rd Army, to attack on a 30-kilometer wide sector, {{supported}} by a heavy artillery concentration, and break through the five successive German defensive lines between Kursk and Kharkov. The former two armies had borne {{the brunt of the}} German attack in Operation Citadel. Supported by two additional mobile corps, the 1st Tank Army and the 5th Guards Tank Army, both mostly reequipped after the end of Operation Citadel, would act as the front's mobile groups and develop the breakthrough by encircling Kharkov from the north and west. Mikhail Katukov's 1st Tank Army was to form the westward-facing outer encirclement line, while Pavel Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army would form the <b>inner</b> <b>line,</b> facing the city. A secondary attack {{to the west of the}} main breakthrough was to be conducted by the 27th and 40th Armies with the support of four separate tank corps. Meanwhile, to the east and southeast, the 69th and 7th Guards Armies, followed later by the Southwestern Front's 57th Army, were to join the attack.|$|E
25|$|In {{the major}} but {{moderately}} successful campaign of 1552, two armies took {{the eastern part}} of central Hungary, pushing the borders of the Ottoman Empire to the second (<b>inner)</b> <b>line</b> of northern végvárs (border castles), which Hungary originally built as defence against an expected second Mongol invasion—hence, afterwards, borders on this front changed little. For Hungarians, the 1552 campaign was a series of tragic losses and some heroic (but pyrrhic) victories, which entered folklore—most notably the fall of Drégely (a small fort defended to the last man by just 146 men), and the Siege of Eger. The latter was a major végvár with more than 2,000 men, without outside help. They faced two Ottoman armies, which were surprisingly unable to take the castle within five weeks. (The fort was later taken in 1596.) Finally, the 1556 campaign secured Ottoman influence over Transylvania (which had fallen under Habsburg control for a time), while failing to gain any ground on the western front, being tied down in the second (after 1555) unsuccessful siege of the southwestern Hungarian border castle of Szigetvár.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, New Tavern Fort {{underwent}} major reconstructions, {{though it}} retained its basic plan and earthworks. The gun emplacements were modernised in 1848 to install platforms for traversing guns, and further magazines were built. Further upgrades were soon needed. By {{the end of}} the 1850s, Britain and France were engaged in a naval arms race. A new class of ironclad ships with powerful rifled muzzle loader (RML) guns, exemplified by the British HMS Warrior and the French La Gloire, posed a substantial threat to existing coastal defences. In response, the British government established a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom to review the defences and make recommendations on improvements. Noting the importance of the Thames and its vulnerability to seaborne attack, the Commission advocated in its report in 1860 that two principal lines of defence should be established along the Thames. Three forts would be constructed or rebuilt - Shornemead Fort and Cliffe Fort in Kent and Coalhouse Fort in Essex - to provide an outer line of defence, with further forts and batteries protecting key sites further downriver. The <b>inner</b> <b>line</b> of defence would be provided by Tilbury Fort and New Tavern Fort.|$|E

40|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> {{concept is}} a method to prevent water leakage {{and the risk of}} icing inside tunnels and is {{frequently}} used in countries with cold climate. Blocks of falling ice may result is a severe safety risk in both road and railway tunnels. Although several established <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> systems exist, finding the optimal solution considering function, maintenance- and investment cost is a challenging task. A new system has recently been used in Sweden and is due to its success planned to be used for the Stockholm Bypass, an 18 km road tunnel project in Stockholm. A set of design criterions has been stipulated for the <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> system. In this paper, the case of impact loading from falling rocks is studied. The <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> system is required to withstand the impact of a 600 kg block landing on a square surface of 0. 2 x 0. 2 m. The free fall height, i. e. the distance to the rock surface, is typically less than 0. 5 m but may span up to 1. 5  m in some cases. A too conservative design may result in an unnecessary thick structure and lack of knowledge of the impact phenomena may result in an unsafe design. An extensive experimental program has been performed, consisting of representative parts of the <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> system. A mass of 600 kg is dropped onto the structure and the results are compared with numerical simulations. The experiments show that the current system is rather ductile but that local concrete fallouts may occur at extreme free fall heights. QC 20150617 </p...|$|R
25|$|Condé-sur-l'Escaut {{occupies}} a strategic location at {{the confluence of}} the Scheldt (Escaut) and Haine Rivers. The Romans recognized this when they founded a town at the site. Subsequent residents fortified the location so {{that by the end of}} the Middle Ages, Condé was defended by a stone wall with towers surrounded by a moat. The Spanish first tried to modernize the defenses in 1654, but the town was captured by the French general Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne the following year. After the French returned Condé by the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, the Spanish converted the town into a fortress. They built a new bastioned trace around the town, outside the old wall which was kept as an <b>inner</b> <b>line.</b> Originally, the new defenses were constructed of earth, but in 1666, the bastions on the west side were revetted with stone. On the south side, a hornwork was built to protect the old town castle. In case of attack, the defenders could easily flood the ditch with water from the rivers. In April 1676 a French army laid siege to the town. Condé was ceded to France by the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678. Fortifications expert Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban greatly improved the defenses on the east side, adding two demi-bastions and a full bastion. He also constructed sluice gates so that the garrison could control the depth of the water in the ditches and flood areas on the east side. Outside the fortress, Vauban built five square redoubts in order to keep an attacker away from the main defenses as long as possible. The fortress was undisturbed during the wars of King Louis XIV. The engineer Pierre du Buat made some alterations to Condé in the 1770s.|$|E
25|$|Along {{the north}} and east sides of Corinth, about two miles from the town, was a line of entrenchments, {{extending}} from the Chewalla Road on the northwest to the Mobile and Ohio Railroad on the south, that had been constructed by Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard's army before it evacuated the town in May. These lines were too extensive for Rosecrans's 23,000 men to defend, so with the approval of Grant, Rosecrans modified the lines to emphasize the defense of the town and the ammunition magazines near the junction of the two railroads. The <b>inner</b> <b>line</b> of redoubts, closer to the town, called the Halleck Line, was much more substantial. A number of formidable named batteries, guns positioned in strong earthwork defenses, were part of the inner line: Batteries Robinett, Williams, Phillips, Tannrath, and Lothrop, in the area known as College Hill. They were connected by breastworks, and during the last four days of September these works had been strengthened, and the trees {{in the vicinity of the}} centrally placed Battery Robinett had been felled to form an abatis. Rosecrans's plan was to absorb the expected Confederate advance with a skirmish line at the old Confederate entrenchments and to then meet the bulk of the Confederate attack with his main force along the Halleck Line, about a mile from the center of town. His final stand would be made around the batteries on College Hill. His men were provided with three days' rations and 100 rounds of ammunition. Van Dorn was not aware of the strength of his opponent, who had prudently called in two reinforcing divisions from the Army of the Tennessee to deal with the difficulty of assaulting these prepared positions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Inner</b> <b>lining</b> {{system in}} tunnels {{is a method}} to prevent water ingress and forming of ice in the traffic area. A {{solution}} that is common in Norway is based on stretching a sealing membrane between rock anchorages that forms a gap to the primary rock strengthening. The membrane is in turn protected by a layer of shotcrete towards the traffic area. The rock strengthening is designed to resist all loads from the rock mass independent of the <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> system. A problem is however how to perform inspections and conditional assessment of the rock strengthening, since the gap is usually small. Other topics are what loads the <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> system should be designed for. In TRVK Tunnel 11, the load of a local falling rock of 600  kg is stipulated, assuming to act on a surface of 0. 2 × 0. 2 m. Furthermore, the <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> system should be designed to resist what is connoted as an extreme rock load of 6 metric ton, acting on a 1 × 1 m area, even when a primary rock strengthening is present. Similar <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> systems {{have been used in}} e. g. Norra länken, parts of Citybanan in Stockholm and is planned to be used for the Stockholm Bypass project. In the present paper, results from a recent research project are presented, aiming at investigating the structural manner of action of the aforementioned <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> system. A series of concrete slabs have been tested, both until static failure and with a 600  kg drop weight from different heights. All tested slabs resulted in flexural failure and showed a significant ductility. For several of the slabs tested for impact loading, significant spalling from the soffit was obtained, at the most corresponding to a mass of 16  kg. Three of the slabs tested for impact load were manufactured with an outer layer of steel fibre reinforced shotcrete. None of these slabs showed any significant spalling, despite a free fall height up to 2  m. Several FE-analyses have also been performed, accounting for the nonlinear material properties of concrete. The results showed good agreement with the conducted experiments, both regarding static loading, cracking and impact load. A similar analysis was also done for the whole <b>inner</b> <b>lining</b> system. The results showed a larger load capacity compared to the experiments, but still with a rather localised failure.
