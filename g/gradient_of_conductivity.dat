The fundamental understanding of the complicated electrokinetic phenomena in such crossing type microchannels therefore is necessary. In the literature, a few theoretical models studying the transport phenomena in similar crossing microchannels did not consider the spatial <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> <b>conductivity</b> due to its complexity. However, the spatial <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> <b>of</b> buffer solution often exist in many applications (i. e. pumping a large number of unknown species and stacking the interested sample species) and it was demonstrated that the presence <b>of</b> the <b>conductivity</b> <b>gradients</b> has significant influences on the on-chip microfluidic injection processes. A new theoretical model was developed in this paper to study the transport phenomena in crossing microchannels with the consideration of a large range <b>of</b> spatial <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> electric <b>conductivity.</b> This developed model was used to simulate the potential field, flow field, and concentration field of the injection processes where the <b>conductivity</b> <b>of</b> the sample-carrying buffer differs significantly from that of the driving buffer. The transport phenomena are found to be very sensitive to the conductivity difference between the sample-carrying buffer and the driving buffer.

30|$|One {{process that}} can change {{the height of the}} {{equatorial}} F layer is the vertical plasma drift. The equatorial vertical plasma drift is, in general, upward during daytime and downward at night, and the reversal from upward to downward occurs around 2000 LT. An important feature of the equatorial F region vertical plasma drift is the occurrence of a sharp increase of the upward velocity just before it reverses to downward (Fejer et al. 1991, 2008). This prereversal enhancement (PRE) of the vertical plasma drift is associated with an enhanced eastward electric field when the E region conductivity decreases rapidly immediately after sunset. Large PRE often occurs around equinox when the geomagnetic field lines are aligned with the sunset terminator, so the eastward polarization electric field becomes the strongest near the sharp horizontal <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>conductivity</b> (Tsunoda 1985). Empirical patterns of the PRE and its dependence on solar radio flux, season, longitude, and geomagnetic activity have been derived from measurements of the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar and satellites (Fejer et al. 1991, 2008).|$|E

The model tests show that when the <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>conductivity</b> in the poleward boundary becomes sharper, convection peaks appear around the poleward edge of the aurora. The model results have been confirmed by DMSP observations. Hundreds of large ion flow events are identified from one year DMSP observations, with flow speed larger than 500 m/s that occurred poleward of the aurora. Among them, 280 (74 %) events are found to be associated with conductivity gradient peaks. Most of the convection jets occur in winter when conductivity gradients are expected to be large. The convection jets tend to occur at later local times (21 : 00 – 22 : 00 MLT) at 70 &deg;– 72 &deg; MLat.

E. ischnus has replaced G. fasciatus as the dominant amphipod at some sites, while remaining inferior at other sites—even several years after invasion. We tested the effect of water chemistry (conductivity) {{on the outcome of}} interactions between these two species in the laboratory and in the river in 2006 and 2007. Field experiments involved transplanting both species to different sites along a <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>conductivity</b> within the river, whereas the laboratory experiments examined inter-specific predation in water collected from these sites. The laboratory experiments revealed that these spe-cies are mutual predators and their rate of predation on each other varies with conductivity; E. ischnus is the dominant predator at higher conductivity, while G. fasciatus dominates at lower conductivity. The field experiments showed interannual variation, but supported the lab results at high conductivity in 2006 and at low conductivity in 2007. E. ischnus was more sensitive than G. fasciatus to variation in conductiv-ity, which apparently mediates this invader’s ability to replace or dominate the native species in a heterogeneous environment...|$|E

Our goal is to understand the conditions for fast dissipation due to the Hall term in the induction equation. We study the interplay of Ohmic dissipation and Hall drift in order to find a timescale for the overall crustal field decay. We solve numerically the Hall induction equation by means of a hybrid method (spectral in angles but finite differences in the radial coordinate). The microphysical input consists of the most modern available crustal equation of state, composition and electrical conductivities. We present the first long term simulations of the non [...] linear magnetic field evolution in realistic neutron star crusts with a stratified electron number density and temperature dependent conductivity. We show that Hall drift influenced Ohmic dissipation takes place in neutron star crusts on a timescale of 1 Myr. When the initial magnetic field has magnetar strength, the fast Hall drift results in an initial rapid dissipation stage that lasts 10 - 50 kyr.

40|$|We {{attempted}} {{to develop a}} direct time-domain, finite-difference solution for the electromag-netic response of a 3 -D model. The algorithm {{is an extension of}} our 2 -D modelling technique, which uses the Du Fort-Frankel finite-difference scheme. However, the vector nature of the field makes the 3 -D problem much more complicated than its 2 -D counterpart, and a supercomputer is required for computations. Unlike the 2 -D case, where we solve for the electric field, the solution is formulated in terms of secondary magnetic field to avoid dealing with a discontinuous normal component of electric field. However, that difficulty is replaced with a problem involving the <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>conductivity,</b> which is discontinuous at interfaces. We experimented with both smoothing the conductivity variation, so that the gradient is well defined; and integrating the gradient terms, which results in a tangential current density contrast. Our limited experiments indicate that the magnetic field step response is computationally more stable than the impulse response, because it is a smoother function with smaller dynamic range. However, the step response takes longer to compute because its source, which involves the primary fields in the earth, requires very accurate numerical integration. Due to computer time and memory limitations on the supercomputer available to us, {{we were not able to}} develop an accurate numerical solution.

Overall alignment of the local self-assembled domains was also aimed. In films, anisotropic overall structure and conductivity are observed upon pressing the “melt ” samples between two glass plates.

40|$|The {{through-thickness}} {{thermal diffusivity}} can be {{evaluated by the}} classical flash method. If an homogeneous and extended source is used to irradiate the surface and a thermographic camera is used to monitor the temperature evolution of the opposite side, {{a map of the}} through-thickness thermal diffusivity can be obtained in a single experiment and without any contact with the sample under inspection. In order to measure the in-plane thermal diffusivity of a plate-like sample or in one of the principal directions of its plane, a thermal gradient across the plane of the material has to be settled. The ratio of the Fourier transform of temperature at two different spatial frequencies is an exponential function of time multiplied by the diffusivity in the considered principal direction. This can be used to evaluate the diffusivity in an homogenous material. In order to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio, it is better if heat is absorbed over a series of periodic parallel strips (grid flash method). When the material presents a transverse <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>conductivity,</b> we propose, as a first approach, to perform the Fourier analysis over a sliding window corresponding to one period of the grid pattern. This method allowed us to quantify insitu the diffusivity decrease in a tensile composite sample due to the stress-induced density increase of transverse microcracks. We finally analysed a more rigorous method for transverse conductivity profile inversion. It is based on a perturbation method. The analytical expression of the "transfer function" between the Fourier transform of the temperature contrast and the Fourier transform of conductivity was established.

40|$|Wireless {{communications}} use microwaves {{for fast}} and massive data transfer {{in our daily}} life. This thesis presents broadband absorbers, electromagnetic bandgap filters and invisibility cloaks as novel solutions to reduce electromagnetic (EM) interference phenomena responsible for many issues, ranging from simply annoying (e. g. "Wi-Fi drop out") to outright dangerous (e. g. "wrong transmission from health monitor in hospital" or "disruption of airport radar signal by wind turbine"). The studied structures consist of organised stacks of thin layers made of conductive nano-composite and dielectric polymer or ceramic substrate. As conductive fillers, we mainly use carbon nanotubes (CNT) and metallic magnetic nanowires (NW) because of their exceptional electrical properties and high aspect ratio, which allows reaching the electrical percolation threshold at very low concentration. By the nature and concentration of the fillers, we can control conductivity, permittivity and permeability of the composite films. By controlling orientation of the fillers during processing, we can impart anisotropic properties to the structures. A smart arrangement of the different layers is the key for a controlled absorption or propagation of the EM waves. Broadband absorption is obtained by a novel multilayer arrangement built from alternating films of dielectric polymer and conducting layers. The latter are stacked in a precise <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>conductivity.</b> The conducting layers consist of either PC-CNT nanocomposite films or a very thin CNT coating. Such multilayers effectively absorb electromagnetic waves from 8 to 67 GHz and probably higher despite their overall thickness {{much lower than the}} wavelength. The efficiency can further be enhanced with the help of submillimetric multilayers based on Nickel nanowires (Ni-NW) sandwiched between PC films. The magnetic response of Ni-NW contributes to enhanced attenuation of the incoming waves. Also based on a similar gradient organisation, anisotropic multilayers provide a route to polarisation-selective absorbers. The second objective of the research is to develop frequency-selective absorbers, also called electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) filters. The multilayer is now able to absorb a specified narrow frequency band or selectively reflect desired wavelengths within the GHz-range. The structures use ultra-thin conductive layers to generate a controlled resonance in homogenous high permittivity sheets. The basic structure is still composed of CNT deposits alternating between dielectric layers. The physical properties (i. e. relative permittivity and thickness) of the dielectric spacers generate narrow high-absorption bands at defined frequencies. Finally, we investigate the ability of multilayer structures to deviate microwaves around a reflective cylindrical obstacle and reconstruct the incoming wave front pattern behind, i. e. making the obstacle invisible. A cylindrical invisibility cloak requires fine tuning the effective permittivity, which has to grow in gradient from 0 to 1 from the inner to outer radius of the cloak. We have reached this purpose by successively stacking cylindrical polymer foam - CNT composite bilayers with precise thickness of the dielectric layers and precise conductivity of the conductive layers. Parameters of each bilayer are fine-tuned to get the effective permittivity required by theory. Despite some loss, our multilayers demonstrate significant capacity to reduce the distortion of the wavefront pattern behind the obstacle. (FSA - Sciences de l) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E

Low-cost LWA mainly comes from the recovery of vegetal or plastic wastes. This article focuses on the characterization <b>of</b> the thermal <b>conductivity</b> <b>of</b> innovative lightweight cementitious composites made with fine particles of rigid polyurethane (PU) foam waste. Five mortars were prepared with various mass substitution rates of cement with PU-foam particles. Their thermal conductivity was measured with two transient methods: the heating-film method and the hot-disk method. The incorporation of PU-foam particles causes a reduction of up to 18 % of the mortar density, accompanied by a significant improvement of the thermal insulating performance. The effect of segregation on the thermal properties of LWA mortars due to the differences of density among the cementitious matrix, sand, and LWA has also been quantified. The application of the hot-disk method reveals a <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> along the thickness of the specimens, which could be explained by a non-uniform repartition of fine PU-foam particles and mineral aggregates within the mortars.

The measurement system was validated using two calibration samples having thermal conductivities at both the upper and lower limit of the common range of nuclear fuels (1 - 10 W/m/K). Sources of experimental errors are discussed qualitatively and the uncertainty of the measurement system for the thermal <b>conductivity</b> range <b>of</b> interest is quantified. The measured error is found to be about 10...|$|R
2500|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) is {{a family}} of electrokinetic separation methods performed in submillimeter diameter capillaries and in micro- and nanofluidic channels. Very often, CE refers to capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), but other electrophoretic techniques including capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE), capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF), capillary isotachophoresis and micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) belong also to this class of methods. In CE methods, analytes migrate through electrolyte solutions {{under the influence of}} an electric field. Analytes can be separated according to ionic mobility and/or partitioning into an alternate phase via non-covalent interactions. Additionally, analytes may be concentrated or [...] "focused" [...] by means <b>of</b> <b>gradients</b> in <b>conductivity</b> and pH.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the solar wind with its inherent interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the geomagnetic field sets up a large-scale plasma circulation in the Earth's magnetosphere and the magnetically tightly connected ionosphere. The ionospheric ion drift at polar latitudes accelerates the neutral gas as a nondivergent momentum source primarily in force balance with pressure gradients, which are mainly directed from afternoon to midnight. The high-latitude neutral wind circulation is essentially modified by apparent forces due to Earth's rotation (Coriolis and centrifugal forces), while advection and viscous forces can significantly contribute. The apparent forces affect the dawn and dusk side asymmetrically, favoring a large dusk-side neutral wind vortex that dominates over the dawn-side vorticity cell. The IMF By component induces additional dawn-dusk differences in both ion drift and neutral wind patterns. Nonuniformities and steep <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> the ionospheric <b>conductivity</b> can further modify locally the ionospheric convection and neutral wind circulation. Feedback effects of the neutral wind dynamics and its embedded ionosphere modify {{to a certain degree}} the large-scale magnetospheric convection, which includes dawn-dusk asymmetries of their behavior...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the world, {{epidemiological}} studies were established {{to examine the}} relationship between air pollution and mortality rates and adverse respiratory health effects. However, despite the years of discussion the correlation between adverse health effects and atmospheric pollution remains controversial, partly because these studies are frequently restricted to small and well-monitored areas. Monitoring air pollution is complex due to the large spatial and temporal variations of pollution phenomena, the high costs of recording instruments, and the low sampling density of a purely instrumental approach. Therefore, together with the traditional instrumental monitoring, bioindication techniques allow for the mapping of pollution effects over wide areas with a high sampling density. In this study, instrumental and biomonitoring techniques were integrated to support an epidemiological study that will be developed in an industrial area located in Gijon in the coastal of central Asturias, Spain. Three main objectives were proposed to (i) analyze temporal patterns of PM 10 concentrations in order to apportion emissions sources, (ii) investigate spatial patterns <b>of</b> lichen <b>conductivity</b> to identify the impact of the studied industrial area in air quality, and (iii) establish relationships amongst lichen conductivity with some site-specific characteristics. Samples of the epiphytic lichen Parmelia sulcata were transplanted in a grid of 18 by 20 km with an industrial area in the center. Lichens were exposed for a 5 -mo period starting in April 2010. After exposure, lichen samples were soaked in 18 -MΩ water aimed at determination <b>of</b> water electrical <b>conductivity</b> and, consequently, lichen vitality and cell damage. A marked decreasing <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> lichens <b>conductivity</b> relative to distance from the emitting sources was observed. Transplants from a sampling site proximal to the industrial area reached values 10 -fold higher than levels far from it. This finding showed that lichens reacted physiologically in the polluted industrial area as evidenced by increased conductivity correlated to contamination level. The integration of temporal PM 10 measurements and analysis of wind direction corroborated the importance of this industrialized region for air quality measurements and identified the relevance of traffic for the urban area...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{environmental}} correlates of species’ distributions is essential for understanding population dynamics, responses to environmental changes, biodiversity patterns, and the impacts of conservation plans. Here we examine how environment controls {{the distribution of the}} neotropical genus Montrichardia at regional and local spatial scales using species distribution models (SDMs) and logistic regression, respectively. Montrichardia is a genus of aquatic macrophytes with two species, Montrichardia linifera and Montrichardia arborescens, and is often an important component of flooded habitats. We find that for each species, altitude, precipitation and temperature of the driest month figure in the best performing SDMs as the most important factors controlling large-scale distributions, suggesting that the range limits of both species are climatically constrained by plant water-energy balance and cold intolerance. At small spatial scales, logistic regression models indicate the species partition types of aquatic habitat along local <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> water pH, <b>conductivity,</b> and water transparency. In summary, a hierarchy of factors may control Montrichardia distribution from large to small spatial scales. While at large spatial scales, evolutionarily conserved climatic niches may control the range limits of the genus, at small spatial scales niche differentiation allows individual species to grow in environmentally distinct aquatic habitats...|$|R
