The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> {{the language}}'s development; specific issues {{are discussed in the}} Roundup bug tracker maintained at python.org.

5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> {{the universe}} and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles. He argues in favour of reincarnation; a collective consciousness that has intentionality; modal realism (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (that good and bad thoughts can attract experiences).|$|E

40|$|A {{main purpose}} of this paper is to trace the roots of modern <b>discussions</b> <b>about</b> animal ethics. First, I sort out and survey major <b>discussions</b> <b>about</b> modern animal ethics. Next, I review the <b>discussions</b> <b>about</b> moral {{considerations}} for animals in eighteenth-century England which are probably thought of as templates of modern <b>discussions</b> <b>about</b> animal ethics. Additionally, I track back discussions in the seventeenth century, as a germ of discussions in eighteenth- century England, in the area of animal experiments, such as vivisection. Lastly, I speculate why these discussions in the seventeenth century spread out explosively in the following centuries in England...|$|R

5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead.

5|$|Leigh next {{sought the}} role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage {{production}} of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and was cast after Williams and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in The School for Scandal and Antigone; Olivier was contracted to direct. The play contained a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, and {{was destined to be}} controversial; the media <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work.|$|E

Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E

5|$|Regarding air transport, Aarhus {{is served}} by the Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup about 35km {{northeast}} of the city centre. There has been much <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> constructing a new airport closer to the city for many years, but so far, no plans have been realised. In August 2014, the city council officially initiated a process to assert the viability of a new international airport. A small seaplane now operates four flights daily between Aarhus harbour and Copenhagen harbour.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} told CanWest News Service that {{he hoped}} the documentary would provoke a wider <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> freedom of speech, sexual slang and its media use.

5|$|After Guy and Joanna have sex, Martin arrives to {{tell them}} that Joanna is Guy's mother. She met Guy's father whilst she was an {{exchange}} student in Switzerland. Guy then stabs a syringe full of Botox into Martin's legs as an act of revenge. Martin is taken into an ambulance, and Caroline helps Joanna, but Guy punches Mac in a drunken rage and steals the ambulance. Mac tries to stop him and gets on the ambulance, which drives away. Guy drives the ambulance to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field and almost goes over a cliff. The first series ends with Guy, Mac and Martin teetering on the edge – a literal cliffhanger – while ending up in a <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> which of The Three Musketeers they are most like.|$|E
5|$|After a long <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> how {{the episode}} should end, the writers {{decided that they}} did not want Barney to return to being drunk {{at the end of the}} episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators {{modified}} the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.|$|E

5|$|By 1959 the United States was {{concerned}} that the militarization of the Kola Peninsula would become the prime source of a Soviet attack on North America. A new <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> location arose, with Alta and Kautokeino as the main alternatives. Banak was estimated to cost NOK4.9 million, NOK2.8 million less than Alta, had better instrument landing and weather conditions and allowed a longer runway. The main advantage of Alta {{was that it would}} be better suited for civilian traffic. The government and Parliament approved construction of Banak in 1959 on condition that it receive NATO funding.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> deregulation, Braathens SAFE {{considered}} several possibilities {{to strengthen}} itself. In particular, it had {{discussions with the}} large European airlines Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM about an alliance, but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE, stating that the agreements were all about getting traffic to the partner's hub. Minister of Transport, Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway, Jan Reinås, both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS, {{to ensure that the}} company had a 100% market share on the primary routes before the merger. This would, according to them, secure that no foreign company could compete with the merged company. The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE's management. Still, negotiations started between the companies in 1992, although they were quickly abandoned. The press reported the price of Braathens SAFE to be NOK1.2 billion, but that this had been rejected as too expensive by SAS.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Halloween, Yablans and Akkad began working on Halloween II. There was initial <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> filming Halloween II in 3-D, but the idea never came to fruition. After Halloween II was released, Carpenter and Hill were {{approached}} about creating a third Halloween film, but they were reluctant to pledge commitment. The pair {{agreed to participate in}} the new project only if it was not a direct sequel to Halloween II, which meant no Michael Myers. Most of the filming for Halloween III took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta in Humboldt County, California. Familiar Foods, a milk bottling plant in Loleta, served as the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory, but all special effects involving fire, smoke, and explosions were filmed at Post Studios.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{association}} between the timing of <b>discussions</b> <b>about</b> condoms between mother and adolescent and adolescents' condom use during their first and subsequent sexual encounters was examined. METHODS: Sexually active adolescents reported whether and when they discussed condoms with their mother and answered questions about their own condom use. RESULTS: Mother-adolescent <b>discussions</b> <b>about</b> condoms that occurred prior to sexual debut were strongly associated with greater condom use during first intercourse and most recent intercourse, along with greater lifetime regular condom use. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Discussions</b> <b>about</b> condoms prior to sexual debut are important in promoting condom use among adolescents...|$|R
