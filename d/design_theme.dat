5|$|On the 150th {{anniversary of}} the Declaration of Independence in 1926 the U.S. Post Office issued a {{commemorative}} stamp depicting the Liberty Bell for the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1926, though this stamp actually depicts the replica bell erected {{at the entrance to}} the exposition grounds. The Liberty Bell was chosen for the stamp <b>design</b> <b>theme</b> because the symbol was most representative of the nation's independence. Since then the Liberty Bell has also appeared on several other U.S. postage stamps, including the first forever stamp, issued since 2007.|$|E
25|$|The {{portrayals of}} Washington and Franklin on U.S. postage {{are among the}} most {{definitive}} of examples and have appeared on numerous postage stamps. The presidential theme in stamp designs would continue as the decades passed, each period issuing stamps with variations of the same basic presidential-portrait <b>design</b> <b>theme.</b> The portrayals of U.S. presidents on U.S. postage has remained a significant subject and <b>design</b> <b>theme</b> on definitive postage throughout most of U.S. stamp issuance history.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationships between}} innovation in the business model, business model <b>design</b> <b>themes,</b> and firm performance. The ‘business model view’ and the related ‘business model innovation’ as emerging strategy, and innovation research domains, remain both ill-defined and marred by vague construct boundaries and limited empirical support. We build on existing theory to test our research model {{in a sample of}} 331 Australian firms. We find that business model <b>design</b> <b>themes,</b> which we argue are mechanisms for appropriating value from the firm’s business model, mediate the relationship between innovation and firm performance. Innovation without clarity in the business model leads to modest or negligible performance outcomes. We advocate for novelty-centered <b>design</b> <b>themes</b> because they unlock and translate the value from innovation to firm performance {{to a greater extent than}} transaction efficiency and user simplicity. We contend that broad innovation within the business model matters to performance but only if firms focus their business model design efforts more narrowly on coherently entrenching novelty and efficiency within their activity and transaction architecture...|$|R

25|$|The firm of Whidden & Lewis, Portland's {{pioneering}} architects, {{designed the}} Brewhouse. The building is designed in a medieval Tuscan style. Completed in 1908, other {{businesses in the}} area hired architects to emulate this <b>design</b> <b>theme</b> when building their own warehouses and industrial buildings. At its highest level, the structure has six floors. The structure is actually two buildings that appear as one: The Brewhouse (on {{the north side of}} the block), and the Malt and Hop Building (facing Burnside Street).|$|E
25|$|Many {{designs were}} {{considered}} {{during the development}} process, from designs that resembled the second generation cars, to more radically styled cars. They eventually decided on a radical new styling scheme based upon oval derived design elements, which {{would prove to be}} the car's Achilles heel in the marketplace. Chief designer Jack Telnack, who oversaw the development of the first and second generation Taurus, said that his Taurus was designed the way it was to stand out in the marketplace, and that the use of the oval was becoming the new global <b>design</b> <b>theme</b> for Ford.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with the previous generation model, the redesigned Lexus SC {{was intended as a}} convertible from its inception. The development team was led by chief engineer Yasushi Nakagawa from 1996 to 2000. Lexus designers from Europe and Japan worked together to create a streamlined design. A <b>design</b> <b>theme</b> was chosen in 1997 developed by Sotiris Kovos, who in return was named chief designer. Led by Kovos, designers traveled to the Côte d'Azur to develop the vehicle's exterior shape, and studied the region's architecture, lifestyle, and harbors. The resulting convertible of 1998 received character lines similar to the region's yachts, in {{contrast with}} traditional waveform lines. The vehicle's side profile, the product of extensive wind tunnel testing, was intended to channel air around the passenger compartment at high speed during top-down driving. Design patents were filed in Japan, at the Japan Patent Office on 14 June 1999 under patent number 1095312.|$|E

50|$|To date, Ford has not {{announced}} a production {{version of the}} MKR, {{although many of the}} concept's <b>design</b> <b>themes</b> and features were adopted for the production Lincoln MKS, MKZ, MKX, and MKT vehicles, starting with the 2009 model year MKS, 2010 for the MKZ and MKT, and 2011 for the MKX. The Lincoln C concept also shares <b>design</b> <b>themes</b> with the MKR, in a smaller compact platform. If the MKR had been approved, as an all new vehicle it would have likely been scheduled to launch around the 2011 time frame, most likely having been assembled at Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan alongside the Mustang, with which it would have shared a platform.|$|R
30|$|The 3 D {{modeling}} {{computer program}} “SketchUp” {{was used to}} create the virtual apparel stores. SketchUp is widely used for architectural and interior design in addition to mechanical and product design. Four models were developed in SketchUp to represent various kinds of store layouts and <b>design</b> <b>themes</b> that reflect typical fashion stores. Specifically, two store models were designed based on natural <b>design</b> <b>themes</b> (e.g., hardwood floors, wood walls) while the other two store models reflected modern <b>design</b> <b>themes</b> (e.g., metal wall panels). After the SketchUp models are created they were exported, converted to CAD data, and then converted again to VR data. Because CAD data are usually in a parametric form whereas VR data are {{in the form of}} tessellated polygons, a mesh of triangles (Purschke et al. 1998), CAD data need to be converted to polygons which define the surfaces of visual objects in VR. For example, if the surface of an object is curved in CAD data, arrangements of polygons that closely match the curved surface replace the surface in VR. Only this polygonal representation of a model allows for simultaneous rendering for VR (Beier 2000).|$|R
25|$|The Mercury Sable, {{a sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also {{redesigned}} for the 1996 model year. As with previous generations, the Sable used the same mechanical parts as the Taurus with a unique body. However, the 1996 Sable ditched the unique styling cues of the previous generations, specifically the front light bar, wrap-around rear glass and skirted rear fender, {{in favor of a}} <b>design</b> <b>theme</b> that more closely resembled that of the Taurus. For the first time, the Sable didn't get a unique interior design, instead sharing all of its interior components with the Taurus with the exception of branded parts and unique woodgrain trim. Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation: A base model GS and high-end LS, with a base G model briefly offered {{during the second half of}} the 1996 model year. The Sable had the same powertrains and most features as the Taurus, though no counterpart to the high performance SHO was offered. Prices increased, corresponding with the increase in price of the Taurus. While the design of the Taurus was polarizing, the more conservative design of the Sable was praised; Automobile Magazine selected the Sable as its 1996 design of the year.Unlike the Taurus, sales of the Sable stayed steady with the previous model, and styling revisions for 1998 were limited to a new grille and headlamps. The Taurus and Sable were produced concurrently through the 1999 model year.|$|E
500|$|The poppy is a {{recurring}} <b>design</b> <b>theme.</b> [...] The interior gatefold featured three photographs, the first depicting an outdoor scene with an outstretched hand holding three poppies {{and in the}} distance, a soldier {{with his back to}} the camera. [...] Two more photographs show a welder at work, his mask emblazoned with the Japanese Rising Sun Flag, and a nuclear explosion; a clear reference to [...] "Two Suns in the Sunset". [...] The album's lyrics are printed on the gatefold. [...] Side one of the vinyl disc carries an image of a poppy field and on side two, a soldier with a knife in his back lies face down amongst the poppies, a dog beside him. [...] The back cover features a photograph of a soldier standing upright and holding a film canister, with a knife protruding from his back (the film canister and knife may reflect Waters' tumultuous relationship with The Wall film director Alan Parker).|$|E
500|$|He {{began the}} game after the 2012 Game Developers Conference as a weeklong {{diversion}} from another project, and slowly iterated {{into a full}} version. Jonasson started to prototype a game about a space station with a hull breach that releases the station's occupants into outer space. Within a day, he built a feature where players could build the station using tetromino blocks. He liked this direction better than the hull breach, and abandoned the latter idea {{by the end of}} prototyping. He built the room construction mechanics within a day, and to make the construction more challenging, later added three different resources to be spent towards room construction. When the resources did not [...] "look as interesting" [...] as he wanted, he added minions to defend the station. The minions—shown as small white boxes—have retained their original design. It {{is an example of the}} minimalist <b>design</b> <b>theme</b> that pervades the work. Jonasson has said that he kept the artificial intelligence [...] "a bit stupid on purpose" [...] (doing things such as stealing food intended for other minions) because he found their actions [...] "a bit adorable". He otherwise removed the features he felt were not vital to the game. Jonasson then added [...] "conflict" [...] to the game by putting the minions in danger of being removed.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to handling the graphics, Kaneko designed {{the character and}} demon designs for the game. The Hero's and the Heroine's clothes were designed to be futuristic; the Heroine {{was designed to be}} a protector, with clothes inspired by American football equipment. The Law Hero and Chaos Hero have ordinary clothes at first; the Chaos Hero was designed to look unsophisticated, with a bad posture and military clothes. After their metamorphoses, the Law Hero wears clothes designed to look priestly; Kaneko did not have a specific form in mind when designing them, but thought they looked [...] "Gucci-like". The Chaos Hero's clothes after his metamorphosis were designed to be similar to the character Piccolo from the Dragon Ball manga series; his hair style was also based on Dragon Ball, specifically on that of the [...] "super saiyan" [...] transformations in that series. Kaneko wanted the Chaos Hero to change back and forth between human and demon form to tie in more closely with this <b>design</b> <b>theme,</b> but the concept was abandoned. During production, all the characters had names attached to them to help with identification during event planning. The character Louis Cyphre was inspired by the character of the same name from the 1987 movie Angel Heart. Some characters, such as Stephen and General Gotou, are based on real-life people; in the game files, they are identified as [...] "hoking" [...] and [...] "mishima", respectively. According to Ito, the character Thorman's name was originally inspired by the Norse god of thunder, but after release, he realized that the name was highly similar to that of Harry S. Truman, the American president who approved the atomic attacks against Japan.|$|E
