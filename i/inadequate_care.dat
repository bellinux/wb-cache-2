5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or <b>inadequate</b> <b>care.</b> Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E

Postpartum interviews with 1, 484 primarily low-income women were conducted during 1987 - 88 in three areas of Missouri with the highest rates of <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care.</b> The {{purpose of the study was}} to identify barriers to prenatal care and to determine which barriers differentiated between women receiving adequate and those receiving <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care.</b> Women who received <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> were more likely to be black, unmarried, higher parity, and have less education than those who received adequate care. These women were also more likely to be poor, Medicaid-eligible, to have had an unwanted pregnancy, more stress and problems during pregnancy, and less social support. In the multivariate analysis, race and marital status lost their importance. The strongest predictor of <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> was women not knowing that they were pregnant in the first 4 months of pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 9. 28). To improve the rate of adequate prenatal care, society must address the issues of poverty and wantedness of pregnancy...|$|R

The findings revealed that first and second-generation non-western women’s <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> utilisation could largely be explained by sociocultural factors. For first-generation non-western women socioeconomic, demographic and pregnancy factors also explained a large part of their <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> utilisation.

It is thought this process may lead to the disinhibited form.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine rates of prenatal care utilization in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from 1991 to 2000; to compare two indices of prenatal care utilization in identifying the proportion of the population receiving inadequate prenatal care; to determine the association between <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> and adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight [LBW], and small-for-gestational age [SGA]), using each of the indices; and, to assess whether or not, and to what extent, gestational age modifies this association. Methods We conducted a population-based study of women having a hospital-based singleton live birth from 1991 to 2000 (N = 80, 989). Data sources consisted of a linked mother-baby database and a physician claims file maintained by Manitoba Health. Rates of <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> were calculated using two indices, the R-GINDEX and the APNCU. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Stratified analysis was then used to determine whether the association between <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> and LBW or SGA differed by gestational age. Results Rates of inadequate/no prenatal care ranged from 8. 3 % using APNCU to 8. 9 % using R-GINDEX. The association between <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> and preterm birth and LBW varied depending on the index used, with adjusted odds ratios (AOR) ranging from 1. 0 to 1. 3. In contrast, both indices revealed the same strength of association of <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> with SGA (AOR 1. 4). Both indices demonstrated heterogeneity (non-uniformity) across gestational age strata, indicating the presence of effect modification by gestational age. Conclusion Selection of a prenatal care utilization index requires careful consideration of its methodological underpinnings and limitations. The two indices compared in this study revealed different patterns of utilization of prenatal care, and should not be used interchangeably. Use of these indices to study the association between utilization of prenatal care and pregnancy outcomes affected by the duration of pregnancy should be approached cautiously. </p...|$|R

Also [...] "husbandless" [...] mothers of children under 3 should be supported {{to care for the}} child at home rather than the child be left in <b>inadequate</b> <b>care</b> whilst the mother sought work. (It was assumed the mother of the illegitimate child would usually be left with the child). Fathers left with infants or small children on their hands without the mother should be provided with [...] "housekeepers" [...] so that the children could remain at home. Other proposals included the proper payment of foster homes and careful selection of foster carers, and frank, informative discussions with children about their parents and why they ended up in care and how they felt about it rather than the [...] "least said, soonest mended" [...] approach. The point that children were loyal to and loved even the worst of parents, and needed to have that fact understood non-judgementally, was strongly made.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{prenatal}} care {{is to promote}} good maternal and foetal health and to identify risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes {{in an attempt to}} promptly manage and solve them. Although high {{prenatal care}} attendance is reported in most areas in Brazil, perinatal and neonatal mortalities are disproportionally high, raising doubts about the quality and performance of the care provided. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the adequacy of prenatal care use and the risk factors involved in <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> utilization in the metropolitan area of Aracaju, Northeast Brazil. Methods A survey was carried out with puerperal women who delivered singleton liveborns in all four maternity hospitals of Aracaju. A total of 4552 singleton liveborns were studied. The Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index, modified according to the guidelines of the Prenatal Care and Birth Humanization Programme, was applied. Socioeconomic, demographic, biological, life style and health service factors were evaluated by multiple logistic regression. Results: Prenatal care coverage in Aracaju was high (98. 3 %), with a mean number of 6. 24 visits. Prenatal care was considered to be adequate or intensive in 66. 1 % of cases, while 33. 9 % were considered to have inadequate usage. Age < 18 to 34 years at delivery, low maternal schooling, low family income, two or more previous deliveries, maternal smoking during pregnancy, having no partner and prenatal care obtained outside Aracaju were associated with <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> use. In contrast, private service attendance protected from <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> use. Conclusion Prenatal care coverage was high. However, a significant number of women still had <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> use. Socioeconomic inequalities, demographic factors and behavioural risk factors are still important factors associated with <b>inadequate</b> prenatal <b>care</b> use...|$|R

2500|$|Automated {{external}} defibrillators are now {{easy enough}} to use that most states in the United States include the [...] "good faith" [...] use of an AED by any person under Good Samaritan laws. [...] "Good faith" [...] protection under a Good Samaritan law means that a volunteer responder (not acting {{as a part of}} one's occupation) cannot be held civilly liable for the harm or death of a victim by providing improper or <b>inadequate</b> <b>care,</b> given that the harm or death was not intentional and the responder was acting within the limits of their training and in good faith. In the United States, Good Samaritan laws provide some protection for the use of AEDs by trained and untrained responders. AEDs create little liability if used correctly; NREMT-B and many state Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training and many CPR classes incorporate or offer AED education as a part of their program. In addition to Good Samaritan laws, Ontario, Canada also has the [...] "Chase McEachern Act (Heart Defibrillator Civil Liability), 2007 (Bill 171 – Subsection N)", passed in June, 2007, which protects individuals from liability for damages that may occur from their use of an AED to save someone's life at the immediate scene of an emergency unless damages are caused by gross negligence.|$|E
