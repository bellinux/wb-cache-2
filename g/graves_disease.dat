40|$|Forty-one {{children}} and adolescents had thyroidectomies for <b>Grave's</b> <b>disease</b> during an 8 yr period. Twenty patients became euthyroid within a short period after treatment with antithyroid drugs and had operations with minimal disruption of their lives. Antithyroid drugs were administered to 20 patients {{for a longer period}} of time as a primary form of treatment for <b>Grave's</b> <b>disease.</b> Complications resulting from drug toxicity, poor cooperation by patients, and persistent goiters were indications for thyroidectomies in this group. Permanent remissions, after prolonged antithyroid drug therapy, are rare in children. Because the treatment is associated with significant morbidity, this form of therapy is unacceptable in most cases. Iodine- 131 was given to 30 children or adolescents for <b>Grave's</b> <b>disease</b> during the same time period. Iodine- 131 is primarily indicated for patients who are resistant or allergic to antithyroid drugs, who have serious systemic diseases, or who have had previous thyroid operations. Hypothyroidism is an inevitable result of effective 131 I treatment of <b>Grave's</b> <b>disease</b> in children. Serious consequences from 131 I therapy were not observed during the short period of follow-up. Subtotal thyroidectomy continues to be the preferred primary treatment for most patients with <b>Grave's</b> <b>disease</b> in childhood. Total thyroidectomy may be indicated for patients in the first decade of life. Hypothyroidism, which is easily managed in this age group, is the price paid for the prevention of recurrent <b>Grave's</b> <b>disease.</b> Early detection and treatment of hypothyroidism can be achieved only by a careful follow-up of all patients treated by less than total thyroidectomy for <b>Grave's</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Roy Orbison was falsely {{said to be}} albinistic, by his widow, for unknown reasons. [...] German singer Heino has <b>Graves</b> <b>disease,</b> {{which can}} be mistaken for albinism.

[...] London mayor Boris Johnson, known for his pale hair, has also been mistakenly called albino. In general, platinum blonde ("towheaded") people with very pale skin can be mistaken for albinistic (and conversely, some forms of albinism can result in phenotypes so normal-looking that only genetic testing can reveal the albinistic genes).|$|E
2500|$|Due to its mode of beta decay, iodine-131 {{is notable}} for causing {{mutation}} {{and death in}} cells that it penetrates, and other cells up to several millimeters away. For this reason, high doses of the isotope are sometimes less dangerous than low doses, since they tend to kill thyroid tissues that would otherwise become cancerous {{as a result of}} the radiation. For example, children treated with moderate dose of I-131 for thyroid adenomas had a detectable increase in thyroid cancer, but children treated with a much higher dose did not. Likewise, most studies of very-high-dose I-131 for treatment of <b>Graves</b> <b>disease</b> have failed to find any increase in thyroid cancer, even though there is linear increase in thyroid cancer risk with I-131 absorption at moderate doses. Thus, iodine-131 is increasingly less employed in small doses in medical use (especially in children), but increasingly is used only in large and maximal treatment doses, as a way of killing targeted tissues. This is known as [...] "therapeutic use." ...|$|E
