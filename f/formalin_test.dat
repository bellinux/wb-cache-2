40|$|Introduction: The <b>formalin</b> <b>test</b> is {{the most}} {{accepted}} chemical test for evaluation of nociception. It requires the injection of an adequate amount of formalin into {{the surface of the}} hindpaw. <b>Formalin</b> <b>test</b> consists of phase 1 (0 - 7 min) and phase 2 (15 - 60) in which the animal shows painful behaviors. These phases are separated with a quiet phase named interphase, in which the nociceptive responses are decreased or completely disappeared. Methods: The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effects of swim stress at different heights of water on different phases of the <b>formalin</b> <b>test</b> in male rats. Results: Swim stress decreased nociceptive behaviors in first phase and prolonged interphase or delayed the start of second phase in a water height dependent manner. Swim stress in 25 and 50 cm completely abolished the nociceptive behaviors in phase 1. Discussion: The present results showed different pain modulation during different phases of the <b>formalin</b> <b>test</b> and elucidated the impact of swim stress on duration of interphase. Interphase considered as an inactive period, but a recent research has shown that active inhibitory mechanisms are involved in the modulation of pain during this period. Therefore, swim stress may be considered as a useful tool for study of the basic inhibitory mechanisms underlying attenuation of nociceptive behaviors between phase 1 and 2 of the <b>formalin</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E

Background Systemic {{nitroglycerin}} (NTG) activates brain nuclei {{involved in}} nociceptive transmission {{as well as}} in neuroendocrine and autonomic functions in rats. These changes are considered relevant for migraine because NTG consistently provokes spontaneous-like migraine attacks in migraineurs. Several studies have suggested a relationship between the endocannabinoid levels and pain mediation in migraine. URB 937, a peripheral inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) - the enzyme that degrades anandamide, produces analgesia in animal models of pain, but there is no information on its effects in migraine. Aim We evaluated whether URB 937 alters nociceptive responses in the animal model of migraine based on NTG administration in male rats, using the tail flick test and the plantar and orofacial <b>formalin</b> <b>tests,</b> under baseline conditions and after NTG administration. Furthermore, we investigated whether URB 937 affects NTG-induced c-Fos expression in the brain.

Formalin-induced behaviour is characterized by two phases relevant to acute and tonic. Methods: In this behavioral study, Inflammatory Pain Model by formalin was used in white rats with weight range of 200 - 300 g. Using a stereotaxic apparatus, canulla was inserted into the LPGI. After 1 week recovery, animals were initially submitted to the injection of 50 ml of 2 % formalin solution in hind paw. Results: Intra-LPGI microinjection of morphine produced robust inhibition of formalin-evoked behaviour in phase 1, interphase and phase 2 (P< 0. 001); however, exogenous injection of morphine in the LPGI had no effect on reducing formalin induced nociceptive behaviors Conclusion: The results suggested that morphine plays an anti-nociceptive role in LPGI in phase 1, interphase and late phase of <b>formalin</b> <b>test</b> in rats, which suggests that opioid receptors in the LPGI may be involved in the LPGI -mediated depression of <b>formalin</b> <b>test</b> as inflammatory pain...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} {{dextromethorphan}} on antinociception and tolerance induced by water swim-stress in the <b>formalin</b> <b>test</b> was investigated. Methods: Swim- stress at 8 ºC induces antinociception in both phases of the <b>formalin</b> <b>test.</b> Intraperitoneal administration of dextromethorphan (60 mg/kg) also induces antinociception {{in the second phase}} of the <b>formalin</b> <b>test.</b> The lower doses of dextromethorphan (1. 25, 2. 5, and 5 mg/kg) which did not induce antinociception alone, but did so in combination with swim- stress (40 second), showed antinociceptive effect in both phases of the test. Exposure to water swimming stress with a period of 20 sec, once daily for three days, altered swim- stress- induced antinociception in the <b>formalin</b> <b>test,</b> when tested on the fourth day. Results: In these animals, exposure to either water swimming stress alone or water swimming stress in combination with dextromethorphan showed potentiation of antinociception induced by swim- stress up to 20 second and decreased the response induced by 40 and 60 second swim-stress, indicating a tolerance induction. Dextromethorphan (20 mg/kg) did not alter the changes induced by three days exposure to swim- stress. Conclusion: The results may indicate a possible involvement of n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor mechanism in the antinociception but not tolerance induced by swim- stress at 8 ºC...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The {{consumption}} of mushrooms in popular and traditional medicine is associated to immune modulating activity. It {{is known that}} decreasing the inflammatory process will decrease nociception. This study aimed at checking the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity of Agaricus blazei Murill, mushroom of the sun, in Wistar rats using the modified <b>formalin</b> <b>test.</b> METHOD: Animals (n = 18) were distributed in the following groups: Control Group (CG) : non-treated animals receiving just 2 % Tween solvent (n = 6); Treated Group (TG) : animals daily treated orally with 2. 65 mg of A. blazei powder in 2 % Tween solvent for 15 days (n = 12). After treatment, they were submitted to the modified <b>formalin</b> <b>test.</b> RESULTS: After formalin injection, the three phases of the <b>formalin</b> <b>test</b> were observed in CG and TG animals. The treatment with A. blazei has not interfered with <b>formalin</b> <b>test</b> phases I or II, but has decreased the number of paw elevations in phase III. CONCLUSION: The treatment with Agaricus blazei during 15 days had action in nociceptive response and acute inflammation because rats treated with Agaricus had a lower number of paw movements during phase III, which is related to pain caused by mediators of the acute inflammatory process phase...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGene {{targeting}} {{was used}} to delete exon 2 of mouse DOR- 1, which encodes the δ opioid receptor. Essentially all 3 H-[D-Pen 2,D-Pen 5]enkephalin (3 H-DPDPE) and 3 H-[D-Ala 2,D-Glu 4]deltorphin (3 H-deltorphin- 2) binding is absent from mutant mice, demonstrating that DOR- 1 encodes both δ 1 and δ 2 receptor subtypes. Homozygous mutant mice display markedly reduced spinal δ analgesia, but peptide δ agonists retain supraspinal analgesic potency that is only partially antagonized by naltrindole. Retained DPDPE analgesia is also demonstrated upon <b>formalin</b> <b>testing,</b> while the nonpeptide δ agonist BW 373 U 69 exhibits enhanced activity in DOR- 1 mutant mice. Together, these findings suggest {{the existence of a}} second delta-like analgesic system. FinallyDOR- 1 mutant mice do not develop analgesic tolerance to morphine, genetically demonstrating a central role for DOR- 1 in this process...|$|R
40|$|Antinociceptive and {{anti-inflammatory}} {{effects of}} a peptide concentrate mix (PepC) obtained from whey protein, via hydrolysis with cardosins from Cynara cardunculus, was tested in vivo. The antinociceptive effect was assessed using writhing, hot-plate and <b>formalin</b> <b>tests</b> in mice, and the anti-inflammatory effect using the paw oedema test. PepC at 300 mg kg 1 bw conveyed a significant result in the writhing test when co-administered with 1 and 3 mg kg 1 bw indomethacin, similar to administration of higher doses of indomethacin alone. Conversely, {{no statistically significant differences}} were observed in the paw oedema test when the same PepC concentration was co-administered with dexamethasone at 3, 10 and 30 mg kg 1 bw. PepC at 1000 mg kg 1 bw did not cause any remarkable outcome in the hot-plate test. PepC appears to possess anti-inflammatory and peripheral antinociceptive activities, so it may be a candidate for nutraceutical ingredient...|$|R
40|$|E- 2078 is a {{very stable}} {{dynorphin}} analog that has the same affinity and selectivity for oploid receptors as dynorphin-A by in vitro bioassay. In the present study, we have characterized the receptor selectivity of E- 2078 in pt-, #{ 244 }-and ic-representative binding assays, and have evaluated the analgesic effect of systemically administered E- 2078 by the tail pinch, tail flick and <b>formalin</b> <b>tests</b> in mice. E- 2078 possessed a higher affinity for -receptors than for L- or #{ 244 }-receptorsin the receptor-binding assay. Dose-related, long-lasting analgesia was produced by s. c. injec-tion of E- 2078, and its peak effect was observed 2 hr after s. c. administration in all the analgesic tests. This analgesic effect was produced at doses that did not affect rotarod latency. Post-treatment with naloxone dose-dependently reversed the anal-gesic effects of both E- 2078 and morphine, but E- 2078 -induce...|$|R
