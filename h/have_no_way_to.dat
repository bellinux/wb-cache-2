They flee to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, the family home of Sirius Black that Harry had inherited a year before. They identify R.A.B. as Sirius' brother Regulus Black, and learn from the house-elf Kreacher, Slytherin's locket was stolen {{from the house and}} then seized by Dolores Umbridge of the Ministry of Magic. They infiltrate the Ministry of Magic using Polyjuice Potion and take back the locket, but <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> destroy it. With the Ministry now after them, the trio goes on the run across the countryside. Under the object's evil influence and the strain of constant vigilance, they argue and Ron leaves.|$|E
25|$|Conceptual metaphor {{theories}} {{argue against}} both subjective and objective conceptions of value and meaning, {{and focus on}} the relationships between body and other essential elements of human life. In effect, conceptual metaphor theories treat ethics as an ontology problem and the issue of how to work-out values as a negotiation of these metaphors, not the application of some abstraction or a strict standoff between parties who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> understand each other's views.|$|E

Landing upon a mud field, they find out from Lucky Bug that Apple Dumplin' {{ended up at the}} Palace; they now <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> rescue her. Mr. Sun, the narrator of the story, grants Strawberry a wish. She wishes to defeat the Pieman, and a grove of marching trees help her {{accomplish}} this; their stomping causes the Palace to collapse. [...] Afterward, Apple Dumplin' gives him a note demanding that he surrender and do good deeds; he reluctantly does so, giving the toddler and berries back to Strawberry and company. [...] At the end of the special, Strawberry Shortcake offers him a chance to sell his pies at Strawberry Market, and become friends with her.|$|E

Some students are [...] "bad test takers", meaning they get nervous and unfocused on tests.

2500|$|In September 2014, Jason Nova of Android Authority {{reported}} on {{a study by the}} German security company Fraunhofer AISEC in antivirus software and malware threats on Android. Nova wrote that [...] "The Android operating system deals with software packages by sandboxing them; this does not allow applications to list the directory contents of other apps to keep the system safe. By not allowing the antivirus to list the directories of other apps after installation, applications that show no inherent suspicious behavior when downloaded are cleared as safe. If then later on parts of the app are activated that turn out to be malicious, the antivirus will <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> know since it is inside the app and out of the antivirus’ jurisdiction". The study by Fraunhofer AISEC, examining antivirus software from Avast, AVG, Bitdefender, ESET, F-Secure, Kaspersky, Lookout, McAfee (formerly Intel Security), Norton, Sophos, and Trend Micro, revealed that [...] "the tested antivirus apps do not provide protection against customized malware or targeted attacks", and that [...] "the tested antivirus apps were also not able to detect malware which is completely unknown to date but does not make any efforts to hide its malignity".|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday 10 August Maj. Gen. Abdulsalam Al-Obaidi, the Chief of Staff of the Libyan National Army, gave {{evidence}} in a three-hour session before the newly elected House of Representatives in Tobruk. During the session Obaidi claimed he had [...] "no control" [...] over the various government funded rebel groups. Speaking about the Libya Shield Force, Obaidi claimed he {{had no way to}} find out how many soldiers were fighting under the Force, and also claimed to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> either reform the group or change its leadership. Mohammed el-Jarh, a Libyan analyst based in Tripoli, claimed that members of the House of Representatives were determined to hold Obaidi accountable after his comments. Benghazi representative Salih al-Shawihidi denied that there were plans to replace Obaidi with Saad al-Qatrani. The following day a letter that had been sent by Obaidi to numerous militias on the 6 August was leaked on the internet. In the letter Obaidi instructed all groups, including the Libya Shield Forces which are officially under his command, and which he had assigned to Tripoli, to stop fighting. The letter reflected the House of Representatives decision No. 3, which had been issued on the same day, and which ordered all sides to commit to an immediate cease fire.|$|E

60|$|The {{next year}} 1666, {{there was a}} fire in London, which burnt down whole streets, with their churches, and even {{destroyed}} St. Paul's Cathedral. Perhaps it did good by burning down the dirty old houses and narrow streets where the plague might have lingered, but it was a fearsome misfortune. It was only stopped at last by blowing up a space with gunpowder all round it, so that the flames might <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> pass on.

But now"--He would have proceeded; but the firmness which had hitherto sustained him gave way. He turned aside to hide the tears which all the pride of his nature could not restrain, and which, instead of relieving, added to his anguish. At length he resumed, [...] "No, Ellen, we must part now and forever. Your life will be long and happy. Mine will be short, but not altogether wretched, nor shorter than if we had never met.

This therefore showeth you the dreadful state of those that lightly, vainly, lyingly, and profanely make use of the name, this fearful name of God, either by their blasphemous cursing and oaths, or by their fraudulent dealing with their neighbour; for some men <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> prevail with their neighbour to bow under a cheat, but by calling falsely upon the name of the Lord to be witness that the wickedness is good and honest; but how these men will escape, when they shall be judged, devouring fire and everlasting burnings, for their profaning and blaspheming {{of the name of}} the Lord, becomes them betimes to consider of (Jer 14:14,15; Eze 20:39; Exo 20:7).[3] ...|$|E
