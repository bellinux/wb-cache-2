2500|$|Senator Edwards, as we wrap up {{the foreign}} policy part of this, I do {{want to talk to}} you about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Today, a senior member of Islamic Jihad was killed in Gaza. There have been suicide bombings, {{targeted}} assassinations, mortar attacks, all of this continuing at a time when the United States seems absent in the peace-making process. What would your administration do? First of all, do you agree that the United States is absent? Maybe you don't. But what would your administration <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> resolve that conflict? ...|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} we walked around the walls two or three times, and found {{a place where we}} thought we could get up, if we had a rope {{fastened}} {{to the top of the}} wall. When General Oglethorpe bombarded the fort,--at the time the Spaniards held it,--he made a good many dents in the wall, and these would help us.

60|$|We {{intended}} {{having the}} coronation in the house; {{but we found}} the crowd too large for this, so we brought the rocking-chair out-of-doors, and set {{it in front of}} the only window in the palace. The yard was large enough to accommodate a good many people, and those who could not get in had plenty of room out in the road. We tried to make Poqua-dilla take off her turban, because a crown on a turban seemed to us something entirely out of order; but she wouldn't listen to it. We had the pleasant-faced neighbor-woman as an interpreter, and she said that it wasn't any use; the queen would almost as soon appear in public without her head as without her turban. So we let this pass, for we saw very plainly that it wouldn't <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> force too much on Poqua-dilla, for she looked now as if she thought we had come there to perform some operation on her,--perhaps to cut off her leg.|$|E

They seemed to have settled down to starve us out; but it is quite {{possible}} that now I have got away they will grow nervous lest I should bring help up, and are very likely to make another attempt this evening. They would be pretty sure to succeed this time, for there are only seven of us left there; and though they could make a good fight in daylight, they would have no real chance if the Boers went at them in earnest, which they are sure to do next time. We agreed before I started that it would not <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> defend the yard. After I left they were going to pile everything movable against the doors and windows and fight hard to keep the Boers out, and would then go upstairs and sell their lives dearly." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{the second}} night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn't <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> run in a fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't {{anything}} but little saplings to tie to. I passed the line around one of them {{right on the edge}} of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and then there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn't come. I was in such a hurry I hadn't untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them.|$|E

Told him how bad business was--Well, he could see for himself nobody would want boots shined in that weather. He said if I promised him I wouldn't freeze to death, 'cause he didn't want any dead bootblacks on his hands, I could come in for a spell. An' don't you think I wasn't fixed! All the shavings I wanted for a bed right there on the floor, an' if the boss of the Astor House had got down on his knees beggin' me to come to his hotel to stop, I'd said 'no,' 'cause I couldn't be bothered with the airs they put on down that way. How long can I stay here? I ain't troublin' my head 'bout that. I don't let the man what owns the place see me any oftener than I can help, an' so long's I keep out of sight there ain't much chance of my bein' fired." ...|$|E
