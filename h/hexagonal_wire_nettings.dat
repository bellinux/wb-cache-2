40|$|Large pullout {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh embedded in silty sand locally known as Ayutthaya sand to investigate the soil reinforcement interaction. PVC-coated of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh was tested with different applied normal pressures ranging from 35 to 105 kPa. The <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh specimens with 80 x 100 mm cell sizes were pulled {{at a rate of}} 1 mm/min. In the conventional pullout test wherein the clamping system is outside the pullout box, the deformation and movement of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh known as necking phenomenon occurred simultaneously during the pullout process. In order to reduce this phenomenon, the large pullout test was modified to install the clamping system inside the pullout box hereinafter called “in-soil pullout test”. The total pullout resistance of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh reinforcement consists of two components, namely: friction and bearing resistance. An elastic-perfectly plastic model was used to simulate the friction resistance and relative displacement relation of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh while a hyperbolic model was applied to simulate the passive bearing resistance of the individual bearing member. The bearing resistance is approximately 4 to 6 times greater than the friction resistance. The maximum pullout resistances increased with increasing specimen lengths as well as the applied normal pressures. The in-soil pullout resistances are about 50 % greater than the corresponding results from previous conventional pullout tests. Several analytical models for predicting the pullout resistance of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh reinforcement have been proposed and modified in this paper. These proposed analytical models for predicting the pullout resistance and displacement relation agreed with the laboratory test results reasonable well...|$|R

40|$|Masonry {{is widely}} used as a {{construction}} material for load bearing structures or as infill walls in reinforced concrete skeleton frame structures. Cracking {{is one of the}} most common problems in masonry walls. It would be better to take relevant precautions at the construction stage rather than carrying out rectification work after cracks are formed. Laboratory tests were carried out to investigate the effectiveness of five methods that can be used as remedial measures to prevent cracking near the wall openings. Test wall panels would represent the load bearing brick masonry walls with openings. Five different types of wall panels were constructed in this study, namely, walls with normal lintel above the opening, normal lintel above the opening and walls reinforced with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh, normal lintel above the opening and walls reinforced with hexagonal plastic mesh, continuous lintel above the opening and both the continuous lintel above the opening with a continuous beam just below the opening. Loads at which cracks propagate were compared. From the test results it was found that many cracks propagated on walls with normal lintels at low load levels. When walls were reinforced with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh or plastic mesh, walls could withstand higher loads before cracking. However, from the results it could be clearly seen that walls having both the continuous lintels above the opening and continuous beams below the openings were the most effective method to control cracking in masonry walls compared to all four other remedial measures considered in this study...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide greater meaning and {{significance}} to wire glass {{so that it}} may be preserved by exploring the historical origins and complexity of manufacture of the medium. The Industrial Revolution was a period of amazing evolution in the history of glass manufacture. Plate glass technology allowed for new design and building construction concepts, including the Crystal Palace, but this was an imperfect technology. As the brilliant minds of the Revolution struggled to grapple with the obstacles posed by plate glass, wire glass was eventually born. This new glass type spread across the United States in subsequent years, fueled by uniform manufacture standards on the city and state levels and the American mass media’s coverage of conflagrations, which led to the public’s association of wire glass with safety given its fire retardant and shatterproof qualities. Wire glass was technically incredibly difficult to produce, especially in mass production, and although inventors experimented with various treatments and patterns, wire glass remained and was comparatively expensive (though people generally believed the safety benefits outweighed the costs). Wire glass fell into disfavor during the World Wars as it was replaced by newer types of glass that were more economical, but recent trends have sparked renewed interest in the use and hence preservation of wire glass. Original methods of wire glass manufacture using early wire netting patterns no longer exist, and so current methods of preservation and conservation involving replication through glass lamination methods using imported <b>wire</b> <b>nettings</b> and salvage are discussed. Possible conservation treatments for repair are debated and further research is concluded...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} {{modeling of}} the full scale test embankment reinforced with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh was analyzed using finite difference method under three dimensional (3 D) conditions to reflect the actual embankment dimensions. In the analysis, the 3 D finite difference simulation using 5 times of vertical laboratory permeability can reasonably predict its behavior on soft foundation. In comparison with the field measurements, the predicted results from 3 D analysis reasonably agreed with measured data including vertical settlement, excess pore pressures and lateral displacements. Thus, the actual embankment geometry and the selected permeability influenced {{the behavior of the}} reinforced embankment constructed on soft ground foundation. The simulated maximum tension lines in the reinforcements tend to follow the coherent gravity failure plane. The maximum tension {{at the bottom of the}} reinforced embankment occurred near midpoint portion away from the facing due to the settlement profile of the soft soil foundation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved discrete element model, which incorporates stochastically distorted contact mechanics, for the simulation of double-twisted <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> meshes that {{are commonly used}} in rockfall protection. First, the characteristics of such meshes are investigated by conducting quasi-static and dynamic experimental tests. Second, the discrete model for the simulation of such meshes is presented. A stochastically distorted contact model is introduced to account for distortions of the wires and hexagons, allowing a more realistic representation of the mechanical response of the mesh from the deformation {{point of view and}} the force point of view. Quasi-static tensile tests of a plane net sheet, subjected to a constant strain rate, are used to study the effect of the stochastically distorted contact formulation and to calibrate the numerical model. Finally, the dynamic response of an impacting block on a horizontal mesh sheet is used to compare the numerical predictions against experimental results in order to validate the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:The main {{principle}} of design of truss by using Ferro-cement is economy and safety. In this investigation a ferrocement roof truss {{has been designed}} which are of low in cost, light in weight and easy to maintain. The first step of design involves the calculation of dead load using IS 875 (part- 1) and wind load using IS 875 (part- 3) - 1987. The next step involves the calculation of tension and compression in each individual member of the truss. Sections of the truss are designed using the value of highest tension or compression. After designing all the sections, the truss is constructed. A 6 -mm diameter circular coil is used as reinforcing material for construction and angles of desired shape are made to hold the sections in position. <b>Hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh or chicken mess is cut into required sizes and are placed over the reinforced skeleton of the section.

40|$|This work {{contributes}} to the Hydride Fuels Project, a collaborative effort between UC Berkeley and MIT aimed at investigating {{the potential benefits of}} hydride fuel use in light water reactors (LWRs). Core design is accomplished for both hydride and oxide-fueled cores over a range of geometries via steady-state and transient thermal hydraulic analyses, which yield the maximum power, and fuel performance and neutronics studies, which provide the achievable discharge burnup. The final optimization integrates the outputs from these separate studies into an economics model to identify geometries offering the lowest cost of electricity, and provide a fair basis for comparing the performance of hydride and oxide fuels. This work focuses on the steady-state and transient thermal hydraulic as well as economic analyses for PWR cores utilizing wire wraps in a hexagonal array with UZrH 1. 6 and UO 2. It was previously verified that square and hexagonal arrays with matching rod diameters and H/HM ratio have the same thermal hydraulic performance. In this work, this equivalence is extended to <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> wrap arrays, and verified by comparing the thermal hydraulic performance of a single <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> wrap core with its equivalent square array core with grid spacers. A separate neutronics equivalence is developed, {{based on the assumption that}} arrays with matching rod diameters and H/HM ratios will have identical neutronic performance. Steady-state design limits were separated into hard limits, which must be satisfied, or soft limits, which serve to keep the design reasonable. Design limits were placed on the pressure drop, critical heat flux (CHF), vibrations, and fuel and cladding temperature. Vibrations limits on the wire wrap assemblies were imposed for flow induced vibrations (FIV) and thermal hydraulic vibrations (THV). (cont.) An analysis of the fretting wear of wire wraps was performed, which outperformed the analogous fretting wear analysis for grid spacers. A CHF study found wire wraps to outperform grid spacers. LOCA and overpower transient analyses were performed for wire wraps. The overpower transient was analyzed over a range of geometries, and found to be more limiting than the steady-state analysis. The LOCA was analyzed for various powers at the reference geometry and another geometry of interest. Through all of these analyses, it was determined that the thermal hydraulic performance of UZrH 1. 6 and UO 2 are very similar. The optimal wire wrap designs were found to have significantly higher maximum powers than the reference core, allowing for uprates up to - 54 %. This is due to improved vibrations, pressure drop, and CHF. The steady-state and transient analyses were combined with fuel performance and neutronic studies into an economics model that determines the optimal geometries for incorporation into existing PWR's. The model also provides a basis for comparing the performance of UZrH 1. 6 to UO 2 for a range of core geometries. Results presented herein show cost savings for oxide fuel with wire wraps over grid spacers of at least 0. 8 mils/kWe-hr, or 4 %, due to power increases predicted by the thermal hydraulic analyses. Wire wrap UZrHI. 6 has a COE savings over U 02 of 0. 7 mils/kWe-hr, or 4 %. Due to the large power uprates possible, a utility could achieve a cost savings of up to 10. 9 mils/kWe-hr, or 40 %, with a UZrH 1. 6 wire wrap uprate instead of building a new core. by Peter Ray Diller.

The reinforcement used in this embankment was Tenax TT 201 geogrid SAMP, which is uniaxial oriented polymer grid reinforcement [4]. Furthermore, Long [24] studied about the behaviour of a geotextile reinforced embankment on soft ground. This study was focussed on the interaction parameter between soil and geotextile reinforcement, the localized mobilization of geotextile reinforcement force related with slip failure, the performance behaviour of geotextile reinforced embankment on soft ground and the closed-form solution for rotational stability analysis of reinforced embankment. Similarly, Voottipruex [40] studied the behaviour of full scale embankment built in AIT campus which was reinforced with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> mesh up to 6  m with 10 ° inclined of gabion facing. The facing consisted of large rectangular wire baskets wired all together and was filled with rock and height of each basket was 1  m. Two types of reinforcements, galvanized coated and PVC coated with unequal aperture size, {{were used in the}} two different sections {{along the length of the}} wall. Furthermore, Lai et al. [23] performed the full scale MSE embankment laid on fully instrumented Deep Mixing Method (DMM) improved ground. The behaviour of the full scale test embankment showed that deep mixing improvement method reduced the settlement of reinforced soil test embankment by 70 %, which was an effective finding. Tanchaisawat [37] performed the study about the interaction between geogrid and tire chips-sand mixture, performances of full scale geogrid reinforced test embankment and numerical simulation of this full scale test embankment. The results revealed that the aperture sizes of geogrid affected most for the direct shear resistance of geogrids. He concluded that larger aperture size may lead to higher direct shear resistance.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the {{epitaxial}} growth of high-quality core-shell nonpolar m-plane GaN/InAlN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on the sidewall facets of c-oriented <b>hexagonal</b> GaN <b>wires.</b> Pseudomorphic growth without generation of threading dislocations has been established for planar GaN/InAlN (In = 15 %) MQWs grown on m-GaN substrates, although m-plane InAlN epilayers cannot be grown perfectly lattice-matched to GaN along the two in-plane directions. Calculations based on elasticity theory indicate that the significant amount of strain oriented along the c-axis is the likely factor favoring the formation of cracks along this direction. For the core-shell wire geometry, such cracks are not observed, leading to high structural quality MQWs. A significant UV emission centered around 3. 7 eV at room temperature with a strong polarization perpendicular to the wire axis is observed for those core-shell wires, {{which is consistent with}} k*p method calculations, proving the absence of quantum confined Stark effect on nonpolar m-plane surfaces.

The barrier layers were coated on all surfaces of the <b>hexagonal</b> monocore <b>wires.</b> Then, several pieces of the coated wires were stacked and inserted into an Ag tube, and the composites were deformed into tape shape.

The loss properties in the barrier tape were compared with those in the tape without barriers. The results indicated that introducing Ca 2 CuO 3 barriers is effective to suppress the electromagnetic coupling among the filaments and also to reduce the magnetization losses under parallel transverse field.

40|$|Electric {{potential}} {{produced in}} deformed piezoelectric nanostructures is of significance for both fundamental study and practical applications. To reveal the piezoelectric property of ZnO nanohelices, the piezoelectric potential in single-crystal nanohelices was simulated by {{finite element method}} calculations. For a nanohelix with a length of 1200 nm, a mean coil radius of 150 nm, five active coils, and a <b>hexagonal</b> coiled <b>wire</b> with a side length 100 nm, a compressing force of 100 nN results in a potential of 1. 85 V. This potential is {{significantly higher than the}} potential produced in a straight nanowire with the same length and applied force. Maintaining the length and increasing the number of coils or mean coil radius leads to higher piezoelectric potential in the nanohelix. Appling a force along the axial direction produces higher piezoelectric potential than in other directions. Adding lateral forces to an existing axial force can change the piezoelectric potential distribution in the nanohelix, while the maximum piezoelectric potential remains largely unchanged in some cases.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{behavior}} of small molecules on a surface depends critically on both molecule−substrate and intermolecular interactions. We present here a detailed comparative investigation of 1, 3, 5 -benzene tricarboxylic acid (trimesic acid, TMA) {{on two different}} surfaces: highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and single-layer graphene (SLG) grown on a polycrystalline Cu foil. On the basis of high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) images, we show that the epitaxy matrix for the <b>hexagonal</b> TMA chicken <b>wire</b> phase is identical on these two surfaces, and, using density functional theory (DFT) with a non-local van der Waals correlation contribution, we identify the most energetically favorable adsorption geometries. Simulated STM images based on these calculations suggest that the TMA lattice can stably adsorb on sites other than those identified to maximize binding interactions with the substrate. This is consistent with our net energy calculations that suggest that intermolecular interactions (TMA−TMA dimer bonding) are dominant over TMA−substrate interactions in stabilizing the system. STM images demonstrate the robustness of the TMA films on SLG, where the molecular network extends across the variable topography of the SLG substrates and remains intact after rinsing and drying the films. These results help to elucidate molecular behavior on SLG and suggest significant similarities between adsorption on HOPG and SLG. 1...|$|R

Analysis of the 					interaction of light with long cylindrical/hexagonal structures with 					subwavelength diameters identifies radial resonant modes, such as Leaky Mode 					Resonances, or Whispering Gallery modes. The two-dimensional treatment should 					incorporate axial variations in “volumetric modes,”which have so far been 					presented in terms of Fabry–Perot (FP), and helical resonance modes.

However, optically 					equivalent structures such as <b>hexagonal</b> and cylindrical <b>wires</b> can have very 					different optoelectronic properties meaning that light management alone does not 					sufficiently describe the observed enhancement in upward (absorption) and 					downward transitions (emission) of light inNWs; rather, the electronic 					transition rates should be considered.

A parametric study has been performed to determine the optimum combination of lattice pitch, rod diameter, and channel shape-further referred to as geometry-for maximizing power given specific transient conditions for pressurized water reactors (PWR) loaded with either U 02 or UZrH 1. 6 fuel. Several geometries have been examined with the VIPRE subchannel analysis tool along with MATLAB scripts previously developed to automate VIPRE execution. The transients investigated were a large break {{loss of coolant accident}} (LBLOCA), am overpower transient, and a complete loss of flow accident. The maximum achievable power for each geometry is defined as the highest power that can be sustained without exceeding any of the steady state or transient limits. The limits were chosen based on technical feasibility and safety of the reference core and compared with the final safely analysis report (FSAR) of the reference core, the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station (STPEGS), whenever possible. This analysis was performed for two separate pressure drop limits of 29 and 60 psia for both a square array with grid spacers and a <b>hexagonal</b> array with <b>wire</b> wraps. (cont.) The square core geometry sustaining the highest power (4820. 0 MW) for both the hydride and oxide fueled has a pitch of 9. 0 mm and a rod diameter of 6. 5 mm and was limited by the complete loss of flow accident. Both of these maximum power geometries occurred at the 60 psia pressure drop case. The maximum power of the 29 psia pressure drop case (4103. 9 MW) for both fuel types occurred at a pitch of 9. 7 mm and a rod diameter of 6. 5 mm. The maximum power for the hexagonal arrayed cores occurred at the same hydrogen to heavy metal ratio as the square cores. The hydride fueled core power (5123. 2 MW) was limited by the overpower transient while the oxide fueled core power (4996. 1 MW) was limited by the overpower transient. The pressure drop constraint was not limiting for either fuel type for either pressure drop case for the wire wrapped cores. by Jarrod Michael Trant. Thesis (S. M.)

Gerberich. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxii, 139 pages, appendix p. 138 - 139. With a newly developed symmetry-adapted tight-binding molecular dynamics (MD) capability, we performed microscopic calculations {{on a variety}} of quasi-one dimensional silicon, carbon, and molybdenum disulfide nanostructures. In symmetry-adapted MD the helical symmetry instead of the standard translational symmetry is used. In the considered nanostructures, equivalent calculations can now be performed with a substantial smaller, {{in terms of the number}} of atoms, repeating domain. The symmetry-adapted method was utilized in the studied highlighted below. The stability of the most promising ground state candidate silicon nanowires with less than 10 nm in diameter was comparatively studied with with nonorthogonal tight-binding and classical potential models. The computationally expensive tight-binding treatment becomes tractable due to the substantial simplifications introduced by the presented symmetry-adapted scheme. It indicates that the achiral polycrystalline of fivefold symmetry and the <b>hexagonal</b> (wurtzite) <b>wires</b> of threefold symmetry are the most favorable quasi-one-dimensional silicon arrangements. Quantitative differences with the classical model description are noted over the whole diameter range. Using a Wulff energy decomposition approach it is revealed that these differences are caused by the inability of the classical potential to accurately describe the interaction of Si atoms on surfaces and strained morphologies. The elastic response for a large catalog of carbon nanotubes subjected to axial and torsional strain was next derived from tomistic calculations that rely on an accurate tight-binding description of the covalent binding. The application of the computationally expensive quantum treatment is possible due to the simplification in the number of atoms introduced by accounting for the helical and ngular symmetries exhibited by the elastically deformed nanotubes. The elasticity of nanotubes larger than 1. 25 nm in diameter can be represented with an isotropic elastic continuum. The torsional plastic response of single-walled carbon nanotubes is studied with tight-binding objective molecular dynamics. In contrast with plasticity under elongation and bending, a torsionally deformed carbon nanotube can slip along a nearly axial helical path, which introduces a distinct (+ 1,&# 8722; 1) change in wrapping indexes. The low energy realization occurs without loss in mass via nucleation of a 5 - 7 - 7 - 5 dislocation dipole, followed by glide of 5 - 7 kinks. The possibility of nearly axial glide is supported by the obtained dependence of the plasticity onset on chirality and handedness and by the presented calculations showing the energetic advantage of the slip path and of the initial glide steps. Symmetry-adaptedMD combined with density-functional-based tight-binding made possible to compute chiral nanotubes as axial-screw dislocations. This enabled the surprising revelation of a large catalog of MoS 2 nanotubes that lack the prescribed translational symmetry and exhibit chirality-dependent electronic band-gaps and elastic constants. Helical symmetry emerges as the natural property to rely on when studying quasi-one dimensional nanomaterials formally derived or grown via screw dislocations. The nonlinear elastic response of carbon nanotubes in torsion was derived with the symmetry-adapted MD and a density-functional-based tight-binding model. The critical strain beyond which tubes behave nonlinearly, the most favorable rippling morphology, and the twist- and morphology-related changes in fundamental band gap were identified from a rigorous atomistic description. There is a sharply contrasting behavior in the electronic response: while in single-walled tubes the band-gap variations are dominated by rippling, multiwalled tubes with small cores exhibit an unexpected insensitivity. Results are assistive for experiments performed on nanotubes-pedal devices. Despite its importance, little is known about how complex deformation modes alter the intrinsic electronic states of carbon nanotubes. We considered the rippling deformation mode characterized by helicoidal furrows and ridges and elucidate that a new intralayer strain effect rather than the known bilayer coupling and &sigma-&pi orbital mixing effects dominates its gapping. When an effective shear strain is used, it is possible to link both the electrical and the mechanical response of the complex rippled morphology to the known behavior of cylindrical tubes. Moving on to graphene, to describe the strain stored in helical nanoribbons, we supplement the standard elasticity concepts with an effective tensional strain. Using &pi -orbital tight binding and objective molecular dynamics coupled with density functional theory, we show that twisting couples the frontier conduction and valence bands, resulting in band-gap modulations. In spite of the edges and ridges of the helical nanoribbons, from the effective strain perspective these band-gap modulations appear strikingly similar with those exhibited by the seamless carbon nanotubes...|$|R
