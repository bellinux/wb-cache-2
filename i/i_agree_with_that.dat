50|$|During the 1996 Sochi film festival, Sergei Bodrov {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of director Aleksei Balabanov, who {{invited him to}} the STW film studio. It was here that the Brother was being filmed for release in 1997. Sergei played the starring role, Danila Bagrov. The movie was criticized by the media, accused of racism and Russophobia (as a film made for foreign audiences). Bodrov himself assessed his character in the following way: I know that Danila is often reproached for being primitive, simple and inarticulate. And in part <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> But a metaphor connected with him forms in my mind: I imagine people in a primitive chaos, who sit in their cave before the fire and do not understand anything else in their life except for the responsibility to eat and to reproduce. And suddenly one of them stands up and utters very simple words about how {{it is necessary to}} stand up for their friends, to respect women, to defend one's brother.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the novel}} for The New York Times, critic Michiko Kakutani wrote, [...] "The minute he starts talking, Peter Jernigan, {{the narrator of}} David Gates's {{astonishing}} first novel, grabs you by the lapels and compels {{you to listen to}} the sad-funny-tragic story of his life. His voice is one of those distinctive, all-American voices: brash, sarcastic, rueful and boyish, all at the same time. He sounds like a Holden Caulfield who has grown up to find himself trapped in a novel by Richard Yates." [...] Douglas Seibold of The Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "It is a compelling ride, and makes for compelling reading. But it is Jernigan's voice, the hectoring, profane, desperate voice with which he tells the story of his fall, that is the motivating force." [...] In reviewing the 2015 UK reissue of Jernigan for The Independent, Doug Johnstone wrote, [...] "Re-reading Jernigan, I was struck all over again at how brutal and brilliant it is. The author Stuart Evers, in his insightful and passionate foreword to this new edition, claims that it deserves to be rediscovered in a similar fashion to Stoner or Revolutionary Road. While <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> sentiment entirely, Jernigan feels like a more powerful piece of writing than those books, a howl into the abyss, a very modern American rage against the indignities of life and death." ...|$|E

5000|$|In June 2012, in an {{appearance}} on Democracy Now!, Finkelstein elaborated on his criticisms of the BDS movement: The problem as I see it with the BDS movement is not the tactic. Who could not support Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions? Of course you should. And most {{of the human rights}} organizations, church organizations have moved in that direction. The problem is the goal [...] [...] [...] The official BDS movement, they claim to be agnostic, neutral—whatever term you want to use—on the question of Israel. You can’t reach a broad public if you are agnostic on the question of Israel. The broad public wants to know, where do you stand? And if you claim not to have a stand, you lose them. The BDS movement, it always says, and I’m using their language, [...] "We are a rights-based organization. We are based in international law." [...] <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> That’s where you have to go: rights-based international law. But the international law is clear. You read the last sentence of the 2004 International Court of Justice opinion on the wall that Israel has been building in the West Bank, and the last sentence says, [...] "We look forward to two states: a Palestinian state alongside Israel and at peace with its neighbors." [...] That's the law.And {{if you want to go}} past that law or ignore the Israel part, you’ll never reach a broad public. And then it's a cult. Then it’s pointless, in my opinion. We're wasting time. And it's only a wasting of time. It becomes—and I know it's a strong word, and I hope I won't be faulted for it, but it becomes historically criminal, because there was a time where whatever we said, it made no difference. Nobody was listening. You could shout whatever you want—who cares? But now, actually, we can reach people. There is a possibility. I’m not saying a certainty. I'm not even saying a probability. But there is a possibility that we can reach a broad public. And so, we have to be very careful about the words we use, and we have to be very careful about the political strategy we map out. Otherwise, we're going to squander a real opportunity. And I don't want to squander it.|$|E

40|$|Justice Scalia {{believed}} in {{the rule of law}} as a law of rules. He wanted judges to be umpires, which ordinarily entails judges applying a settled legal principle to a particular set of facts. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> vision of the judiciary. But there are two major impediments in current jurisprudence to achieving that vision of the judge as umpire. The first is the ambiguity trigger in statutory interpretation. The second is the amorphous tests employed in cases involving claimed constitutional exceptions. We should identify and study these issues. Inspired by Justice Scalia’s longstanding efforts to improve the law, we all must continue to pursue the ideal of a neutral, impartial judiciary...|$|E
40|$|My {{work about}} {{statistics}} and probability. I {{realize that in}} some cases we can guess events by looking statistics. But our guess is a probability which tells how will be an events. This shows statistical results can also effect probibility. I started my study firstly giving information about statistics and probability. To give these informations firstly I made a research from books and internet. Working on statistics and probability could reveal their relation easily. I saw that in some situations probability is directly propotional to the statistics. For example we can guess a football match’s result with looking early matches’ results. And I found a table which shows result of challenges between Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray. These two teams’ new match can be guess by looking this table. But <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> there are infinite number of factors that can effect the result of match. So we can not find the absolute value of winning chance of a team. But as we increase the factors we thought we get close the real probability. This study also shows every event is not dependent to statistical results. Sometimes events can be independent from statistics and we can not guess their probability by looking statistics. Becuse these events has constant probabilities. For example throwing coin, tossing die… etc...|$|E
40|$|There is much in Professor Chemerinsky 2 ̆ 7 s and Professor Wells 2 ̆ 7 s {{thoughtful}} Articles {{with which}} I agree. My remarks, however, {{will focus on}} those areas in which I tend to disagree, or have a slightly different formulation of the issues. Both professors contend that parity should not be primarily understood as an empirical issue, but for rather different reasons-Wells because he thinks there is agreement about the empirical issue and Chemerinsky {{in part because he}} thinks {{that it is going to}} be difficult to find an answer to the empirical question. I agree with their conclusion, but will try to avoid taking sides by offering yet a third reason that I find more compelling. Chemerinsky also argues that the issue of parity should not be one for judicial policymaking. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> too, but I do not agree that it follows that Congress should have unfettered discretion to allocate jurisdiction between state and federal courts. I would like to argue that both professors have framed the issue of parity too narrowly by thinking only about state courts versus lower federal courts sitting in original jurisdiction. Neither professor seems to be thinking about parity in the larger context-about state court jurisdiction versus the federal judicial power of the United States as a whole. This is a context which would include not just original jurisdiction, but also appellate jurisdiction, not just lower federal court jurisdiction, but also Supreme Court jurisdiction. Widening the frame in this way would focus our attention on the ways in which lower federal courts could serve as de jure and de facto appellate tribunals over state courts in a wide array of doctrinal contexts. Let me now try to spell all that out...|$|E

40|$|Psychology {{begins with}} my {{article on the}} valid-ity {{of the family of}} MHLC scales. In that article, I try to show how {{difficult}} it is to provide researchers with a simple statement about the scales ’ validity, despite the fact that the litera-ture is replete with evidence to support such an assertion. In addition to this overview and my article on validity, the Special Issue contains nine articles, most of which present new findings using one or another of the MHLC scales. An exception to the empirical contributions in this Special Issue is an invited commentary by Luszczynska and Schwarzer containing a well-reasoned review of the MHLC construct and its measurement. In their commentary, Luszczynska and Schwarzer compare the construct of locus of control as applied to health to the construct of self-efficacy applied to health. Although these two constructs are conceptually related, the differences between them are important, and Luszczynska and Schwarzer argue, as I have elsewhere (Wallston, 1992), that self-efficacy may be a more critical construct to assess when predicting health behavior change. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> argument if an investigator has to make a choice between measures of one or another of those two constructs. From a theoretical stand-point, however, it would be preferable to assess both self-efficacy and health locus of control beliefs, and to examine interactions among them to predict behavior. Luszczynska and Schwarzer also recommend further refinement of the MHLC construct and scales, a point independently endorsed by Baken and Stephens ’ contribution in which they suggest that further development of the construct include two distinct aspects of control beliefs: strategy and capacity. Baken and Stephens tested a new, multidimensional measure of perceived control that includes strategy and capacity beliefs about ability, family, friends, money and luck as sources of control on 592 people sampled from the general population of New Zealand. In the Baken and Stephens study, Form A of the MHLC was used to validate their new Multi...|$|E
40|$|Danto {{thinks that}} the {{development}} of art history was over in 1964, because Andy Warhol's "Brillo Box" appeared. We can no longer make a distinction between this work of art and the real Brillo Box, which is just a commonplace object. However, the end of art does not mean we cannot make art anymore, nor does it mean that art has lost its value. It just means the concept of art is exhausted. No new style of art can emerge. There is no direction for art history to go on. Danto told us that there are two consequences of the end of art. One is we can find the essence of art and define art in terms of non-manifest properties. The other is pluralism. Danto was influenced by Hegel's view of art history, he used "self understanding of art" to interpret the development of art, and he thought {{that the development of}} modernist art is to find out the essence of art. The end of art means that art can no longer understands itself, it should pass this mission to philosophy. Although generally speaking <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> the interpretation of art history given by Danto, I think the end of modernism does not necessarily mean the end of art, and also {{there is no need to}} interpret the development of modernist art only from the perspective of seeking the essence of art. Moreover, I do not accept the definition proposed by Danto. I want to argue that we can define art when there is no essence. Besides discussing the problems of the end of art and the definition of art, I have also discussed problems that are related to pluralism, such as evaluation of art and postmodernism. 梁光耀. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2006. 參考文獻(p. 178 - 182).
