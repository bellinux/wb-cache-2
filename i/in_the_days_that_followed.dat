5|$|Jinnah {{rejected}} Gandhi's {{proposal and}} called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, {{and tens of thousands}} were injured in the cycle of violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b> Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.|$|E
5|$|The 39th and 2/14th Infantry Battalions withdrew {{south along}} the track {{on the western side}} of Eora Creek, passing through the 53rd which was holding Alola. The 2/16th withdrew south from Abuari along the eastern side of Eora Creek. Withdrawing in contact, several groups of Australians– {{including}} the 2/14th's headquarters company– found themselves isolated from the main body of Maroubra Force. In the confusion, an Australian counter-attack against the 3/144th caught a group of their own troops in a fierce crossfire. Although the counter-attack was ultimately successful in breaking through the Japanese blocking force, it also forced a large group of Australians off the track. Over several days large numbers trekked through the jungle in an effort to rejoin their units. Several were captured by the Japanese <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> including Key, who was executed by the Japanese after interrogation.|$|E

5|$|While the Potomac River forts {{were being}} built, {{planning}} and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts {{to protect the}} city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked {{efforts were made to}} defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington.|$|E
5|$|During the relief, the {{battalion}} suffered heavy shelling, which, {{after it had}} moved into trenches {{in front of the}} village along the sunken road to Courcellette, was followed by a brief German attack that was repulsed and resulted in {{the battalion}} capturing 20 Germans. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> the battalion worked to improve their defensive line, digging saps towards the German trenches while patrols were sent out into no man's land. Late on 8 August, the 15th put in an attack alongside a British battalion from the Suffolk Regiment, on their left. Amidst heavy shelling and machine-gun crossfire, the attack stalled following the loss of almost all of the officers in the assaulting companies; nevertheless, despite progress on their left, they succeeded in capturing part of the German line, but were ordered to withdraw the following day. On the night of 9 August, a second attack was put in, in concert with the 16th Battalion, which succeeded in securing part of the German line, despite heavy shelling. At noon the following day, the 15th was relieved as the 4th Brigade was withdrawn from the line and replaced by the 13th. Casualties during the battalion's first battle on the Western Front were high: 90 killed and 370 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, {{a bridge}} at Wairopi was {{destroyed}} by the withdrawing PIB troops who had been reinforced by a platoon of Australians from the 39th Infantry Battalion. There was a brief fire-fight on 24 July, before the Japanese began forcing a crossing of the Kumusi River in rubber assault boats supported by mortars and machine gun fire. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> skirmishes were fought around Gorari and at Oivi, before the Australians and Papuans were forced back to Deniki. From there, a small force was sent north to Kokoda, {{with the intent of}} holding the village and its logistically important airfield. Over the course of a fortnight, two important engagements were fought around Kokoda in late July and early August. This was followed by a short but sharp engagement around Deniki before the Australians withdrew towards Isurava on 14 August. In the short lull that followed, the Japanese began landing the main body of Horii's South Seas Detachment on the northern coast, while minor patrol actions resulted in several skirmishes north of Isurava.|$|E
