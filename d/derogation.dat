5|$|Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him {{to play for the}} championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, although I have deemed myself the equal of any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a <b>derogation</b> of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.|$|E

25|$|To {{investigate}} {{the salience of}} religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some {{studies have shown that}} greater religious attitudes may be significant predictors of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups. These effects are often conceptualized under the framework of intergroup bias, where religious individuals favor members of their ingroup (ingroup favoritism) and exhibit disfavor towards members of their outgroup (outgroup <b>derogation).</b> Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification. Many studies regarding religion and prejudice implement religious priming both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings with evidence supporting the perpetuation of ingroup favoritism and outgroup <b>derogation</b> in individuals who are high in religiosity.|$|E

40|$|Adoption {{of organic}} animal {{production}} legislation, {{particularly at the}} Community level, is done with a spirit of compromise and an attempt to reach consensus. In this sense, legal tools are used to solve technical problems so that an appreciable number of <b>derogations</b> (exceptions) are introduced. These may allow the use of certain feed additives, tethered animals or even application of castration. However, <b>derogations</b> should be avoided in legislation where harmonization is pursued, since they bring about distortion in the marketing of organic products. The validity of these <b>derogations</b> has expiry dates. However, at least the EU was hesitant {{to proceed with the}} necessary amendments to lift these <b>derogations</b> so that eliminate ambiguities and block loopholes. In turn, mention is made to geographical issues raised from the exceptions question posed again with the new EU Regulations. Furthermore some thoughts are expressed concerning the relationship between setting standards and the crucial role of values in agriculture, organic in particular, social aspects and pursued policy. Finally, the essential feature of this work is that <b>derogations</b> in legislation inevitably lead to conventionalization of organic animal production, which necessitates the clear definition of “organic”. To substantiate this, relevant arguments are put forward...|$|R

The rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) cover agricultural trade, but countries have found it expedient both to ask for <b>derogations</b> to protect their own domestic agicultural interests and also to be less rigorous in the enforcement of such rules even when <b>derogations</b> have not been requested...|$|R

25|$|When the Metrication Board was {{abolished}} in 1980, agreement {{had been}} reached with the EEC {{regarding the use of}} certain imperial measures until the end of 1989, a date that was subsequently extended to 1999. By this date most pre-packaged goods were sold in metric quantities with loose goods and goods weighed in front of the customer continuing to be sold in imperial quantities. In 1999, when the British Government allowed the <b>derogation</b> for the use of imperial units to lapse, all goods (apart from beer, cider and milk in returnable containers) had to be priced in metric units.|$|E

LaMountain continued his public <b>derogation</b> of Lowe as well as creating ill-will among the other men in the Corps. Lowe lodged a formal complaint to Gen. George B.

40|$|Several {{prominent}} {{human rights}} treaties attempt to minimize violations during emergencies by authorizing states to “derogate”—that is, to suspend certain {{civil and political}} liberties—in response to crises. The drafters of these treaties envisioned that international restrictions on <b>derogations</b> and international notification and monitoring mechanisms would limit rights suspensions during emergencies. This article analyzes the behavior of derogating countries using new global datasets of <b>derogations</b> and states of emergency from 1976 to 2007. We argue that <b>derogations</b> are a rational response to domestic political uncertainty. They enable governments facing serious threats to buy time and legal breathing space from voters, courts, and interest groups to confront crises while signaling to these audiences that rights deviations are temporary and lawful. Our findings have implications for the studies of treaty design and flexibility mechanisms and compliance with international human rights agreements...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the temporary <b>derogations,</b> that are automatically discontinued {{after the end of}} the transitional period, the Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification is permanent and its discontinuation is conditional only on the positive assessment of benchmarks fulfillment in the regular reports issued by the Commission. This is similar to the permanent <b>derogations</b> on Eurozone and Schengen Area for new member states (formulated in accession treaties), whose discontinuation is also conditional the on fulfillment of benchmarks (like the convergence criteria) and similarly assessed in regular progress reports. According to the treaties the new member states are obliged to fulfill the benchmarks for discontinuation of both these permanent <b>derogations</b> and the CVMs, but some of them deliberately delay these processes. The CVM is thus different from the Enhanced co-operation mechanism, where generally all EU members are free to opt-in at any time into an already established Enhanced co-operation initiative, without preconditions.|$|R
25|$|The {{right to}} strike {{is one of the}} {{essential}} means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their economic and social interests. The Committee considers that this basic right is not really guaranteed when a worker who exercises it legally runs the risk of seeing his or her job taken up permanently by another worker, just as legally. The Committee considers that, if a strike is otherwise legal, the use of labour drawn from outside the undertaking to replace strikers for an indeterminate period entails a risk of <b>derogation</b> from the {{right to strike}} which may affect the free exercise of trade union rights.|$|E

He once again sought his party's nomination for the post of Resident Commissioner in 2003, but was defeated by Luis Fortuño.

25|$|The {{national}} fiscal {{accounts for}} the previous full calendar year are released each year in April (next time 23 April 2015). As the compliance check for both the debt and deficit criteria always awaits this release in a new calendar year, the first possible month to request a compliance check will be April, which {{would result in a}} data check for the HICP and interest rates during the reference year from 1 April to 31 March. Any EU member state may also ask the European Commission to conduct a compliance check, at any point of time during the remainder of the year, with HICP and interest rates always checked for the past 12 months – while debt and deficit compliance always will be checked for the three-year period encompassing the last completed full calendar year and the two subsequent forecast years. As of 10 August 2015, none of the remaining euro <b>derogation</b> states without an opt-out had entered ERM-II, which makes it highly unlikely that any of them will request that the European Commission conduct an extraordinary compliance check ahead of the publication of the next regular convergence report scheduled June 2016.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{weights and}} {{measures}} legislation in the United Kingdom only applied to trade, but when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community, it had to align its legislation with EEC directives that were in place. These directives included EEC directive 71/354/EEC which related to {{weights and measures}} and which required the United Kingdom to formally define in law a number of units of measure, hitherto formally undefined in law including those for electric current (ampere), electric potential difference (volt), temperature (degree Celsius and kelvin), pressure (pascal), energy (joule) and power (watt).Due to public opposition to metrication (in 1979, 46% were opposed to the programme), the programme stalled. In the late 1970s, the United Kingdom government asked the EEC to postpone the deadlines for the introduction of metric units. The result was the repeal of directive 71/354/EEC {{and the introduction of}} directive 80/181/EEC. This new directive contained a <b>derogation</b> allowing for the continued use in the United Kingdom, until the end of 1989 (subsequently extended to 1995), of many imperial units then in use for trade. The directive should have been transposed into United Kingdom law by 30 June 1981, but this transposition only occurred with the enactment of The Weights and Measures Act 1985, which also removed from the statute book a large number of imperial units of measure that had fallen into disuse {{as a result of the}} completed elements of the metrication programme.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the most}} {{important}} rights were codified in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in 2000. While the UK has opted out of direct application of the Charter, this has little practical relevance since the Charter merely reflected pre-existing principles and the Court of Justice uses the Charter to interpret all EU law. For example, in Test-Achats ASBL v Conseil des ministres, the Court of Justice held that Equal Treatment in Goods and Services Directive 2004 article 5(2), which purported to allow a <b>derogation</b> from equal treatment, so men and women could be charged different car insurance rates, was unlawful. It contravened the principle of equality in CFREU 2000 articles 21 and 23, and had to be regarded as ineffective after a transition period. By contrast, in Deutsches Weintor eG v Land Rheinland-Pfalz wine producers claimed that a direction to stop marketing their brands as 'easily digestible' (bekömmlich) by the state food regulator (acting under EU law) contravened their right to occupational and business freedom under CFREU 2000 articles 15 and 16. The Court of Justice held that in fact, the right to health for consumers in article 35 has also to be taken into account, and was to be given greater weight, particularly given the health effects of alcohol. Some rights in the Charter, however, are not expressed with sufficient clarity to be regarded as directly binding. In AMS v Union locale des syndicats CGT a French trade union claimed that the French Labour Code should not exclude casual workers from counting toward the right to set up a work council that an employing entity must inform and consult. They said this contravened the Information and Consultation of Employees Directive and also CFREU article 27. The Court of Justice agreed that the French Labour Code was incompatible with the Directive, but held that article 27 was expressed too generally to create direct rights. On this view, legislation was necessary to make abstract human rights principles concrete, and legally enforceable.|$|E

30|$|The key {{question}} {{in the context of}} storage of health data is always with regard to the purpose. The GDPR provides several exemptions and <b>derogations</b> for the use of health data, e.g. in the context of research or public health purposes under certain conditions. Typical procedures in this context include the application of ethical standards for scientific research as mentioned in Recital 33 and the implementation of organisational and technical safeguards as mentioned in Article 89 including anonymisation, pseudonymisation and encryption [2]. Pseudonymisation is generally recommended as long as the research purposes can be fulfilled in this manner. With the condition of such safeguards, the GDPR creates exemptions for researchers to process sensitive health data even beyond the purposes for which they were collected. In addition, the GDPR provides some room for manoeuvre for national regulations (<b>derogations</b> defined by a law) in this context. It is clearly emphasised, however, that exemptions and <b>derogations</b> for research purposes should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers, insurance or banking companies (Recital 54, [1].|$|R
