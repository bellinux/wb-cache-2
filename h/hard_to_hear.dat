(Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft ork) by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short roo-oo) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound that is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of a symbol for a chord defines {{the root of the}} chord. The root of the chord is always played by one of the {{instruments}} in the ensemble (usually by a bass instrument). Failure to include the root means that the indicated chord may be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> for some listeners. By convention, the root alone indicates a simple major triad, i.e., the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. After this, various additional symbols are added to modify this chord. There is unfortunately no universal standard for these symbols. The most common ones are below.|$|E

At higher speeds the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise. However, a 2011 study, commissioned by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) and conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory, found little correlation between pedestrian vehicle involvement density and noise level for the majority of vehicles. In addition, the analysis found no evidence of a pattern in pedestrian vehicle involvement densities when only considering those accidents occurring on [...] or slower roads, or where the pedestrian was disabled. A previous study did not found an increased pedestrian vehicle involvement density for electric and hybrid vehicles with respect to their conventional counterparts which raised the question as to whether added sound is necessarily required.|$|E

The parking lots near the Field House were used as a staging area for ambulances and fire trucks that arrived from throughout the region. At 3:13p.m., Sergeant Ellington advised that there were at least two deaths. Officers encountered several problems, including a piercing fire alarm that had been pulled, as well as very high radio traffic and static that made it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> radio calls come in. In addition, due to conflicting reports (including the presence of a shooter at Founders Memorial Library) and the multitude of injured victims at various buildings around campus, officers needed to check multiple sites to rule out the possibility of multiple shooters and multiple shooting sites. [...] Injured victims began appearing at Neptune Hall (just north of Cole Hall) and at DuSable Hall (west of Cole). At 3:21p.m., as personnel arrived from the DeKalb Fire Department, DeKalb County Sheriff's Office, DeKalb Police Department, and Sycamore Police Department, officers advised that the scene and perimeter of Cole Hall were secure, and that it was safe for emergency personnel to proceed to the shooting site and to the sites of the injured victims.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the recording of their fourth album, as the group was taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Sessions proved to {{be difficult for the}} band as Wentz started taking LSD when Zach Blair lead guitarist for Rise Against made him try it at a party in April 2008. The goal in Wentz using LSD was to hope it would influence his songwriting, but it just made him distracted from writing songs, which annoyed Stump, so he stopped using LSD in August 2008. Wentz later said he had taken LSD over 50 times. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, Trohman felt he and Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff I was reading. It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie à Deux. [...] "It made me feel like I owned the songs a lot more. It made me really excited about contributing to Fall Out Boy and made me find my role in the band," [...] Trohman recalled.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The NIOSH Hearing Loss Simulator is a {{software}} training and communication tool for promoting hearing loss prevention. It allows a user or trainer {{to demonstrate the}} effects of noise exposure on hearing without experiencing an actual noise-induced hearing loss. Estimates {{of the effects of}} different levels of noise exposure are based on the American National Standard Determination of Occupational Noise Exposure and Estimation of Noise-Induced Hearing Impairment, otherwise known as ANSI S 3. 44. This standard specifies the predicted hearing loss for noise-exposed populations of individuals based on risk factors that include gender, age, sound levels (in A-weighted decibels or dBA), and years of exposure. Algorithms specified in the standard were derived from empirical studies of populations that had no exposure to loud noise and other populations that had experienced various levels and durations of noise exposure. This manual explains the major objectives that can be addressed with the simulator and training scenarios that can be applied to real-life, real-worker scenarios. The majority of this guide explains the simulator's functions in detail. Simulator users are encouraged to read this manual while learning how to run the software. [] Training Objectives The main objective of the Hearing Loss Simulator is to increase motivation for taking effective hearing prevention action by demonstrating simulated noise-induced hearing losses. [The Simulator can also help teach the following facts about hearing loss. Hearing loss is affected by noise levels. Hearing loss worsens as the noise exposure duration increases. Hearing loss can become permanent. Hearing loss makes it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> what others say. Most hearing loss is not caused by age. Speech is made up of both low and high pitch sounds. <b>Hearing</b> loss due <b>to</b> noise makes it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> high pitch sounds. <b>Hearing</b> loss due <b>to</b> noise has less of an effect on hearing low pitch sounds. ...|$|R

2500|$|Most private {{healthcare}} providers in the United States {{do not provide}} coverage for hearing aids, so all costs are usually borne by the recipient.

Though if an adult has a hearing loss which substantially limits major life activities, some state-run vocational rehabilitation programs can provide upwards of full financial assistance. Severe and profound hearing loss often falls within the [...] "substantially limiting" [...] category.
