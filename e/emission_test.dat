40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the abilities of acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> and self-sensing fibres to detect damage in composite materials. This was achieved by performing acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> on fibre samples and resin samples during tensile tests. In parallel to the acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> the changes in strain for the resin samples was recorded using electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. Acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> of Self-sensing fibre composites allowed the recorded changes in the light intensity transmitted by the fibres to be analysed in conjunction with the acoustic emission data. The fabrication of the three different sample types is presented as is the installation of the electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. The experimental procedure and method of data capture is detailed for tensile and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing,</b> strain data and Self-sensing fibre data. The fabrication and testing of the samples was performed successfully. The testing procedure and analysis of results demonstrates the accurate use of acoustic emission and the potential of self-sensing fibres in detecting damage in composite materials...|$|R

50|$|<b>Emission</b> <b>test</b> (front plate) and vehicle {{safety test}} (rear plate) {{stickers}} were also {{attached to the}} plate before 2010, in which year the emission sticker became obsolete as the <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> was incorporated into the safety test and was not performed separately any more. The expiration date can be figured out as follows: The year is in {{the centre of the}} sticker, and the stickers are attached with the month of expiration pointing upwards. The black marking on the side (near the 12) thus makes it easy for the police to see the expiration month from a distance. Like a clock, the marking shows the same position of a number on the face of a clock. For example, the black marking is on the left side, so it is the ninth month (or 9 o'clock) and hence the expiry date is 30 September. The six possible colors code for the year when the next safety test is due and repeat once a six-year period has passed.|$|E
