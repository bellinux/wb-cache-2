5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, <b>junctional,</b> and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The <b>junctional</b> epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Junctional</b> nevus: the nevus {{cells are}} located along the {{junction}} of the epidermis and the underlying dermis. A <b>junctional</b> nevus is flat and brown to black.|$|E
25|$|Intramucosal nevus: <b>junctional</b> nevus of the mucosa of {{the mouth}} or genital areas. In the mouth, they are found most {{frequently}} on the hard palate.|$|E
25|$|Compound nevus: {{a mixture}} of <b>junctional</b> and {{intradermal}} proliferation. Compound nevi are slightly raised and brown to black. Beauty marks are usually compound nevi of either the acquired variety or congenital variety.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between the gingiva and the tooth is called the dentogingival junction. This junction has three epithelial types: gingival, sulcular, and <b>junctional</b> epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth.|$|E
25|$|It often {{requires}} a dermatologist to fully evaluate moles. For instance, a small blue or bluish-black spot, often called a blue nevus, is usually benign but often mistaken for melanoma. Conversely, a <b>junctional</b> nevus, which develops {{at the junction}} of the dermis and epidermis, is potentially cancerous.|$|E
25|$|ECG changes seen in {{a patient}} taking digoxin include {{increased}} PR interval (due to decreased AV conduction) and a shortened QT interval. Also, the T wave may be inverted and accompanied by ST depression. It may cause AV <b>junctional</b> rhythm and ectopic beats (bigeminy) resulting in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|A Health Technology Assessment {{found that}} {{sclerotherapy}} provided less benefit than surgery, but {{is likely to}} provide a small benefit in varicose veins without reflux from the sapheno-femoral or sapheno-popliteal junctions. It did not study the relative benefits of surgery and sclerotherapy in varicose veins with <b>junctional</b> reflux.|$|E
25|$|Staging {{is based}} on the TNM staging system, which classifies the amount of tumor {{invasion}} (T), involvement of lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M). The currently preferred classification is the 2010 AJCC staging system for cancer of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. To help guide clinical decision making, this system also incorporates information on cell type (ESCC, EAC, etc.), grade (degree of differentiation – an indication of the biological aggressiveness of the cancer cells), and tumor location (upper, middle, lower, or <b>junctional).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{heart of}} the {{adherent}} junctions are the cadherin proteins. Cadherins form the cell-cell <b>junctional</b> structures known as adherens junctions {{as well as the}} desmosomes. Cadherins are capable of homophilic interactions through their extracellular cadherin repeat domains, in a Ca2+-dependent manner: this can hold adjacent epithelial cells together. While in the adherens junction, cadherins recruit β-catenin molecules onto their intracellular regions. β-catenin, in turn, associates with another important protein, α-catenin that directly binds to the actin filaments. This is possible because α-catenin and cadherins bind at distinct sites to β-catenin. The β-catenin – α-catenin complex can thus physically bridge cadherins with the actin cytoskeleton. Organization of the cadherin–catenin complex is additionally regulated through phosphorylation and endocytosis of its components.|$|E
25|$|Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing {{invariant}} T {{cell receptors}} (TCRs), such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells exhibit characteristics that place {{them at the}} border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells may be considered a component of adaptive immunity in that they rearrange TCR genes to produce <b>junctional</b> diversity and develop a memory phenotype. However, the various subsets may also be {{considered part of the}} innate immune system where a restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as a pattern recognition receptor. For example, according to this paradigm, large numbers of Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted intraepithelial Vδ1 T cells will respond to stressed epithelial cells.|$|E

500|$|The American Cream Draft {{is a rare}} {{draft horse}} breed, the only such breed {{developed}} in the United States that is still in existence. It is recognized by its cream color, known as [...] "gold champagne", produced {{by the action of}} the champagne gene upon a chestnut base color, and by its amber eyes, also characteristic of the gene; the only other color found in the breed is chestnut. Like several other breeds of draft horses, the American Cream is at risk for the autosomal recessive genetic disease <b>junctional</b> epidermolysis bullosa.|$|E
500|$|The {{autosomal}} {{recessive genetic disease}} <b>junctional</b> epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) {{has been found in}} some American Cream Drafts. This is a lethal genetic disorder that causes newborn foals to lose large areas of skin and have other abnormalities, normally leading to euthanasia of the animal. It is most commonly associated with Belgian horses, but is also found in other draft breeds. A DNA test was developed in 2002, and JEB can be avoided as long as two carriers are not bred to one another. The American Cream registry states that it has [...] "been pro-active in testing its registered animals since JEB was discovered".|$|E

2500|$|Much about gingival {{formation}} {{is not fully}} understood, but {{it is known that}} hemidesmosomes form between the gingival epithelium and the tooth and are responsible for the primary epithelial attachment. Hemidesmosomes provide anchorage between cells through small filament-like structures provided by the remnants of ameloblasts. [...] Once this occurs, <b>junctional</b> epithelium forms from reduced enamel epithelium, one of the products of the enamel organ, and divides rapidly. This results in the perpetually increasing size of the <b>junctional</b> epithelial layer and the isolation of the remnants of ameloblasts from any source of nutrition. As the ameloblasts degenerate, a gingival sulcus is created.|$|E
2500|$|Based on the 1961 {{paper by}} Gargiulo, the mean {{biologic}} width {{was determined to}} be 2.04mm, of which 1.07mm is occupied by the connective tissue attachment and another approximate 0.97mm is occupied by the <b>junctional</b> epithelium.. J Perio 1961;32:261–267. [...] Because it is impossible to perfectly restore a tooth to the precise coronal edge of the <b>junctional</b> epithelium, it is often recommended to remove enough bone to have 3mm between the restorative margin and the crest of alveolar bone..

2500|$|HMB-45 is a {{monoclonal}} antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas. It {{is used in}} anatomic pathology as a marker for such tumors. [...] The antibody was generated to an extract of melanoma. It reacts positively against melanocytic tumors but not other tumors, thus demonstrating specificity and sensitivity. The antibody also reacts positively against <b>junctional</b> nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.|$|E
2500|$|Biologic width is the {{distance}} established by [...] "the <b>junctional</b> epithelium and connective tissue {{attachment to the}} root surface" [...] of a tooth. [...] In other words, it is the height between the deepest point of the gingival sulcus and the alveolar bone crest. This distance {{is important to consider}} when fabricating dental restorations, because they must respect the natural architecture of the gingival attachment if harmful consequences are to be avoided. The biologic width is patient specific and may vary anywhere from 0.75-4.3mm.|$|E
2500|$|In humans, {{mutations}} in the XRCC4 gene cause microcephalic primordial dwarfism, a phenotype characterized by marked microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, developmental delay and short stature. [...] Although immunoglobulin <b>junctional</b> diversity is impaired, these individuals {{do not show}} a recognizable immunological phenotype. [...] In contrast to individuals with a [...] LIG4 mutation, pancytopenia resulting in bone marrow failure is not observed in individuals with XRCC4 deficiency. [...] At the cellular level, disruption of XRCC4 induces hypersensitivity to agents that induce double-strand breaks, defective double-strand break repair and increased apoptosis after induction of DNA damage.|$|E
2500|$|Attachment {{occurs with}} the aid of the virus σ1 protein. This is a {{filamentous}} trimer protein that projects out of the outer capsid of the virus. There are two receptors for the virus on the host cell. There is the <b>junctional</b> adhesion molecule-A, which is a serotype-independent receptor as well as the sialic acid coreceptor. Viral proteins μ1 and σ3 [...] are responsible for attachment by binding to the receptors. After the attachment to the receptors, entry to the host cell occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis through the aid of clathrin coated pits.|$|E
2500|$|This [...] "barrier" [...] {{results from}} the {{selectivity}} of the tight junctions between endothelial cells in CNS vessels, which restricts the passage of solutes. [...] At the interface between blood and the brain, endothelial cells are stitched together by these tight junctions, which are composed of smaller subunits, frequently biochemical dimers, that are transmembrane proteins such as occludin, claudins, <b>junctional</b> adhesion molecule (JAM), or ESAM, for example. Each of these transmembrane proteins is anchored into the endothelial cells by another protein complex that includes ZO-1 and associated proteins.|$|E
2500|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} is a premalignant condition. [...] Its malignant sequela, oesophagogastric <b>junctional</b> adenocarcinoma, has a {{mortality rate}} of over 85%. [...] The {{risk of developing}} esophageal adenocarcinoma in people who have Barrett's esophagus has been estimated to be 6–7 per 1000 person-years, however a cohort study of 11,028 patients from Denmark published in 2011 showed an incidence of only 1.2 per 1000 person-years (5.1 per 1000 person-years in patients with dysplasia, 1.0 per 1000 person-years in patients without dysplasia). The relative risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma is approximately 10 in those with Barret's esophagus, compared to the general population. Most patients with esophageal carcinoma survive less than one year.|$|E
2500|$|Mutations {{result from}} errors during DNA {{replication}} or {{other types of}} damage to DNA (such as {{may be caused by}} exposure to radiation or carcinogens), which then may undergo error-prone repair (especially microhomology-mediated end joining), or cause an error during other forms of repair, or else may cause an error during replication (translesion synthesis). [...] Mutations may also result from insertion or deletion of segments of DNA due to mobile genetic elements. [...] Mutations may or may not produce discernible changes in the observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism. Mutations play a part in both normal and abnormal biological processes including: evolution, cancer, and the development of the immune system, including <b>junctional</b> diversity.|$|E
2500|$|CRISPR can be {{utilized}} to create human cellular models of disease. For instance, applied to human {{pluripotent stem cells}} CRISPR introduced targeted mutations in genes relevant to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). These CRISPR-modified pluripotent stem cells were subsequently grown into human kidney organoids that exhibited disease-specific phenotypes. Kidney organoids from stem cells with PKD mutations formed large, translucent cyst structures from kidney tubules. The cysts were capable of reaching macroscopic dimensions, up to one centimeter in diameter. Kidney organoids with mutations in a gene linked to FSGS developed <b>junctional</b> defects between podocytes, the filtering cells affected in that disease. This was traced to the inability of podocytes ability to form microvilli between adjacent cells. [...] Importantly, these disease phenotypes were absent in control organoids of identical genetic background, but lacking the CRISPR modifications.|$|E
2500|$|Gamma delta T cells [...] (γδ T cells) {{possess an}} {{alternative}} T cell receptor (TCR) {{as opposed to}} CD4+ and CD8+ αβ T cells and share characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted natural killer T cells, γδ T cells exhibit characteristics that place them at the border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells may be considered a component of adaptive immunity in that they rearrange TCR genes via V(D)J recombination, which also produces <b>junctional</b> diversity, and develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, however, the various subsets may also be {{considered part of the}} innate immune system where a restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as a pattern recognition receptor. For example, according to this paradigm, large numbers of Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted intraepithelial Vδ1 T cells respond to stressed epithelial cells.|$|E
2500|$|Abnormalities in {{conduction}} and repolarization of {{the heart}} that can result from anorexia nervosa include QT prolongation, increased QT dispersion, conduction delays, [...] and <b>junctional</b> escape rhythms. Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, can cause anomalies in the electrical activity {{of the heart}}, and result in life-threatening arrhythmias. Hypokalemia most commonly results in anorexic patients when restricting is accompanied by purging (induced vomiting or laxative use). Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common, and symptoms include fatigue and weakness. Orthostatic hypotension, a marked decrease in blood pressure when standing from a supine position, may also occur. Symptoms include lightheadedness upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment, and may result in fainting or near-fainting. Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization. [...] Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes atrophy of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased ability to pump blood, {{a reduction in the}} ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue. Some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size normalizes over weeks to months, with recovery. Atrophy of the heart muscle is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or palpitations; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the mitral valve remains the same size. Studies have shown rates of mitral valve prolapse of around 20 percent in those with anorexia nervosa, while the rate in the general population is estimated at 2–4 percent. It has been suggested that there is an association between mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death, but it has not been proven to be causative, either in patients with anorexia nervosa or in the general population.|$|E

50|$|<b>Junctional</b> {{transmission}} {{is measured in}} seconds to minutes. The time course of the <b>junctional</b> potential has been divided into two most frequently observed time courses representing ‘close’ and ‘wide’ <b>junctional</b> transmissions. The “close” <b>junctional</b> {{transmission is}} associated with fast junction potential and the “wide” <b>junctional</b> transmission is associated with slow junction potential. The slow electrical potentials reach a peak in about 150 ms and then decline with a time constant between 250 and 500 ms. These responses typically last several seconds to minutes and may be depolarizing and excitatory, or hyperpolarizing and inhibitory, and have been called slow EJP or slow IJP, respectively.|$|E
