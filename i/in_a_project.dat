40|$|M. Ing. This {{dissertation}} {{gives an}} understanding of principles that can be implemented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>projects</b> department to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. This dissertation consists of a literature review and a case study. The literature review gives a background on principles that can be implemented to improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of <b>a</b> <b>projects</b> department. The effective design of projects {{and the importance of}} establishing specifications have been reviewed. Tools such as business process reengineering can be used to rethink and redesign processes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>projects</b> department to improve its current way of working. Materials requirement planning is another tool that can be used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>projects</b> department to calculate how many types of a specific product are required at any specific time. Just-in-time planning and control is a philosophy that can be implemented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>projects</b> department to meet demands immediately, thus improving their effectiveness. Quality management tools and techniques can be implemented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>projects</b> department. Total quality management, leadership and teamwork will help to convey good practises, generate interest, ideas and awareness in the department. The literature also explains the importance of ergonomics. Ergonomics <b>in</b> workplaces has <b>an</b> affect on the performance, fatigue and physical strain of the staff. Assessing the projects department and applying ergonomics to it will help the staff of the department to be more efficient and effective in their work. The literature further explains the stages involved in the risk management process. Developing an initial risk management plan is an effective and efficient way to identify and prevent risks at an early stage. The case study is about different principles brought together and implemented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> newly formed <b>projects</b> department to improve its way of work. Principles were identified through surveys that were given to various stakeholders. These principles guided the projects department to be more efficient and effective in their way of work...|$|R

Up until his death, he collaborated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928.

5|$|In 1986, the station's twin towers, {{which had}} been Grade II listed in 1972, were {{restored}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> costing £242,000 (now £).

The brickwork was repaired, cleaned and repointed, and the weather vanes gilded to complement the dome of nearby St Paul's Cathedral. This work {{was one of the}} Railway Heritage Trust's first projects and coincided with an exhibition held in the station in August of the same year to mark its 150th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Livestock Conservancy began {{investigating}} the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it was truly a descendant of colonial Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type for Spanish horses. In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, the creation of a new studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} re-excavated in July 2013 {{to learn more}} about the friary church, before {{building}} work on the adjacent disused school building. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> co-funded by Leicester City Council and the University of Leicester, a single trench about twice the area of the 2012 trenches was excavated. It succeeded in exposing the entirety of the sites of the Greyfriars presbytery and choir sites, confirming archaeologists' earlier hypotheses about the layout of the church's east end. Three burials identified but not excavated in the 2012 project were tackled afresh. One burial was found to have been interred in a wooden coffin in a well-dug grave, while a second wooden-coffined burial was found under and astride the choir and presbytery; its position suggests that it pre-dates the church.|$|E
