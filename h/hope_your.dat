500|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} version of events was that Richardson had contracted flu during the tour and asked Waylon Jennings for his seat on the plane. When Holly learned that Jennings {{was not going to}} fly, he said in jest: [...] "Well, I <b>hope</b> <b>your</b> ol' bus freezes up." [...] Jennings responded: [...] "Well, I <b>hope</b> <b>your</b> ol' plane crashes", a humorous but ill-fated response that haunted him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|King George {{also had}} a {{personal}} friendship with the Marlboroughs; the Duke of Marlborough had fought {{with him in the}} War of the Spanish Succession, and John and Sarah made frequent visits to the Hanoverian court during their effective exile from England. George's first words to Marlborough as King of Great Britain were, [...] "My lord Duke, I <b>hope</b> <b>your</b> troubles are now over;" [...] Marlborough was restored to his old office of Captain-General of the Army.|$|E
500|$|The Winter Dance Party tour {{began in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel created {{logistical}} problems, as {{the distance between}} venues had not been considered when scheduling each performance. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer Carl Bunch suffered frostbite to his toes (while aboard the bus) and was hospitalized, so Buddy Holly {{made the decision to}} find another means of transportation. Before their performance at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered a four-seat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane at Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, Iowa, for himself, Jennings, and Tommy Allsup, to avoid the long bus trip to their next venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. Following the Clear Lake show (which ended around midnight), Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the charter plane to Ritchie Valens, while Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson, who was suffering from the flu and complaining about how cold and uncomfortable the tour bus was for a man of his size. When Holly learned that his bandmates had given up their seats on the plane and had chosen to take the bus rather than fly, a friendly banter between Holly and Jennings ensued, and it would come back to haunt Jennings for decades to follow: Holly jokingly told Jennings, [...] "Well, I <b>hope</b> <b>your</b> ol' bus freezes up!" [...] Jennings jokingly replied, [...] "Well, I <b>hope</b> <b>your</b> ol' plane crashes!" [...] Less than {{an hour and a half}} later, shortly after 1:00am on February 3, 1959 (later known as The Day the Music Died), Holly's charter plane crashed at full throttle into a cornfield outside Mason City, Iowa, instantly killing all on board.|$|E

500|$|It was in New Hampshire where Huntsman adopted his new [...] "Country First" [...] {{campaign}} slogan. The slogan was {{borrowed from}} John McCain's 2008 campaign, though {{the context of}} the slogan was different. Huntsman, who, as Governor of Utah at the time, endorsed McCain over Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary, had hoped McCain would return the favor; however, McCain endorsed Romney in a rally at Manchester's Manchester Central High School on January 4. Huntsman later characterized McCain's endorsement of his main rival as a [...] "petty betrayal". He told McCain [...] "I don't care if you support Romney, that's great – but just to have given me the dignity of waiting until after the New Hampshire primary." [...] McCain replied, [...] "I didn't mean to offend. I <b>hope</b> <b>your</b> family is well." ...|$|E
500|$|Rising {{standards}} of achievement at Dartington enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute {{from one of}} the audience: [...] "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I <b>hope</b> <b>your</b> services will be required and that I will be in the chorus". By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and [...] 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission [...] to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival. Sensing {{that it was time to}} leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.|$|E
500|$|Yesterday Major BOYLE Roche, {{representative}} in parliament for Tralee (who is raising {{a body of}} men for his Majesty's service) began recruiting here, and met with great success, which is not surprising, if we consider his connexions, and the uncommon support he has received from the noblemen and gentlemen of this province. His method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed the procession, which was as follows: Major Roche, bearing a large purse of gold. Captain Cowley. A great number of likely recruits. An elegant band of music, consisting of French horns, hautboys , clarionets, and bassoons, playing God Save the King. A large brewer's dray, with five-barrels of beer, the horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with ribbands. Two draymen with cockades to serve the beer, The recruiting serjeant. Drums [...] fifes. Another division of recruits. The returning soldiers. Prodigious concourse of [...] The following speech was made by Major Roche to the populace: Being appointed, through the favour of [...] most excellent governor, to raise a body of men for the service of his Majesty, I think it [...] most happy circumstance {{of my life to}} be the instrument of leading you to honour and renown. The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [...] the globe [...] war, have procured us a fame so glorious as not to be equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice, nor the effects of time: not an action in which we were not victorious, not a siege in which we were not honoured. Will you, my dear countrymen, permit those laurels to fade, or those actions to be forgotten? No, forbid it, heaven! Let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity, and a confirmation of our loyalty. A more critical period never presented itself, nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, than the present, as his Majesty's deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion, and like unnatural children, wound their ever indulgent parent, forgetting the torrents of blood spilt, and heap of treasure expended for their preservation. His Sacred Majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us, and I <b>hope</b> <b>your</b> instinct prompts you, to obey the dictates of so [...] a master. Let us then, my brave and loyal countrymen, join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in the glorious cause of our Creator, our King and our Country.|$|E

2500|$|In 1908, Alexander {{had written}} to Grinnell asking for a {{recommendation}} of someone suitable for the upcoming 1908 expedition.

2500|$|Quite a few critics {{cited the}} long and {{fragmented}} development time as {{a major factor in}} the finished product. In a positive review PC Gamer noted that [...] "years of anticipation will spoil Duke Nukem Forever for some", adding, [...] "There’s no reinvention of the genre here, no real attempt at grandeur... Check unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers", and concluded, [...] "Don’t expect a miracle. Duke is still the hero we love, but struggles to keep up with modern times." [...] Game Informer, whilst disappointed in the game concluded [...] "I'm glad Gearbox stepped up and finished this game, but after hearing about it for 12 years, I have no desire to relive any of it again. I’m now satisfied in my knowledge of what Duke Nukem Forever is and ready to never talk about it again. Welcome back, Duke. I <b>hope</b> <b>your</b> next game (which is teased after the credits) goes off without a hitch." [...] GiantBomb however concluded that for those [...] "part of that faction that finds yourself so fascinated by this whole project that you need to know how it ends, I recommend you play Duke Nukem Forever for yourself. But I'd practically insist that you do so on the PC and try to wait for a sale. If you're not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it has some kind of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on." [...] Jake Denton of Computer and Video Games wrote that parts of the game were fun to play and listed it as one of the [...] "5 most underrated games of 2011", while admitting the game's overall faulty structure.
