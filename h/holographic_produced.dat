50|$|The company mainly {{specialized}} {{in the production}} of the large format white-light-viewable rainbow hologram, a type of holography originally invented in 1968 by Dr. Stephen Benton of MIT. IN fact, while all rainbow holograms are white-light-viewable the most commonly known application of the technique has been applied to reflectve substrates like PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and PET (poly ethylene terephthalate) and used widely on credit cards and as anti-counterfeiting applications on labeling of products. Australian Holographics applied the principle for transmission rather than reflective viewing conditions. In 1992, Australian <b>Holographics</b> <b>produced</b> a 2×1 metre rainbow transmission hologram of a Mitsubishi station wagon car, which was shown at Holographics International '92 conference in London.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} <b>producing</b> <b>holographic</b> stereograms with reduced {{geometrical}} constraints is presented. The type of <b>holographic</b> stereogram <b>produced,</b> called the ULTRAGRAM, {{can offer a}} combination of large viewing zone, arbitrary viewing distance, minimal image distortion, and high spatial resolution, depending on alterable parameters in the image processing software. Computerbased image processing techniques are used to mimic the effect of optical devices while permitting simple re-configurability. The ULTRAGRAM holographic exposure apparatus can be built with reduced attention to the final viewing geometry. An astigmatic computer graphics camera design greatly simplifies image generation. The techniques described are applicable to both one and multi-step stereograms, optical predistortion methods, and both horizontal and full-parallax systems...|$|R

Methods for the interpretation of time-averaged <b>holographic</b> fringes <b>produced</b> by non-linear oscillations of microelectromechanical systems has been investigated in this work. Finite element model of a fixed-fixed beam, performing nonlinear oscillations, provides valuable insight into the motions of investigated systems.

The developed algorithmic implementation and original line tracing methods make this scheme robust to noise and various distortions in the original optical image. Finally, an image hiding scheme based on computer generated holography and dynamic visual cryptography is proposed. The secret image is embedded into the stochastic geometric moiré cover image.

40|$|Digital {{holography}} {{is a novel}} {{technique that}} has been developed recently to study living cells. The technique is an innovative, non-destructive method with possibilities to study living cells over time. We are investigating cell number, growth, viability and death of adherent cells using digital holography, which is a novel, label-free, imaging technique for biological applications. We have recently demonstrated that digital holography is highly comparable to the conventional manual cell counting method using a hemocytometer (Mölder et al., 2008). Digital holography is a method that gives us information about the refractive index of cells, which can change under different circumstances. The technique is cheap, fast and simple to use. The unique measurable parameters are the cell number, cell area, thickness and volume, which can be transformed to proliferation, migration, viability and cell death. The digital <b>holographic</b> images <b>produced</b> can provide both quantitative and qualitative phase information from a single hologram. Future applications can include real-time cell monitoring of various parameters of cells of different diseases in response to clinically relevant compounds...|$|R

The Mueller matrix has been used to quantify changes in the polarization in diffracted orders containing optical vortices. Decomposition of the Mueller matrices estimates the polarizing properties, such as diattenuation, retardance and depolarization of the system. We find that the system is a non-depolarizing system.
