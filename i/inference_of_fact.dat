40|$|This work {{is divided}} into three main parts or chapters. Chapter I deals with the {{concepts}} of the basic entities with which historians are concerned. ‘Fact’ (something that is the case) is distinguished from ‘event’ (something that occurs or happens) and also from ‘interpretation’ or ‘theory’. ‘Event’ is delimited from ‘Situation’ (something which is changed by an event) as well as from ‘thing’ (something which is a situation) but it is shown that the differences between the three – as well as the deference between event and ‘superevents’ – is relative to the point of view adopted by the historian. Chapter II deals that the question of how the knowledge <b>of</b> simple historical <b>fact</b> (as opposed to connexions between facts) is acquired and validated. The general presuppositions are examined which are necessary for the <b>inference</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> from evidence, and the concept of evidence itself is subjected to an analysis whereby the role of the interpretation of data is emphasised and distinction are drawn between different kinds of evidence (direct and circumstantial, records and remains) and their reliability. Chapter III deals with the adequacy of whole historical reconstruction (as opposed to the adequacy of dingle historical statements), i. e. with the criteria for deciding whether a historians account is adequate, or more adequate than a rivals account. It is pointed out that conditions of truth alone cannot provide such criteria but that selection and emphasis play n important part, the selection and emphasis of what is ‘relevant’ or ‘important’. Thee two concepts are analysed in detail and several suggested solutions of the problems to when something is relevant or important are examined and rejected.

Ontological systems allow for computational reasoning, i.e. the <b>inference</b> <b>of</b> new <b>facts</b> from given knowledge and rules.

40|$|Causation is {{a crucial}} issue in ascertaining whether certain loss or damage is covered in an {{insurance}} policy. Although marine insurance is well-known for investigating the “proximate” cause of loss {{in order to determine}} the insurers’ liability, decisions by English courts are far from reconcilable. The problem has been suggested to be the <b>inference</b> <b>of</b> matters <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> and consequently, causal connection is deemed as a complex and uncertain issue. In the light of incoherency and uncertainty of law in this respect, the value of this research lies in the effort to conceptualize and develop a set of consistent causation rules in the marine insurance context and to explore how perils themselves would affect the formation and application of causation rules. Essentially, the proximate cause in law should not remain as a mere open question <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> In order to achieve the merits, this dissertation scrutinises the causation theory itself and also the correlations between the perils involved in the policy. Introduction presents the legal problem of causation in marine insurance law and stresses the importance of setting up coherent and certain rules. The research on the pure causation theory consists of two chapters: Chapter One regarding the test of causation, i. e. the doctrine of proximity; and Chapter Two on concurrent causes. The subsequent three chapters concentrate on identifying the cause of loss from the nature and concepts of different marine risks. Chapter Three introduces marine perils and examines how causation rules apply in the case of a few typical insured and uninsured perils; Chapter Four and Chapter Five are concerned with exclusive researches on inherent vice and seaworthiness respectively. Apart from the substantive analysis on causation, burden of proof is addressed in the last chapter. Finally, the Conclusion provides a summary of the issues and the set of causation rules...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of OWL ontologies {{in the emerging}} Semantic Web are constructed from properties that lack domain and range constraints. Constraints in OWL {{are different from the}} familiar uses in programming languages and databases. They are actually type assertions that are made about the individuals which are connected by the property. Because they are type assertions these assertions can add vital information to the individuals involved and give information on how the defining property may be used. Three different automated generation techniques are explored in this research: disjunction, least-common named subsumer, and vivification. Each algorithm is compared for the ability to generalize, and the performance impacts with respect to the reasoner. A large sample of ontologies from the Swoogle repository are used to compare real-world performance of these techniques. Using generated facts is a type of default reasoning. This may conflict with future assertions to the knowledge base. While general default reasoning is non-monotonic and undecidable a novel approach is introduced to support efficient contraction of the default knowledge. Constraint generation and default reasoning, together, enable a robust and efficient generation of domain and range constraints which will result in the <b>inference</b> <b>of</b> additional <b>facts</b> and improved performance for a number of Semantic Web applications...|$|R
