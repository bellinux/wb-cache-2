40|$|In {{the same}} thermogravimetric {{analyzer}} (TGA) under identical conditions, samples of pure, ash-free cellulose (i. e. Avicel PH- 105, Whatman CF- 11, Millipore ash-free <b>filter</b> <b>pulp,</b> and Whatman # 42) obtained from different manufacturers undergo pyrolysis at temperatures which differ {{by as much}} as 30 C. Thus the pyrolysis chemistry of a sample of pure cellulose is not governed by a universal rate law, {{as is the case with}} a pure hydrocarbon gas (for example). Nevertheless, the pyrolytic weight loss of all the samples studied in this work is well represented by a high activation energy (228 kJ/mol), first order rate law at both low and high heating rates. These results do not corroborate the recent findings of Milosavljevic and Suuberg (1995). For a particular cellulose sample (for example Avicel PH- 105), variations in the pre-exponential constant determined at different heating rates reflect uncontrolled, systematic errors in the dynamic sample temperature measurement (thermal lag) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} water {{available}} is usually restricted, {{which leads to a}} situation where a complete understanding of the process, including water circulations and the influence of water components, is essential. The main aim of this thesis was to clarify the possibilities for the efficient use of residual peroxide by means of water circulation rearrangements. Rearranging water circulations and the reduction of water usage may cause new problems, such as metal induced peroxide decomposition that needs to be addressed. This thesis introduces theoretical methods of water circulations to combine two variables; effective utilization of residual peroxide and avoiding manganese in the alkaline peroxide bleaching stage. Results are mainly based on laboratory and mill site experiments concerning the utilization of residual peroxide. A simulation model (BALAS) was used to evaluate the manganese contents and residual peroxide doses. It was shown that with optimum recirculation of residual peroxide the brightness can be improved or chemical costs can be decreased. From the scientific perspective, it was also very important to discover that recycled peroxide was more effective pre-bleaching agent compared to fresh peroxide. This can be due to the organic acids i. e. per acetic acid in wash press filtrate that have been formed in alkaline bleaching stage. Even short retention time was adequate and the activation of residual peroxide using sodium hydroxide was not necessary. There are several possibilities for using residual peroxide in practice regarding bleaching. A typical modern mechanical pulping process line consist of defibering, screening, a disc filter, a bleach press, high consistency (HC) peroxide bleaching and a wash press. Furthermore there usually is not a particular medium consistency (MC) pre-bleaching stage that includes additional thickening equipment. The most advisable way to utilize residual peroxide in this kind of process is to recycle the wash press filtrate to the dilution of disc <b>filter</b> <b>pulp</b> (low MC pre-bleaching stage). An arrangement such as this would be beneficial in terms of the reduced convection of manganese to the alkaline bleaching stage. Manganese originates from wood material and will be removed to the water phase already {{in the early stages of}} the process. Recycling residual peroxide prior to the disc filter is not recommended because of low consistencies. Regarding water circulations, the novel point of view is that, it would be beneficial to divide water circulations into two sections and the critical location for the division is the disc filter. Both of these two sections have their own priority. Section one before the disc filter: manganese removal. Section two after the disc filter: brightening of pulp. This division can be carried out if the disc <b>filter</b> <b>pulp</b> is diluted only by wash press filtrate before the MC storage tower. The situation is even better if there is an additional press after the disc filter, which will improve the consistency of the pulp. This has a significant effect on the peroxide concentration in the MC pre-bleaching stage. In terms of manganese content, it is essential to avoid the use of disc filter filtrate in the bleach press and wash press showers. An additional cut-off press would also be beneficial for manganese removal. As a combination of higher initial brightness and lower manganese content, the typical brightness increase varies between approximately 0. 5 and 1 % ISO units after the alkaline peroxide bleaching stage. This improvement does not seem to be remarkable, but as it is generally known, the final brightness unit is the most expensive and difficult to achieve. The estimation of cost savings is not unambiguous. For example in GW/TMP mill case 0. 6 % ISO units higher final brightness gave 10 % savings in the costs of bleaching chemicals. With an hypothetical 200 000 ton annual production, this means that the mill could save in the costs of bleaching chemicals more than 400 000 euros per year. In general, it can be said that there were no differences between the behavior of different types of processes (GW, PGW, TMP and BCTMP). The enhancement of recycling gave a similar response in all cases. However, we have to remember that the utilization of residual peroxide in older mills depends a great deal on the process equipment, the {{amount of water}} available and existing pipeline connections. In summary, it can be said that processes are individual and the same solutions cannot be applied to all cases...|$|E
40|$|Mixtures of stickies-containing and stickies-free pulps were {{investigated}} for their deposition potntial {{in an attempt}} to better understand the interactions of dissolved and colloidal material (DCM) when mixing two different <b>pulps.</b> The <b>filtered</b> <b>pulp</b> mixtures were tested in a deposition apparatus which measures both the dynamic fluid as well as impact deposition by an established optical scanning method. A pulp filtrate of model stickies led to deposition according to the proportion of stickies-containing pulp in the mixture. Other mixtures of pulps, however, led to deposition that differed from the predicted value. It is theorised that pulp fibres present in the mixture could adsorb the polysaccharides that would otherwise keep the colloidal system electrostatically stable. This destabilisation was most prominent at lower proportions of the stickies-free pulp suspensions used for mixing. These results show that care must be taken when mixing different pulps for paper and board production, as even a small amount of replacement pulp can lead to destabilisation of DCM and formation of deposits. Furthermore, special care must be taken when mixtures of pulps are used to validate stickies measurements...|$|R

This is {{a report}} of some suggestive expts. on the mutual {{adsorption}} relations of saponin, lampblack and filter paper. When varying amts. of saponin are added to a standard suspension of lampblack in water the solns. of high and of low conc. settle faster than do the intermediate ones. There is an optimum stability at a conc. of saponin between 2. 0 and 3. 5 %. In an elec. field saponin moves toward the anode, lampblack toward the cathode. When saponin is added to a lampblack suspension and an elec. current is passed the lampblack moves toward the anode-a reversal of the direction which it exhibits when alone. When a suspension of lampblack is poured through a filter the paper retains {{a part of the}} lampblack and this retained portion cannot be removed by washing with water, even when the filter is reversed. But if a soln. of saponin be poured through the blacked filter a portion of the retained lampblack is given up and passes through with the soln. A crayon made by molding a mixture of wet clay with lampblack or finely ground graphite marks paper easily and leaves a mark which is erased with difficulty. If, however, a soln. of saponin be used to moisten the clay-lampblack mixture the crayon is harder, marks paper with difficulty and the mark is easily erased. Similar results are obtained when the paper, instead of the crayon, is impregnated with saponin. When <b>filter</b> paper <b>pulp</b> is mixed with a lampblack suspension and collected on a cloth <b>filter,</b> the <b>pulp</b> retains some of the lampblack and the amt. so retained is sensibly independent of the conc. of lampblack in the original suspension. The author makes certain applications to the action of soapy substances in the cleansing of fabrics and concludes that there exists a limiting "saturation capacity in the combinations between colloids" which is analogous to the saturation of one atom by chem. combination with another. [This conclusion is quite out of accord with the existing knowledge of the form of the absorption isotherm and is not supported by the evidence presented.

40|$|Açai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.), a {{fruit from}} the Amazon region, {{has emerged as}} a {{promising}} source of polyphenols. Açai consumption has been increasing owing to ascribed health benefits and antioxidant properties; however, its effects on hepatic injury are limited. In this study, we evaluated the antioxidant effect of <b>filtered</b> açai <b>pulp</b> on the expression of paraoxonase (PON) isoforms and PON 1 activity in rats with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The rats were fed a standard AIN- 93 M (control) diet or a high-fat (HF) diet containing 25 % soy oil and 1 % cholesterol with or without açai pulp (2 [*]g/day) for 6 weeks. Our results show that açai pulp prevented low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, increased serum and hepatic PON 1 activity, and upregulated the expression of PON 1 and ApoA-I in the liver. In HF diet-fed rats, treatment with açai pulp attenuated liver damage, reducing fat infiltration and triglyceride (TG) content. In rats receiving açai, increased serum PON 1 activity was correlated with a reduction in hepatic steatosis and hepatic injury. These findings suggest the use of açai as a potential therapy for liver injuries, supporting the idea that dietary antioxidants are a promising approach to enhance the defensive systems against oxidative stress...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of NASA's Advanced Life Support Program (ALS) for {{sustaining}} human life in space is to achieve a closed system in plant production and usage. That all inedible plant parts should be recycled or used in some way. A Tuskegee University team researching sweetpotato and peanut for ALS has developed paper products from dried sweet-potato stems and peanut shells. In this study, the sweet-potato stems and peanut shells were soaked separately in water for 48 hours. After 48 hours, researchers manually separated the pulp and the unusable parts. To form the paper, 160 g of pulp and water mixture was poured through a 15. 1 cm (diameter) filtration funnel and the pulp was trapped on 15 cm (diameter) filter paper. The <b>filter</b> paper and <b>pulp</b> were dried in an air oven, and the filter paper was removed, An examination under a scanning electron microscope showed that the sweet-potato paper was composed of "fibers", whereas the peanut shell paper was composed of "blocks". Results of physical testing showed that the sweet-potato stem paper was stronger than the peanut shell paper. It is anticipated that there may be other uses of these products such as writing paper, bags and packaging material.

40|$|The {{placement}} of filling {{materials in the}} treatment procedures of caries lesions sometimes leaves smaller, sometimes bigger marginal gaps around the restorations, areas that may be potential areas of development of microbial populations. The microbial populations developed in those areas produce acids that compromise the integrity of dental hard tissues at the restorations margins, while toxins that may be <b>filtered</b> towards the <b>pulp</b> may jeopardize it’s operational integrity. Addressing the risks from the presence of plaque {{was the subject of}} many studies which were directed at methods to reduce marginal gaps and integrate antimicrobial properties in filling materials. The evolution of research led to inclusion in the organic matrix of composite resins or resin adhesives of a bioactive monomer (MDPB) which co-polymerizes with other monomers and is not released from the material, and this results on both the structure and composition stability of the material over time and the permanent presence of antimicrobial action by contact inhibition {{in the vicinity of the}} material. The introduction of these materials in commerce gave rise to the need of their effectiveness against oral microbial flora and their influence on pulp-dentin complex to be studied. At the hitherto existing literature there are studies of the material in laboratory scale (in vitro) and in vivo animal studies. This study is an attempt to evaluate the results of applying the commercial formulation Protect Bond contains MDPB molecule in humans and the comparative study of the corresponding system without connecting the MDPB (SE Bond). To perform the experiment, seventy-four teeth, which according to the treatment plan should be extracted for periodontal reasons, were used. The teeth were caries free, vital and patient’s ages been between 40 - 50 years old. The experiment was divided into two parts (Study A and Study B). Study A the restorative materials were placed in proximity to the pulp but without direct contact with it, while in study B direct pulp capping performed with the study materials. Teeth were extracted four or eight weeks after {{placement of}} restorations and evaluated. Study A specimens examined on the optical microscope and factors that evaluated were inflammatory pulp response, remaining dentine thickness, tissue disorganization, fibrous pulp degeneration and bacterial infiltration. Study B is a qualitative evaluation of pulp tissue reactions when there is a direct contact of the study materials with the pulp. Specimens evaluated in study B, where examined in the optical microscope and in the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) in order pulp alterations to be evaluated in an ultra-microscopically level. Statistical analysis of the results showed that for the time period of four and eight weeks that the specimens were examined there were no statistically significant differences regardless the material used. Clinical performance of the study adhesives is satisfactory when the materials are not in direct contact with the pulp, although when direct pulp capping is performed, adhesive materials may lead to inflammatory response which can be followed by degenerative procedures and/or partial or full pulp necrosis. ...|$|R
