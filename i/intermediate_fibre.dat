The passive mechanical properties of muscle tissue are important for many biomechanics applications, including impact biomechanics, tissue engineering and rehabilitation engineering. However, significant gaps remain {{in our understanding of}} the passive three-dimensional tensile and compressive response of skeletal muscle tissue. In particular, the tensile quasi-static soft tissue anisotropy remains unclear and the responses to loading at <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibre</b> directions, as well as the asymmetrical behavioural response of muscle tissue have not been investigated before...|$|E
40|$|Composite materials, such as fibre {{reinforced}} plastics and sandwich panels, have considerable potential {{for use in}} the next generation of transport structures.

These complexities, together with issues of cost, are currently limiting their adoption by the transport sectors. The selection of the manufacturing process for a composite component will normally depend upon the nature of part and the required production volumes.

40|$|It {{is known}} that some {{anabolic}} steroids are capable of increasing the sizes of skeletal muscles or increasing their mechanical performance. The present study was undertaken to establish quantitatively the alterations which occur in skeletal muscle fibres {{as a result of}} the injection of 19 -nortestosterone (nandrolone phenyl proprionate). Specimens of diaphragm were obtained from the experimental and control animals and prepared for electron microscopy and stereological analyses. Following low doses of the steroid stereological analyses have shown that in Type I and in <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres</b> their mitochondrial volume proportions increase though their myofilament contents decrease.

40|$|Experimental myotonia was {{induced by}} feeding rats with 20, 25 -diazacholesterol {{for up to}} 8 months. Histochemical {{analysis}} of myotonic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle showed a progressive decrease of type IIB fibres and a concomitant increase of type IIA and type I fibres. A transient hypertrophy of type IIA fibres was observed 6 months after beginning the treatment. Analysis of the pattern of myosin light chains of single fibres from EDL showed that myotonia caused a progressive decrease of fibres showing a pure fast myosin light chain pattern and an increase of fibres showing coexistence of fast and slow myosin light chains (<b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres).</b> Only {{a small percentage of}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres</b> showed coexistence of fast and slow myosin heavy chains. Myotonic fibres presented an increased sensitivity to caffeine which approached that of normal soleus fibres. Furthermore, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles isolated from hind limb fast muscles of myotonic rats demonstrated a decrease of Ca 2 +-dependent ATPase and Ca 2 +-transport activities as well as a decrease of immunoreactivity with anti-rabbit SR fast Ca 2 +-ATPase antibody. These results suggest that the increased electrical activity brought about by 20, 25 -diazacholesterol-induced myotonia, caused a fast to slow transition in the phenotypic expression of myosin and sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins...|$|R

40|$|The passive {{mechanical}} properties of muscle tissue {{are important for}} many biomechanics applications. However, significant gaps remain {{in our understanding of}} the three-dimensional tensile response of passive skeletal muscle tissue to applied loading. In particular, the nature of the anisotropy remains unclear and the response to loading at <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibre</b> directions and the Poisson?s ratios in tension have not been reported. Accordingly, tensile tests were performed along and perpendicular to the muscle fibre direction as well as at 30, 45 and 60 degrees to the muscle fibre direction in samples of Longissimus dorsi muscle taken from freshly slaughtered pigs. Strain was measured using an optical non-contact method. The results show the transverse or cross fibre (TT?) direction is broadly linear and is the stiffest (77 kPa stress at a stretch of 1. 1), but that failure occurs at low stretches (approximately ? = 1. 15). In contrast the longitudinal or fibre direction (L) is nonlinear and much less stiff (10 kPa stress at a stretch of 1. 1) but failure occurs at higher stretches (approximately? = 1. 65). An almost sinusoidal variation in stress response was observed at intermediate angles. The following Poisson?s ratios were measured: ?LT = ?LT?= 0. 47, ?TT?= 0. 28 and ?TL= 0. 74. These observations have not been previously reported and they contribute significantly {{to our understanding of the}} three dimensional deformation response of skeletal muscle tissue...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the evolution of cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum L.). Specifically, it focuses on the adaptation of flax to European latitudes during the spread of agriculture. The two main objectives {{of this study are}} to determine 1) the role of hybridization with the flax wild relative (pale flax; Linum bienne Mill.) in the adaptation to northerly latitudes and 2) the link between the adaptation and the emergence of fibre flax varieties. Flowering time genes {{play an important role in}} adaptation to northerly latitudes. Homologs of three flowering genes from Arabidopsis thaliana (LFY, TFL 1 and TOC 1) were identified and sequenced in flax. This included seven flax paralogs of TFL 1, which shared gene structure, exonic sequences, conservation of amino acids in the active site, and expression patterns with the phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein family that includes TFL 1. Sixteen different haplotypes of LuTFL 1 were discovered amongst sequence data derived from a diversity collection of flax accessions. Haplotypes in cluster I are associated with samples from Southern Europe and the Near East, while those in cluster III are associated with Central and Northern Europe. The LuTFL 1 gene was under selection or selective sweep that occurred in cultivated flax. Haplotype I was inherited from pale flax during domestication, while haplotype III was inherited post-domestication following hybridization with pale flax from around the Bosphorus. Within sequence data of LuTFL 2, ten haplotypes were discovered and these too were correlated with latitude. Contrary to the previous case however, there is no evidence of selection in LuTFL 2. LuTFL 1 and LuTFL 2 might be in linkage disequilibrium. A collection of RADseq markers was developed to investigate the genetic structure of flax and measure the genetic migration between wild and cultivated species. Of all the RADseq markers, 219 were characterized with single SNP and used for further analyses. The genetic diversity of cultivated flax was found to be similar to that of pale flax. The population structure inferred from SNP data showed genetic separation of dehiscent and non-dehiscent varieties, but no distinction between <b>intermediate,</b> <b>fibre</b> and oil varieties of cultivated flax. The population is structured from south to north within landraces, intermediate and fibre varieties. There is strong evidence for admixture from pale flax to cultivated flax, especially from the populations in the area of domestication. High levels of genetic migration are shown from all populations of pale flax towards both the southern and northern cultivated flax. RADseq SNP alleles that are associated with northerly latitudes in cultivated flax were introduced through post-domestication hybridization with pale flax of various geographic origin. These combined molecular results indicate that pale flax contributed to the adaptation of cultivated flax in the European climate through post-domestication gene flow. Considering archaeological and phenotypic data from the literature, the adaptation to northerly latitude might have led to the emergence of fibre varieties. This inference is supported by a custom-made programme called PGROWTH, which models the impact of FT and TFL 1 gene expression on flax architecture. These two genes play an important role in plant development and therefore might have an impact on flax architecture. This study suggests the need of carrying out transgenic, functional experiments with LuTFL 1 constructs in the future...|$|E

40|$|In {{skeletal}} muscle, pure fibres expressing one myosin {{heavy chain}} (MyHC) isoform, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres,</b> expressing two and exceptionally three MyHCs {{have been described}}. When skeletal muscle adapts its fibre type profile to changed functional demands MyHC isoform transformation follows the pathway: MyHC- 1 ↔ MyHC- 2 a ↔ MyHC- 2 x/d ↔ MyHC- 2 b. Therefore, in hybrid fibres only successive isoforms from the proposed pathway should coexist. However, jump fibres in which MyHC- 1 is co-expressed with MyHC- 2 x/d have been described recently. The present study describes possible coexpression of MyHC- 1 with MyHC- 2 b in transforming {{as well as in}} normal control mouse and rat muscle fibres.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of muscle fibres in the submaxillaris muscle of the frog were studied using electrophysiological and anatomical techniques. The muscle fibres {{were capable of}} eliciting action potentials and their passive membrane properties {{were similar to those}} of fast muscle fibres. Composite end-plate potentials, due to polyneuronal innervation, were observed in most muscle fibres. Acetylcholinesterase staining of the whole muscle revealed multiple end-plate areas, and several end-plates of different size and shape were observed in single teased fibres. It is concluded that the submaxillaris muscle of the frog is composed of a distinctive population of muscle <b>fibres</b> (<b>intermediate</b> muscle <b>fibres)</b> with electrical properties like those of fast muscle fibres and multiple innervation like that of slow muscle fibres...|$|R

Muscle tissues were obtained from muscle iliotibialis lateralis pars preacetabularis, muscle femorotibialis medius and muscle fibularis longus.

A higher incidence of type I compared to type IIA fibres in muscle iliotibialis lateralis pars preacetabularis and muscle femorotibialis medius was noticed.

40|$|In a large {{proportion}} of chronic neuropathies and motor neurone disease, in biopsies taken from clinically little affected muscles, the fibre type grouping is not conspicuous, so that this pattern should not be considered as a hallmark of the morphologic diagnosis of denervation. In this respect, the increased terminal innervation ratio remains a much more reliable parameter. The high proportion of type III or <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres</b> occurring preferentially in cases without obvious type grouping must be emphasized, with regard to the hypothesis that these fibres represent a transient stage of reinnervation through collateral branching of subterminal axons. The pattern of type I grouping with numeric and sometimes volumetric reduction of type II fibres occurring in obviously neuropathic conditions leads to a reappraisal of the so called type II atrophy observed in disuse atrophy and in some myopathies. A neural influence in these conditions should only be accepted when there are characteristic changes in the terminal motor innervation pattern.

40|$|Recent {{molecular}} {{work has}} revealed a large diversity of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) gene variants in the abdominal musculature of gammarid amphipods. An unusual truncated MyHC transcript from the loop 1 region (Variant A 3) was consistently observed in multiple species and populations. The current study aimed {{to determine whether}} this MyHC variant is specific to a particular muscle fibre type, as a change in net charge to the loop 1 region of Variant A 3 could be functionally significant. The localisation of different fibre types within the abdominal musculature of several gammarid species revealed that the deep flexor and extensor muscles are fast-twitch muscle fibres. The dorsal superficial muscles were identified as slow fibres and the muscles extrinsic to the pleopods were identified as <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres.</b> Amplification of loop 1 region mRNA from isolated superficial extensor and deep flexor muscles, and subsequent liquid chromatography and sequence analysis revealed that Variant A 3 was the primary MyHC variant in slow muscles, and the conserved A 1 sequence was the primary variant in fast muscles.

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} diagnostic {{muscle biopsy}} finding {{in patients with}} mitochondrial DNA disease {{is the presence of}} respiratory-chain deficient fibres. These fibres are detected as cytochrome c oxidase-deficient following a sequential cytochrome c oxidase-succinate dehydrogenase reaction, often in a mosaic pattern within a population of cytochrome c oxidase-normal fibres. Detailed analysis of muscle biopsies from patients with various mitochondrial DNA defects shows that a spectrum of deficiency exists, as there are a large number of fibres which do not correspond to being either completely cytochrome c oxidase-normal (brown staining) or cytochrome c oxidase-deficient (blue staining). We have used a combination of histochemical and immunocytochemical techniques to show that a population of cytochrome c oxidase-intermediate reacting fibres are a gradation between normal and deficient fibres. We show that cytochrome c oxidase-intermediate fibres also have different genetic characteristics in terms of amount of mutated and wild-type mtDNA, and as such, may represent an important transition between respiratory normal and deficient fibres. Assessing changes in <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres</b> will be crucial to evaluating the responses to treatment and in particular to exercise training regimes in patients with mitochondrial DNA disease...|$|R

Lotta S, Scelsi R, Alfonsi E, Saitta A, Nicolotti D, Epifani P, Carraro U. Source Centro di Recupero G. Verdi, USL. 3., Pavia, Italy. Abstract Morphometric and electrophoretic properties of soleus and medialis gastrocnemius fibres from paraplegic patients were studied 1 to 10 months following complete traumatic cord transection (spinal cord level C 5 -T 1). In {{the short term}} of paraplegia (1 - 6 months) gastrocnemius medialis and soleus muscles showed predominant atrophy of IIA fibre types. In long term paraplegia (8 - 10 months) atrophy and reduction of type 1 fibres, with presence of high percentages of type IIB fibres, were seen in both studied muscles. The consistence in both muscles of IIB <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres</b> in long term paraplegia, seems to indicate the initial stage of a mechanism of fibre transformation reflecting the adaptative capacity of the paretic muscle to spasticity. Electrophysiological studies of the H-reflex and the H/M ratio values reveal an increase of the H-reflex excitability in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles during a 1 to 10 months follow-up.

Slow, intermediate {{and fast}} twitch muscle fibres, distinguished {{on the basis}} of the pH stability of their mATPases, showed intense, moderate and low staining activity for SDHase, respectively. Slow fibres were the major component of the pectoral fin adductor profundis muscle.

40|$|Growth of laterarl {{muscle in}} the teleost fish Sparus aurata (L.) was {{examined}} from hatching to juvenile by a basic morphofunctional approach {{that takes into}} account structural and ecophysiological aspects and combines in vivo observations and LM and TEM microscopic analysis. As shown in most teleost fishes, muscle growth proceeds by a double mechanism of hyperplasia and hypertrophy that contribute differentially to the overall development of the lateral muscle, giving rise in each myomere to a typical pattern of structurally and functionally different fibre types (slow-red and fast-white <b>fibres,</b> plus pink <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres)</b> in a nerve-dependent process. During larval life the muscle growth takes place mainly due to hyperplastic growth at the level of specific proliferative zones of the myomeres, from which slow, pink and white muscle fibres are derived. In those species that reach a large adult size a new typical hyperplastic process disseminated throughout the fast white muscle layer takes place during post-larval life. In contrast, hypertrophic growth occurs in all stages, but is the dominant mechanism of muscle growth only in juvenile and adult. The suitable recruitment of the different fibre types enables the fish to optimize its performances according to specific functional and metabolic requirements related to the swimming behaviour and hydrodynamic regimes. The different mechanisms of growth are here analysed in their detailed structural and ultrastructural aspects in order to interpret their adaptive significance {{in the light of the}} fish life cycle, with particular reference to locomotion and feeding behaviou...|$|R
40|$|The histochemical {{fibre type}} {{composition}} of the rat superior and medial rectus (SR and MR), superior oblique (SO) and levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) muscles was studied using the myofibrillar ATPase and NADH-tetrazo-lium reductase (NADH-TR) techniques. In the SR, MR and SO a peripheral zone containing small fibres and a central zone containing both small and large fibres could be identified. Four fibre types {{were present in the}} central zone of these muscles and were categorised as Type 1, Type 2 a, Type 2 a', and Type 2 b. Four fibre types were also identified in the peripheral zone–Type 1, Type 2 a, Type 2 a' and Type 2 c. In the LPS Type 1, Type 2, Type 2 a', Type 2 b and Type 2 c fibres were evenly intermixed without a zonal arrangement. The Type 1, Type 2 a, Type 2 b and Type 2 c fibres correspond to accepted fibre types in the rat limb muscles. The Type 2 a' and Type 2 a' fibres were differentiated from the Type 2 a fibres on the basis of size and pattern and intensity of staining with the NADH-TR technique. The Type 2 c fibres, which possess both acid-stable and alkali-stable myofibrillar ATPase, are considered to represent <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres</b> in the process of transformation from Type 2 to Type 1, rather than fibres with a dual innervation as has been suggested in the past.

40|$|Males of {{the eastern}} {{mosquito}} fish (Gambusia holbrooki) possess one of the widest reproductively active temperature ranges for any ectotherm, ranging across seasons from at least 18 degreesC to 34 degreesC. In this study, we tested the ability of male G. holbrooki to acclimate their sustained swimming performance following long-term exposure to 18 degreesC or 30 degreesC. We also investigated some of the possible physiological mechanisms associated with thermal acclimation responses in swimming performance, including changes in slow muscle fibre size and abundance and the expression of myosin heavy chains (MyHC). We found that U-crit, of 18 degreesC-acclimated G. holbrooki was 20 % greater at 18 degreesC than 30 degreesC-acclimated fish, and the Ucrit of the 30 degreesC-acclimated group was more than 15 % greater at 30 degreesC. Slow, fast and <b>intermediate</b> muscle <b>fibres</b> were identified {{on the basis of}} their myosin ATPase staining reaction. Although the number of slow and <b>intermediate</b> muscle <b>fibres</b> was similar between groups, the total cross-sectional area of aerobic fibre types was 40 % greater in 18 degrees-than 30 degreesC-acclimated fish, reflecting an increase in the average fibre diameter. An S 58 antibody raised against chicken slow skeletal muscle myosin stained a sub-set of the slow fibres identified by myosin ATPase staining. The number of S 58 -positive muscle fibres was 50 % greater in 30 degreesC-than 18 degreesC-acclimated fish, implying that different MyHCs are being expressed in cold and warm acclimated individuals. Given the sexually coercive mating system of this species, increases in the sustained swimming performance via thermal acclimation may benefit the ability of males to maintain a high rate of sneaky copulations.

40|$|The morphology, infrastructure, {{innervation}} {{and physiology}} {{of the third}} axillary muscle in Manduca sexta were examined to investigate the role of this muscle in flight. The muscle consists of three parts: the upper bundle, which originates on the episternum, and the middle and lower bundles, which originate on the epimeron; all three parts insert {{on the tip of}} a projection from the third axillary sclerite. The middle bundle is composed of tonic fibres, and is innervated by a single slow axon, while the other two bundles consist of <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres</b> and are each innervated by a single fast axon. The shape and position of the third axillary sclerite within the wing hinge are such that its primary function appears to be remotion of the wing. The length of the third axillary muscle determines the amount of remotion, independently of the degree of elevation or depression of the wing and independently of the amount of remotion of the contralateral wing. Electrophysiological recordings from the three parts of the muscle during tethered flight indicate that they may each function independently of each other and in different ways. The tonic (middle) bundle is capable of maintaining tension to hold the wings in the folded position at rest and is active when the wings are folded at the end of flight. The intermediate (upper and lower) bundles are activated phasically with impulses that may occur with various relationships to the timing of activation of a direct depressor, the subalar, or of several of the elevators. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the third axillary muscles on both sides are important in determining the asymmetric degrees of remotion observed in turning flight...|$|R

Investigation {{of the distribution of}} fast-twitch-fibre and slow-twitch-fibre isoforms of myosin light chains and the type of myosin heavy chains, based on peptide 'maps' published in Cleveland. Fischer, Kirschner & Laemmli [(1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1102 - 1106], allowed a classification of muscle fibres into four classes, corresponding to histochemical types I, IIA, IIB and IIC. Type I fibres with a pure slow-twitch-type of myosin were found to be characterized by a unique set of isoforms of troponins I, C and T, in agreement with the immunological data of Dhoot & Perry [(1979) Nature (London) 278, 714 - 718], by predominance of the beta-tropomyosin subunit and by the presence of a small amount of an additional tropomyosin subunit, apparently dissimilar from fast-twitch-fibre alpha-tropomyosin subunit. The myofibrillar composition of type IIB fast-twitch white fibres was the mirror image of that found for slow-twitch fibres in that the fast-twitch-fibre isoforms only of the troponin subunits were present and the alpha-tropomyosin subunit predominated. Type IIA fast-twitch red fibres showed a troponin subunit composition identical with that of type IIB fast-twitch white fibres. On the other hand, a unique type of myosin heavy chains was found to be associated with type IIA fibres. Furthermore, the myosin light-chain composition of these fibres was invariably characterized by a small amount of LC 3 F light chain and by a pattern that was either a pure fast-twitch-fibre light-chain pattern or a hybrid LC 1 F/LC 2 F/LC 3 F/LC 1 Sb light-chain pattern. By these criteria type IIA fibres could be distinguished from type IIC <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres,</b> which showed coexistence of fast-twitch-fibre and slow-twitch-fibre forms of myosin light chains and of troponin subunits...|$|R

We recently proposed a technique for cadaver specimen preparation, which seems able to identify a more systematic organization of the superficial white matter terminations.

Hence three examples of standard approaches to eloquent areas are herein reanalyzed starting from the first superficial layer. New insights into the possible surgical trajectories and subsequent quantitative damages of both vessels and white matter fibres can help readapt even the most standard and widely accepted approach trough the brain cortex. A more detailed study of these fine anatomical details may become in the near future a fundamental part of the neurosurgical training and the preoperative planning...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that long thin {{asbestos}} fibres are more pathogenic in in vivo and more active in in vitro assays than short fibre samples. In the present study a long fibre amosite asbestos sample and a short fibre sample prepared from it were tested for ability to cause inflammation in the peritoneal cavity of the mouse; a UICC sample <b>intermediate</b> in <b>fibre</b> size and an inert compact dust, TiO 2, were also tested. The ability of the dust samples to cause inflammation, as judged by macrophage and neutrophil recruitment, was ranked in the order long fibre greater than UICC greater than short fibre greater than TiO 2. Ability of amosite samples to cause inflammation was therefore related to the proportion of long fibres. The enhanced ability of long fibres to cause inflammation and cause macrophage activation is probably a key factor in the ability of long fibres to cause pulmonary fibrosis and may also be important in fibre carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the native myosin isoenzyme composition, myosin light-chain distribution and histochemical profile of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles of normal and dystrophic (129 REJ dy/dy) mice has been performed, and the results correlated with the known contractile abnormalities of murine dystrophic muscles. Normal mouse slow-twitch soleus contained two isomyosins (slow myosin, SM and intermediate myosin, IM) which were electrophoretically distinct from the three major isomyosins (FM 1, FM 2, FM 3) of fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (e. d. l.) muscle. The calcium-activated ATPase activities of FM 1, FM 2, FM 3 and IM at pH 9. 2 were each much {{higher than that of}} SM, and this difference is reflected in the histochemical profile of muscle, as demonstrated with the myofibrillar ATPase reaction at alkaline pH. E. d. l. Type II fibres retained myofibrillar ATPase activity following pre-incubation of histochemical sections at pH 4. 6, and were therefore classified Type IIB, whereas soleus Type II fibres did not, and were classified Type IIA. It was concluded that Type I (slow) fibres contain SM, Type IIA (<b>intermediate)</b> <b>fibres</b> contain IM, and Type IIB (fast) fibres contain FM 1 -FM 3. Each electrophoretically distinct myosin contained a different combination of the five skeletal myosin light chains (LCs). Thus different normal muscles, which differed in their isomyosin profiles, differed also in their light-chain composition. Analysis of the distribution of native myosins (FM 1, FM 2, FM 3, IM, SM, in order of decreasing gel migration rate) in dystrophic muscles revealed increased proportions of the slower-migrating forms, when compared with the distribution in the corresponding normal muscles. The shift in isomyosin distribution would explain the known decrease in the proportion of myosin light chain (LCf 3) in murine dystrophic muscle. The abnormal isomyosin distribution in the dystrophic muscle is correlated with its altered histochemical characteristics, and with well-established abnormalities in its isometric and isotonic properties. It is concluded that the altered isomyosin distribution in murine dystrophic muscle would result in decreased power output per unit muscle mass when compared with normal muscle. The possibility is considered that defective myelination of the innervating nerve may contribute to these abnormalities by preventing higher frequency impulses from reaching muscle...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{differences}} in the physiological and biochemical responses to octopamine have been investigated in the extensor tibiae muscle of the hind leg of the locust. Octopamine increases the rate of relaxation of twitch tension generated by the slow motoneurone by different amounts in {{different regions of the}} muscle. It also increases the amplitude of twitch tension by the same amount in different regions of the muscle. The relaxation rate of fast twitch tension is increased by the same amount in all regions of the muscle innervated by the fast motoneurone. Octopamine also increases cyclic AMP levels by different amounts in different regions of both the extensor muscle and its antagonistic muscle, the flexor tibiae. In both muscles the maximal responses are obtained in the regions of the muscles containing the highest proportions of slow and <b>intermediate</b> muscle <b>fibres</b> as characterized by their contractile and ultrastructural properties. The results are discussed in terms of their functional significance and compared with examples of differential responses of different muscle fibre types in other invertebrate and vertebrate skeletal muscles...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Dupuytren’s Disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative {{disease of}} the normal palmar and digital fascia of the hand, {{resulting}} {{in the formation of}} fibrous cords. Although this is a benign disease, the fibrous cords can give rise to disabling flexion deformities of the fingers, sometimes necessitating amputation in the advanced stages. Although the normal microanatomy of the fascial structures of the hand is essential to the understanding of DD’s progression and its treatment, the literature in unequivocal especially where it concerns the transition of the palmar fascia into the digital fascia. The aim of this study was therefore to elucidate the microanatomy of the palmodigital junction and its relation to palmar and digital fascial structures. Methods: To this end we performed a literature and a dissection study. We dissected a total number of 26 cadaveric digits, 13 middle fingers and 13 ring fingers from 13 fresh frozen human cadaveric hands. A longitudinal midline incision was used on the volar aspect of the hand, running from the midpalm to the tip of the finger. The characteristics of the palmodigital structures were observed and their interrelations with palmar and digtal structures. The proximal and distal borders of the palmodigital fibrous condensations were measured and their width in the midline of the finger at origin and radially and ulnarly. Results: At the palmodigital junction we found a structure which to our knowledge has not been described before. This structure spirals around the neurovascular bundle at the palmodigital junction and we therefore suggest to call it the palmodigital spiralling sheet (PSS). The proximal border fibres of PSS originate from the pretendinous band and insert into the natatory ligament (NL). The <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibres</b> originate from the flexor tendon sheath over the A 1 pulley and continue as Grayson’s fibres. The distal border fibres originate from the flexor tendon sheath just distal to the proximal border of the A 2 pulley and arch into Cleland’s 1 B ligament while it attaches on the flexor tendon sheath at the proximal interphalangeal joint. PSS forms the most proximal and inner part of the neurovascular tunnel. Additionally three types of continuities between volar and dorsal fibres in the digit have been found, possibly contributing to a spiralling arrangement of fibres in the neurovascular tunnel. Conclusion: This study has provided new insights in the microanatomy of the palmar, digital and especially the palmodigital fascia of the hand. The palmodigital spiralling sheet at the palmodigital junction has been found to have an important linking function between the palmar and the digital fascia. PSS and the continuities found between fibres in the digit make the fascia of the palm and digit an intertwining continuum of fibres, instead of separate anatomical structures. Therefore any part of this continuum has the potential of becoming pathologic in DD. ...|$|R
40|$|Bundles of {{polymeric}} chains {{in biological}} systems represent the analogue of macroscopic fibrous {{materials such as}} textile, wood or paper, scaled down to nanometric dimensions, and performing the same mechanical functions of their macroscopic counter-parts. The scale reduction, however, does not leave the physical picture unchanged, but it amplifies surface effects, fluctuations, and affects phase transformations taking place into the system. The thesis {{is devoted to the}} exploration of these size and time scale effects, using molecular dynamics approach based on an idealised force field model. The focus of the investigation is on creep and fatigue, that represent irreversible aging processes due to the thermal breaking of bonds. On the long time scale, and under tensile load, both processes cause the breaking of fibre bundles. My work, based on a preliminary study carried out in my host group, aimed at developing, implementing and validating a simulation approach <b>intermediate</b> between <b>fibre</b> bundle models and the atomistic simulation models prevalent in biophysics and materials science. The main portion of the thesis reports results from representative simulations, showing that the new model opens the possibility of investigating a wider range of phenomena than otherwise possible. In this respect, the thesis achieved all the aims set in the original plan. The thesis work has many possible developments and applications in biophysics and in nanotechnology, that are briefly outlined {{at the end of the}} thesis...|$|R
40|$|After intratracheal {{injection}} of short chrysotile asbestos fibres in guinea-pigs an intense neutrophil alveolitis was observed within three days. Evaluation by bronchoalveolar lavage of the inflammatory and immune effector cells producing the alveolitis by three days showed an increased proportion of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, which comprised 21 % +/- 3 % {{of the total}} leucocytes compared with 9 % +/- 2 % for the controls (p less than 0. 05), persisting {{for at least six}} weeks (after which time the polymorphonuclear leucocytes comprised 28 % +/- 2 % compared with 7 % +/- 1 % for the controls: p less than 0. 05). One mechanism by which asbestos fibres may cause polymorphonuclear leucocytes to be attracted to the alveolar structures is by induced release of neutrophil chemotactic factor by alveolar macrophages. When exposed in vitro to short or <b>intermediate</b> chrysotile <b>fibres</b> or amosite or crocidolite fibres guinea-pig alveolar macrophages released appreciable amounts of neutrophil chemotactic factor. The release of this chemotactic factor was augmented when the asbestos fibres had been previously exposed to normal serum. The chemotactic factor was lipid soluble, and was similar to the neutrophil chemotactic factor spontaneously released by alveolar macrophages recovered from guinea-pigs exposed in vivo to short chrysotile fibres. These observations suggest that alveolar macrophages may play an important part {{in the early stages of}} asbestosis by modulating the migration of neutrophils to the lung...|$|R
