50|$|Phytomyza ilicis, the <b>holly</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> is a fly whose larvae burrow into {{leaves of}} the holly tree (Ilex aquifolium) leaving {{characteristic}} pale trails or leaf mines. The <b>holly</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> has frequently been used in ecological studies as a system to study food webs since examination of the leaves can reveal whether the leaf miner has successfully emerged, been killed by a parasitic wasp, or been predated by blue tits.|$|E

50|$|Agromyzidae larvae are phytophagous, feeding as leaf miners, less {{frequently}} as stem miners or stem borers. A few live on developing seeds, or produce galls.Sometimes larvae in roots or under bark. The biology of many species {{is as yet}} unknown. There is {{a high degree of}} host specificity, an example being Phytomyza ilicis, the <b>holly</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> that feeds on no other species. Some Agromyzidae are quarantine species in many countries. Liriomyza huidobrensis, Liriomyza sativae and Liriomyza trifolii are examples.|$|E
40|$|Many species inhabit {{fragmented}} landscapes, where {{units of}} resource have a patchy spatial distribution. While {{numerous studies have}} investigated how the incidence and dynamics of individual species {{are affected by the}} spatial configuration and landscape context of habitat patches, fewer studies have investigated the dynamics of multiple interacting resource and consumer species in patchy landscapes. We describe a model system for investigating host-parasitoid dynamics in a patchy landscape: a network of 166 holly trees, a specialised herbivore of <b>holly</b> (the <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> Phytomyza ilicis (Curtis, 1948)), and its suite of parasitoids. We documented patch occupancy by P. ilicis, its density within patches, and levels of parasitism over a 6 -year period, and manipulated patch occupancy by creating artificially vacant habitat patches. Essentially all patches were occupied by the herbivore in each year, suggesting that metapopulation dynamics are unlikely to occur in this system. The main determinants of densities for P. ilicis and its parasitoids were resource availability (patch size and host density, respectively). While P. ilicis is apparently not restricted by the spatial distribution of resources, densities of its parasitoids showed a weaker positive relationship with host density in more isolated patches. In patches where local extinctions were generated experimentally, P. ilicis densities and levels of parasitism recovered to pre-manipulation levels within a single generation. Furthermore, patch isolation did not significantly affect re-colonisation by hosts or parasitoids. Analysing the data at a variety of spatial scales indicates that the balance between local demography and dispersal may vary depending on the scale at which patches are defined. Taken together, our results suggest that the host and its parasitoids have dispersal abilities that exceed typical inter-patch distances. Patch dynamics are thus largely governed by dispersal rather than within-patch demography, although the role of demography is higher in larger patches. © 2011 Gesellschaft für ökologie...|$|R
40|$|Surveys were {{conducted}} from 2011 to 2015 in cashew plantations {{to document the}} parasitoids of cashew <b>leaf</b> <b>miner.</b> Three eulophid parasitoids, viz., Chrysocharis sp., Closterocerus sp. and Aprostocetus sp. were recorded {{for the first time}} as parasitoids on the larvae of Cashew <b>Leaf</b> <b>Miner,</b> Acrocercops syngramma Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae).   Among the parasitoids, Chrysocharis sp. was dominant recording 99. 0 % abundance.   The parasitism of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> larvae was observed from September onwards, which reached its peak during November coinciding with the population of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> larvae.   Chrysocharis sp. was found to be a solitary parasitoid, completing its life cycle within the mine of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> and emerging as an adult.   Parasitization was noticed only on the third and fourth instar <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> larvae but not on the first and second instar larvae.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the alien {{horse-chestnut}} <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> Cameraria ohridella, on native fauna was studied by comparing the species richness of native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> communities and the abundance of selected native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> species in the presence and absence of horse-chestnut trees infested by C. ohridella, in various environments in Europe. The species richness of native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> communities in Switzerland was lower at sites where C. ohridella was present than at control sites. In Switzerland, France and Bulgaria, several native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> species were significantly less abundant {{in the vicinity of}} infested horse-chestnuts. The native species most affected by the presence of the invasive alien species were those occurring early in the year and sharing their parasitoid complex with C. ohridella. These results suggest apparent competition mediated by shared natural enemies because these are the only link between C. ohridella and native <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> using other food resources...|$|R

(1991) and Petitt and Wietlisbach (1994) reported that (99.9 %) of Liriomyza sativae emerged from leaves after 95 DD (threshold temperature, 10  °C). Millia (2005) stated that the <b>Holly</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> (Phytomyza ilicis) larvae and adults needed 246 DD, while native <b>holly</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> (Phytomyza iliciola) larvae and adults needed 192 and 298 DD.|$|E
40|$|This {{short term}} {{research}} {{was concerned with}} an Agromyzid parasite –Phytomyza ilicis, Curt, which attacks young unthickened leaves of Jlex aquifolium, causing the formation of brown yellow blotches or mines on the leaf surface. Few papers related to P. ilicis have been published, and no recorded work has been given for the North East area of England, {{despite the fact that}} the <b>holly</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> /holly tree association provides a useful system for the study of plant-insect relationships. Aims of the investigation were to determine whether differences in levels of infestation existed between trees of varying age and sex within the same area. Variation in infestation with height and aspect was investigated, together with egg mortality, later mortality factors by bird-attack and different species of parasites was also examined. The life-cycle of P. ilicis and its parasites was recorded from the mature larval - adult stages. Adult Sphegigaster flavicornis were recorded from suction-traps only. The study was carried out within Hollingside Wood, Durham city G. R. NZ. 276 405. Sixteen holly bushes were examined on the basis of their isolation or proximaty to other holly bushes, position with respect to other vegetation, height and diameter, degree of healthiness based on the number of leaves per twig, sex and position with respect to gradient within the main wood. Six suction-traps were set up within a group of three adjacent trees at varying height Intervals within the University field-station. The size of bushes examined varied between 1. 7 - 9. 6 metres. Problems with sampling are discussed, and it was decided to sample between 325 - 4300 leaves depending on the size of, the tree, The ideal sample size was 800 - 1000 leases, leaves v/ere examined for the presence of eggs, the number of eggs per leaf, the position along the midrib, the number of mines per leaf and their position on the leaf. Each mine was examined for bird attack, and for the presence of both larval and pupal parasites. Leaf-sections were obtained from each tree for leaves of the 1977 season, to determine whether cuticle thickness, influenced the level of infestation between trees. Cuticle thickness was found to be unimportant in determining whether a leaf was mined or not, however cuticle thickness ultimately is important since adult P. ilicis can only attack young leaves where the cuticle is undeveloped. A variation in the time of emergence for adult P. ilicis was observed when compared with accounts given by Miall and Taylor (1907), Downes (1931), although the general pattern of the life-cycle was similar. No significant difference in the level of infestation was observed between trees, although total mine and egg number varied significantly. Spatial distribution did not appear to influence the density of mines, and no significant difference in population density with regard to position within Hollingside Wood was found. Aspect and height influenced both total mine and egg number. Egg mortality was observed to vary between trees but differences were not significant. Egg density was observed to influence the viability of eggs within the leaf, but; the relationship was density-independent by the larval parasite, C. gemma, and by an undetermined mortality factor influencing survival in the early stages of development. The pupal parasites observed were C, syma and S. flavicorni...|$|E

40|$|The <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> (Coelaenomenodera elaeidis Mlk) is {{the major}} pest of the oil palm. The {{seasonality}} of C. elaeidis, its natural enemies and their relationship with temperature, rainfall and relative humidity was observed between January 2009 and December 2010 at the main station of the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research, Nigeria. Past <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> population estimates were obtained from NIFOR entomology division from 1976 - 1980. This study analyses temporal patterns in <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> abundance, and elucidates general patterns and factors influencing <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> abundance. Multiple linear regressions were {{used to analyze the}} relationship between abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its parasitoids and predators and the following climatic variables: maximum and minimum temperature (oC), rainfall (mm) and relative humidity (%). For the analyses, climate variables from the month of collection (control variable) or from the month before the collection (delayed variable) were used. The abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> and predatory ants peaked in the dry season, while parasitoids were most abundant in the rainy season. Significant correlations (P is not great than 0. 05) were found between <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. For all years, maximum temperature was the most dominant variable for all the <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> stages. Significant correlations were found between <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. This indicates that the weather variables at both the month of collection and with a delayed month in relation to collection is critical for pest-weather evaluation. This is important for <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> control. Temperature, rainfall and relative humidity had an effect on the population of C. elaeidis, and this effect was manifested primarily in seasonal fluctuations in oil palm agroecosystems.

40|$|Shaded coffee agroecosystems {{traditionally}} have few pest problems potentially due to higher abundance {{and diversity of}} predators of herbivores. However, with coffee intensification (e. g., shade tree removal or pruning), some pest problems increase. For example, coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> outbreaks {{have been linked to}} more intensive management and increased use of agrochemicals. Parasitic wasps control the coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> but few studies have examined the role of predators, such as ants, that are abundant and diverse in coffee plantations. Here, we examine linkages between arboreal ant communities and coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> incidence in a coffee plantation in Mexico. We examined relationships between incidence and severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> attack and: (1) variation in canopy cover, tree density, tree diversity, and relative abundance of Inga spp. shade trees; (2) presence of Azteca instabilis, an arboreal canopy dominant ant; and (3) the number of arboreal twig-nesting ant species and nests in coffee plants. Differences in vegetation characteristics in study plots did not correlate with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage perhaps because environmental factors act on pest populations at a larger spatial scale. Further, presence of A. instabilis did not influence presence or severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage. The proportion of leaves with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage was significantly lower where abundance of twig-nesting ants was higher but not where twig-nesting ant richness was higher. These results indicate that abundance of twig-nesting ants in shaded coffee plantations may contribute to maintenance of low <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> populations and that ants provide important ecosystem services in coffee agroecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Leaf mining {{is a form}} of endophagous {{herbivory}} {{in which}} insect larvae live and feed within leaf tissue. In this review we discuss aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology, and the current evidence for three hypotheses relating to the evolution of this feeding guild. We also present a summary of the literature coverage relating to these herbivores, which have been relatively poorly studied compared with insects that feed externally such as sap suckers and leaf chewers. The majority of published studies concern <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> from the northern hemisphere, with a general focus on those species considered to be agricultural, forestry or horticultural pests. In a more detailed case study, we examine aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology of Australian species. At least 114 species have been recorded as <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in Australia in four orders: Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera. Lepidoptera and Diptera are the most speciose orders of Australian leaf miners; Hymenoptera are represented by a single endemic genus and half of all coleopteran miners are species introduced for biological control.
