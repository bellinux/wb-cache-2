5|$|In 2006, it was {{discovered}} that nine of the satellite galaxies lie <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy; they are not randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the possibilities to}} reconstruct an illuminated Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ground <b>plane</b> instead of <b>a</b> slant-range <b>plane</b> using Fast Backprojection (FBP) algorithm. Hence, two methods to reconstruct <b>a</b> SAR scene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ground <b>plane</b> are introduced in this paper. The methods are then considered to be extended for bistatic cases where the formation of <b>a</b> SAR scene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ground <b>plane</b> is highly recommended. The proposals are examined with simulated SAR data and the simulation results indicate that rebuilding <b>a</b> SAR scene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ground <b>plane</b> using FBP is possible...|$|R

5|$|Apollonius {{problem is}} to {{construct}} one or more circles tangent to three given objects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane,</b> which may be circles, points, or lines. This gives rise to ten types of Apollonius' problem, one corresponding to each combination of circles, lines and points, which may be labeled with three letters, either C, L, or P, to denote whether the given elements are a circle, line or point, respectively (Table 1). As an example, the type of Apollonius problem with a given circle, line, and point is denoted as CLP.|$|E
5|$|Consider a {{particle}} moving under an arbitrary central force F1(r) whose magnitude depends {{only on the}} distance r between the particle and a fixed center. Since the motion of {{a particle}} under a central force always lies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane,</b> {{the position of the}} particle can be described by polar coordinates (r,θ1), the radius and angle of the particle relative to the center of force (Figure1). Both of these coordinates, r(t) and θ1(t), change with time t as the particle moves.|$|E

Pan Yousheng started a company making thermoses with the brand Butterfly, and she actively promoted her namesake product in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. They lived a few happy years together, until Pan died soon after being diagnosed with liver cancer in 1958.|$|E

5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Reggie and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the air raid shelter whenever the sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.|$|E

5|$|The general {{statement}} of Apollonius' {{problem is to}} construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plane,</b> where an object may be a line, a point or a circle of any size. These objects may be arranged in any way and may cross one another; however, they are usually taken to be distinct, meaning {{that they do not}} coincide. Solutions to Apollonius' problem are sometimes called Apollonius circles, although the term is also used for other types of circles associated with Apollonius.|$|E
5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped.
