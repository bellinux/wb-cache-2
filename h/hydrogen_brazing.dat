40|$|Modeling of {{a furnace}} brazing process is described. The {{computational}} tools predict the thermal response of loaded hardware in a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>brazing</b> furnace to programmed furnace profiles. Experiments {{were conducted to}} validate the model and resolve computational uncertainties. Critical boundary conditions that affect materials and processing response to the furnace environment were determined. {open_quotes}Global{close_quotes} and local issues (i. e., at the furnace/hardware and joint levels, respectively) are discussed. The ability to accurately simulate and control furnace conditions is examined...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} procedures and results of testing performed on a platinum/ 10 -percent rhodium, thin-wall tubular product. The {{purpose of the}} testing was to develop exemplar SEM fractographs {{to be used to}} characterize failures under various environmental conditions. Conditions evaluated for the platinum alloys included high temperature, <b>hydrogen</b> environment, <b>braze</b> metal contamination, and cyclic loading...|$|R
40|$|A 6. 7 -MeV 350 MHz, cw Radio Frequency Quadrupole proton linac {{has been}} {{designed}} and is being fabricated for the Accelerator Production of Tritium Project at Los Alamos. This eight-meter long structure consists of four resonantly-coupled segments and is being fabricated using <b>hydrogen</b> furnace <b>brazing</b> as a joining technology. Details of the design and status of fabrication are reported...|$|R
40|$|A small, {{isotropic}} graphite electrode, multistage depressed collector (MDC) was designed, fabricated, {{and evaluated}} {{in conjunction with}} a 500 -W, continuous wave (CW), 4. 8 - to 9. 6 -GHz traveling-wave tube (TWT). The carbon electrode surfaces were used to improve the TWT overall efficiency by minimizing the secondary electron emission losses in the MDC. The design and fabrication of the brazed graphite MDC assembly are described. The brazing technique, which used copper braze filler metal, is compatible with both vacuum and the more commonly available <b>hydrogen</b> atmosphere <b>brazing</b> furnaces. The TWT and graphite electrode MCC bakeout, processing, and outgassing characteristics were evaluated and found to be comparable to TWT's equipped with copper electrode MDC's. The TWT and MDC performance was optimized for broadband CW operation at saturation. The average radiofrequency (RF), overall, and MDC efficiencies were 14. 9, 46. 4, and 83. 6 percent, respectively, across the octave operating band. A 1500 -hr CW test, conducted without the use of an appendage ion pump, showed no gas buildup and excellent stability of the electrode surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Numerous process {{variables}} {{can influence the}} robustness of conventional metal/ceramic brazing processes. Experience with brazing of hermetic vacuum components has identified the following parameters as influencing the outcome of <b>hydrogen</b> furnace <b>brazed</b> Kovar{trademark} to metallized alumina braze joints: (a) Mo-Mn metallization thickness, sinter fire temperature and porosity (b) Nil plate purity, thickness, and sinter firing conditions (c) peak process temperature, time above liquidus and (d) braze alloy washer thickness. ASTM F 19 tensile buttons {{are being used to}} investigate the above parameters. The F 19 geometry permits determination of both joint hermeticity and tensile strength. This presentation will focus on important lessons learned from the tensile button study: (A) the position of the Kovar{trademark} interlayer can influence the joint tensile strength achieved [...] namely, off-center interlayers can lead to residual stress development in the ceramic and degrade tensile strength values. Finite element analysis has been used to demonstrate the expected magnitude in strength degradation as a function of misalignment. (B) Time above liquidus (TAL) and peak temperature can influence the strength and alloying level of the resulting braze joint. Excessive TAL or peak temperatures can lead to overbraze conditions where all of the Ni plate is dissolved. (C) Metallize sinter fire processes can influence the morphology and strength obtained from the braze joints...|$|R
40|$|Under certain conditions, {{hydrogen}} can {{degrade the}} mechanical properties and fracture behavior of most structural alloys; however, {{it also has}} some positive effects in metals. Several current and potential applications of hydrogen for enhancing the production and processing of materials are reviewed. These include thermohydrogen processing (THP) and forming of refractory alloys, processing of rare earth-transition metal magnets by hydrogen decrepitation (HD) and hydrogenation–decomposition–desorption–recombination (HDDR), hydrogen-induced amorphization (HIA) and microstructural refinement, extraction of elements from ores and alloys, {{and the use of}} hydrogen as a reducing gas for welding and <b>brazing.</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> is found to enhance the formability, microstructure and properties of a large variety of materials, including steels, Ti-based alloys and metal matrix composites (MMCs), refractory metals and alloys, rare earth-transition metal alloys, metalloid-containing metallic glasses, etc...|$|R
500|$|The engine's nozzle is [...] {{long with}} a {{diameter}} of [...] at its throat and [...] at its exit. The nozzle is a bell-shaped extension bolted to the main combustion chamber, {{referred to as a}} de Laval nozzle. The RS-25 nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio (about 77.5:1) for the chamber pressure. At sea level, a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle, which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. However, to aid the engine's operation [...] Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls from the theoretical optimum for thrust, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure just around the rim to an absolute pressure between , and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around [...] or less. The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid <b>hydrogen</b> flowing through <b>brazed</b> stainless steel tube wall coolant passages. On the Space Shuttle, a support ring welded to the forward end of the nozzle is the engine attach point to the orbiter-supplied heat shield. Thermal protection is necessary because of the exposure portions of the nozzles experience during the launch, ascent, on-orbit and entry phases of a mission. The insulation consists of four layers of metallic batting covered with a metallic foil and screening.|$|R
