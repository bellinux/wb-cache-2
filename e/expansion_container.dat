40|$|Naval {{vessels are}} {{designed}} to remain operational in severe conditions, sea-state 6 or higher, and have to maintain a minimum forward speed in these conditions. These seakeeping conditions may result in severe impact loads on {{the bow of the}} vessel, called slamming. Sonar domes are often used at naval vessels to detect objects under water and are located at the forefoot of the vessel. The sonar dome used by the Royal Netherlands Navy is a composite structure connected under the steel bow structure of the vessel and is filled with water. Slamming and other seakeeping loads at the composite sonar dome have to be transferred to the steel bow structure through the composite and water inside the dome. Slamming loads have an impact type of character, which is described as a sudden quick increase of the load and with a short duration. Previous research has shown that neglecting the loads at the dome structure results in a serious underprediction of local structural response of the bow of the vessel. Besides that, {{little is known about the}} load transfer from the dome towards the bow structure. First, the dynamic response of a fluid filled composite sonar dome is studied. Different load types are applied at the sonar dome model to study the influence of the internal fluid on the response. Second, the effect of the loading transferred from the sonar dome on the stress levels in steel bow structure is studied. Slamming loads at the dome structure do not result in a highly dynamic response for the considered design. The rise-times of the loads have a relative long duration compared to the lowest natural response period of the sonar dome. The rise-times observed in the studied seakeeping conditions is in general much longer compared to the natural response periods of the dome. Including the internal fluid in the dome results in a reduction of the deformation and stresses of the composite shell. During seakeeping loading the pressure in the internal fluid rises, resulting in a pressure load on the bow structure above the dome. The reduction of internal pressure due to the outflow of water from the dome to an <b>expansion</b> <b>container</b> seems to be rather limited The presence of a sonar dome results in additional loads at the bow structure. These loads are a force at the dome flange and a pressure load on the bow structure above the dome. This leads to an increased stress level of the structural elements directly above the dome. It is concluded that the contribution of the internal pressure within the dome to the stress levels of the bow structure is most relevant. Vessels without a sonar dome do not have a deck in the forefoot of the vessel that is loaded by a fluid pressure. It is concluded that the loads from the sonar dome should not be neglected in a structural analysis of the bow structure.

40|$|Several {{factors can}} affect {{occupational}} accident frequency, namely economical factors, technologies used (low automation, discontinuous operating) job design, organization of work/environmental conditions and human factors. In particular, technological advances in industrial activities can {{give rise to}} improvement in productivity and in occupational health and safety, but not necessarily simultaneously. The beginning of the container transport dates back to 50 years ago, but while containerization changed everything, from ships and ports to patterns of global trade, its impact on work injuries was not explored at all. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the relationship between work organization, job experience, productivity and occupational accidents, from the starting of the <b>container</b> <b>expansion</b> to nowadays, considering Genoa port (Italy), one of the largest of the Mediterranean Sea. In order to minimize possible reporting biases, such as underreporting or reclassification to a lower level of severity, injury statistics are elaborated starting from data collected directly on-site, from internal accident or medical-aid reports. An in-depth statistical analysis on occupational injuries in the years 1980 – 2006 is carried out, with reference to frequency indexes, mechanism of injury and material causes. The increase of container-ships traffic and, consequently, the sharp change in port infrastructure involved a rapid modification also in the work organization, with particular reference to the number and characteristics of workforce (decrease from 5783 to nearly 1000 employees and increase of low experience workers from 28 % to 74 %). The striking high percentage increase of young or low experienced workers in handling container (and performing correlated new tasks) caused a remarkable increase of the risk for occupational injuries. In the studied port, we recorded an increase of the frequency index (injuries per hundred thousand hours worked) from 13. 0 to 29. 7. It results that the increased <b>expansion</b> of shipping <b>container</b> utilization is not connected to a correspondent human factor safety implementation. Main risk factors are pointed out, revealing an increase of accidents due to transport vehicle (+ 8. 3 %) and a reduction of accidents caused by substance or materials (− 4. 5 %).

Consideration of these findings may enable managerial solutions and workplace organization interventions for the prevention of injuries and safety performance improvement in port activities...|$|R
50|$|When {{measuring}} {{the expansion of}} a liquid, the measurement must account for the <b>expansion</b> of the <b>container</b> as well. For example, a flask that has been constructed with a long narrow stem filled with enough liquid that the stem itself is partially filled, when placed in a heat bath will initially show the column of liquid in the stem to drop followed by the immediate increase of that column until the flask-liquid-heat bath system has thermalized. The initial observation of the column of liquid dropping is not due to an initial contraction of the liquid but rather {{the expansion of the}} flask as it contacts the heat bath first. Soon after, the liquid in the flask is heated by the flask itself and begins to expand. Since liquids typically have a greater expansion over solids, the liquid in the flask eventually exceeds that of the flask, causing the column of liquid in the flask to rise. A direct measurement of the height of the liquid column is a measurement of the apparent expansion of the liquid. The absolute expansion of the liquid is the apparent expansion corrected for the expansion of the containing vessel.|$|R

INTRODUCTIONCityLink is a 22 km road scheme in two sections. The Western Link upgrades an existing freeway to eight lanes and adds a six-lane elevated road and bridge crossing over the River Yarra. The Southern Link upgrades an arterial roadway to five and six lanes, and provides two three-lane tunnels (of 3. 4 km and 1. 6 km in length) under the Yarra. It opened in 2000. Toll charges are collected through an electronic system developed as part of the project. The project is associated with the redevelopment of unused docklands between the central business district and the Yarra, and the <b>expansion</b> of <b>container</b> traffic through the port. BACKGROUNDThe primary objective of the project was to relieve congestion in the city centre, by linking the existing radial highways and bypassing the centre’s urban and residential streets. This in turn would improve the urban environment and provide better access for industry to port, rail and airport facilities. The project was supported by a variety of national and state government policy statements relating to transport and urban development between 1987 and 1992. The decision to seek private sector involvement was announcd in 1992, based on guidelines issued by the State government in 1991. The scheme was initially developed by the state road agency, VicRoads, but in 1995 the core team from VicRoads was transferred to the newly established Melbourne City Link Authority. Public consultation took place in 1992, highlighting issues about potential economic, social and environmental impacts, and leading to the publication of an environmental effects statement in 1994. CHARACTERISTICSThe cost was estimated at AUD 1. 776 bn (at 1993 prices) (USD 2. 80 bn at 2010 pricesi) in Transurban’s 1996 prospectus. The design and construct contract accounted for 65...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{globalization}} of manufacturing and outsourcing {{led to an}} unparalleled growth in demand for containerized shipping services over the past years. Worldwide, ports have been making considerable efforts to appropriate a share of this rapidly increasing demand. Significant public and private resources are allocated toward modernization and/or <b>expansion</b> of <b>container</b> terminals. ^ The container port market structure is oligopolistic and unlike perfectly competitive firms or monopolists, oligopolists {{have to consider the}} policies of their competitors, because they engage in a market game in which their profits depend on the behavior of their rivals. Accordingly, the profitability of their investment decisions is highly dependent on the investment behavior of other competitor ports. ^ This study employs elements of non-cooperative game theory to develop a theoretical model of investment and price competition within the port industry context. To examine whether or not potential investment decisions yield profitable outcomes, three scenarios are analyzed: a static status quo model in which ports compete in prices and no investment occurs, a static model in which ports compete by being able to make both pricing and investment adjustments, and a dynamic model that accounts for a construction lag. Furthermore, an economic experiment is designed and conducted to test the theoretical model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions. ^ The experimental results reveal that investments are significantly above subgame perfect equilibrium predictions. Additionally, prices fall below their predicted equilibrium levels, and overall profitability is considerably lower than that obtained in the theoretical model. In the presence of these higher than expected levels of investment, both prices and profits are almost fifty percent less than their status-quo (non-investment) values. Results also show that an intensified level of competition leads to higher levels of investment. ^ These findings suggest that in a highly competitive market, ports may make strategic investment decisions to increase and/or protect market share that are likely to lead to overcapitalization by lowering port prices and reducing their profits. This study is intended to provide assistance to port planners in identifying whether there are situations in which investment costs can not be recovered. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to present the {{operations}} in container terminals, highlight the underlying factors for port expansion and evaluate the development and future potential of the container terminal in the port of Gothenburg. The paper consists of a literature study of maritime container terminals, {{as well as a}} case study of the container terminal in the port of Gothenburg operated by APM Terminals. Since the introduction of the container, the amount of goods transported in these standardized steel boxes has steadily increased. Increasing containerization, along with the continuous growth of global trade, has resulted in enormous volume developments within the container segment. In order to assimilate the increasing amount of cargo, there is a continuous development regarding ship size. The last twenty years the size of the biggest containerships has more than quadrupled in the quest to obtain economies of scale and thus increase the efficiency of the transport. The paradox of the shipping industry however, is that efficiency only can be obtained if similar performance can be matched in the land-based organization found in ports and container terminals. As a result, there is a continuous demand for <b>expansion</b> within major <b>container</b> ports. Not only due to the sole reason of being able to stow the even larger containerships, but due to higher container throughput and the increased concentration of goods at each arrival. A demand for increased efficiency and performance is requested by costumers, which results in an increasing competition between geographically close ports. Competitiveness among container ports is defined by price, vessel turnaround time and terminal throughput. In order to achieve this, there is a high demand for advanced technology to efficiently interact with the human factor and logistical theories...|$|R
40|$|The Tanjung Perak harbour of {{the city}} of Surabaya on the island Java, Indonesia has {{experienced}} a considerable growth of container traffic. In order to adequately deal with the expected continuing increase of container traffic in the future, the International container terminal is presently being expanded. In future there will be three independently operating terminals: two terminals for international container traffic (ICT) and one terminal for inter island traffic (IIT). The Inter Island Terminal will handle coasters operating between the larger and smaller (more inland located) ports. The quays of these three terminals will be connected to the container yards by one bridge. Evidently the <b>expansion</b> of the <b>container</b> terminal will create a new situation on the whole terminal, in particular on the bridge connecting the quays to the container yards. The objective of this research is to investigate the capacity of the future container terminal and to analyse possible future bottlenecks (with emphasis on the bridge situation). For this purpose computer simulation models have been created of the three terminals and the bridge. Using simulation models the future terminal operations have been analysed and in the process also an indication of the capacity of the terminal is obtained. The models enabled a better insight of the possible container throughput of the terminal in relation to the efficiency level of terminal operations and upgrading of equipment. The traffic load on the bridge has been investigated by analysing the varying traffic flows generated by the terminal models. Concluding it appears that there are two factors that may limit the anticipated container throughput increases per terminal: the capacity of the portainers and the stacking area of the container yards. In case the container throughput per terminal increases as expected and the efficiency levels can not be improved (thus limiting the production of quay cranes), the possibility of a serious congestion of the terminal may be the result. This would result in increased anchorage waiting times for the vessels and in a further increase of the quay occupancy (more than the present 70 %). Also the capacity of the stacking areas may prove to be insufficient to cope with this increased container throughput. These effects also imply that the terminal will not have an adequate safety margin to handle unforeseen delays, for instance equipment breakdown.
