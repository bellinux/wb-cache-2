The goal {{of this research is}} to automatically modulate sunlight efficiently and to enhance the quality of <b>interior</b> <b>illuminations,</b> thus reducing the need for artificial lighting and conserving energy. Daylight panels are typically installed on the outside of windows. By applying the proposed fuzzy controller, the reflection angle of daylight panels could be adjusted and optimized so that interior illuminative quality is improved and energy-saving is achieved at the same time.

This study assessed the illumination and the probable effects on visual fatigue and mental states in Velaiat hospital’s personnel of Damghan. Materials and Methods A case study design performed in indoor hospital working areas. Layout and type of luminaires were examined and <b>interior</b> <b>illuminations</b> were measured as proposed by IESNA (Illuminating Engineering Society of North America). A questionnaire was used to collect data and descriptive and analytical statistical analyses were conducted. Results Interior lighting measurements showed unacceptable levels of local illumination in 82. 3 percent of sections during day light hours and all sections during night hours. General levels of illumination were unacceptable for 83. 3 percent of section in day light and all sections in night hours. Uniformity ratios were unacceptable during day and night hours for 91 percent and 83 percent of sections, respectively. There is a significant relation between age and perceived favorable light, visual fatigue and mental states (P < 0. 05). We found significant relationships between the lighting type and illumination with visual fatigue and mental states (P < 0. 05). Conclusion Insufficient illumination and excessive artificial light may lead to visual fatigue and mental strain. Lighting design should account for acceptable quantity and similarity to daylight. * Corresponding Author: Research Center for Social Determinants of health, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

Due to costly global illumination computation, which is required for the prediction of appearance, physically-based rendering still remains the domain of research laboratories, and is rarely used in industrial practice.

This makes it possible to focus the computation on readily visible scene details, and to stop it when further improvement of the image quality cannot be perceived by the human observer. Also, by better use of perception-motivated physically-based partial solutions, meaningful images can be presented to the user at the early stages of computation. Since many algorithms make simplifying assumptions about the underlying physical model in order to achieve gains in rendering performance, a validation procedure for testing lighting simulation accuracy and image quality is proposed.
