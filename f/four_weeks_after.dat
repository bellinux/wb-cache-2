The mean daily intake of PAH during the consumption period was 3431 ng and the mean daily intake of PAH per kg body wt/day was 46 ng. Blood samples were collected from each subject 7, 14, 21 and 28 days before, during, and after the beefburgers consumption period. glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly higher in serum of subjects during CBB consumption period {{compared with those of}} before CBB consumption ones.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of immobilization on chondrocyte apoptosis and histological features of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insertion and knee articular cartilage in rabbits. Forty-eight male Japanese white rabbits were assigned to an immobilization (n = 24) or sham (n = 24) group. Rabbits in the immobilization group underwent complete unilateral surgical knee immobilization and rabbits in the sham group underwent a sham surgery. The average thickness of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) stained red area by safranin O staining, the chondrocyte apoptosis rate and the chondrocyte proliferation rate in the cartilage layer in the ACL insertion and the articular cartilage of the medial tibial condyle were measured at one, two, <b>four</b> and eight <b>weeks</b> in six animals from each group. In the ACL insertion, the chondrocyte apoptosis rate was higher in the immobilization group than in the sham group at two and eight <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery (p < 0. 05). The chondrocyte proliferation rate gradually decreased from two weeks to eight weeks in the immobilization group. The GAG layer was thinner in the immobilization group than in the sham group at two, <b>four</b> and eight <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery (p < 0. 05). In the articular cartilage, the chondrocyte apoptosis rate in the immobilization group was {{higher than in the}} sham group at <b>four</b> and eight <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery (p < 0. 05). The GAG layer was significantly thinner in the immobilization group than that in the sham group at <b>four</b> and eight <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery (p < 0. 05). Knee immobilization significantly increased chondrocyte apoptosis at two and eight <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery in the ACL insertion and at <b>four</b> and eight <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery in the articular cartilage of the medial tibial condyle, and decreased GAG layer thickness from two to eight <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery in the ACL insertion and from <b>four</b> to eight <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery in the articular cartilage...|$|R

5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> delivery.|$|E
