Dhamans are large snakes, growing to 2 m and occasionally even to 3 m. Their colour varies from pale browns in dry regions to nearly black in moist forest areas. Dhamans are diurnal, semi-arboreal, non-venomous, and fast-moving. Dhamans eat a variety of prey and are frequently found in urban areas where rodents thrive.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{hematology}} and serum biochemistry parameters of Indian spectacled cobra (Naja naja) and <b>Indian</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> (Ptyas mucosa) and {{to evaluate the}} differences in the same between captive and wild populations. Materials and Methods: Animals were categorized into four groups, viz., wild Indian spectacled cobra (n= 10), wild Indian rat snakes (n= 10), captive Indian spectacled cobra (n= 10), and captive <b>Indian</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> (n= 10). The snakes were restrained with restraint tubes, and 2 ml of blood was collected from either heart or ventral coccygeal vein. Hematological examinations were performed manually and serum biochemistry assays were performed on semi-automated clinical chemistry analyzer. Results: The values of total erythrocyte count, packed cell volume, and hemoglobin were slightly low in captive spectacled cobras and captive rat snakes compared to wild ones, whereas total leukocyte count was found to be slightly high in wild spectacled cobras compared to captive ones. All the recorded values of biochemical and electrolyte analytes were found to be well within expected range for snakes except for total protein and chloride levels in both the species which was slightly above the expected range. Conclusion: The hematology and serum biochemistry intervals of the two most common Indian snakes are presented here. The data will be useful in routine health evaluations and aiding in better medical management of the species studied. Since this study is the first to report complete hematologic and blood biochemical ranges for the study species, observations made here can also be used as referral intervals for future use...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{following}} snakes {{were located}} and acquired: two albino black rat snakes; one xanthlc black <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> one hypoplgmented black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> with phenotype not previ-ously described; one leucistic Texas <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> one F, wild-type black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> heterozy-gous for albinism, and one male and two female F ^ wild-type Texas <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> heterozy-gous for albinism. Between 1975 and 1983 these snakes {{were subjected to}} various breed-ing combinations to determine their genetics. The results of 29 matings are summarized. All of the aberrant phenotypes {{were found to be}} autosomal recessive mutations. Allellc and nonallellc forms of albinism were found to exist in the black <b>rat</b> <b>snake.</b> The xanthlc form of hypopigmentatlon was found to be tyroslnase-positive partial albinism. Leucism In the Texas <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> appears to be associated with bilateral exophthalmos in some in-stances. The previously undescribed black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> phenotype was designated "brlndle" because of its appearance. It appears to be a genetically determined alteration In the quantity or quality of pigment, or both, and it does not undergo ontogenetic loss of pattern. It is not a form of tyrosinase-positive albinism analogous to the xanthlc phenotype.
