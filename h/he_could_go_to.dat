5|$|Historical markers {{concerning}} Hines' exploits have occasionally included mistaken information. The historical marker {{placed by}} the Indiana Civil War Centennial Commission in 1963 {{in the vicinity}} of Derby, Perry County, Indiana, to memorialize Hines' entry into Indiana states that Hines invaded Indiana in 1862, although he actually did so in 1863. In addition, a marker by the Confederate Monument of Bowling Green in Bowling Green's Fairview Cemetery says that Hines died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the dedication ceremony in 1876, when in reality he died in 1898 and is buried a few hundred feet away.|$|E
25|$|Still restless, he got {{his brother}} {{to write a letter}} of {{recommendation}} to one of his Portuguese friends so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Brazil or Portugal. After less than six months he arrived in São Paulo de Loanda, modern Luanda.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{decided to}} help fight for the Empire and sent 6,500 mounted troops to assist the British efforts, making the war New Zealand's first {{overseas}} military campaign. Virtually every man in New Zealand was desperately keen to get to war, so the first soldiers to go were {{selected on the basis}} of who could afford to go. If a man could provide his own horse, rifle and equipment, costing about £25 in total, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war. The first two of the 10 contingents paid their own way. The proposal to send the first contingent – 200 mounted riflemen – was approved by Parliament prior to the outbreak of war on 28 September 1899. Prime Minister Richard Seddon's proposition to do so was overwhelmingly supported, meeting opposition from only five members of parliament.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the troubled}} {{development}} of Kill the Irishman, Reid {{decided to make}} a documentary about Greene's life; known as Danny Greene: the Rise and Fall of the Irishman. Due to the research he had done for the movie, Reid became specialized in the Northern Ohio crime scene and Greene’s life. Reid felt that by doing the documentary, at least <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> his [...] "grave 'saying I tried'". In 2009, with 17 hours of the documentary shot, Reid was told his film had been green-lit. He joined forces with production company Code Entertainment and engaged with a [...] "reliable" [...] director; Jonathan Hensleigh. They then signed actors Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken to the project. This was followed by the signing of actors Vincent D’Onofrio (Full Metal Jacket), Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas), and Irish actor Ray Stevenson, respectively. Stevenson was filming The Book of Eli when he got a telephone call from Hensleigh, so they arranged to meet in Los Angeles. According to Stevenson, he was drawn to the script and immediately made a deal.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, Perot re-entered {{the presidential}} race, {{with a desire}} to further explain his {{economic}} plans to the American people. The New York Times commented that Perot's [...] "chances of winning are much less than when he quit in July. His only dim practical hope is to confuse and destabilize the contest." [...] He hoped to spend more resources using paid advertisements than holding traditional rallies to spread his message. During the last month of campaigning, Perot left his headquarters in Dallas only to appear in the presidential debates and seven rallies. One aide later commented: [...] "he wanted to do it just like <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the office every day, run for president, and go home and eat dinner." [...] Rather than using professional advisers, Perot employed [...] "political amateurs" [...] whose loyalty was unquestioned. Orson Swindle, whom he had known since the 1970s, was hired as the top aide. Perot's son-in-law Clayton Mulford, who was involved in the early draft effort, was hired as legal adviser. Sharon Holman, who worked for Perot since 1969, was hired as press secretary, and friend Murphy Martin was added as the media chief.|$|E
500|$|Lody {{stated that}} he had been sent to the UK [...] "to remain until the first [...] {{encounter}} had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E

[...] And he had a vodka bottle in his hand... and he was drunk beyond belief. [...] And it really was like a gift for our show. [...] It was like a gift fell out of the sky. [...] <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> , <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Letterman, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> all those shows, and they'd have him arrested. And I said 'Howard, I just walked in and there's a drunken dwarf wearing a Hawaiian lei, with a vodka bottle.' [...] And [...] said, 'Bring him in immediately.' [...] He really found the right place." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, as a sophomore, Ringer {{earned the}} Biggie Munn Award {{given to the}} team's most {{inspirational}} player. In eight games (including five starts), he led the Spartans in rushing with 86 carries for 497yards, despite missing five games with a knee injury. Then-Spartans coach John L. Smith said of Ringer, [...] "Javon Ringer is a special player and a special young man. He has incredible heart and courage. After suffering {{what appeared to be}} a season-ending knee injury, Javon willed himself back onto the playing field. He worked his tail off, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the field and compete with his teammates." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Mason City {{the father}} {{worked as a}} cashier of the First National Bank until it began to lose money in the {{recession}} of 1887. The family then moved to Portland, Oregon, where the father went into the insurance business. James J. Montague entered high school there, finishing in two years so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work to help support the family. Consequently he never attended university, but he made up for his lack of formal education through a love of literature. In the memoir Memory Street, his son Richard wrote: [...] "He was an omnivorous reader, especially {{of the works of}} Shakespeare, Conrad, Mark Twain, O. Henry, Shelley, Keats, Coleridge, Byron [...] Burns" ...|$|E
50|$|During a {{fight against}} Iraqi forces Mustafa Faraj {{was shot in}} his arm, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a {{hospital}} in Iraq, so he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tehran in Iran where he was treated.|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} {{not a word}} beyond this, and before he {{answered}} it he {{made up his mind}} to tell Lady Laura the truth. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Paris because he had no money.|$|R

2500|$|Their {{household}} records witness {{incidents that}} imply a comfortable, even humorous, relationship. Each year on Easter Monday, Edward let Eleanor's ladies trap {{him in his}} bed and paid them a token ransom so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> her bedroom {{on the first day}} after Lent; so important was this custom to him that in 1291, on the first Easter Monday after Eleanor's death, he gave her ladies the money he would have given them had she been alive. [...] Edward disliked ceremonies and in 1290 refused to attend the marriage of Earl Marshal Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk; Eleanor thoughtfully (or resignedly) paid minstrels to play for him while he sat alone during the wedding.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell details {{noteworthy}} {{changes in}} the social and political atmosphere of Barcelona when he returns after three months at the front. He describes a lack of revolutionary atmosphere and the class division that he had thought would not reappear, i.e., with visible division between rich and poor and the return of servile language. Orwell had been determined to leave the POUM, and confesses here that he [...] "would have liked to join the Anarchists," [...] but instead sought a recommendation to join the International Column, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Madrid front. The latter half of this chapter is devoted to describing the conflict between the anarchist CNT and the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the resulting cancellation of the May Day demonstration and the build-up to the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. [...] "It was the antagonism between those who wished the revolution to go forward and those who wished to check or prevent it—ultimately, between Anarchists and Communists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having safely {{withdrawn}} {{his army}} to Dalton, Georgia, General Bragg directed Cleburne's exhausted troops to camp at nearby Tunnel Hill, a town bearing {{the same name}} as the spot where they had made their stand atop Missionary Ridge. Private Matthews reports that the 33rd Alabama was given [...] "some cabins... above the tunnel... some were of round oak poles, others of split oak log, their cracks daubed with clay." [...] Captured shelter halves were used as doors, and the men wintered there as best they could. He writes that those who died here were buried nearby; the regiment would accompany them to their final resting place [...] "with arms [...] reversed, and sounded taps; however, [...] did not always fire blank cartridges from our guns, for fear of exciting other sick men in camp." [...] Though they worried about the nearly worthless currency they were being paid in, [...] "there was not as much complaint as one might suppose, as all realized that the [...] Government was doing all it could for us." [...] Matthews blamed [...] "hospital rats" [...] {{for most of the}} grumbling, and observed that troops in winter quarters played cards, dominoes, dice or keno; those who had a dollar, said <b>he,</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> minstrel shows. Not everyone in the camp had the best interests of their comrades at heart: [...] "two or more sharpers," [...] said he, would accost soldiers doing various chores and seek to con them out of their earnings. One regiment was assigned to twenty-four hours of guard duty every day; whenever the 33rd Alabama drew this duty, they would pack up their gear and march a mile or so to the front lines, leaving behind sick soldiers and a guard over their other property.|$|E

60|$|Nicholas briefly {{said that}} he feared it would be so, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not yet speak {{with any degree of}} certainty; and getting away as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>went</b> home <b>to</b> con Newman's letter once more, and speculate upon it afresh.|$|R

60|$|So in the {{fullness}} of time the complicated devices of Bindon ripened, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mwres {{and tell him that}} the young people were near despair.|$|E
60|$|The {{dismissal}} {{made him}} feel strange, too. <b>He</b> wished <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> upstairs <b>to</b> Frank, {{but he did not}} know how soon Mr. Joyce might want him. He wondered how Frank was getting along, and who the firm would get to help him.|$|R
50|$|At 17, Davis {{found himself}} in front of a judge, who told him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> either <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the California Youth Authority or join the United States Army. He chose the latter. He {{received}} a discharge after 13 months' service.|$|R
60|$|Kenneby {{said that}} he should go back by the 3 P.M. train, but he declined, with {{considerable}} hesitation, the beefsteak and brandy and water. After what had passed between him and Miriam <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Blue Posts with her husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] croaked Blacky. [...] "Farmer Brown's boy {{has turned}} hunter." [...] It {{was such a}} dreadful shock to Blacky {{that it was a}} long time before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "O no," [...] said Ting-a-ling; [...] "I {{will come}} on my blue butterfly. You {{have no idea}} how fast he flies. I do believe <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> your castle nearly as fast as you could yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I met Cap’n Hargreaves as I was a-coming up," [...] he said; [...] "and I {{explained}} to him your ideas on the subject, an’ he went straight back, as straight as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go,</b> <b>to</b> make out his disbursement sheet." ...|$|E
6000|$|Indisputably {{the child}} was {{troublesome}} and out of place, [...] "He was always about," [...] the Vicar used <b>to</b> say. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church {{by virtue of the}} obvious limitations of its cubical content. There was some attempt to satisfy the spirit of that [...] "most foolish and destructive law"--I quote the Vicar--the Elementary Education Act of 1870, by getting him to sit outside the open window while instruction was going on within. But his presence there destroyed the discipline of the other children. They were always popping up and peering at him, and every time he spoke they laughed together. His voice was so odd! So they let him stay away.|$|R
60|$|Her brother {{understood}} {{immediately the}} nature and intention of the peace-offering; {{but it was not}} so easy for him to behave well in the matter, as it was for Mr Harding. It is much less difficult for the sufferer to be generous than for the oppressor. John Bold felt that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the warden's party: he never loved Eleanor better than he did now; he had never so strongly felt how anxious he was to make her his wife as now, when so many obstacles to his doing so appeared in view. Yet here was her father himself, as it were, clearing away those very obstacles, and still he felt that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the house any more as an open friend.|$|R
50|$|At {{the prison}} of Ruzyň an {{official}} {{informed him that}} from there <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> straight <b>to</b> Prešov, on condition {{that he was willing}} to become patriarch of the Orthodox Church in Czechoslovakia. He rejected the offer as an infidelity to the Pope and the faithful, and remained in prison.|$|R
