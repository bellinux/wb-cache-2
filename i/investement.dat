In order to obtain answers to this, the authors use the services of a survey to see how men and women are acting in investments. Chi square test was conducted to obtain answers to the pre-selected variables. As a complement to this, two tables from the Central Bureau of Statistics used to illustrate how these outcomes relate to {{the results of the study}} and previous research. The authors concluded that women’s risk tendency has increased than they have exhibited in the past. This is a result of Sweden's equal society that gives women equal rights and opportunities to obtain knowledge about the stock market as men. The authors could see though that men’s risk tendency in <b>investements</b> is still in a higher level than women. This is manifested by the Central Statistical Office table where men have much larger shareholdings than women in 2015. The authors did conclude that the risk tendency in investments between men and women change over time, however, this is a process that takes time. Women are becoming more active in the stock market, but the men are still more likely to take risks when investing. With this conclusion the first quetsion in this paper could be answered. The authors could also illustrate which of the variables that affected the risk tendency the most, which was the variable age. This could be illustrated by respondents' answers and thechi square test was conducted. The authors were able to conclude that this was because with age comes knowledge and experience in the stock market, leading to both men and women invest to achieve different goals.

However, use of coal-powered electricity stresses the environment and power cuts create an urgent need to reduce the demand. Solar water heaters (SWH) could enable increasing access and affordability of energy services in the townships without stressing the environment or increasing the demand for coal-powered electricity. However, it is an expensive solution {{and the majority of}} the city-level efforts still target the high-consuming households. The benefits for the poor households from using a SWH could though outweigh the high capital <b>investements</b> and {{meet the needs of the}} city's environmental management. The results from this study of 20 households showed that by having an affordable, clean and reliable source of energy for heating water, households were able to use more warm water for bathing and reduce their use of electricity and paraffin. This resulted in improvements in health and quality of life. Also, households' general spending on energy was reduced, which for some enabled an increase in income-generating activities. The use of solar-heated showers was found to be restricted by the issue of sharing and it is argued that the benefits would be greater if each households had their own solar water heater. The estimated increase in water use might raise questions of the solution's future feasibility. Despite this, it can be argued that the changes in the households' energy and water use are likely to result in significant improvements in the households' well-being which could also benefit the city as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{networks}} are proliferating {{currently in the}} world with a rather high pace. The number of mobile telecom subscribers has already exceeded one billion and the number will exceed two billions before the year 2010. The big <b>investements</b> needed in the telecom infrastructure raise the question, how much revenues can the operators and other players expect from the investments and what would limit them. It was shown earlier that the revenues obtained from human users of mobile networks and services are limited ultimately by the time the users are willing and able to use the services. In this paper we look closer at what are more concretely the limiting factors. The problematics is approached from five different points of views. First we analyse how much data is produced in the world in a time unit. This forms in a way the ultimate limit, because what does not exist cannot be transmitted. Second, the data volumes and types produced in organizations are analysed. This gives basis to estimate how much of the organizationally produced data could be transmitted over a mobile channel. Third, we analyze previous research that investigates how the people allocate their time among various activities, like sleep, work, watching TV, traveling to work or leisure activities, etc. Thus, {{only a fraction of the}} time of an individual can be used at the mobile channel. Fourth, cost models for communication capacity use and the key findings based on time users are willing to spend on communicating in private or work context are discussed.

40|$|If SMEs have {{below average}} mark-up ratios - gross {{operating}} profit over value added - {{it is because they}} are less capital intensive - less capital to be remunerated - and not because they are less profitable. On the contrary, their profitability appears higher both in terms of usual accounting ratios and when measured through their valorisation when taken over by groups. This does not mean that growth reduces profit and that SMEs have no incentive to grow. This strong profitability is less a matter of size than a matter of age. They become less profitable when getting old and this fall in profitability is more accentuated {{for those who do not}} grow. This higher profitability can result from a selection effect - only the best SMEs are able to survive. But, with or without selection, one result holds : the underinvestment of existing SMEs cannot be linked up with a problem of under-profitability. It is all the more true that over the last 15 years, the operating profitability of all non-financial societies slightly improved and, thanks to the fall interest rates, their financial profitability distinctly increased. As other firms, SMEs get out of debt, increase dividends and their shareholders equity. More than other firms, they accumulate cash reserves that substitute to short term credit lines, and whose dominant function is to provide a buffer against potential negative shocks, rather than to prepare future <b>investements.</b> This weakness of investment does not prevent these SMEs from being the main source of job creation.
