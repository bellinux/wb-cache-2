50|$|The FB-MultiPier {{analysis}} {{program is a}} nonlinear <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>program</b> capable of analyzing multiple bridge pier structures interconnected by bridge spans. The full structure can {{be subject to a}} full array AASHTO load types in a static analysis or time varying load functions in a dynamic analysis. Each pier structure is composed of pier columns and cap supported on a pile cap and piles/shafts with nonlinear soil. This {{analysis program}} couples nonlinear structural finite element analysis with nonlinear static soil models for axial, lateral and torsional soil behavior to provide a robust system of analysis for coupled bridge pier structures and foundation systems. FB-MultiPier performs the generation of the finite element model internally given the geometric definition of the structure and foundation system as input graphically by the designer. This allows the engineer to work directly with the design parameters and lessens the bookkeeping necessary to create and interpret a model.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded on 6 February 1986, {{initially}} called Oxford Technical Software Ltd, by Dr Richard Trinder and Mr Geoffrey Haines. Both founders were then working at Oxford Magnet Technology, the developer and manufacturer of super conducting magnets for MRI scanners. At the time, Dr Trinder was Marketing Manager, and Mr Haines was Technical Manager to their principle customer Siemens Healthcare. During a trip in 1985 to Germany they both discussed the emerging power and capability of Personal Computers and how this would change the way engineers design products. The initial vision, to write engineering design software for PC’s then took form. Working on early microprocessor computers, initial prototype analysis software was commenced in order to formulate interfaces and capabilities. However, {{it became apparent that}} in order to catch the wave of new software emanating from the USA they decided to acquire UK distribution rights for selected applications. The first product acquired was a <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>program</b> from Algor Inc - one of the first FEA applications available on IBM PC’s running MS-DOS. The company start trading formally on 1 July 1986.|$|E
50|$|Many amateur {{telescope}} makers use cells {{which are}} designed via equal area rule calculation, using {{programs such as}} David Chandler's public domain program, Cell. However, such calculation {{does not account for}} mechanical stresses introduced in one part of a telescope mirror by another part, whereas <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> can be used to reduce such stress. Although general <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>programs</b> such as Nastran will work for mirror cells, an advantage of PLOP is that it can be set to ignore deformation that merely results in refocus of a mirror's parabola. PLOP can be used to calculate floating support points for a mirror's axial (rear) support; however, additional tools are needed to calculate potential error from a mirror's lateral (edge) support.|$|R

40|$|For {{evaluating}} the stress gradient, a mathematical technique {{based on the}} stress field of lower-order C 0 elements is developed in this paper. With nodal stress results and location information, an overdetermined and inconsistent equation of stress gradient is established and the minimum norm least squares solution is obtained by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. This technique {{can be applied to}} any element type in comparison with the superconvergent patch (SCP) recovery for the stress gradient, which requires the quadratic elements at least and has to invert the Jacobi and Hessian matrices. The accuracy and validity of the presented method are demonstrated by two examples, especially its merit of achieving high accuracy with lower-order linear C 0 elements. This method can be conveniently introduced into the general <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>programs</b> as a postprocessing module...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a transputer-based binary tree eigensolver for {{the solution of}} the generalized eigenproblem in linear elastic <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis.</b> The algorithm is based on the method of recursive doubling, which parallel implementation of a number of associative operations on an arbitrary set having N elements is of the order of o(log 2 N), compared to (N- 1) steps if implemented sequentially. The hardware used in the implementation of the binary tree consists of 32 transputers. The algorithm is written in OCCAM which is a high-level language developed with the transputers to address parallel programming constructs and to provide the communications between processors.

40|$|The new BW 1 beamline at the DORIS III {{storage ring}} at HASYLAB in Hamburg was {{characterized}} using ray tracing and <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>programs.</b> The angular {{distribution of the}} beam, power densities at different locations and spectral distributions were calculated. The main aspect for the calculations was the thermal deformation of the optical elements, especially the distortion of the first monochromator crystal resulting from the high power emitted by the wiggler. In the present setup a 4 m long X-ray wiggler is used as the source, imposing a heat load of up to 2. 5 kW on a directly cooled Si(1 1 1) crystal. The bending of this crystal was analyzed by means of X-ray diffractometry.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the development of}} a structural optimization framework adept at accommodating diverse customer requirements. The purpose is to provide a framework accessible to the optimization research analyst. The framework integrates the method of moving asymptotes into the <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>program</b> (FEAP) by exploiting the direct interface capability in FEAP. Analytic sensitivities are incorporated to provide a robust and efficient optimization search. User macros are developed to interface the design algorithm and analytic sensitivity with the <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>program.</b> To test the optimization tool and sensitivity calculations, three sizing and one topology optimization problems are considered. In addition, flutter analysis of a heated panel is analyzed as an example of coupling to nonstructural discipline. In sizing optimization, the calculated semianalytic sensitivities match analytic and finite difference calculations. Differences between analytic designs and numerical ones are less than 2. 0 % and are attributed to discrete nature of finite elements. In the topology problem, quadratic elements are found robust at resolving checkerboard patterns...|$|E
