5|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Stevie Richards {{defeated}} René Duprée {{in a dark}} match, a non-televised match used to generate excitement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march. Deeper planners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> spread the word that the king needed to dismiss his royal bodyguards entirely and replace them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of argument that had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|J. Allen Hynek makes a cameo {{appearance}} in the closing scene. Spielberg's friends Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins cameo as two World War II pilots returning from the mother ship. Real-life ARP technician Phil Dodds cameos as the operator of the ARP 2500 synthesizer communicating with the alien ship. Musician Jerry Garcia also makes an appearance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> scene. Carl Weathers appeared as {{a soldier in the}} film.|$|E

5|$|Jovovich {{played the}} role of Dr. Abigail Tyler in the science-fiction thriller The Fourth Kind and starred in the {{psychological}} thriller Faces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crowd,</b> which was written and directed by Julien Magnat; in the latter film, she plays the survivor of a serial killer’s attack that leaves her suffering from a condition called prosopagnosia, which renders her unable to recognize faces.|$|E
5|$|On February 21, 1965, in Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom, MalcolmX {{began to}} speak to a meeting of the Organization of Afro-American Unity when a {{disturbance}} broke out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> of 400. As MalcolmX and his bodyguards moved to quiet the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot Malcolm in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun. Two other men charged the stage and fired handguns, hitting MalcolmX 16 times.|$|E
5|$|One day {{somebody}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> identified me. Standing {{behind me}} was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over {{what had once been}} her face.|$|E

5|$|TNA {{held two}} $25,000 Fan Challenge {{segments}} next with then-TNA Women's Knockout Champion Awesome Kong and her manager Raisha Saeed offering fans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{the chance to}} face Kong. Kong and Saeed then chose a willing participant and if they defeated Kong they won $25,000. The participants chosen for these segments were predetermined, with each planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> The first encounter pitted Serena D against Kong, which Kong won after slamming Serena face-first into the mat with her signature Implant Buster maneuver at 2 minutes and 26 seconds. The second was between Josie Robinson and Kong, lasting 1 minute and 42 seconds. Kong won the bout after slamming Josie back-first into the mat with her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} day, Booth was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{outside the}} White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. Lincoln {{stated that he}} was in favor of granting suffrage to the former slaves, and Booth declared that it would be the last speech that Lincoln would ever make.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} {{four thousand}} Beatles' fans were present on 7 February 1964 as Pan Am Flight 101 left Heathrow Airport. Among the passengers were the Beatles, {{on their first}} trip to the United States as a band, with their entourage of photographers and journalists, and Phil Spector. When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they were greeted by a second large crowd, with Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a little space, a few people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E
50|$|Hypno-Hustler made a cameo in House of M <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> {{and it was}} not {{revealed}} if {{he played}} a part in this reality.|$|R

60|$|Dave overheard the {{conversation}} {{between the two}} rough-looking men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> car, and so did Phil and Roger. All glanced at each other suggestively.|$|R
5|$|Another catch {{went down}} off Miller {{late in the}} day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip. Charlie Barnett then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller {{completed}} a difficult catch. Compton then hit Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.|$|E
5|$|As {{the factory}} bell rings, the {{cigarette}} girls emerge and exchange banter with young men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> ("La cloche a sonné"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love ("L'amour est un oiseau rebelle"). The men plead {{with her to}} choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don José, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.|$|E
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{a few yards}} apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
60|$|He {{pressed the}} call-button, and, when his room-steward answered, turned Michael {{over to him}} to be taken down below and tied up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> cubby-hole.|$|R
60|$|This {{evidence}} virtually {{decided the}} trial. There {{was a great}} burst of relief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> assembly when <b>the</b> woman's statement {{had come to an}} end.|$|R
50|$|The only {{confirmed}} {{location of}} the video is <b>the</b> Corner Hotel <b>in</b> Richmond <b>in</b> Melbourne, Australia. <b>The</b> band is featured only very briefly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> as fans.|$|R
5|$|Barris finally {{leaves his}} room and meets Patricia in Boston. After {{a cup of coffee}} with her, Barris collapses, {{seemingly}} poisoned. Patricia reveals that she is the mole. Barris has tricked Patricia into drinking from the poisoned cup, and she falls dead. After her death, he returns home and begins writing his autobiography, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. He finally decides to marry Penny. At the end of the ceremony, he sees some of the people he killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Distraught, he confesses to her his double life as a CIA assassin, but she merely laughs, assuming he is joking, and he decides not to correct her.|$|E
5|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus and {{his disciples}} {{go to the}} garden Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to {{identify}} him to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus. In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword {{to cut off the}} ear of a man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.|$|E
5|$|Keibler began {{watching}} {{wrestling with}} her boyfriend at the time, Kris Cumberland. She can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> at Starrcade 1998 before the television title match, dancing in an nWo Wolfpac T-shirt. In late 1999, Keibler entered a contest held by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) {{to find a new}} member of the Nitro Girls dance troupe. In November, she defeated 300 other girls for a spot on the dance troupe and $10,000. Her winning routine was watched by 4.4 million viewers. Keibler performed dance routines every week on WCW's flagship show Monday Nitro under the name Skye. By 2000, Keibler was appearing on WCW as a Nitro Girl, attending school full-time, and cheering for the Baltimore Ravens.|$|E
40|$|We present {{analytical}} expressions for {{the friction}} a sphere experiences when it moves through a macromolecular medium, showing the friction is strongly reduced compared to Stokes' law {{due to an}} entropic depletion effect. Depletion of macromolecules from the sphere surface leads to a low-viscosity layer around the sphere as compared to <b>the</b> viscosity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> bulk. <b>The</b> resulting translational and rotational transport behaviour of a sphere through a polymer solution was analytically resolved using Stokes' stream function theory, showing the spheres apparently slip <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> medium of macromolecules. This slip facilitates particle diffusion...|$|R

50|$|Up to mid August, Webb {{carried a}} 42 {{scoreless}} innings streak. The streak ended against the Brewers on August 23 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>inning.</b> <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> gave two standing ovations.|$|R
5|$|Lownds infuriated the Special Forces {{personnel}} {{even further}} when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian {{refugees from the}} area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB. Lownds feared that NVA infiltrators were mixed up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position {{a short distance from}} the perimeter and from there some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish fans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and gestured to the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took his place in the dugout and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E
5|$|Ochs went on tour {{wearing the}} gold suit, {{backed by a}} rock band, singing his own {{material}} along with medleys of songs by Buddy Holly, Elvis, and Merle Haggard. His fans {{did not know how}} to respond. This new Phil Ochs drew a hostile reaction from his audience. Ochs's March 27, 1970, concerts at Carnegie Hall were the most successful, and by the end of that night's second show Ochs had won over many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> The show was recorded and released as Gunfight at Carnegie Hall.|$|E

60|$|They found places <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> {{restaurant}} car. <b>The</b> {{manufacturer of}} crockery made a highly satisfactory and important meal. Norgate, {{on the other}} hand, ate little. Herr Selingman shook his head.|$|R
