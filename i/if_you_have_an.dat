500|$|Hersey {{began by}} making himself {{familiar}} {{with the work of}} writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. [...] He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material. [...] The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was looking for, and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. [...] Hersey distributed a [...] "Notice to Writers" [...] that described what he was looking for: [...] "strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> idea which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, let us see it." [...] This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories, though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine. [...] Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: [...] "As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten!" ...|$|E
500|$|Enema of the State {{is mainly}} {{considered}} a pop punk album and is even considered a skate punk album. According to Mike Damante of the Daily Cougar, the album [...] "embraces the pop side of pop-punk". The songs on Enema of the State are fast-paced songs regarding [...] "adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over {{the care and}} feeding of girls." [...] Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times called Enema of the State a sampling of [...] "ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection." [...] The songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences. Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—"more specifically, their lack of it, their attitude toward their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it." [...] The band decided to emphasize arrangements, harmonies and melodic ideas rather than the fast-paced nature of Dude Ranch; the change was {{brought about by the}} band, rather than the label. Barker hoped to give the songs varying tempos, something missing in the group's prior recordings. [...] "I told Mark and Tom, 'It's going to be repetitive if all our songs have the same punk-rock beat all the time. Why don't we try some different tempos?'" [...] DeLonge noted he was open to his proposals, and responded, [...] "Dude, I just play guitar and write melodies. You own the beats. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> idea, that's what you're supposed to do." [...] DeLonge later reflected on his desire for a more [...] "pop" [...] sound: ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Graeme Thomson of Uncut {{was not so}} impressed, {{giving the}} album 2 stars out of 5 and stating [...] "You can't fault the raw material, but Collins brings nothing new to these songs. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> overpowering desire to hear him gamely plough through {{renditions}} of [...] "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" [...] and [...] "Uptight", step aboard. For anyone else, Going Back is a heartfelt but pointless exercise in ersatz soul." [...] Terry Staunton of Record Collector was even more negative, defining the album as a set [...] "of 60s soul covers of baffling irrelevance" [...] and wondering, [...] "what possible use could anyone have for weedy-voiced faded Xeroxes of songs readily available in their wondrously uplifting original form?" ...|$|E
2500|$|However, both Benko and Webb {{advocate}} what Webb {{calls the}} [...] "barrage technique": analyze a forced sequence of moves, then play them quickly. Webb explains, [...] "For example, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> obvious exchange of pieces available, don't play it immediately, but first decide {{on your next}} move, and then play them both at once. ... The aim is to catch your opponent with a move he hasn't considered. He will probably have considered most sensible moves in the position on the board, but since he doesn't know what your first move is going to be, he can't prepare replies to your second or third moves. The effect of an unexpected second move bashed out instantaneously can be shattering, even if it isn't particularly good." [...] (Both Benko and Webb emphasize that a player who has a winning position should not play quickly in his opponent's time pressure. Likewise, GM Luděk Pachman remarks, [...] "It is best to continue with one's sound strategic plan, and if one has the better position, it is completely illogical to fish in the murky waters of the opponent's time trouble.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Music {{channels}} {{owned by}} Viacom, including MTV and VH1, refused to air Jackson's videos or only aired them in minor rotation following the incident, stated to be [...] "a major catalyst" [...] in the album's performance. The Associated Press stated [...] "MTV's [...] "Spanking New" [...] videos in heavy rotation include a gyrating, cleavage-baring Beyoncé [...] and a bleeped-out Eminem with his group D12 [...] Yet the sedate new video from Janet Jackson—a fixture {{on the cable}} channel {{for almost two decades}} and its first [...] "MTV Icon"—has been absent from its playlist. Meanwhile, Jackson's name had barely been mentioned on MTV—unusual for a superstar whose previous projects have typically gotten heavy promotion." [...] Jackson's collaborator Jimmy Jam commented [...] "You can probably read between the lines with MTV." [...] "I would guess that if MTV wanted to play it, they would, but this is just speculation on my part. It certainly could raise a few questions <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> investigative mind." [...] Jam also commented, [...] "It's tough to click with audiences when you don't get support from the major media outlets." [...] "It's interesting because the video was sent to Viacom" [...] – [...] "but somehow MTV didn't ?" [...] Roger Friedman of Fox News ridiculed the decision; stating [...] "One thing is certain, however: Janet is being scapegoated for her Super Bowl [...] "wardrobe malfunction." [...] Imagine that MTV, where illiteracy and lewdness thrive most of the day, would banish Janet's new video because of her [...] "reputation." [...] Who are they trying to kid? Of course, MTV is a corporate cousin of CBS, where the original snafu happened. But that's just a coincidence!" ...|$|E
