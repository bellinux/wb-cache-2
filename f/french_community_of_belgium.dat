The case of the French-speaking inhabitant was forwarded to a Dutch-speaking chamber (since the other two plaintiffs were removed from the case, the competetent chamber changed) and debates were reopened. On 25 February 1998, the municipality of Kraainem (in the periphery of Brussels, with a French-speaking majority) had initiated another case, also requesting annulment of the directive. On 28 May, Wemmel and Wezembeek-Oppem filed for intervention, joined by Drogenbos on 28 July 2008. The municipalities (and a number of French-speaking inhabitants) claimed that the directive introduced new rules, and thus conflicted with art. 129, §2 of the Constitution.|$|E

The economic consequences frame, followed by the power frame, appeared most prominently in all of the newspapers' coverage. However, the conflict and nationalisation frames recurred in a significantly lesser degree. These findings indicate that the meaning behind the EU Constitution as a symbol of supranational unity could have led to a shift from a domesticated, conflict oriented coverage as found in previous studies to a more unified portrayal of the EU within and between the quality papers under study...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of intergroup trust and recognition of past sufferings on intergroup attitudes {{in a situation where}} the members of a group share a collective memory of victimization. The recurring conflicts between the Dutch- and <b>French</b> speaking <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium</b> provide an interesting research field to test the assumption that a reconstructive discourse on collective memory (see Ferry, 1996), that is acknowledging the perspectives of the different rival groups on their past, has the potential to improve intergroup relations. We conducted an experiment among Dutch-speaking students (N = 80) in which we manipulated the degree of importance that French-speakers gave to historical episodes of past victimizations in order to test its impact on the Dutch-speakers’ attitudes towards the French-speakers. Results show that intergroup attitudes were most favorable among the high-trusting Dutch-speaking participants when they were led to believe that the French-speakers judged important the events were both communities were considered as victims (Mixed victimization condition), compared to the conditions were only French-speaking sufferings or only Dutch-speaking sufferings were considered important. However, the same Mixed victimization condition elicited less positive attitudes among the low-trusting participants. This suggests that reconsidering the past in a reconciliation perspective could not be effective without paying attention to the level of trust in current group relationships. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Organizational {{performance}} {{is a central}} theme in organizational analysis. But how can organizations make their way towards high performance? We focus on the 56 sport governing bodies from the <b>French</b> speaking <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium.</b> We emphasize the constituents of their organizational performance, that is their missions (elite sport, sport for all and customers missions) and their processes and skills we respectively measure and assess for 20 of them. Due to the small N-sample and the causal complexity inherent in this research, we perform a crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA) {{in order to identify}} the complex relations between these constituents. We highlight three combinations of key determinants linked with high performance. These are th three pathways according to which governing bodies might reach performance. The first one is being proactive. They should provide sport and non sport services to give added value to their members and elites. The second one is both to involve paid staff in the decision making processes and to develop a project shared by volunteers, paid staff and sport clubs. And the third one, for small governing bodies which have no sufficient resources to organize various sport activities, is to delegate these to their sport clubs and to involve volunteers. According to these pathways, we propose a performance management tool to help sport governing bodies to reach their missions. Our research shows that combinations of factors are useful to understand and to « explain » high performance. (EDPH 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R

40|$|A {{bottom-up}} {{approach to the}} German minorities policy in Belgium The Belgian state is organized according {{to the principle of}} territorialism. As a result, state politics and language policy are closely interwoven. The political crisis of 2008 rekindled the debate on the necessity of a new state reform, which would basically result in a further power transfer from the national toward the regional governments. Concretely this implies the search for a balance between the Dutch speaking and <b>French</b> speaking <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium.</b> The German speaking community, which has been recognized as a national minority, is often neglected in such negotiations. Its current rights as a minority aren’t the result of its own emancipation, but rather an epiphenomenon of past negotiations between the other communities. As such, a state reform could have far-reaching consequences for German speaking Belgians. In my research I investigate whether the language policy ‘from above’ meshes with the experiences of the language user ‘from below’. I examine which interaction between (German speaking) citizens and the state can be useful to counterbalance certain needs created by the current German minorities policy. The data are drawn from a survey that is the biggest in its kind so far (1137 respondents). I asked German speaking and non-German speaking citizens to evaluate the minority policy and to characterize its desired and undesired (side-) effects. In the context of the present conference, this case-study should provide interesting comparative data for studies on language contact and language policy worldwide. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} the infant vaccination coverage in Belgium, a random cluster sample {{according to the}} {{expanded program on immunization}} (EPI) cluster sampling technique was performed in 1999 in the Flemish (Flanders) and <b>French</b> (Wallonia) speaking <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium.</b> The objective was to document the infant vaccination coverage retrospectively in 18 - 24 -month-old children. In addition, the study offered the opportunity to assess some factors influencing vaccine uptake in infants. RESULTS: In the Flemish community infant vaccination coverage could not be associated with any of the socio-demographic factors, with two exceptions: the province (county) and the hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination. The main reason for not complying with the vaccination schedule was mainly carelessness on either parent's or physician's side. In the <b>French</b> speaking <b>community</b> parents feel mostly themselves responsible for the non-vaccination or incomplete vaccination of their child, except for pertussis. For all vaccines, the attitude of the physician is mentioned as being very influential in the decision to vaccinate a child. Most of the socio-demographic factors showed no association with the infant vaccination coverage. CONCLUSION: The surveys in Flanders and Wallonia stress the importance of having information made available, and underline the role parents as well as physicians (and nurses) play in the infant immunization coverage.

40|$|Health {{promotion}} {{concept and}} practices have brought many significant changes even in disease management and care settings. In the Ottawa charter, health promotion {{is defined as}} "the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health". However, care settings are in contradiction with this process on several levels (focus on disease and not enough on health, concern more on cure than on care, etc.). The emergence of health promotion practices has been deeply questioning these features. Care institutions start to reconsider their role and missions. However, changes are slow {{and there has been}} much resistance. What is the current situation of health promotion in French speaking Belgian care institutions in 1998 ? The WHO EUROPE HEALTH PROMOTING HOSPITALS' (HPH) project, which officially started in 1991, aims at "promoting positive health and well-being in hospitals and beyond that, in the community". For each participating hospital, the implications of membership have an important influence on the institution and care project, because it implies adherence to the principles of the Ottawa charter on health promotion, and to the philosophy and objectives <b>of</b> HPH. <b>Belgium</b> joined the WHO project and the HPH network in 1996. It was necessary to review the situation of health care institutions in the <b>French</b> speaking <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium</b> {{in order to understand the}} evolution over the last years, to assess health professionals expectations and the feasibility of some actions, and to provide political decision makers with information likely to influence future decisions and choices in a positive way. This article presents the descriptive results of a survey carried out on nursing and patient education departments in health care institutions. Half of 105 hospitals answered the questionnaires sent. Out of these answers, 150 projects and actions were identified and briefly described by the institutions, which had the possibility to present a maximum of five actions. The main topics addressed were chronic diseases, psychology (conflict management, aggressiveness, ill-treatment), maternity, screening, prevention and vaccination. Regarding perspectives, 78 % of actions concern disease and/or risks of disease (therapeutic or preventive perspectives) and 22 % concern the maintenance or improvement of health. 90 % of listed and described actions are permanent, and only 10 % are selective (limited), which suggests an evolution of projects and their integration in practices. Concerning the number of projects, two aspects were analysed: the number by institution and the evolution over the last twenty years. On average, there are 3. 2 actions per institution. As for the evolution, 7 % of hospitals said they had at least one education action/project in 1980, 60 % in 1990 and 98 % in 1998. This amazing and remarkable evolution occurred simultaneously to the development of education committees, of patient education co-ordinators and/or resource persons. In this field, there was also a remarkable evolution since the creation of the first committees in 1983. Amongst the elements encouraging the development of information and health education initiatives and actions mentioned by hospital managers, the first one is a demand from the public (and patients).
