40|$|IntroductionWith {{the growing}} number of oral {{targeted}} therapies being approved for use in cancer therapy, the potential for long-term administration of these drugs to cancer patients is expanding. The use of these drugs in the home setting has the potential to expose family members and caregivers to them either through direct contact with the drugs or indirectly by exposure to the parent compounds and/or their active metabolites in contaminated patient's waste. MethodsA systematic literature review was performed and the known adverse health effect of 32 oral targeted therapeutics is summarized. In particular, the carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and <b>embryo-foetal</b> <b>toxicity,</b> along with the route of excretion were evaluated. ResultsCarcinogenicity testing has not been performed on most of the oral targeted therapeutics and the genotoxicity data are mixed. However, the majority of these drugs exhibit adverse reproductive effects, some of which are severe. Currently available data does not permit the possibility of a health hazard from inappropriate handling of drugs and contaminated patients waste to be ignored, especially in a long-term home setting. Further research is needed to understand these issues. ConclusionsWith the expanding use of targeted therapies in the home setting, family members and caregivers, especially those of reproductive risk age, are, potentially at risk. Overall basic education and related precautions should be taken to protect family members and caregivers from indirect or direct exposure from these drugs. Further investigations and discussion on this subject is warranted. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2018 - 01 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 27009803 PMC 5628499 vault: 2482...|$|E

Pregnant women with gestational age < 20 weeks were recruited from Maternal Health clinics or from monthly house visits (demographic surveillance), and followed prospectively until delivery. 2167 pregnant women were recruited and 1783 (82. 3 %) completed the study until delivery. 319 (17. 9 %) used anti-malarials in first trimester, of whom 172 (53. 9 %) used (AL), 78 (24. 4 %) quinine, 66 (20. 7 %) sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and 11 (3. 4 %) amodiaquine. Quinine exposure in first trimester was associated with an increased risk of miscarriage/stillbirth (OR 2. 5; 1. 3 – 5. 1) and premature birth (OR 2. 6; 1. 3 – 5. 3) as opposed to AL with (OR 1. 4; 0. 8 – 2. 5) for miscarriage/stillbirth and (OR 0. 9; 0. 5 – 1. 8) for preterm birth. Congenital anomalies were identified in 4 exposure groups namely AL only (1 / 164 [0. 6 %]), quinine only (1 / 70 [1. 4 %]), SP (2 / 66 [3. 0 %]), and non-anti-malarial exposure group (19 / 1464 [1. 3 %]). Exposure to AL in first trimester was more common than to any other anti-malarial drugs. Quinine exposure was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes which was not the case following other anti-malarial intake. Since AL and quinine were used according to their availability rather than to disease severity, {{it is likely that the}} effect observed was related to the drug and not to the disease itself. Even with this caveat, a change of policy from quinine to AL for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria during the whole pregnancy period could be already envisaged...|$|E
