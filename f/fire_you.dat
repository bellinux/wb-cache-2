500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed, the crowd around Private White grew {{larger and more}} boisterous. Church bells were rung, which usually {{signified}} a fire, bringing more people out. Over fifty Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race runaway slave named Crispus Attucks, throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White, who had taken up a somewhat safer position {{on the steps of}} the Custom House, sought assistance. Runners alerted the nearby barracks and Captain Thomas Preston, the officer of the watch. According to his report, Preston dispatched a non-commissioned officer and six privates of the 29th Regiment of Foot, with fixed bayonets, to relieve White. The soldiers Preston sent were Corporal William Wemms, Hugh Montgomery, John Carroll, William McCauley, William Warren, and Matthew Kilroy. Accompanied by Preston, they pushed their way through the crowd. En route, Henry Knox, again trying to reduce tensions, warned Preston, [...] "For God's sake, take care of your men. If they <b>fire,</b> <b>you</b> must die." [...] Captain Preston responded [...] "I am aware of it." [...] When they reached Private White on the custom house stairs, the soldiers loaded their muskets, and arrayed themselves in a semicircular formation. Preston shouted at the crowd, estimated to number between three and four hundred, to disperse.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Beyoncé Knowles told a {{reporter}} from The Independent [...] "how inspired she's been by the whole drag-house circuit in the States, an unsung part of black American culture where working-class gay men channel ultra-glamour in mocked-up catwalk shows. 'I still have that in me', {{she says of the}} 'confidence and the <b>fire</b> <b>you</b> see on stage... '" ...|$|E

I was joking about <b>firing</b> <b>you.</b> You ought to know that, after the talk we had at Mouquin's the other night. You can't {{be thinking}} of leaving us! There's no end of possibilities here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Jonas, [...] "they {{are afraid}} {{you will take}} cold. As long as you run about and play around the <b>fires,</b> <b>you</b> keep warm." ...|$|R
2500|$|Flight Lieutenant Ian Gleed of 87 Squadron {{wrote about}} the effect of using the extra boost on the Hurricane while chasing a Bf 109 at low {{altitude}} on 19 May 1940: [...] "Damn! We're flat out as it is. Here goes with the tit. A jerk– boost's shot up to 12 pounds; speed's increased by 30 mph. I'm gaining ground– 700, 600, 500 yards. Give him a burst. No, hold your <b>fire</b> <b>you</b> fool! He hasn't seen you yet..." [...] Gleed ran out of ammunition before he could shoot the 109 down although he left it heavily damaged and flying at about [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Navy's best {{test pilot}}, Captain Eric Brown, chief naval test pilot and {{commanding}} officer of the Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight Royal Aircraft Establishment, who tested the Me 262 noted: [...] "This was a Blitzkrieg aircraft. You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly and hope for the best. If you want to sight and <b>fire,</b> <b>you</b> need to double that time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, you could have done that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He said so; only he {{went off}} so quickly, and was so busy with things, that we hardly {{understood}} him. Is it not dreadful {{that there should be}} such fighting? And then these horrid <b>fires!</b> <b>You</b> {{were in the middle of}} the <b>fire,</b> were <b>you</b> not?" [...] It suited Kate's feelings that Medlicot should be the hero of this occasion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, madam," [...] said Frank, [...] "some {{one must}} {{look after the}} <b>fires,</b> <b>you</b> know, else London would be in ashes in a few months; and I like the work." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{this message}} reads at my discretion," [...] said Neale. [...] "It's a plain {{surprise}} to me. I've {{no intention of}} making you lose your back pay, or of <b>firing</b> <b>you,</b> either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think again," [...] Saton said. [...] "There {{was only}} {{a corner of the}} wood between you and that field when the shot was <b>fired.</b> <b>You</b> are walking there now, now, as the shots are <b>fired.</b> Bend forward. <b>You</b> can see through those trees if you try.

6000|$|... "It was dirt mean, lad, an' I about {{told him}} so, too. But the Felpses always {{was a hard}} crowd to deal with. He thought he was gettin' one in on Mr. Dodge when he <b>fired</b> <b>you</b> out." ...|$|R
6000|$|As soon as Hen heard that, {{and felt}} {{sure it was}} not a dream, which he did in about half a second, he began to yell, too, and to say: [...] "How did <b>you</b> get there? <b>Fire,</b> fire, <b>fire!</b> What are <b>you</b> on? <b>Fire!</b> Are <b>you</b> in a tree, or what? <b>Fire,</b> <b>fire!</b> Are <b>you</b> in a flat-boat?

6000|$|... "Now I {{begin to}} {{understand}} how you got your jacket tore up and that lump on your forehead," [...] he said. [...] "I wasn't quite sure about your tale, anyway, and if Harry <b>fired</b> <b>you</b> it was for something mean. You'll get no horse from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{know of no}} one beside yourself, Chainbearer, who {{has been}} hurt to-night.

6000|$|THE OFFICER. (on the balcony, {{shouting}} savagely {{down to the}} street). Cease <b>firing</b> there, <b>you</b> fools: do <b>you</b> hear?
