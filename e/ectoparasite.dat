5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative <b>ectoparasite,</b> as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering in the water column. To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and <b>ectoparasite</b> removal service to larger, often predatory fish. Cleaner species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E

These <b>ectoparasites</b> can transmit rodents’ pathogens to human or animals. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the distribution and infestation load of <b>ectoparasites</b> on rodents in Meshkin-Shahr District, northwestern Iran. Method: Rodents were captured using baited live traps in spring 2014 from Meshkin-Shahr District and were trans­ferred to the laboratory for identification to the species level. Their <b>ectoparasites</b> were collected, mounted and identi­fied. Results: Three rodent species including Meriones persicus  (74 %),  Mus musculus  (16. 9 %)  and Cricetulus migrato­rius (9 %) were identified. Among all rodents, 185 specimens (90. 69 %) were infested with a total of 521 ectopara­sites. Overall, 10 arthropods species were collected, including fleas (97. 6 %), one mite (1. 6 %) and one louse species (0. 6 %) as follows: Xenopsylla nubica, X. astia, X. buxtoni, X. cheopis, Nosopsyllus fasciatus, N. iranus, Cten­ocephalides felis, Ctenophthalmus rettigismiti, Ornithonyssus sp and one species of genus Polyplax.

40|$|Abstract. The {{life cycles}} and biology of the {{arthropods}} that affect livestock in Canadian grasslands are reviewed. The blood-feeding dipterous parasite complex consists {{of members of}} the families Culicidae, Ceratopogoinidae, Simuliidae, Tabanidae, and Muscidae. Field <b>ectoparasites</b> that affect grazing livestock include several species of ixodid ticks. The blood-feeding dipterous parasite complex and the field <b>ectoparasites</b> consist mainly of native species that were able to readily colonize introduced domestic livestock. A few important species of Muscidae were introduced with livestock, and these species tend to be more specialized. Populations of field <b>ectoparasites</b> and the blood-feeding dipterous complex have responded positively to various environmental perturbations, including irrigation, dam construction, and animal feeding practices. Cultivation may have reduced habitat for some field <b>ectoparasites.</b> Endo- and ectoparasitic arthropods are more specialized and were most likely introduced with their domestic hosts. Populations of these arthropods are affected by host factors such as body temperature, grooming, and immunity. Résumé.
