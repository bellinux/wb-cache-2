The most dramatic of these encounters was with Deborah Willet, a young woman engaged as a companion for Elisabeth Pepys. On 25 October 1668, Pepys was surprised by his wife as he embraced Deb Willet; he writes that his wife [...] "coming up suddenly, did find me imbracing the girl con [...] my hand sub [...] su [...] coats; and endeed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> main [...] in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also...." [...] Following this event, he was characteristically filled with remorse, but (equally characteristically) continued to pursue Willet after she had been dismissed from the Pepys household.|$|E

60|$|Familiar as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> friend's methods, {{it was not}} {{difficult}} for me to follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of attire, the sheaf of legal papers, the watch-charm, and the breathing which had prompted them.

60|$|I {{asked him}} what was for his service, {{and he said he}} would take rum; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near. I paused where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> napkin in my hand.|$|E

6000|$|... "Since I {{came there}} first to boarding-school," [...] she answered. [...] "A little child <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> hair in {{pigtails}} and frocks to my knees.

60|$|One autumn morning <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> {{mother in}} the front garden, when Mr. Murdstone--I knew him by that name now--came by, on horseback.

60|$|Gasping as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own hamper, I could not, for {{the life}} of me, help {{laughing}} at Long Ghost.

6000|$|Again {{the drops}} of sweat {{came out and}} stood thick upon his forehead. But this Mr Apjohn could {{understand}} without making an accusation against the man, even in his heart.

[...] "Yes," [...] said he; [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> uncle on that morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aaron," [...] he said, in a tremble of pity, [...] "I {{know what}} is the real sorrow of your life, and I rejoice because I can {{put an end to}} it.

6000|$|The girl {{laid her}} hand upon his arm appealingly. [...] "I {{have a little}} my mother left me, and it was hers before she married my father.

Geoffrey saved my life, Sir Patrick," [...] he added, his voice rising, and his eyes brightening with honest admiration of his friend. [...] "But for him, I should have been drowned in a boat-accident. Isn't that {{a good reason for}} his being a friend of mine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] said Sir Launcelot, [...] "such {{constraint}} as {{that would}} be very pleasing to me at another time.

60|$|I hated looking, and I {{could not}} help but look. It was as if this detestable old woman was {{dragging}} me down and down, down far below all dignity to her own level of a peeping observer.

I could have sworn aloud at the hopeless indignity of my pose.|$|E
