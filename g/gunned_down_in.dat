25|$|Orators, Rostrums, and Propaganda Stands {{is based}} on the work of Gustav Klutsis, {{including}} his designs for Screen-radio Orators, Rostrums, and Propaganda Stands from 1922.

Each of these images is juxtaposed, in montage, with frames from the Odessa Steps scene of Sergei Eisenstein‘s historic Battleship Potemkin film. When touched, the virtual objects play sound from the uprising. The stands call up both the resurgence and nostalgia of current worldwide political idealism as they re-imagine the museum plaza in the function of the public square.|$|E
