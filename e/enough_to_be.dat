5|$|Like other lanthanides, many isotopes, {{especially}} isotopes with odd mass {{numbers and}} neutron-poor isotopes like 152Eu, have high cross sections for neutron capture, often high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> neutron poisons.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{was already}} {{working on a}} key {{component}} of the device. In April 1943, Robert Serber had proposed that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day half life, which made it intense <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful but long-lived <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto to work on the development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the urchin detonators.|$|E

These lesions may bleed intermittently, which is rarely significant <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> noticed (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus excelsus was the {{original}} type species of Brontosaurus, first named by Marsh in 1879. Elmer Riggs reclassified Brontosaurus as a synonym of Apatosaurus in 1903, transferring the species B.excelsus to A.excelsus. In 2015 Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson argued that the species was distinct <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> placed in its own genus, so they reclassified it back into Brontosaurus.|$|E
