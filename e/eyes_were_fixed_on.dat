[...] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see— made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of use to us all, it is a general opinion, is it not so Lord Stair? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said —I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.|$|E
60|$|Edith's steel-grey <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> him, coldly compelling.|$|E
60|$|Everybody was astonished, and everybody's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> me inquiringly.|$|E
60|$|THE MALE FIGURE [after {{a slight}} {{convulsion}} during which his <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the He-Ancient] Spare her; and kill me.|$|R
60|$|Then comes {{a moment}} of expectation, every one is {{trembling}} with excitement. There is perfect silence. All <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the open gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; the farmer's <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the furrow; he {{must follow}} the plow. His crop and his stock are nearer him; he cannot see past them. The wanderer's mind is free." ...|$|R
60|$|Her wide, dark-filled <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> him, {{like two}} moons of darkness.|$|E
60|$|But Winifred's large <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> her, and {{the girl}} did not move.|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced at}} Eliphalet, {{to find that}} his <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the {{approaching}} couple.|$|E
60|$|Deep silence followed, and Andrew {{saw that}} every <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> him. He <b>was</b> acting against all precedent--opposing his {{colleagues on the}} Board, who were, in a manner, {{entitled}} to his support.|$|R
60|$|Through {{the court}} ran a stir and shuffle, {{as it might}} be of sympathy with his lost divinity, and every <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> that tall, lean figure, with the shaven face, and red, grey-streaked hair.|$|R
60|$|The medical {{evidence}} was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and every <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the famous London specialist, {{who was known}} {{to be one of the}} greatest authorities of the day on the subject of toxicology.|$|R
60|$|Dane {{glanced at}} Winston {{somewhat}} ruefully, but the latter's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> Colonel Barrington.|$|E
60|$|Here Lady Madeleine passed again, {{and this}} time the Baron's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the ground.|$|E
60|$|Pierre, Isabel, and Delly were {{standing}} in the room; Isabel's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the cot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody CALLS it St. George's now," [...] Cleer answered, with girlish persistence. And {{her father}} looked round at her sharply, with an {{impatient}} snap of the fingers, while Mrs. Trevennack's <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> him now more carefully and more earnestly, Tyrrel observed, than ever.|$|R
60|$|Two figures, a man {{and woman}} of noble appearance, beautifully {{modelled}} and splendidly attired, emerge hand in hand from the temple. Seeing that all <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> them, they halt on the steps, smiling with gratified vanity. The woman is on the man's left.|$|R
60|$|Instantly every <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> Curtis's bent head as {{he opened}} the letter.

A nervous chill ran though Elsie's blood and Parker turned pale and cold.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Susie's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> Haddo's cruel telegram. She {{seemed to}} hear his mocking laughter.|$|E

60|$|Gradually I {{became aware}} that his {{piercing}} <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> me, and in answer I {{turned and looked at}} him.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Jack {{still held}} the bunch of white straw aloft. Every <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> it, {{but not a}} man moved, because it {{remained}} stationary. This absence of pursuit {{in the midst of}} such appalling sights and sounds must, undoubtedly, have added to the mystery and therefore to the terrors of the scene.|$|R
60|$|Grant's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> eagerly <b>on</b> the speaker, {{although}} the others scarcely turned their heads.|$|R
60|$|Dunwoodie {{caught up}} the fatal paper, that still lay {{where it had}} fallen from his own hands, and studied its {{characters}} intently. Something seemed to bewilder his brain. He passed {{his hand over his}} forehead, while each <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> him in dreadful suspense--all feeling afraid to admit those hopes anew that had been so sadly destroyed.|$|R
6000|$|Stanmer hooked {{extremely}} meditative; his <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> mine. [...] "Yes, {{that marriage}} is hard to get over. It was not becoming." ...|$|E
60|$|The fan {{had dropped}} into Christian's lap; it rested on her white frock {{like a large}} crimson leaf; her <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> it.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not look}} at Romola as he said this, but he knew quite well that her <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> him with delight.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{features}} are perfect Elinor," [...] answered Walter, [...] "and {{at the first}} glance the expression seemed also hers; but I could fancy that the portrait has changed countenance while I {{have been looking at}} it. The <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> mine with a strangely sad and anxious expression. Nay, it is grief and terror. Is this like Elinor?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Ferrars laid it beside her, {{and held}} aloof. Gilbert's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> intently <b>on</b> it.|$|R
60|$|His <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> brightly <b>on</b> her, {{the pupils}} large and {{electric}} {{like those of}} a cat.|$|R
60|$|Malvina's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the Professor. In the {{dim light}} of the low-ceilinged room, those eyes seemed all of her that was visible.|$|E
6000|$|Teddy's <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> {{his father}}, {{and all his}} father could do was to whisper, 'Sit still, Teddy. You mustn't move. Teddy, keep still.' ...|$|E
60|$|All <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the man. He {{was looking}} down at the woman like a {{creature}} spell-bound or possessed by some devil's own intention.|$|E
60|$|LEMMY. Wot <b>is</b> it? [His <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> fearfully <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> LADY WILLIAM] I fought {{everybody}} knew 'em.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now {{comes the}} trial!' whispered Claude to Lilias, {{after he had}} vehemently contributed his {{proportion}} to the noise. Lilias saw that his colour had risen, as much {{as if he had}} to make a speech himself, and he earnestly examined the coronet on his fork, while every other <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the Marquis. Eloquence was not to be expected; but, at least, Lord Rotherwood spoke clearly and distinctly.|$|R
60|$|No one spoke, but I think {{a thrill}} ran through {{everybody}} in the room, and I know the blood rose to my face. Still, I fancy their own sensations troubled very few of my companions for every <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> their leader, as the stiffness seemed suddenly to melt out of him. He gasped, {{and for a moment}} or two seemed to be struggling to recover himself.|$|R
