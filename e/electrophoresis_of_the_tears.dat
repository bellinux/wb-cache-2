40|$|The {{advancement}} in adaptive optics {{in recent years}} has increased the interest in <b>the</b> dynamic aberrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye, including those introduced by the first optical surface provided by <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film. A curvature sensing system to measure <b>the</b> dynamic topography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film is described. This optical system was used to measure <b>the</b> aberrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film on 14 eyes. <b>The</b> evolution <b>of</b> this surface is monitored through videos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film topography. <b>The</b> effect on optical quality is studied from <b>the</b> time-evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RMS wavefront error showing non-negligible aberration variations attributed to <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film layer; <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>tear</b> film break-up on the ocular optical quality is also discussed. Furthermore, the aberration maps are decomposed into their constituent Zernike components showing stronger contributions from 4 th order terms, and also from those components with vertical symmetry which can be attributed to <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye lids on <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film.
