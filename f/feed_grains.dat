25|$|The {{market economy}} {{was based on}} extracting and {{processing}} natural resource and agricultural products for local consumption, such as mining, gristmills and sawmills, and the export of agricultural products. The most important agricultural exports were raw and processed <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> (wheat, Indian corn, rice, bread and flour) and tobacco. Tobacco was a major crop in the Chesapeake Bay region and rice a major crop in South Carolina. Dried and salted fish was also a significant export. North Carolina was the leading producer of naval stores, which included turpentine (used for lamps), rosin (candles and soap), tar (rope and wood preservative) and pitch (ships' hulls). Another export was potash, which was derived from hardwood ashes and {{was used as a}} fertilizer and for making soap and glass.|$|E
25|$|However, , {{there was}} still a {{significant}} amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the oilseeds, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, <b>feed</b> <b>grains</b> and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy. Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers. Unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn, soybeans, cows) are generally graded to indicate quality. The quality affects the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight.|$|E

McGovern had a fractious relationship with Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, who was less sympathetic to farmers; McGovern's 1966 resolution to informally scold Freeman made the senator popular back in his home state. Fellow new senator Edward M. Kennedy saw McGovern as a serious voice on farm policy and often sought McGovern's guidance on agriculture-related votes. McGovern was largely inactive on the Interior Committee until 1967, when he was given the chair of the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs. However, Interior Committee chair Henry M. Jackson, who did not get along with McGovern personally or politically, refused to allow McGovern his own staff, greatly limiting his effectiveness. McGovern regretted not accomplishing more for South Dakota's 30,000 Sioux Indians, although after a McGovern-introduced resolution on Indian self-determination passed in 1969, the Oglala Sioux named McGovern [...] "Great White Eagle".|$|E

The results suggest that there exists a relatively high degree of arbitrage between Maritime <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> prices and those of Thunder Bay or Chatham for equivalent quality, price transmission being strictly from West to East. Although the LOP hypothesis must be rejected in the short run, in most cases, it was found to hold in the long run. Local markets appear to be highly integrated and price adjustment occurs within a period of four to six weeks, generally corresponding to the lead time of <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> orders and transportation from Western Canada. A price transmission analysis found no evidence of the exercise of market power in the pricing of local grain. In general, the pricing of local grains in the Maritimes may be judged as efficient considering that the lag in price response corresponds to the replacement period for Western grains...|$|R

40|$|Reliability {{of supply}} of <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> {{has become a}} high {{priority}} issue for industry in the northern region. Expansion by major intensive livestock and industrial users of grain, combined with high inter-annual variability in seasonal conditions, has generated concern in the industry about reliability of supply. This paper reports on a modelling study undertaken to analyse the reliability of supply of <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> in the northern region. <b>Feed</b> <b>grain</b> demand was calculated for major industries (cattle feedlots, pigs, poultry, dairy) based on their current size and rate of grain usage. Current demand {{was estimated to be}} 2. 8 Mt. With the development of new industrial users (ethanol) and by projecting the current growth rate of the various intensive livestock industries, it was estimated that demand would grow to 3. 6 Mt in three years time. <b>Feed</b> <b>grain</b> supply was estimated using shire scale yield prediction models for wheat and sorghum that had been calibrated against recent ABS production data. Other crops that contribute to a lesser extent to the total <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> pool (barley, maize) were included by considering their production relative to the major winter and summer grains, with estimates based on available production records. This modelling approach allowed simulation of a 101 -year time series of yield that showed the extent of the impact of inter-annual climate variability on yield levels. Production estimates were developed from this yield time series by including planted crop area. Area planted data were obtained from ABS and ABARE records. Total production amounts were adjusted to allow for any export and end uses that were not <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> (flour, malt etc). The median <b>feed</b> <b>grain</b> supply for an average area planted was about 3. 1 Mt, but this varied greatly from year to year depending on seasonal conditions and area planted. These estimates indicated that supply would not meet current demand in about 30 % of years if a median area crop were planted. Two thirds of the years with a supply shortfall were El Nino years. This proportion of years was halved (i. e. 15 %) if the area planted increased to that associated with the best 10 % of years. Should demand grow as projected in this study, there would be few years where it could be met if a median crop area was planted. With area planted similar to the best 10 % of years, there would still be a shortfall in nearly 50 % of all years (and 80 % of El Nino years). The implications of these results on supply/demand and risk management and investment in research and development are briefly discussed...|$|R
