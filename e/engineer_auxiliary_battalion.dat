25|$|During World War II, Nazi German {{death squads}} {{encouraged}} local populations in German-occupied Europe to commit pogroms against Jews. Brand new battalions of Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz (trained by SD agents) were mobilized {{from among the}} German minorities, {{in order to make}} the local populations share responsibility for the killings. During Operation Barbarossa which lasted from June 22 to December 5, 1941, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler established the Schutzmannschaft collaborationist <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battalions</b> and tasked them with carrying out pogroms behind the front lines.|$|R
50|$|In 1872 the Cardwell Reforms {{began the}} process of organising the British Army along county lines based on two-battalion line {{infantry}} regiments, a process that was completed by the Childers Reforms nine years later. As a result, in 1881 the 28th and the 61st regiments were amalgamated to form the Gloucestershire Regiment, headquartered at Horfield Barracks in Bristol. The reforms also added the county's auxiliary forces to the establishment, and at its formation the regiment thus comprised two regular and four <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battalions...</b>|$|R
50|$|Later Tyutyunnyk {{was offered}} {{command of the}} 6th Siberian {{battalion}} by the regimental command, but because {{he was interested in}} military strategy, the army suggested he undertake formal military studies. Tyutyunnyk successfully took entrance tests to the 1st Kiev gymnasium, but soon he was sent to the Caucasus where he finished a military school in Gori (today in Georgia). After completing his studies, he was again offered command of the 6th battalion, which was still actively fighting during the war. Tyutyunnyk was wounded a second time, and after recuperating, he was sent to Simferopol, where he joined the 32nd <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>battalion.</b>|$|R

5|$|The CardwellChilders reforms {{from the}} 1860s to the 1880s {{substantially}} reorganised the British Army, principally by amalgamating single-battalion regiments to form regiments of multiple battalions. The King's, which already had two regular battalions, did not amalgamate, but did adopt a new title on the numbering system's abolition. Thus, on 1 July 1881, the two battalions of the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, The King's (Liverpool) Regiment. The 8th Foot had {{been associated with}} Liverpool since 1873, when it became allocated to the town's 13th Brigade Depot.

5000|$|For {{decades after}} World War II, Soviet {{authorities}} {{were unwilling to}} acknowledge that the mass murder of Jews at Babi Yar was part of the Holocaust. The victims were generalized as Soviet; mention of their Jewish identity was impermissible, even though their deaths were every bit as much a consequence of the Nazi's genocidal Final Solution as the death camps of occupied Poland (Ehrenburg, Pravda 1944). There was, too, a virtual ban on mentioning the participation of the local police, or the role of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battalions</b> sent to Kiev by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN-B) in rounding up, guarding and murdering their Jewish countrymen. In order to make the connection the Soviets worked so hard to suppress, Holocaust scholars have come to call events such as the massacres at Babi Yar [...] "the Holocaust by bullet." ...|$|R
25|$|Some of the regiment's <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battalions,</b> {{which in}} 1900 were {{increased}} in number with {{the formation of}} the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, also {{played a role in the}} war. On 16 March 1900 a company of 124 officers and men from 1st and 2nd Volunteer Battalions landed at Cape Town. They served for a year alongside 2nd Battalion and were replaced by a second volunteer company in April 1901. 4th (Militia) Battalion, meanwhile, guarded Boer prisoners held on St. Helena. By the war's end the regiment had lost 2 officers and 94 other ranks killed, and 13 officers and 201 men wounded, with a further 250 deaths caused by sickness. The regiment added 4 new battle honours to its colours: 'Defence of Ladysmith'; 'Relief of Kimberley'; 'Paardeberg'; and 'South Africa, 1899–1902'; the last of which was also awarded to the 1st and 2nd volunteer battalions.|$|R

25|$|Before the war, the Indian {{government}} {{had decided that}} India could afford to provide two infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade {{in the event of}} a European war. 140,000 soldiers saw active service on the Western Front in France and Belgium – 90,000 in the front-line Indian Corps, and some 50,000 in <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battalions.</b> They felt that any more would jeopardise national security. More than four divisions were eventually sent as Indian Expeditionary Force A formed the Indian Corps and the Indian Cavalry Corps that arrived on the Western Front in 1914. The high number of officer casualties the corps suffered early on had an effect on its later performance. British officers that understood the language, customs, and psychology of their men could not be quickly replaced, and the alien environment of the Western Front had some effect on the soldiers. However, the feared unrest in India never happened, and while the Indian Corps was transferred to the Middle East in 1915 India provided many more divisions for active service during the course of the war.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the First World War the regiment's four <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battalions</b> were {{converted}} to three Territorial Force battalions and a reserve battalion, and on the outbreak of war a further 18 battalions {{were added to the}} regiment's establishment, 16 of which saw active service during the conflict. During the war the regiment fought in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and Salonika, lost a total of 8,100 men killed, and won 72 different battle honours. Four awards of the Victoria Cross (VC) were made to soldiers serving with the regiment. In the Second World War four battalions of the regiment saw active service in Europe and Burma. After being lost almost in its entirety during the Battle of Dunkirk, the regiment's resurrected 2nd Battalion landed at Gold Beach on D-Day and fought in the allied campaign in North-West Europe. The regiment's 1st Battalion was involved in the retreat from Rangoon during the Japanese conquest of Burma, and its 10th Battalion saw active service in the defeat of the Japanese forces during the Burma Campaign 1944–45.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, the French Directory sank in {{popularity}} after military defeats and mismanagement. Back in Paris, Sérurier {{became part of}} the Bonaparte faction, having seen nothing but disaster since serving under the military genius. Bonaparte launched the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799 during which Sérurier led a reserve detachment of soldiers at the Pont-du-Jour. The next day, the coup almost collapsed when Bonaparte had to be rescued from the Council of Five Hundred. However, Lucien Bonaparte convinced the Council's own guard battalion that only a minority of members opposed his brother. These soldiers soon evicted the lawmakers from their own hall. During these events, Sérurier's troops arrived at Saint-Cloud and the general was heard addressing them, [...] "The wretches! They wished to kill General Bonaparte. Do not stir soldiers; wait until you get orders". In the aftermath of the coup, Sérurier was put on a commission to determine how to use <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battalions</b> on 15 November 1799.

40|$|We {{consider}} a semi-supervised setting for domain adaptation where only unlabeled data {{is available for}} the target domain. One way to tackle this problem is to train a generative model with latent variables on the mixture of data from the source and target domains. Such a model would cluster features in both domains and ensure {{that at least some}} of the latent variables are predictive of the label on the source domain. The danger is that these predictive clusters will consist of features specific to the source domain only and, consequently, a classifier relying on such clusters would perform badly on the target domain. We introduce a constraint enforcing that marginal distributions of each cluster (i. e., each latent variable) do not vary significantly across domains. We show that this constraint is effective on the sentiment classification task (Pang et al., 2002), resulting in scores similar to the ones obtained by the structural correspondence methods (Blitzer et al., 2007) without the need to <b>engineer</b> <b>auxiliary</b> tasks. ...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans in the Hawaii National Guard {{activated}} and began to guard the beaches, clear rubble, donate blood and aid the wounded but three days later, they were disarmed because of their ancestry. The next day, however, they were authorized to rearm, but an uneasy tension lasted until 5 June 1942. At the same time, Japanese Americans who had been undertaking the ROTC program at the University of Hawaii, and who had been activated in the Hawaii Territorial Guard, were discharged on 19 January 1942. Many of these discharged soldiers formed a Corps of <b>Engineers</b> <b>auxiliary,</b> known as the [...] "Varsity Victory Volunteers", in February 1942. On 5 June 1942, 1,400 Nisei of the Hawaii National Guard shipped out from Hawaii bound for Oakland and on 12 June, after docking, they were formed into the 100th Infantry Battalion. Afterwards, all Japanese American men, not already in the military, were classified as enemy aliens; this policy was reversed in 1943.|$|R
50|$|The {{destruction}} or extermination ghettos {{existed in}} the final stages of the Holocaust, for between two and six weeks only, in German-occupied Soviet Union - especially in Lithuania and the Soviet Ukraine - in Hungary, and in occupied Poland.

50|$|Each {{battalion}} {{consisted of}} approximately 500 men armed with light infantry weapons. In the East, each company {{also had a}} heavy machine-gun detachment. Administratively, the Police Battalions remained under the Chief of Police Kurt Daluege, but operationally they were {{under the authority of}} regional SS and Police Leaders (SS- und Polizeiführer), who reported up a separate chain of command directly to Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. The battalions were used for various auxiliary duties, including the so-called anti-partisan operations, support of combat troops, and construction of defense works (i.e. Atlantic Wall). Some of them were focused on traditional security roles as an occupying force, while others were directly involved in actions designed to inflict terror and in the ensuing Holocaust. While they were similar to Waffen-SS, they were not part of the thirty-eight Waffen-SS divisions, and {{should not be confused with}} them, including the national 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division. The battalions were originally numbered in series from 1 to 325, but in February 1943 were renamed and renumbered from 1 to about 37, to distinguish them from the Schutzmannschaft <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battalions</b> recruited from local population in German-occupied areas.|$|R

The attackers advanced in three separate columns. The left column, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-Colonel Révillon, consisted of a marine infantry battalion, a supporting company of Cochinchinese riflemen and two artillery sections. It was accompanied by the Yellow Flag <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battalion.</b> The centre column, under the command of Bouët's chief of staff, chef de bataillon Paul Coronnat, consisted of a marine infantry battalion with a supporting company of Cochinchinese riflemen and a marine artillery battery. [...] The right column, under the command of Colonel Bichot, also included a marine infantry battalion, a supporting Cochinchinese rifle company and a marine artillery battery. [...] Bichot's column, whose right flank lay on the Red River, was supported by six French gunboats (Pluvier, Léopard, Fanfare, Éclair, Mousqueton and Trombe) from the Tonkin Flotilla, under the command of capitaine de vaisseau Morel-Beaulieu.
