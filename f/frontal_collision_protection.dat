50|$|Fuel tank mounted airbags can aid {{in saving}} many lives. It {{has been proven}} with crash test dummies {{that this type of}} airbag {{technology}} is very beneficial during a <b>frontal</b> <b>collision.</b> This is important because statistically, 62% of motorcycle accidents in the U.S. are <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions.</b> Additional tests were performed to show that when a motorcycle rider impacts a car during a <b>frontal</b> <b>collision,</b> the fuel tank mounted airbag prevents the person from traveling into the vehicle. This significantly reduced the head trauma by 83% that otherwise would have occurred according to the data from the crash test dummy. A rider would have lived with an airbag, whereas the fatality rate would be higher without the airbag. It has also been pointed out that this can only work if the accident is at low speed and follows the same dynamics as a car accident.|$|R

Firstly there are described collisions of vehicles from different vehicle classes (small cars, lower middle class, Pick up / SUV) into the fixed barrier by the US NCAP.

40|$|During the <b>frontal</b> <b>collision</b> of a vehicle, be it {{with another}} vehicle or with a fixed or mobile obstacle, {{one of the most}} {{frequent}} injuries suffered by the driver of the vehicle occurs in the knee joint. Thus, the present paper aims at investigating the knee to dashboard contact during a <b>frontal</b> <b>collision.</b> Admittedly, the first stage of our investigation underpinned the design of a model to encompass the dummy and the main interior elements of the vehicle. Subsequently, the main types of contacts provided by the LS-DYNA software have been analysed. In order to establish the optimal modelling variant of the impact between the knee and the dashboard various simulations have been carried out while applying different methods to define the contact. The results obtained following the simulations have been then compared to the results provided by the specialized literature...|$|R

5000|$|There {{were many}} traffic {{accidents}} {{right after the}} 730. When turning right/left on a crossing, drivers often approached to {{the right-hand side of}} the road, although they had to approach to the left, resulting in one bus overturning. This led to many collisions on a crossing. Larger accidents included a <b>frontal</b> <b>collision</b> of two buses.|$|R
5000|$|Bumper height {{from the}} roadway surface is {{important}} in engaging other protective systems. Airbag deployment sensors typically do not trigger until contact with an obstruction, {{and it is important}} that front bumpers be the first parts of a vehicle to make contact {{in the event of a}} <b>frontal</b> <b>collision,</b> to leave sufficient time to inflate the protective cushions.|$|R
50|$|An anti-submarine seat {{is a kind}} of {{seat that}} {{incorporates}} specially shaped panels in the forward edge of the seat cushion, reducing the tendency for the occupant to slide beneath the seatbelt in a severe <b>frontal</b> <b>collision.</b> Anti-submarine seating is a safety feature that may be more important for the front seats than the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{implementation of}} front airbags {{did little to}} protect against side collisions, which can be more dangerous than <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> because the protective crumple zone {{in front of the}} passenger compartment is completely bypassed. Side airbags and protective airbag curtains are increasingly being required in modern vehicles to protect against this very common category of collisions.|$|R

Section 5 presents the simulation results of rider-car door <b>collision</b> with the <b>protection</b> system. The paper is concluded in Section 6.|$|R
50|$|Also, some {{specialized}} vehicles (such as the AM General HMMWV and {{the related}} Hummer H1) are designed with no frontal overhang, allowing it to possess incredible abilities such as climbing vertical walls. This does, however, place these vehicles' front wheels as the furthest forward point of the vehicle, {{which can lead to}} disastrous results {{in the event of a}} <b>frontal</b> <b>collision.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that children sit rear-facing {{for as long as}} possible. In Scandinavian countries, for example, children sit rear-facing until around 4 years old. Rear-facing car seats are significantly safer in <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions,</b> which are the most likely to cause severe injury and death. Rear-facing group 1 car seats are becoming more widespread but are still difficult to source in many countries.|$|R
40|$|Derailments of trains {{often occur}} {{due to the}} wheel-rail contact failure caused by {{the impact of the}} trains with road {{vehicles}} at road-rail crossings. <b>Frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> of passenger trains onto stuck road vehicles occur frequently at such road-rail crossings even where active warning systems are installed. Such collisions are often fatal and cause significant damages to vehicles and the infrastructure especially when they incur derailments. Innovations in passive railway infrastructure designs for mitigating the severity of collision induced derailments are rare. This paper presents a formulation for a passive road-rail crossing involving stiffened edges of the raised road pavement to minimise the risk of failure of wheel–rail contact using a nonlinear three-dimensional multibody dynamics model. Severe derailment scenarios of trains passing through the passive and normal road-rail crossings have been analysed and presented. The innovative design of the road-rail crossing with passive track structure presented in the paper is shown to reduce the failure of the wheel-rail contact and hence the train-truck <b>frontal</b> <b>collision</b> derailment potential...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{shoulder}} range-of-motion and stiffness between volunteers and 50 th percentile dummies in static loading conditions simulating <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions.</b> Five volunteers a Hybrid III and a THOR Alpha were positioned in a test rig where both arms were statically loaded in the forward-upward direction at 90 °, 135 ° and 170 ° angles while the sternum was supported. The distances between right shoulders and sternums were estimated by means of photo analysis. The photo analysis showed that the volunteers’ range-of-motion was at least three times larger for the maximum load (200 N/arm) than those of the Hybrid III and the THOR Alpha. The results indicate that the biofidelity of the dummies used today in full-frontal, oblique and offset <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> may be improved by redesigned shoulder complexes. The dummies would then better predict the human kinematics and the loading of the chest by various restraint systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggressivity}} {{of trucks}} to other road users in daily traffic is widely known. The incompatibility is the origin mostly of serious and fatal injuries. Much harm can be anticipated by preventing for underride. Most serious and fatal injuries is inflicted to occupants of passenger cars in <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> with trucks. An {{underrun protection device}} helps to address the energy absorbing structure of the passenger car and thus reduces excessive deformation of the occupant compartment. Research on front underrun protection (FUP) for trucks by means of full scale testing, and especially on energy absorbing systems, is extensive and time consuming. Therefore simulation tools are applied in the early stage of the design process {{in order to obtain}} the basic parameters for later testing. In this presentation it is shown how MADYMO was used with combined multibody/finite element models of a truck with different types of FUP and a car in order to evaluate different FUP systems in car-to-truck <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions...</b>|$|R
