40|$|What role should {{religion}} play in {{the political}} deliberations and decisions of liberal democratic citizens? In light of recent political phenomena such as Quebec 2 ̆ 7 s proposed ban on the wearing of religious symbols in 2013, the constant theocratic threat posed by the religious right as perceived by the secular left and libertarian right in the United States, or the 2009 banning of minarets in Switzerland, this is a pressing question for modern democracy. In this dissertation I argue that religious citizens {{should be allowed to}} make recourse to comprehensive accounts of their positions in political debates and decisions, but that these accounts should not dominate these debates and decisions in accordance with the principle of respect for persons. The Judeo-Christian tradition was its source in the West, but respect for persons took political shape following the Wars of Religion that plagued Europe in the 16 th and 17 th centuries CE. Through the gradual political affirmation of the principle of respect liberal democracies emerging out of these wars experienced the proliferation and multiplication of fundamentally opposed worldviews. What these worldviews shared was and continues to be the affirmation of this principle, and recognition of this fact creates the possibility of liberal democratic political respect, or concord, across fundamental difference. In the liberal democratic world citizens are equalized by their shared affirmation of the principle of respect for persons. My claim is that the principle of political respect allows for expression of the fundamentally irreconcilable worldviews that overlap in affirming the principle of respect in political debates and decisions and that the principle of respect depends on their continually being freely expressed in order to retain its normative force in politics. Drawing heavily on Arendt 2 ̆ 7 s writings on religion and morality, I conclude that, despite the supposedly 2 ̆ 2 secular 2 ̆ 2 character of liberal democratic politics, the principle of respect for persons must be rooted in <b>exemplary</b> <b>embodiments</b> of morality, which I claim are 2 ̆ 2 religious 2 ̆ 2 insofar as they transcend the limits of politics.

40|$|As {{the study}} of complex {{interconnected}} networks becomes widespread across disciplines, modeling the large-scale behavior of these systems becomes both increasingly important and increasingly difficult. In particular, it is of tantamount importance to utilize available prior information about the system's structure when building data-driven models of complex behavior. This thesis provides a framework for building models that incorporate domain specific knowledge and glean information from unlabeled data points. I present a methodology to augment standard methods in statistical regression with priors. These priors might include how the output series should behave or {{the specifics of the}} functional form relating inputs to outputs. My approach is optimization driven: by formulating a concise set of goals and constraints, approximate models may be systematically derived. The resulting approximations are convex and thus have only global minima and can be solved efficiently. The functional relationships amongst data are given as sums of nonlinear kernels that are expressive enough to approximate any mapping. Depending on the specifics of the prior, different estimation algorithms can be derived, and relationships between various types of data can be discovered using surprisingly few examples. (cont.) The utility of this approach is demonstrated through three <b>exemplary</b> <b>embodiments.</b> When the output is constrained to be discrete, a powerful set of algorithms for semi-supervised classification and segmentation result. When the output is constrained to follow Markovian dynamics, techniques for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and system identification are derived. Finally, when the output is constrained to be zero on a given set and non-zero everywhere else, a new algorithm for learning latent constraints in high-dimensional data is recovered. I apply the algorithms derived from this framework to a varied set of domains. The dissertation provides a new interpretation of the so-called Spectral Clustering algorithms for data segmentation and suggests how they may be improved. I demonstrate the tasks of tracking RFID tags from signal strength measurements, recovering the pose of rigid objects, deformable bodies, and articulated bodies from video sequences. Lastly, I discuss empirical methods to detect conserved quantities and learn constraints defining data sets. by Benjamin Recht. Thesis (Ph. D.)
