The optical absorbance of the methyl orange aqueous solution and the optical transmittance of ZnO-based films were measured in the wavelength range of 350 - 800 nm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{research}} {{has sought to}} adopt the use of drift-reducing technologies (DRTs) for use in field trials to control diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) in canola (Brassica napus L.). Previous studies observed no difference in canopy penetration from fine to coarse sprays, but the coverage was higher for fine sprays. DBM has a strong propensity to avoid sprayed plant material, putting further pressure on selecting technologies that maximise coverage, but often this is {{at the expense of}} a greater drift potential. This study aims to examine the addition of a DRT oil that is labelled for control of DBM as well and its effect on the drift potential of the <b>spray</b> <b>solution.</b> The objectives of the study are to quantify the droplet size spectrum and spray drift potential of each nozzle type to select technologies that reduce spray drift, to examine the effect of the insecticide tank mix at both (50 and 100 L ha) application rates on droplet size and spray drift potential across tested nozzle type and to compare the droplet size results of each nozzle by tank mix against the drift potential of each nozzle. RESULTS: The nozzle type affected the drift potential the most, but the <b>spray</b> <b>solution</b> also affected drift potential. The fine spray quality (TCP) resulted in the greatest drift potential (7. 2 %), whereas the coarse spray quality (AIXR) resulted in the lowest (1. 3 %), across all <b>spray</b> <b>solutions.</b> The <b>spray</b> <b>solutions</b> mixed at the 100 L ha application volume rate resulted in a higher drift potential than the same products mixed at the 50 L ha mix rate. The addition of the paraffinic DRT oil was significant in reducing the drift potential of Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstkai (Bt) -only treatments across all tested nozzle types. The reduction in drift potential from the fine spray quality to the coarse spray quality was up to 85 %. CONCLUSION: The addition of a DRT oil is an effective way to reduce the <b>spray</b> <b>solution</b> drift potential across all nozzle types and tank mixes evaluated in this study. The greatest reduction in drift potential can be achieved by changing nozzle type, which can reduce the losses of the spray to the surrounding environment. Venturi nozzles greatly reduce the drift potential compared with standard nozzles by as much as 85 % across all three insecticide <b>spray</b> <b>solutions.</b> Results suggest that a significant reduction in drift potential can be achieved by changing the nozzle type, and can be achieved without a loss in control of DBM...|$|R

Zinc acetate and indium(III) chloride {{were used as}} Zn and In sources, respectively, with [In]/[Zn] = 3 at. %. Independent of <b>solution</b> <b>spray</b> rate, the crystallites in ZnO:In films grow preferentially in the (101) plane parallel to the substrate. The <b>solution</b> <b>spray</b> rate influences the surface morphology, grain size, film thickness, and electrical and optical properties. According to SEM and AFM studies, sharp-edged pyramidal grains and canvas-resembling surfaces are characteristic of films grown at spray rates of 0. 5 and 3. 3 [*]mL/min, respectively. To obtain films with comparable film thickness and grain size, more <b>spray</b> <b>solution</b> should be used at low spray rates.

40|$|Controlling {{droplet size}} is a {{critical}} part of making any successful agrochemical spray application. This is particularly true for higher-speed aerial applications where secondary atomization from air shear becomes the most dominant factor driving spray droplet size. Previous research has shown that higher spray pressures can result in larger droplet-sized sprays by increasing the exit velocity of the spray liquid from the nozzles, which in turn decreases the differential velocity between the spray liquid and surrounding airstream, reducing secondary breakup. This work explores the effects of higher-than-normal spray pressures on two typical aerial application nozzles {{in the presence of a}} formulated herbicide <b>spray</b> <b>solution,</b> with and without additional adjuvants. Generally, the <b>spray</b> <b>solution</b> effects followed trends seen in previous studies, with crop oil-containing adjuvants resulting in the largest droplet-sized sprays and the silicones and polymers the smallest. Increasing spray pressure increased droplet size across all combinations of nozzle, airspeed, and <b>spray</b> <b>solution,</b> without exception. The most promising results from this work showed that for typical high-end application airspeeds, increasing spray pressure from the lowest to highest pressures tested generally resulted in spray classifications increasing at least one size coarser.
