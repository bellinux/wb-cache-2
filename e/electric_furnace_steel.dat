40|$|Abstract. Four {{kinds of}} {{industrial}} solid waste, granulated {{blast furnace slag}} (GBFS), <b>electric</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>steel</b> slag (EFSS), semi-dry flue gas desulfurization slag (FGDS) and gypsum were activated by mechanochemistry to prepare a novel kind of cementious material, DA type soil solidification agent (DA agent). Compared to the traditional cementious materials, this paper evaluated DA agent used in silt soil solidification project. Test results showed that DA- 4 was prepared with adding the 40 % CFBA, 39 % GBFS, 11 % OPC clinker and 10 % gypsum by mill and more superior in material characteristics. It was found that compressive strength of DA- 4 paste and mortar specimens at 28 -days cured age were 46. 0 and 27. 3 MPa respectively; 5 % of DA- 4 was used to stabilize the silt soil in lab and the maximum dry unit weight, optimum moisture content, unconfined compressive strength and CBR value were 1. 754 g/cm 3, 15. 35 %, 1. 15 MPa and 95. 5 % respectively. The hardening mechanism of prepared cementious materials is explained by two points: the sulfite or sulfate activation on alkali blast furnace slag; and the hydration product produced from cement clinker hydration process. Besides test programs of the trial pavement section in site showed that stabilized and solidified silt soils by DA- 4 can meet the requirement of subgrade of pavement for strength and stiffness...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Altered {{patterns}} of gene expression mediate {{the effects of}} particulate matter (PM) on human health, but mechanisms through which PM modifies gene expression are largely undetermined. OBJECTIVES: We aimed at identifying short- and long-term effects of PM exposure on DNA methylation, a major genomic mechanism of gene expression control, in workers in an <b>electric</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>steel</b> plant with well-characterized exposure to PM with aerodynamic diameters < 10 microm (PM(10)). METHODS: We measured global genomic DNA methylation content estimated in Alu and long interspersed nuclear element- 1 (LINE- 1) repeated elements, and promoter DNA methylation of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), a gene suppressed by DNA methylation and induced by PM exposure in blood leukocytes. Quantitative DNA methylation analysis was performed through bisulfite PCR pyrosequencing on blood DNA obtained from 63 workers {{on the first day}} of a work week (baseline, after 2 days off work) and after 3 days of work (postexposure). Individual PM(10) exposure was between 73. 4 and 1, 220 microg/m(3). RESULTS: Global methylation content estimated in Alu and LINE- 1 repeated elements did not show changes in postexposure measures compared with baseline. PM(10) exposure levels were negatively associated with methylation in both Alu [beta = - 0. 19 % 5 -methylcytosine (% 5 mC); p = 0. 04] and LINE- 1 [beta = - 0. 34 % 5 mC; p = 0. 04], likely reflecting long-term PM(10) effects. iNOS promoter DNA methylation was significantly lower in postexposure blood samples compared with baseline (difference = - 0. 61 % 5 mC; p = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: We observed changes in global and gene specific methylation that should be further characterized in future investigations on the effects of PM...|$|E
40|$|The {{technical}} progress obtained {{for this time}} frame consisted of the awarding of two contracts for determination of metallurgical parameters for heat treatment of strapping and strip which are unavailable from current technology and/or published data in this field. The two contractors were Bricmont, Inc. and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Technological Institute of Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. Phase 1 of the two stage contract with Bricmont, Inc. which provided a computer analysis of the cooling rates of a typical range of thickness' of strapping was completed. This study was developed {{for the purpose of}} determining the time parameters for quenching low carbon steels to a martensitic microstructure within the time frame of the design of the proposed process. It also provides design criteria for cooling to ambient for the total process. This data is required for Phase 2 of the Bricmont proposal which completes the design and specifications of the total heat treating and cooling system for the process. This becomes the basis for developing the cost and space requirements for this component of the production line. The authors do not intend to award Phase 2 until the work done at Northwestern University discussed hereafter is completed. On or about May 1, 1999 a contract for a project entitled ``Effects of Steel Composition and Quench Rate on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Strapping'' to be performed at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering was awarded. The delay in initiating this project was due to the legal interpretation and final agreement of the intellectual provisions of the award by the author's attorneys, Northwestern's attorneys and the legal representative in the Chicago office of the DOE. The work to date includes rapid quenching of a number of different steel compositions and microstructure on an existing drop quench test apparatus. It was initially assumed that this procedure would simulate proposed processing line conditions however variations in test results have necessitated further investigations into the nature of cold rolled steel vs. hot rolled steel and <b>electric</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>steel</b> vs. basic oxygen furnace steel as it may apply to heat treating procedures and selection of appropriate steel chemistry for the process...|$|E

40|$|The {{cementitious}} and pozzolanic {{behavior of}} <b>electric</b> arc <b>furnace</b> <b>steel</b> slag, both as received and treated {{has been studied}} in detail. The as received slag was completely crystalline and multi-phasic with Fe-substituted monticellite as the predominant phase. Treatment of this slag, remelting and water quenching, results in reduction of Fe-oxide content coupled {{with an increase in}} basicity index which makes it more hydraulic compared to the as received slag. The remelted slag has several phases with merwinite as the dominant phase. Thermal analysis of the hydrated slag shows that treating the as received slag increases the water absorption capacity, a property essential for cementitious behavior. Compression strength of the slag blended cements was studied and it was found that substitution of 20 % ground granulated blast <b>furnace</b> slag with <b>electric</b> arc <b>furnace</b> <b>steel</b> slag does not decrease the strength beyond 28 days. The control cement has a strength of 58. 6 MPa compared to 58 MPa for the cement comprising of 20 % untreated slag. The substitution of this untreated slag with treated slag exhibits the highest strength, 61 MPa and a potential for further strength increase after 28 days. In the case of cement mix with no blast furnace slag, substitution of 15 % clinker with steel slag does not decrease the strength significantly, 64. 4 MPa compared to 66. 5 MPa for the control cement Substituting 30 % clinker in the cement mix with <b>electric</b> arc <b>furnace</b> slag however results in significant decrease in strength, 53. 4 MPa.
