5|$|A {{squadron}} of three galleys under Antonio Diedo arrived {{to reinforce the}} city on 17 March, but to little avail. A muster of the city's available defenders showed that they sufficed to man only one <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> crenelles, and they were deficient in both armament and morale: news of Murad's approach {{at the head of}} an army rumoured to number 190,000 men caused widespread terror among the populace.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E

50|$|Another form of {{rebellion}} by the Maya and other indigenous groups against the Franciscans was {{the murder of}} missionaries themselves, often just <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> at a time, though in some instances many more.

5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E
5|$|When {{electrons}} and positrons collide, they annihilate each other, {{giving rise to}} two or more gamma ray photons. If the electron and positron have negligible momentum, a positronium atom can form before annihilation results <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> gamma ray photons totalling 1.022MeV. On the other hand, high-energy photons can transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production, {{but only in the}} presence of a nearby charged particle, such as a nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Excavation {{evidence}} {{from all the}} imperial borders which suggests that late forts were designed to accommodate much smaller garrisons than their predecessors from the Principate. Where such sites can be identified with forts listed in the Notitia, {{the implication is that}} the resident units were also smaller. Examples include the Legio II Herculia, created by Diocletian, which occupied a fort just one-seventh the size of a typical Principate legionary base, implying a strength of c. 750 men. At Abusina on the Danube, the Cohors III Brittonum was housed in a fort only 10% the size of its old Trajanic fort, suggesting that it numbered only around 50 men. The evidence must be treated with caution as identification of archaeological sites with placenames in the Notitia is often tentative and again, the units in question may be detachments (the Notitia frequently shows the same unit <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> different locations simultaneously). Nevertheless, the weight of the archaeological evidence favours small sizes for frontier units. Archaeological evidence suggests that the army in Britain in ca. 400 just one-third its size in 200 (17,500 effectives versus 55,000).|$|E

5|$|Italian folk {{styles are}} very diverse, and include monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial song, choral, {{instrumental}} and vocal music, and other styles. Choral singing and polyphonic song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo singing is more common, and groups usually use unison singing <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> parts carried {{by a single}} performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict tempo and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a rubato tempo, and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little perception of a common Italian folk tradition, and the country's folk music never became a national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. <b>In</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, {{the top of the}} cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E

25|$|Jalouse was an 18-gun Belliqueuse-class brig-corvette of the French Navy, {{built to}} a design by Pierre-Alexandre-Laurent Forfait, and {{launched}} in 1794 at Honfleur. The Royal Navy captured her in May 1797 {{and took her}} into service under her existing name. In British service she served primarily on the North Sea station where she captured three small French privateers, and many Dutch merchant vessels. She also participated with other British warships <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> major cutting-out expeditions. She was broken up in 1807.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> generations, the new {{immigrants}} themselves began to speak French.

The exclusively French educational system {{played an important role}} in this changing language landscape. Dutch was mainly ignored as a school subject. From 1842, Dutch was removed from the first four years of boys' schools, although in later school grades it could be studied. In girls' schools and Catholic schools Dutch was taught even less, even though Dutch was still the native tongue of a majority of the students.|$|E
60|$|There {{were then}} many poets of no mean merit, all capable of admirable verse on occasion; and in various degrees possessed of the lofty, vigorous, and vivid style of that great age.
