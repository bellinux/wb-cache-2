Anthropometric measures were collected to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity of children enrolled in Merced County Head Start. To assess maternal figures perceptions of their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status, maternal figures were asked to complete a self- administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included items that examined maternal figures perception of their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status, their concern regarding their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> weight status and physical activity, and their feeling of degree of control over their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> dietary habits and physical activity. Maternal figures perceptions were then compared to their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> actual weight status. Factors that influence maternal figures perceptions were examined through focus groups discussions with maternal figures at four Merced County Head Start Centers. Recurrent themes were identified and a list supporting comments was generated. The collection and analysis of the data was intended to provide valuable information for the enhancement and development of obesity prevention efforts for Head Start children and families in Merced County...|$|R

40|$|Amphibious {{vision is}} {{accomplished}} in many animals by special optical and physiological adaptations in the eyes. However, human eyes {{are considered to}} be adapted to a life in air since our curved outer cornea – which is used to refract {{more than two-thirds of the}} incoming light on land – becomes useless underwater. This thesis produces evidence that Moken children, a population of sea nomads (or sea-gypsies) from Southeast Asia, have developed an underwater visual acuity that is more than twice as good as that of <b>European</b> <b>children.</b> They achieve this by heavy accommodation and concurrent pupil constriction underwater, a reaction absent in <b>European</b> <b>children.</b> This skill is most likely learned since this thesis also shows that <b>European</b> <b>children</b> can be trained to achieve the same level of acuity underwater as the Moken <b>children.</b> <b>European</b> <b>children</b> learned to control their accommodation in only 4 - 6 months, depending on the individual. Experiments were also made to determine whether the physiological diving response is involved in the process of pupil constriction underwater, but the results were negative. The Moken children constrict their pupils even when diving with goggles, a reaction also present in trained <b>European</b> <b>children.</b> In untrained <b>European</b> <b>children</b> however, this pupil constriction is absent. It is possible that training affects the connection between the accommodative response and pupil constriction so that it becomes a conditioned response elicited when the children immerse their heads in water. Furthermore, optical theory is used to predict underwater acuity in humans. Considering that the normal ranges of contrast sensitivity vary a great deal between individuals, the experimental values of underwater acuity are well within the range of values predicted theoretically...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: {{review the}} literature, {{exploring}} {{factors that contribute}} to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior such as the role of learning and social context. Methods: the review of the literature was done using Medline, Psyclit, and Lilacs as resources for assessing international and national research articles on child nutrition, with an emphasis on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior. These articles were revised and grouped together according to the topic. Results: family is responsible for the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior through social learning. Parents are <b>children</b> <b>s</b> first nutritional educators. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> eating experiences are influenced by cultural and psychosocial factors. Social context plays a relevant role in this process, especially through the strategies used by parents to encourage children to have a balanced diet and to eat specific foods. These strategies may contain adequate and inadequate stimuli as to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food preference and food intake self-control. Conclusion: the learning process is a determining factor for <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior, and is associated with three factors: food flavor conditioning, food postingestional consequences, and social context. Parents are deeply concerned with the amount of food their children eat and not with the development of more adequate habits and attitudes related to dietary quality. J. pediatr.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The HIV {{epidemic}} in South Africa has increased {{not only the}} number of ill children but also the number of orphans. Although the establishment of orphanages is not sustainable, the number of residential care facilities continues to increase. Many persons working in South African <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes can testify to the impact HIV has had on this sector, but no studies have actually measured it. AIMS The primary aim {{of this research was}} to determine the impact of HIV on the Johannesburg <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes. The secondary aims were to make recommendations informed by this research to assist <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes to mitigate the impact and to inform the activities of the <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> Homes Outreach Medical Programme (CHOMP). METHODS A rapid appraisal of all <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in the greater Johannesburg was done by means of a telephonic survey. This was followed by an in depth analysis of 24 <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes through the use of questionnaires, data collection forms, a pop quiz for residential child care workers and the inspection of facilities. RESULTS A total of 115 residential care facilities with a population (excluding the special needs homes) of 5 934 were identified. In a sample of 24 homes, 31, 7...|$|R
