25|$|In {{the next}} step of the surgery, an {{internal}} pouch is made of the patient's own small bowel, and this pouch is then hooked back up internally to the rectal stump so that the patient can once again have a reasonably functioning bowel system, all internal. The temporary <b>ileostomy</b> can be reversed at this time so that the patient is internalized for bowel functions, or, in another step to the procedure, the pouch, and rectal stump anastamosis can be left inside the patient to heal for some time while the patient still uses the <b>ileostomy</b> for bowel function. Then, on a subsequent surgery, the <b>ileostomy</b> is reversed and the patient has internalized bowel function again.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{surgical}} approaches to treat megacolon, {{such as a}} colectomy (removal of the entire colon) with ileorectal anastomosis (ligation of the remaining ileum and rectum segments), or a total proctocolectomy (removal of colon, sigmoid and rectum) followed by <b>ileostomy</b> or followed by ileoanal anastomosis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{surgical}} {{option for}} ulcerative colitis that is affecting {{most of the}} large bowel is called the ileo-anal pouch procedure. This is a two- to three-step procedure in which the large bowel is removed, except for the rectal stump and anus, and a temporary <b>ileostomy</b> is made. The next part of the surgery {{can be done in}} one or two steps and is usually done at six- to twelve-month intervals from each prior surgery.|$|E
5000|$|People with <b>ileostomies</b> {{must use}} an ostomy pouch to collect {{intestinal}} waste. People with <b>ileostomies</b> typically use an open-ended (referred to as a [...] "drainable") one- or two-piece pouch that is secured {{at the lower}} end with a leakproof clip, or velcro fastener. The alternative is the closed-end pouch that must be thrown away when full. Ordinarily, the pouch must be emptied several times a day. The pouch and flange (both one and two piece pouches) are usually changed every 2-5 days.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ileostomies</b> are {{necessary}} where injury or a surgical response to disease has rendered the large intestine incapable of safely processing intestinal waste, typically because the colon and rectum have been partially or wholly removed.|$|R
50|$|An ostomy {{pouching}} {{system is}} a prosthetic medical device that provides a means for the collection of waste from a surgically diverted biological system (colon, ileum, bladder) {{and the creation of}} a stoma. Pouching systems are most commonly associated with colostomies, <b>ileostomies,</b> and urostomies.|$|R
25|$|Emergency {{surgery is}} {{necessary}} for people whose intestine has ruptured; intestinal rupture always results in infection of the abdominal cavity. During emergency diverticulitis surgery, the ruptured section is removed and a colostomy or <b>ileostomy</b> is performed. This means that the surgeon will create an opening between the large intestine and {{the surface of the}} skin. The colostomy is closed in about 10 or 12 weeks in a subsequent surgery in which the cut ends of the intestine are rejoined.|$|E
2500|$|Rectum involved: [...] the rectum {{and part}} {{or all of}} the colon are removed. The patient may require an <b>ileostomy</b> (permanent stoma where stool goes into a bag on the abdomen) or have an ileo-anal pouch reconstruction. The {{decision}} to remove the rectum depends on the number of polyps in the rectum as well as the family history. [...] If the rectum has few polyps, the colon is partly or fully removed and the small bowel (ileum) can be directly connected to the rectum instead (ileorectal anastomosis).|$|E
2500|$|Bowel {{obstruction}} can {{be treated}} with palliative surgery (colostomy, <b>ileostomy,</b> or internal bypass) or medicine, but surgery {{has been shown to}} increase survival time. Palliative surgery may result in short bowel syndrome, enterocutaneous fistula, or re-obstruction; or may not be possible due to the extent of obstruction. Other treatments of complications can include total parenteral nutrition, a low-residue diet, palliative gastrostomy, and adequate pain control. Bowel obstruction can also be treated with octreotide when palliative surgery is not an option. Cancer can also block the ureters, which can be relieved by a nephrostomy or a ureteric stent. Ascites can be relieved by repeated paracentesis or placement of a drain to increase comfort. Pleural effusions can [...] be treated in a similar manner, with repeated thoracentesis, pleurodesis, or placement of a drain.|$|E
40|$|Parastomal hernias (PSH) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} complications of enterostomies with a non-negligible complication rate and a significant socioeconomic effect. Therefore, preventing PSH by placing a mesh at the time of primary surgery has been advocated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the new stomaplasty ring [Koring™, (Koring GmbH, Basel, Switzerland) ] and investigate the reason why surgeons are reluctant to take preventive measures. A multicenter observational study was conducted on 30 patients between December 2013 and January 2015. In permanent end colostomies and end <b>ileostomies,</b> the Koring™ was implanted. The primary outcome was the 30 -day morbidity (infection and other stoma-related complications). Secondary endpoints were the technical feasibility and the time needed to fix the ring. In addition, an online survey of 107 surgeons was performed. Twenty-seven patients received permanent end colostomies, and three received end <b>ileostomies.</b> No stoma-related complication was detected within the first 30  days post-operatively. The Koring™ ring was evaluated by the surgeons as easy and very easy to implant in more than half of the patients. Average additional operating time for ring implantation was 19  min. Koring™ implantation at the time of creating the stoma is safe, easy and only adds minimally operating time. A long-term follow-up as well as a randomized controlled study is needed to evaluate the impact of the Koring™ on PSH prevention. The ease and rapidity with which Koring™ can be implanted may help surgeons to overcome their apprehension of using a preventative device...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: No {{consensus}} {{exists on}} the optimal treatment of acute malignant right-sided colonic obstruction (RSCO). This systematic review aims to compare procedure-related mortality and morbidity rates between primary resection and stent placement as a bridge to surgery followed by elective resection for patients with acute RSCO. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library were searched for all relevant literature. Primary endpoints were procedure-related mortality and morbidity. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the MINORS criteria. RESULTS: Fourteen cohort studies were eligible for analysis. A total of 2873 patients {{were included in the}} acute resection group and 155 patients in the stent group. Mean mortality rate for patients who underwent acute resection with primary anastomosis was 10. 8 % (8. 1 - 18. 5 %). Overall mortality for patients initially treated with a colonic stent followed with elective resection was 0 %. Major morbidity was 23. 9 % (9. 3 - 35. 6 %) and 0. 8 % (0 - 4. 8 %), respectively. Both mortality and major morbidity were significantly different. In addition, stent placement shows lower rates of anastomotic leakages (0 vs 9. 1 %) and fewer permanent <b>ileostomies</b> (0 vs 1. 0 %). CONCLUSION: Primary resection for patients with acute RSCO seems to be associated with higher mortality and major morbidity rates than stent placement and elective resection. In addition, stent placement resulted in fewer anastomotic leakages and permanent <b>ileostomies.</b> However, as no high-level studies are available on the optimal treatment of RSCO and proximal stenting is considered technically challenging, future comparative studies are warranted for the development of an evidence-based clinical decision guideline...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen {{apparently}} healthy {{patients with}} <b>ileostomies</b> {{were found to}} be depleted of total exchangeable sodium and potassium, but had normal serum electrolyte concentrations and normal extracellular fluid and total body water volumes. The low exchangeable sodium and potassiums were thus primarily due to depletion of the intracellular compartment.

40|$|Beeturia is the {{excretion}} of red beetroot pigment (betalaine) in {{urine and}} faeces. It occurs in about 14 % of humans. Betalaine is a redox indicator whose colour {{is protected by}} reducing agents. We investigated pigment-decolourizing systems in the intestinal tracts of beeturic and non-beeturic sub-jects. Betalaine was decolourized by hydrochloric acid, ferric ions and colonic bacteria preparations, but not by pancreatic or mucosal enzymes. In animals, oral betalaine did not produce beeturia, but injection of betalaine into the peritoneum did. Oral betalaine and 1 g oxalic acid produced beeturia in non-beeturic normal humans, but passed into <b>ileostomies</b> without beeturia. Thus, beeturia results from colonic absorption of betalaine. Oxalic acid preserves the red colour to the colon, otherwise it is decolourized in non-beeturic individuals by non-enzymic processes in the stomach and colon...|$|R
5000|$|The entire {{procedure}} can {{be performed}} in one operation, but is usually split into two or three. When done as a two-step, the first operation (step one) involves a proctocolectomy (removal of the large intestine and rectum), and fashioning of the pouch.

After a period of usually 6-12 weeks the second step (sometimes called the [...] "takedown") is performed, in which the <b>ileostomy</b> is reversed. The reason for the temporary <b>ileostomy</b> is to allow the newly constructed pouch to fully heal without waste passing through it, thus avoiding infection.|$|E

40|$|Perfusion {{experiments}} in the small intestine of normal subjects and in the ileum of patients with <b>ileostomies</b> demonstrated that the distribution of potassium across the mucosa was compatible with a passive process for transport.

This permeability was apparently unaffected by calcium in the lumen in concentrations of between 1 · 15 and 7 · 25 m-equiv/ 1. In the ileum potassium transport was influenced by changes in luminal sodium concentration and it is suggested that this is a passive consequence of the change in electrical potential which the change in sodium concentration induces. The electrical potential is thought to be a sodium diffusion potential. All the evidence thus points to a purely passive behaviour of the small intestine towards potassium...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{restorative}} proctocolectomy (RPC) with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) {{is currently}} the preferred surgical method for most patients with ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis and sometimes, functional bowel diseases. Infection around the pouch, remaining rectal stump, stricture at anastomosis site, pouch dysfunction and refractory pouchitis can lead to pouch failure. Pouch salvage surgery could prevent pouch failure in some cases. Case Presentation In this report, five patients were introduced, who underwent pouch salvage surgery after RPC/IPAA surgery failure. Two of the patients were male and three were female and the relevant age range was 16 to 41. Initially, RPC/IPAA surgery was performed on these five patients. Four of the patients underwent RPC/IPAA surgery {{as a result of}} ulcerative colitis and, one of the patients as a result of familial adenomatous polyposis. However, due to pouch failure from the RPC/IPAA surgery, pouch-salvage surgery was performed on each of these five patients. Two of the patients underwent pouch-salvage surgery due to infection and pouch fistula, and the other three underwent this surgery due to the remaining rectal stump, anastomosis stenosis and pouch dysfunction. The average time for when pouch-salvage surgery was performed was 3. 5 years (three months to five years) after the initial operation and the patients were under follow-up care for two to seven years. Conclusions After performing pouch salvage operation, pouch function was acceptable in all patients and we could close <b>ileostomies</b> of all of them...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} and temporal {{stability of the}} predominant bacteria in the human ileum was studied {{with the use of}} ileal effluent samples of seven individuals with Brooke <b>ileostomies.</b> The total number of bacteria within the ileal effluent was in the range of 10 (7) - 10 (8) bacteria per gram (wet weight). The diversity of the bacteria in the ileal effluent showed marked differences compared with that in faecal samples from age-matched healthy adults. The ileal effluent had a higher relative abundance of species within the orders Lactobacillales and Clostridiales, mainly Streptococcus bovis-related species, and the Veillonella group, and a lower proportion of species related to Ruminococcus gnavus, R. obeum and Bacteroides plebeius. In addition, inter-individual differences were found, indicative of a highly personal ileal microbiota profile. Furthermore, temporal profiles showed large fluctuations per individual over a period of 9 - 28 days (average similarity over a period of 9 days was as low as 44 %), and differences between morning and afternoon profiles were observed. Parallel cloning and sequencing efforts revealed several phylotypes that were not identified in previous studies (12 out of 65 phylotypes showed less than 97 % sequence similarity with previously reported sequences). Achaea were found to be below detection limit by quantitative PCR. Overall, the results indicate that the microbiota of the human ileum is relatively unstable, less complex and consisting of different dominating phylotypes when compared with the colonic microbiot...|$|R
