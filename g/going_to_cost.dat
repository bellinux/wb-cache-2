5|$|During the {{artillery}} barrage {{that preceded the}} infantry assault, Longstreet began to agonize over an assault that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> dearly. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett's division to his artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander. When {{the time came to}} actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order. The assault, known as Pickett's Charge, suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.|$|E
5|$|Max bumps into Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) in {{the village}} and tells him that his wedding with Steph is back on. Niall is devastated but tries to remain {{composed}} in front of Max. Steph has big plans for her wedding day and it looks as if it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost,</b> with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno and ask him to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's no way the wedding can go ahead on Thursday.|$|E
25|$|Following the oil spill, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh {{declared}} two {{islands and}} parts of the Sunshine coast as disaster areas. Cleanup efforts were reportedly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> at least $100,000 a day and last more than a week as the oil continued to spread. The company in charge of the cargo ship is faced with a possible $1.5million in fines for the incident. Several search parties have been sent to the spill area to attempt to find the potentially explosive materials that were in the 31 containers. Press reports stated that if the ammonium nitrate were to mix with the heavy fuel, it could ignite the ammonium nitrate and cause a large explosion. If the chemical did not react with the fuel, but still leaked out, marine life could be threatened by large blooms in algae. A team of 88 people were sent out to begin the cleanup process and another 58 were expected to join within the following days. On Moreton Island, a total of 290 people are working to clean up the oil with most of them focusing on Middle Creek and Cape Moreton. Even though hundreds of people were working on cleaning the spill, the average amount cleaned each day was 1km2 (0.6mi2). It was not until May of that year that Moreton Island was finally cleared of oil. The cleanup effort was undertaken by 2,500 people and led to the removal of roughly 3,000 tonnes of contaminated sand.|$|E

500|$|Matters worsened when Columbia Pictures {{experienced}} financial difficulties. Spielberg {{estimated the}} film would cost $2.7million {{to make in}} his original 1973 pitch to Columbia, but the final budget came to $19.4million. Columbia studio executive John Veich remembered, [...] "If {{we knew it was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> that much, we wouldn't have greenlighted it because we didn't have the money." [...] Spielberg hired Joe Alves, his collaborator on Jaws, as production designer. In addition the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season brought tropical storms to Alabama. A large portion of the sound stage in Alabama was damaged because of a lightning strike. Columbia raised $7 million from three sources: Time Inc., EMI, and German tax shelters.|$|E
500|$|When {{working with}} actors, Nolan prefers {{giving them the}} time to perform as many takes of a given scene as they want. [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} the {{lighting}} and camera setups, the technical things, take all the time, but running another take generally only adds a couple of minutes.... If an actor tells me they can do something more with a scene, I give them the chance, because it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues." [...] Gary Oldman praised the director for providing a relaxed atmosphere on set, adding [...] "I've never seen him raise his voice to anyone". He also observed that Nolan would give the actors space to [...] "find things in the scene", and not just give direction for direction's sake.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{suspension}} of operations at {{three out of four}} BPI plants, members of the media and leaders were invited by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to tour the BPI facility that remained open in South Sioux City, Nebraska. The founders of BPI gave campaign contributions to Branstad in 2010, and to other candidates' campaigns. Branstad stated to ABC News that the contributions were not a factor in his decision regarding having the event. Texas Governor Rick Perry, Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Rick Sheehy, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, and South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Matt Michels, toured the South Sioux City, Nebraska, plant in an attempt to allay [...] "inaccurate information" [...] that they stated as having caused [...] "an unnecessary panic among consumers". The publicity tour emerged with the promotional slogan, [...] "Dude, it's beef!" [...] News reporters were not allowed to ask employees at BPI any questions during the tour. BPI asserts that social media and ABC News [...] "grossly misrepresented" [...] their product. BPI eventually sued ABC News for defamation. On March 28, 2012, Branstad stated, [...] "The problem is, we take this off the market, then we end up with a fatter product that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> more and it's going to increase the obesity problem in this country". Safeway and other retailers that have removed the product from their shelves or product lines have stated they will not raise the price of their beef. Branstad also stated that he would recommend that Iowa state public schools continue to use ground beef which contains the product, and stated plans to [...] "send a letter to the state's public schools, encouraging them to continue to buy LFTB".|$|E

25|$|Record {{economic}} growth {{starting in the}} mid-1980s mostly erased the problem of finances preventing service. As a secondary measure, starting in 1990, paying for a mission became easier on those called to work in industrialized nations.

This amount paid (about $425 per month currently) {{is used by the}} church to pay for the costs of all missionaries, wherever they go.
