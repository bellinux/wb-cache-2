500|$|Until recently, {{the full}} panoply of {{potential}} federal resources {{had not been}} brought to bear effectively on corruption schemes {{at the state and}} local level. These schemes are at least as corrosive of the governmental process as corruption at the federal level. From the time of Tammany Hall this country has been painfully aware of the existence of corrupt practices in many of our metropolitan areas, and of the [...] "machines" [...] and [...] "rings" [...] which siphon off millions of dollars from public treasuries for private gain. Most state and local prosecutors, beset by inadequate resources and the overwhelming demands of a rising rate of street crime, are simply unable to deal with this type of corruption. Moreover, in some cases, local law enforcement <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> the problem itself, due to the outright corruption of its own establishment.|$|E
500|$|On February 28, 2005 the Schindlers filed a motion, {{asking for}} {{permission}} to attempt to provide Schiavo with [...] "Food and Water by Natural Means." [...] This second motion asked {{for permission to}} [...] "attempt to feed" [...] Schiavo by mouth. Judge Greer denied the second motion on March 8, saying [...] "it has become clear that the second motion <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> the previous motion on medical evaluations. The same declarations are being used for both motions and the motion {{appears to be an}} alternative pleading to the previous motion. Both are asking for an experimental procedure." [...] The following day, Greer denied the first motion as well, citing that an affiant doctor for Michael cautioned that fMRI was an experimental procedure that should be conducted in an academic setting, because Schiavo had already undergone swallowing tests and failed, and because VitalStim had only been performed on patients who were not in a PVS. Greer noted that [...] "most of the doctor affidavits submitted are based on their understanding of Schiavo's condition from news reports or video clips they have seen. Many are obviously not aware of the medical exams undertaken for the 2002 trial." ...|$|E

The reverend Principal of King's College has delivered his judgment in perfectly clear and candid terms. Two years since, Dr. Wace said that he believed the story as it stands; and consequently he holds, as a part of divine revelation, that the spiritual world comprises devils, who, under certain circumstances, may enter men and be transferred from them to four-footed beasts.

[37] It {{is further}} well worth {{consideration}} whether indications of former ancestor-worship {{are not to}} be found in the singular weight attached to the veneration of parents in the fourth commandment. It is the only positive commandment, in addition to those respecting the Deity and that concerning the Sabbath, and the penalties for infringing it were of the same character. In China, a corresponding reverence for parents <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> ancestor-worship; so in ancient Rome and in Greece (where parents were even called [Greek: deuteroi kai epigeoi theoi]). The fifth commandment, as it stands, would be an excellent compromise between ancestor-worship and monotheism. The larger hereditary share allotted by Israelitic law to the eldest son reminds one of the privileges attached to primogeniture in ancient Rome, which were closely connected with ancestor-worship. There is a good deal to be said in favour of the speculation that the ark of the covenant may have been a relic of ancestor-worship; but that topic is too large to be dealt with incidentally in this place.|$|E

This is the east pier watch-house; the marine residence, if we may so express it, of the coxswain of the lifeboat and his men. It is their place of shelter and their watch-tower; their nightly resort, where they smoke the pipe of peace and good fellowship, and spin yarns, or take such repose as the nature of their calling will admit of. This little stone house had need be strong, like its inmates, for, like them, it is frequently called upon to brave the utmost fury of the elements--receiving the blast fresh and unbroken from the North Sea, as well as the towering billows from the same.|$|E
6000|$|But this we may say (for God {{himself has}} said it in the Bible), that these earthquakes, and all other disasters, great or small, do not come of themselves--do not come by accident, or chance, or blind necessity; but that he sends them, and that they fulfil his will and word. He sends them, and {{therefore}} they do not come in vain. They fulfil his will, and his will is a good will. They carry out his purpose, but his purpose is a gracious purpose.

They may be meant to do that, and to do a thousand things more. For God's ways are not as our ways, or his thoughts as our thoughts. His ways are unsearchable, and his paths past finding out.
