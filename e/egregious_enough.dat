25|$|Another NCAA infraction scandal {{would end}} Hall's tenure at Florida. In 1989 he {{admitted}} supplementing his assistant coaches' salaries {{with his own}} funds and was accused of paying child support-related legal expenses {{for one of his}} players, a charge he denied. Interim university president Robert A. Bryan demanded Hall's resignation five games into the 1989 season. Defensive coordinator Gary Darnell was interim head coach {{for the rest of the}} season. The NCAA imposed two years' probation and banned the Gators from bowl consideration in 1990.

It was <b>egregious</b> <b>enough</b> that I should now intrude unasked in the private affairs of Crawford's agent, and press upon him the sacrifice of his interests and the venture of his life. But bad as I might be, there was none better; since the affair of the stone I was, besides, sharp-set to be doing, the idea of a delicate interview attracted me, and I thought it policy to show myself abroad.|$|E

50|$|The {{criminal}} penalties imposed for copyright infringement vary between the copyright laws of different jurisdictions. However, the justifications for {{the imposition of}} {{criminal penalties}} are common {{in the sense that}} certain kinds of copyright violations are considered as <b>egregious</b> <b>enough</b> to warrant state interference. These kinds of copyright violations are seen as having a negative consequence affecting the entire community. A criminal conviction for copyright infringement is also more punitive compared to a civil penalty and this increases the value of the punishment as a deterrent to prevent such violations in the future. For these reasons, criminal penalties for copyright infringement are considered to be effective sanctions against violations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, Kentucky {{basketball}} {{was found}} guilty of rampant recruiting and eligibility violations. The Wildcats were facing the possibility of a death penalty after being sanctioned in 1988 for failing to cooperate with an earlier investigation. In its final report, the NCAA said that Kentucky's violations were <b>egregious</b> <b>enough</b> to warrant a death penalty. However, the NCAA said it decided against imposing a death penalty after school president David Roselle took swift action to bring the basketball program under control once the violations came to light—including forcing the resignations of head coach Eddie Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan. In its final report, the infractions committee stated: ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Gay, [...] "I am in {{possession}} of information and internal email correspondence that {{gives rise to the}} concern that the governor has used state monies to manufacture allegations against a political opponent. ... The public knows an abuse of power when they see it, and this (is) one of the most egregious examples of abuse of power in Wyoming history. ... I believe there were political motivations because of the timeline that was involved. ... The things I have found are <b>egregious</b> <b>enough</b> that they have to be stopped immediately and to make sure they never happen again." [...] Gay claimed that a special prosecutor is needed because he does not trust Wyoming Attorney General Peter K. Michael, a Mead supporter, to conduct a fair probe. Michael said that his office does not prosecute crimes except in rare situations which would not apply in this particular matter.|$|E

[...] Kalamazoo Gazette critic James Sanford gave the film 1½ stars and said [...] "the only visions Next inspires are flashbacks to better films" [...] like Honeymoon in Vegas, Leaving Las Vegas, The Illusionist, and Hannibal, adding [...] "any film that makes someone wish he or she were watching Hannibal must be pretty awful." [...] Sanford said [...] "Cage performs as if he's on autopilot, Moore looks more miserable than she did as the suicidal housewife in The Hours, and Biel seems fully aware she was hired only to provide a few glimpses of cheesecake." [...] Sanford also remarked, [...] "the ending of this film is not just a colossal cheat, it's a hard {{slap in the face to}} anyone who has invested his or her time in watching it." [...] Daniel Eagan of Film Journal International said the film [...] "follows a familiar Hollywood pattern in which a few intriguing ideas are swamped by the demands of a big-budget, star-driven vehicle" [...] and that it [...] "won't add any luster to Nicolas Cage's resume." [...] Eagan said [...] "Half of Next is a clever, unpredictable thriller that plays with Dick's customary obsessions with time and reality. The other half is a sloppy, bloated adventure marred by cheesy special effects and some equally cheesy acting" [...] and also that [...] "the script to Next has plenty of jams, one or two <b>egregious</b> <b>enough</b> to demand ticket refunds." ...|$|E
40|$|While {{much has}} been written about the {{effectiveness}} of Transnational Advocacy Network support for social movements of the Global South, relatively few systematic comparisons have sought to reveal the conditions that best facilitate such alliances, or the consequences of such alliances for movement strategy. Comparing regional human rights movements in two Colombian war zones (Urabá and the Bajo Caguán) from 1992 through the present as they responded to waves of violence against movement activists, I find the following movement characteristics enhance both the level of transnational solidarity and its success: a strong social movement and "shared values " with the transnational public, especially the movement's “radical neutrality ” from all armed actors; an environmental component to demands; and repudiation of the coca economy. Intellectual spokespersons and limited, specific demands for prosecution of human rights crimes further enhanced transnational solidarity and movement success, especially when crimes had been carried out by actors vulnerable within Colombia or by “easy-to-hate” corporations based in the Global North, or when violations were <b>egregious</b> <b>enough</b> to attract international attention to the zone. However, structural and historical characteristics meant not every movement had the same ability to adopt a strategy that might maximize international solidarity; these movements focused their efforts instead on strengthening national alliances...|$|E
40|$|Pre-Charter, in {{principle}} {{the police had}} limited powers. However, in practical terms {{it was not possible}} for a private citizen to object to all police action that fell outside those powers: realistically it was only if the police action were <b>egregious</b> <b>enough</b> to {{rise to the level of}} a tort or an offence that there was a mechanism for review. That is, there was a lot of grey area in between the things the police clearly were allowed to do and those they clearly were not allowed to do. The Charter changed that. By making “lawfulness” the standard for deciding whether there was an unreasonable search or an arbitrary detention, the Supreme Court in the ory banished the grey area, making it possible to review any action falling outside the strict limits of police powers. However, experience led to the conclusion that those “strict limits” might in fact be too strict, and so paradoxically the restraint mechanism of the Charter has led in some instances to the expansion of police power. Further, the particular approach taken to expanding police powers amounts to potentially declaring all of the previous grey area to fall within the powers of the police. This paper argues that that is an undesirable strand in Charter jurisprudence, and that it could be avoided by dealing with grey area issues at the remedy stage, as section 24 (2) anticipates, rather than at the stage of deciding what powers police have...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate over}} at-will {{employment}} has been raging for years, 14 {{but it is}} not the primary purpose of this Article to rehash the debate over the value of employment at-will. Instead of taking sides, I find fault with both at-will employment and the just cause standard. Accordingly, the main purpose of this Article is to provide the perfect compromise between at-will employment and the just cause standard. Under a proposed statute (which I have named the 2 ̆ 2 Employment Termination Equity Act (ETEA) 2 ̆ 2), employers would be free to terminate without the burden of proving just cause, allowing them to get rid of unproductive or poorly performing employees with limited risk of litigation. However, certain enumerated reasons for termination would be unlawful. In determining which termination decisions are <b>egregious</b> <b>enough</b> to prohibit, my goal was two-fold: (1) to prohibit termination decisions that have previously been unremedied despite the morass of exceptions to at-will employment and (2) to provide some overlap protection with current statutes by using a procedural process that will be more easily accessible by employees. Yet, in the true spirit of compromise, the ETEA will provide fewer types of remedies than employment discrimination statutes and will force plaintiffs to choose between suit under the ETEA and other statutory remedies. Part II of this Article will give the reader a brief overview of the state of the law, including the current status of the at-will employment rule and the many exceptions that have eroded the employment at-will presumption. Part III will discuss why both the at-will presumption and the just cause standard are problematic and why a compromise between the two is necessary. Part IV will detail the substantive and procedural provisions in my proposed statutory solution. I will explain which terminations should be prohibited and why. More importantly, I will reveal the procedural nuances in the statute that help to make it a true compromise statute. Finally, Part V will address the anticipated challenges to this proposal. As a compromise proposal, either no one wins or everyone wins, depending on one 2 ̆ 7 s level of optimism. Many believe that the measure of a good compromise is when it leaves everyone unhappy. But my goal is to convince the reader to view this proposal in an optimistic light [...] as a massive improvement over the status quo and hopefully as the perfect compromise...|$|E
