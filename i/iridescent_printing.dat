2500|$|In February 2009, {{security}} features were increased on [...] "Machin" [...] self-adhesive stamps {{to avoid the}} reuse of uncancelled used stamps retrieved on mail. Both the effigy and the background were printed with continuous [...] "ROYAL MAIL" [...] <b>iridescent</b> <b>printing.</b> Two ellipsoidal shear panels were added to each stamp, and the water-soluble layer between the stamp and the adhesive was abandoned. These two later features were intended to render the stamps difficult to take off mail and to store for reuse (but in effect are easily overcome by the careful use of a sharp knife edge). Collectors are advised not to attempt to soak such stamps off, but to save them on pieces cut from the envelope.|$|E
