40|$|Lecturepg. 69 The {{technique}} of measuring steady loads on centrifugal pump impellers via magnetic bearings is demonstrated and {{shown to be}} reliable way of clarifying loads, which have been traditionally difficult to determine both analytically and experimentally. Among the most challenging geometries in this respect is the semiopen impeller in an end-suction single volute pump. Because of the uneven distribution of {{the pressure on the}} shroud of a semiopen impeller, axial and radial loads are created. In addition to the classical axial and radial loads, it is recognized that a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>couple</b> is also generated with semiopen impellers. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>couple</b> is not discussed. In the past, experimental evaluation of the hydraulic forces and moments on impellers has been accomplished through techniques such as strain measurements and static pressures at taps in the walls adjacent to the impeller. The present experimental results are obtained using the magnetic bearing test rig that was designed to measure the forces and moments that result from the hydrodynamic interactions in a centrifugal pump under various operating conditions. The comparison is presented between the results for the single stage pump obtained by the traditional methods and those derived from magnetic bearing reactions. The results are given for the full range of flowrates from shutoff to runout and a Reynolds number effect is also examined for semiopen impellers. The information obtained will be used to design new industrial pumps...|$|R

50|$|Christian von Koenigsegg {{invented the}} Koenigsegg Direct Drive System (KDD) {{and it was}} {{developed}} for the Regera by the Koenigsegg Advanced Engineering Team. The KDD system effectively {{eliminates the need for}} a transmission and allows for pure EV (electric vehicle) mode. The Regera doesn't have a traditional multi-gear transmission but instead features a single-speed fixed-gear transmission, often called a direct drive, with a 2.73:1 reduction ratio, meaning the crankshaft mounted on the ICE will rotate 2.73 times for every 1 time that the output shaft of the direct drive mechanism will rotate. At speeds below 30 mph, mostly the wheel shaft electric motors propel the car {{through the use of a}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>coupling</b> that lets the ICE and the crankshaft mounted electric motor slip. In reverse, only the wheel shaft electric motors propel the car. Above 30 mph, the RPM of the crankshaft mounted electric motor and internal combustion engine are proportional to wheel speed through locking of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>coupling.</b> However, in the first driving footage from the Regera through Koenigseggs official YouTube channel, Christian von Koenigsegg described and demonstrated how the Regera features a steering wheel mounted paddle that simulates a traditional downshift by initiating slip of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>coupling</b> connecting the crankshaft to the output shaft. This results in higher RPM of the ICE and the cranskshaft mounted electric motor and therefore higher power at lower speeds than what would have been possible if the coupling would have been locked at all times. Koenigsegg reported that the omission of a gearbox and addition of electric motors and battery only added 88 kg (194 lb) compared to what the Regera would have weighed with the same combustion engine but a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) and no electric motors or batteries.|$|E

40|$|The Institute for Neutron Physics and Reactor Technology (INR) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is {{investigating}} {{the application of the}} meso- and microscale analysis for the prediction of local safety parameters for light water reactors (LWR). By applying codes like CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and SP 3 (simplified transport) reactor dynamics it is possible to describe the underlying phenomena in a more accurate manner than by the nodal/coarse 1 D thermal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>coupled</b> codes. By coupling the transport (SP 3) based neutron kinetics (NK) code DYN 3 D with NEPTUNE-CFD, within a parallel MPI-environment, the NHESDYN platform is created.

The driver module of NHESDYN controls the sequence of execution of the solvers as well as the communication between the solvers based on MPI. In this paper, the main features of NHESDYN are discussed and the proof of the concept is done by solving a single pin problem. The prediction capability of NHESDYN is demonstrated by a code-to-code comparison with the DYNSUB code. Finally, the future developments and validation efforts are highlighted...|$|R
5000|$|The SCWR {{operates}} at supercritical pressure. The reactor outlet coolant is supercritical water. Light water {{is used as}} a neutron moderator and coolant. Above the critical point, steam and liquid become the same density and are indistinguishable, eliminating the need for pressurizers and steam generators (PWR), or jet/recirculation pumps, steam separators and dryers (BWR). Also by avoiding boiling, SCWR does not generate chaotic voids (bubbles) with less density and moderating effect. In a LWR this can affect heat transfer and water flow, and the feedback can make the reactor power harder to predict and control. Neutronic and thermal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>coupled</b> calculation is needed to predict the power distribution. SCWR's simplification should reduce construction costs and improve reliability and safety.A LWR type SCWR adopts water rods with thermal insulation and A CANDU type SCWR keeps water moderator in a Carandira tank. A fast reactor core of the LWR type SCWR adopts tight fuel rod lattice as a high conversion LWR. The fast neutron spectrum SCWR has advantages of a higher poｗer density, but needs plutonium and uranium mixed oxides fuel which will be available from reprocessing.|$|R
