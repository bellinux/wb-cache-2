40|$|The declining cost of {{information}} technology (IT) over time provides the later entrant in information-intensive industries a cost advantage. On the other hand, the earlier entrant {{has the potential to}} build and retain its market share if consumers incur a cost in switching to the later entrant. We investigate the impact of a decline in the IT cost and the switching cost on IT investment strategies of firms. We find that a declining IT cost always hurts the early entrant's profit. The early entrant may assume an aggressive investment strategy or a <b>defensive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> in response to a decline in the IT cost, depending on whether the switching cost relative to the extent of decline in the IT cost is high or low, respectively. A decline in IT cost also hurts the later entrant's profit if the switching cost is high. A surprising result is that when the decline in the IT cost is higher than a critical value, a higher switching cost increases consumer surplus. When firms control the switching cost, the early entrant increases its investment in quality and switching cost and maintains its quality and its market-share leadership irrespective of the extent of decline in the IT cost.

40|$|By {{the latter}} half of the 1980 s, a number of Asia Pacific {{countries}} had succeeded through export strategies in penetrating the European market. While Japan was a net exporter to Europe throughout the 1980 s, countries like Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines were also net exporters to Europe. As we move through the decade of the 1990 s, one of the major uncertainties facing Asia Pacific countries centers on the possibility that, along with the creation of the single market, Europe may erect barriers to trade which could discriminate against non-member countries. Given the potential detrimental impact of a future discriminatory trade policy of the European Union with respect to its outside trading partners, this paper examines the historical relationship and importance of the EU market to selected Asia Pacific countries over the 9 -year period 1982 through 1990. In addition, the paper examines market entry strategies which may be useful for traditional Asia Pacific exporting companies given a potentially adverse European Union trade posture. Specifically, it is suggested that either a <b>defensive</b> export-substitution direct <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> or an offensive export-substitution direct <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> may be appropriate for many Asia Pacific companies.

5000|$|At Purdue, he is {{best known}} for popularising a Personal Finance course that teaches {{undergraduates}} the basic skills of money management, credit, insurance and retirement. The course also covers all popular and current topics and relates them back to the basic principles. The class is structured around a football cliché: [...] "Offense wins games but defense wins championships." [...] Professor Chakravarty argues that to win the game of life one needs to have solid offensive and <b>defensive</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>Investments</b> (including those for retirement) is an offensive strategy while insurance is a defensive strategy. Credit plays the role of good special teams in that a judicious use of credit can move the line of scrimmage from one's 20-yard line to the 45 or 50 yard line and thereby makes it easier to score a personal finance touchdown.

Using rich quasi-experimental variation, we find that the reductions in NOx emissions decreased the number of summer days with high ozone levels by about 25 %. The NBP also led to reductions in expenditures on prescription pharmaceutical expenditures of about 1. 9 %. Additionally, the summer mortality rate declined by approximately 0. 5 %, indicating that there were about 2, 200 fewer premature deaths per summer, mainly among individuals 75 and older. The monetized value of the reductions in pharmaceutical purchases and mortality rates are each roughly $ 900 million annually, suggesting that <b>defensive</b> <b>investments</b> are a significant portion of willingness to pay for air quality. Finally, we cautiously conclude that the reductions in ozone are the primary channel for these reductions in <b>defensive</b> <b>investments</b> and mortality rates, which indicates that willingness to pay for ozone reductions is larger than previously understood...|$|R

Therefore, the expected <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> in Indonesia may provide a favorable outcome. The main issue of writing this final project is whether the application of dividend yield based <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> on the Indonesia stock exchange, especially in LQ 45 stock index so that it can produce such good results as on the Dow Jones stock index.
