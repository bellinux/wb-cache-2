Plasma membranes exhibit a (Na+-K+) -independent-Mg 2 +-ATPase activity which is not activated by calcium between 0. 1 ÂµM and 10 mM CaCl 2. Calcium can, with less efficiency, substitute for magnesium as a cofactor for the (Na+-K+) -independent ATPase. Both Mg 2 +- and Ca 2 +-ATPase activities are identical with respect to pH dependence, nucleotide specificity and sensitivity to inhibitors. But when calcium is substituted for magnesium, there is no detectable membrane phosphorylation from [Î³- 32 P] ATP as it is found in the presence of magnesium. The existence of high affinity binding sites for calcium in liver plasma membranes is compatible with a regulatory role of this ion in membrane enzymic mechanisms or in hormone actions. Plasma membranes obtained by the procedure of Neville are devoid of any Ca 2 +-activated-Mg 2 +-ATPase activity indicating the absence of the classical energy-dependent calcium ion transport.
