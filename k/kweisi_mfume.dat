5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} {{is overwhelmingly}} Democratic, whoever won the Democratic primary election {{was seen as}} the favorite over the Republican nominee in the general election. Baltimore's large African American population initially made it seem likely that the next mayor would also be African American. <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume</b> was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted not to run. Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 Congressman <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume,</b> a Democratic Congressman from Maryland {{and former}} head of the Congressional Black Caucus, was named the organization's president. Three years later {{strained}} finances forced the organization to drastically cut its staff, from 250 in 1992 to 50.|$|E
25|$|Incumbent Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings, who has {{represented}} this heavily liberal district based in Baltimore, Baltimore County and Howard County since previous Congressman <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume</b> resigned in 1996.

50|$|At Yale, he {{majored in}} {{political}} science and became friends with Justin Kan. He graduated in 2005. After graduation, he worked as finance director for <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume's</b> unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 2006. He then moved to Silicon Valley to co-found Justin.tv, and became CEO at the company (from 2007 to 2011). He then became CEO of Socialcam, a social video-sharing app that launched in March 2011 and sold to Autodesk for $60 million in 2012 (after existing for only 18 months). He became a part-time partner at Y Combinator at on January 2013, and joined Y Combinator as its first African-American partner in October 2014. In 2014 Justin.tv was renamed Twitch Interactive and later that year sold to Amazon for over $1 billion dollars.|$|R
25|$|Third District Congressional Representative Ben Cardin won the Democratic Party {{nomination}} after facing tough {{competition in}} the contest for the Democratic ticket from former congressman and NAACP President <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume,</b> businessman Josh Rales, former Baltimore County Executive Dennis F.

25|$|<b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume</b> (born Frizzell Gerald Gray; October 24, 1948) is an American {{politician}} {{and the former}} President/CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), {{as well as a}} five-term Democratic Congressman from Maryland's 7th congressional district, serving in the 100th through 104th Congress. On September 12, 2006, he lost a primary campaign for the United States Senate seat that was being vacated by Maryland U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes.|$|E
25|$|When Paul Sarbanes, Maryland's longest-serving United States Senator, {{announced}} in March 2005 {{that he would}} not be a candidate for re-election in 2006, top state and national Republican officials began pressing Steele to become their party's nominee for the seat. In April 2005, The Baltimore Sun announced the results of a poll it conducted, stating that Steele would run statistically neck and neck against either former NAACP head <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume,</b> or Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin of Baltimore County. Steele formally announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on October 25, 2005.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume</b> {{was elected}} to the Baltimore City Council, serving there until 1986. His {{political}} stance was against that of then-mayor William Donald Schaefer, who Mfume believed had ignored the many poor neighborhoods of the city. It was a contentious matter, but despite his strong opinions he learned the art of political compromise. He was perceived by many to have had some success during his stay in office, a fact perhaps reflected by his subsequent election to the United States House of Representatives in 1986 despite a torrent of criticism, directed in no small part against his early past.|$|E
25|$|On April 26, 2005, Cardin {{announced}} that he would seek the U.S. Senate seat of long-standing senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), following the announcement by Sarbanes {{that he would not be}} running for re-election in 2006. On September 12, 2006, Cardin faced a challenging primary battle with other Maryland Democrats, including <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume,</b> Josh Rales, Dennis F. Rasmussen, and Allan Lichtman. Cardin won, however, with 44 percent of the vote, compared to 40 percent for Mfume, five percent for Rales, and two percent for Rasmussen. He was declared the winner after just two percent of the precincts had reported.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume,</b> {{a former}} congressman and NAACP President, {{was the first}} to {{announce}} for the position, in March 2005. Ben Cardin, then a congressman since 1987, was the only other major candidate until September 2005, when Dennis F. Rasmussen, a former Baltimore County Executive, American University professor Allan Lichtman, and wealthy Potomac businessman Josh Rales entered the contest. Thirteen other candidates subsequently also entered the primary. As of August 2006, Cardin had raised more than $4.8million and collected endorsements from a number of Democratic politicians, the AFL-CIO, and The Washington Post; Mfume had raised over $1.2million and collected endorsements from the Maryland State Teachers Association, Progressive Maryland, former Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, the National Organization for Women, and Maryland Congressmen Elijah Cummings and Al Wynn.|$|E

President Clinton described him as [...] "one of our nation's most passionate and steadfast advocates for civil rights." [...] Jesse Jackson said of Higginbotham, [...] "hat Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston were to {{the first half of this}} century, Judge Higginbotham was to the second half." [...] <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume</b> said [...] "he world has lost one of its finest, most pre-eminent jurists of our times.

500|$|City leaders, {{including}} Howard P. Rawlings, {{a member}} of the Maryland House of Delegates, and William Donald Schaefer, the Comptroller of Maryland and Schmoke's predecessor as mayor, feared that none of the potential candidates had the vision to continue the urban renewal that took place under Schmoke and Schaefer. They hoped that Baltimore-native <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume,</b> the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), would run. Mfume had previously served on the Baltimore City Council and in the United States House of Representatives. Schmoke called the race [...] "his to lose". However, Mfume lived in nearby Catonsville, Maryland, and did not move into Baltimore until March, which would leave him short of the one year residency requirement.|$|E

2500|$|NAACP President <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume</b> {{immediately}} suspended Alcorn {{and condemned}} his remarks. Mfume stated, [...] "I strongly condemn those remarks. I find {{them to be}} repulsive, anti-Semitic, anti-NAACP and anti-American. Mr. Alcorn does not speak for the NAACP, its board, its staff or its membership. We are proud of our long-standing relationship with the Jewish community and I personally will not tolerate statements that {{run counter to the}} history and beliefs of the NAACP in that regard." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film Barbershop (2002) {{featured}} a barber, played by Cedric the Entertainer, arguing with others that other African Americans before Parks had {{been active in}} bus integration, but she was renowned as an NAACP secretary. The activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton launched a boycott against the film, contending it was [...] "disrespectful", but NAACP president <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume</b> stated he thought the controversy was [...] "overblown." [...] Parks was offended and boycotted the NAACP 2003 Image Awards ceremony, which Cedric hosted.|$|E
2500|$|At age 23, it {{came upon}} Gray {{to change his}} life for the better.

He went on to attend Morgan State University, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1976. He would go on to earn a Master of Liberal Arts degree in 1984 at Johns Hopkins University. In the early 1970s, in recognition of his heritage and his success over his beginnings, he legally changed his name to <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume,</b> a name from Ghana that translates to [...] "Conquering Son of Kings".|$|E
2500|$|Like {{other similar}} programs, the Oakland {{resolution}} was widely misunderstood as intended to teach AAVE and [...] "elevate {{it to the}} status of a written language." [...] It gained national attention and was derided and criticized, most notably by Jesse Jackson and <b>Kweisi</b> <b>Mfume</b> who regarded it as an attempt to teach slang to children. The statement that [...] "African Language Systems are genetically based" [...] also contributed to the negative reaction because [...] "genetically" [...] was popularly misunderstood to imply that African Americans had a biological predisposition to a particular language. In an amended resolution, this phrase was removed and replaced with wording that states African American language systems [...] "have origins in West [...] and Niger–Congo languages and are not merely dialects of English...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{year since}} 1997, HRC has hosted a {{national}} dinner {{that serves as}} the organization's single largest annual fundraiser.

2500|$|On August 31, 2006, Maryland Public Television (MPT) and the League of Women Voters (LWV) {{sponsored}} a debate {{between the two}} leading Democratic Primary Candidates.

On the day of the debate, Lichtman, his wife, and a campaign aide were arrested for trespassing while protesting during the taping of the debate. They were found not guilty on all charges. The judge in the case said it should never have been brought to court and was a gross violation of the parties' constitutional rights.|$|E
