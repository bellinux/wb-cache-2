5|$|Records {{of visits}} by pollinators exist {{for only a}} few species, but most of these suggest that the species are pollinated by insects. <b>Flowers</b> <b>of</b> A.chiribogensis produce small {{quantities}} of nectar, but lack a scent. Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae, Sciaridae), midges (Cecidomyiidae, Ceratopogonidae) and micromoths (Lepidoptera) were recorded visiting these flowers, but bees and hover flies were not. Aiphanes eggersii was thought to be pollinated by bees and possibly by wind. Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), hover flies (Syrphidae), biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) and leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) were recorded visiting the <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> A.erinacea, but bees were not. Aiphanes horrida was reportedly pollinated by wind, bees (Meliponidae), weevils (Curculionidae) and bugs (Hemiptera). Flies and weevils were observed on the <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> A.simplex.|$|E

5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G.

This reproductive mimicry may not be readily apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.|$|E

5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> many species of Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Particular species recorded on P.levis include the longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons. Weighing 1700mg (0.60oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds. The <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> P.levis are self-incompatible—that is, they are unable to fertilise themselves and require outcrossing to another plant.|$|E
5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of <b>flowers)</b> <b>of</b> {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size}} from the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{species of}} Perovskia are recognized. P.abrotanoides shares {{much of the}} range of P.atriplicifolia, but is {{distinguished}} by its bipinnate leaves.

5|$|Several {{plants are}} {{immediately}} evident to the visitor. Banyan (Ficus macrophylla subsp. columnaris) {{is a remarkable}} tree with a buttressed trunk and pendulous aerial roots: {{it can be seen}} on the track to Clear Place and near Ned's Beach. Pandanus tree (Pandanus forsteri) has spectacular teepee-like prop roots and pineapple-like fruits that are orange-red when mature, the tough leaves being used for basketry. It occurs in damp areas like creek beds and fine specimens can be seen along the Boat Harbour track. There are ten species of orchid on the island, the most noticeable being the bush orchid (Dendrobium macropus subsp. howeanum) on lowland trees and rocks, bearing cream flowers from August to September. Other prominent flowering plants in the summer include, on the mountain slopes, the whiskery red <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> mountain rose (Metrosideros nervulosa and Metrosideros sclerocarpa), the massed small yellow <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> corokia (Corokia carpodetoides), orange plump <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> pumpkin tree (Negria rhabdothamnoides), and white spikes of Fitzgerald tree (Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii).

5|$|The <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> Schlumbergera have adaptations for {{pollination}} by hummingbirds: tubular {{flowers with}} abundant nectar, and colours towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum.

5|$|There {{are male}} (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (unisexual flowers) {{on a single}} plant (monoecious), and these grow singly, {{appearing}} from the leaf axils. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green bell-shaped calyx. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in Cucurbita there are only three, and their anthers are joined together so that {{there appears to be}} one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> C.argyrosperma and C.ficifolia have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> C.pepo have a small calyx, but the calyx of C.moschata male flowers is comparatively short.|$|E
5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
