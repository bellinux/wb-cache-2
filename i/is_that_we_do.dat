500|$|The {{presence}} {{of nuclear weapons}} on board U.S. aircraft carriers {{since the end of}} the Cold War has neither been confirmed nor denied by the U.S. government. As a result of this, the {{presence of}} a U.S. aircraft carrier in a foreign port has occasionally provoked protest from local people, for example when USS Nimitz docked in Chennai, India, in 2007. At that time, the Strike Group commander Rear Admiral John Terence Blake stated that: [...] "The U.S. policy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not routinely deploy nuclear weapons on board Nimitz." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} then {{referred}} to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which was informed on 26February 2009 by the Special Crime Division of the CPS that the Crown would not oppose the appeal. The case {{then went to the}} Court of Appeal, where, in light of the new DNA evidence available, Hodgson's conviction was quashed. The judgement, which was delivered by Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, on 18March 2009 concluded: [...] "The decision leaves some important, unanswered questions. Perhaps the most important <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know who raped and killed the dead girl. We can but hope {{for the sake of the}} appellant and the family of the murdered girl that her killer may yet be identified and brought to justice. But for now all we can do is to quash the conviction. It is accordingly quashed. The appellant will be discharged. There will be no new trial." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, {{he hopes to}} show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
30|$|Another {{limitation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not ask {{the study}} participants to specify the vessel or vessels affected, something that might also have been of interest.|$|R
30|$|A {{limitation}} of the study <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not measure the severity of headaches which would have influenced the amount of lost productive time {{as shown in the}} working population (Manandhar et al. 2015).|$|R
30|$|There {{are some}} {{limitations}} to our study. The patients were only followed for 1  year postoperatively. It <b>is</b> possible <b>that</b> more time <b>is</b> required {{to demonstrate a}} difference in clinical outcome. Another limitation may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not perform an intra-observer validation study.|$|R
500|$|In April 2016, Most Wanted {{was seen}} to be [...] "a no-brainer" [...] for a series pick-up by {{industry}} insiders. However, in early May it {{was said to be}} [...] "cooling" [...] and [...] "not considered the lock it once was". At that time, the producers were prepping [...] "if-come" [...] orders, [...] "deals with writers that will come into effect in the event a pilot is picked [...] to series". On May 12, 2016, the pilot was passed on by ABC, with Lee's successor Channing Dungey explaining that Most Wanted [...] "did not feel as strong as some of the other pilots that we shot. We talked about it with Marvel and we all came to an agreement that we want {{to figure out what the}} next show <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> together, is something that we all feel is as creatively strong as it can be." [...] However, Dungey said that ABC was open to the series being shopped to another network if Marvel found [...] "another home" [...] for it. Loeb also acknowledged this possibility, but said that the series was designed [...] "to do a very specific thing" [...] alongside S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC.|$|E
2500|$|... "Let's {{talk about}} the Bee Gees. That's an iconic group. Not just a great band, but a great group of songwriters. Even long after the Bee Gees' success on the pop charts, they were still writing songs for other people, huge hit songs. Their talent went far beyond their moment of normal pop success. It is a loss to the music {{industry}} {{and a loss of}} an iconic group. The beauty of this industry <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> pay tribute and every artist coming up is a fan of a generation prior to it, so there's a real tradition element to it".|$|E
2500|$|We {{have made}} our {{positions}} well known. Ghanaian societies frown on homosexuality ... if the people's interest <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not legalize homosexuality, I don't see how any responsible leader will {{decide to go}} against the wishes of his people. I heard what the secretary general said and I wasn't surprised because of where he is coming from, but we only listened to him. We have all made our positions well known. Nobody can say in Ghana we discriminate against homosexuality, there is no witch-hunting on homosexuality ... that is their own problem so we only listen and move on. The secretary general has made his views known and we have also made our views known so the value is the same.|$|E
30|$|Another {{limitation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not have}} {{a sufficient number of}} subjects to create a “train” and “test” cohort. Here we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the technique for creating predictive models. In future studies we will test the methodology more rigorously.|$|R
6000|$|From that on, until {{half an hour}} had passed, we pressed forward cautiously, {{and well}} it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> so, for {{suddenly}} I came upon a levelled musket, {{which would have been}} discharged but for my crying out quickly, as I swerved to one side: ...|$|R
30|$|Finally, another {{limitation}} to {{the study}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not find a suitable control population. The control population <b>we</b> <b>do</b> have comes exclusively from the National Capital Area {{and would not be}} suitable for comparison. A comparable control population would have been particularly helpful for addressing the generalizability of the findings.|$|R
2500|$|Likewise, in {{agreement}} with Ottolenghi, the journalist Dan Rickman said that [...] "Shahak ignores [...] aspects of the sources. Further, through overstating his case, his analysis fits into anti-Semitic traditions of such accusations against the Talmud. Copies of the Talmud have been burned, and {{the text of the}} Talmud that is studied today is still heavily censored. Shahak's view that chauvinism in these sources in any way 'justifies' anti-Semitism is also very troubling. However, I do believe that his trenchant critique of Judaism is, tragically, not without some force. The contemporary situation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> see some modern Orthodox rabbis utilise xenophobic sources in modern rulings. Orthodox rabbis in organisations such as Rabbis for Human Rights are sadly {{the exception rather than the}} rule".|$|E
2500|$|The anti-Zionist {{response}} to this is that Nachmanides' words [...] "we are commanded with the conquest {{of the land in}} every generation" [...] mean every generation until the era of exile. One of the established rules for counting the 613 commandments in the Torah <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not count one-time-only commandments, such as God's command to count the Jews in Numbers 1:2. Nachmanides' intent here is to prove that conquering the land was not a one-time-only commandment that applied to Joshua's battles; rather it applied to King David and, by extension, in every generation. This justifies counting it among the 613, even if it does not apply during exile, just as numerous commandments associated with the Temple are counted {{despite the fact that they}} cannot be kept during exile. Nachmanides does say explicitly later in the piece that the commandment to live in the Land applies even during exile, but this means strictly living there as an individual - not conquering, since that would conflict with the Three Oaths.|$|E
2500|$|Early Dublin is also {{referred}} to {{in a number of}} native sources. The Book of Invasions, a largely fabulous compilation of myths and legends, mentions Dublin when describing how two legendary kings of Ireland, Conn of the Hundred Battles and Mug Nuadat, divided the country between them. The line of demarcation, which cut the island into two symbolic halves (known as Leth Cuinn, or [...] "Conn's Half", and Leth Moga, or [...] "Mug's Half") ran along the Esker Riada from High Street in Dublin to Galway on the west coast. According to another work which draws on early sources, the Annals of the Four Masters, Fiachu Sraibtine, the king of Tara, quelled the rebellious inhabitants of Leinster in a battle fought at Dublin in 291 AD; the Annals of Dublin also record that Alphin mac Eochaid, King of Dublin, was converted to Christianity by Saint Patrick in 448 AD. But these entries were only added to the Annals, or the sources from which they were compiled, many centuries after the events they purport to record, and no reliance can be placed on them. The simple fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know for certain when the city of Dublin was founded.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{he rejects}} <b>that</b> Nheengatu <b>is</b> a [...] "back to the roots" [...] album. [...] "People speak through stereotypes. We didn't {{get back to}} the roots, much to the contrary. What they mean <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> an album as {{relevant}} and seminal as some of our best past works, like Cabeça Dinossauro and Titanomaquia." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "There <b>was</b> nothing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> well tonight," [...] {{a solemn}} Willingham {{said after the}} game.|$|R
30|$|One {{limitation}} {{of the current study}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> reported the secondary outcomes over the period of the study only which last for the first 48 [*]h from initiation of the UFH infusion. Also, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not estimate the incidence of thromboembolic manifestations. Another limitation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not measure the length of ICU stay or the mortality rate in the studied groups.|$|R
60|$|The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{this thing}} so {{differently}} over in America that I {{was for the}} time being completely thrown off my bearings. The questions that I had every right to expect after many years of American and Canadian interviews failed to appear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--all of them, without exception. To {{suppose the}} opposite, and {{imagine that a}} wise, loving, and almighty Being would create {{anything}} for no purpose {{seems to me the}} very essence of absurdity. Our only difficulty <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not always see the purpose. All things are ours, but we must ask if we would have them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{suggestion}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{nothing at}} present, but wait, as Andrew asks, until {{a meeting of}} the shareholders is held, when he must give a full account of his plans. Then we will see our course more clearly; but if he finds he can take us into his confidence sooner, so much the better." ...|$|E
30|$|Another {{limiting}} factor <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not assess dietary habits at either assessment. Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not require participants to fast or refrain from exercise prior to blood draw. IL- 6 levels, for example, can be transiently elevated {{for up to}} 24  hours after an acute bout of exercise (Rogers et al. 2013). These factors {{may have contributed to}} the unexpected results.|$|R
30|$|One major {{limitation}} of the study <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not consider the different industry structures across the agricultural, industry, and service sectors. This concern is relevant because the different sectors produce different impacts on the emission of environmental pollutants and the resulting damage to human health. Furthermore, the eastern region and the western region of China demonstrate large differences in industrial structure.|$|R
30|$|The {{limitations}} {{of our study}} <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not look at the}} size of the motorbike, rider experience, course design, and course safety provisions and therefore we cannot make any conclusions about their impact on safety. The patients included in this study were followed up until the present time, and include 5 patients who sustained significant disability requiring full-time care.|$|R
6000|$|... "O father!" [...] {{she said}} smiling. [...] "I had no sooner lain down than I napped, though I {{did not mean}} to. I wonder I did not dream about poor Mrs. Farfrae, after {{thinking}} of her so; but I did not. How strange it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not often dream of latest events, absorbing as they may be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} girl, reflectively, [...] "the fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{recognize}} the distinctions you allude to, though {{not to the}} same extent that you do; but it takes rather longer to acquire certain mannerisms and modes of expressing oneself than it does to learn the use of the axe and drill. To be more candid, any one can put on a flume-builder's clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|I maintain, therefore, {{that the}} common sociological method is quite useless: that of first {{dissecting}} abject poverty or cataloguing prostitution. We all dislike abject poverty; {{but it might be}} another business if we began to discuss independent and dignified poverty. We all disapprove of prostitution; but we do not all approve of purity. The only way to discuss the social evil is to get at once to the social ideal. We can all see the national madness; but what is national sanity? I have called this book [...] "What Is Wrong with the World?" [...] and the upshot of the title can be easily and clearly stated. What is wrong <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not ask what is right.|$|E
30|$|The main {{limitation}} {{of our study}} was the leak of arterial blood gas analysis during SpO 2 measurements for determining the accurate value. Another {{limitation of}} our study <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not have adequate left hand dominance volunteers. Further studies {{can be made with}} adequate number of left hand dominance volunteers or corroborated by arterial blood gas analyses and PI parameters.|$|R
30|$|Our {{study has}} some limitations, {{including}} {{a lack of}} cytology – histology – mRNA detection which was not included at this time and this also limits the comparison of our retrieval technique with other methods. Therefore a comparison with pathological samples from other publications was also not possible at this time. Another limitation of our study <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> also <b>did</b> not perform a comparison with other assays using the same sample set. Finally, another caveat of this study <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not perform a breakdown of all HPV genotypes present in each samples (for times more than one), what could point out to an association of multiple genotypes and mRNA.|$|R
50|$|Only thing, which hurt, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> don’t <b>do</b> {{anything}} to conserve this beauty. Not {{many people know}} about it.|$|R
6000|$|The ring is {{obviously}} to {{be a piece}} de conviction. But our point, at present, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know how Grewgious, to whom this ring was so dear, employed himself at Cloisterham--after Edwin's disappearance--between December 25 and December 27. On {{the evening of the}} 27th, he came to Jasper, saying, [...] "I have JUST LEFT MISS LANDLESS." [...] He then slowly and watchfully told Jasper that Edwin's engagement was broken off, while the precentor gasped, perspired, tore his hair, shrieked, and finally subsided into a heap of muddy clothes on the floor. Meanwhile, Mr. Grewgious, calmly observing these phenomena, warmed his hands at the fire for some time before he called in Jasper's landlady.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} be willing to say quite as much as that; but certain it is her heart was troubled sorely when I told her what we counted on doing. I believe of a verity if Uncle 'Rasmus had not already left the plantation, she would have set her face against it. As it is, knowing that now most like the old negro is housed up in the cabin, unless the Britishers, suspecting {{intended}} mischief, have given the poor fellow lodgings in a guard-house, she realizes that we can do no less than continue as we have begun, although her command <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not run our heads into danger unnecessarily. She says it is foolish for us to venture our liberty, and perhaps our lives, in the effort to reclaim two horses, when it is possible to buy others that would serve us equally well." ...|$|E
60|$|But even supposing that a {{man should}} raise a dead body to life before our eyes, and on this fact rest his claim to being {{considered}} the son of God;--the Humane Society restores drowned persons, and because it makes no mystery of the method it employs, its members are not mistaken for the sons of God. All {{that we have a}} right to infer from our ignorance of the cause of any event <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know it: had the Mexicans attended to this simple rule when they heard the cannon of the Spaniards, they would not have considered them as gods: the experiments of modern chemistry would have defied the wisest philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome to have accounted for them on natural principles. An author of strong common sense has observed that 'a miracle is no miracle at second-hand'; he might have added that a miracle is no miracle in any case; for until we are acquainted with all natural causes, we have no reason to imagine others.|$|E
