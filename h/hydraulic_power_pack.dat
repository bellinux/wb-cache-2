50|$|This is the {{simplest}} of rotary positive displacement pumps. It consists of two meshed gears that rotate in a closely fitted casing. The tooth spaces trap fluid and force it around the outer periphery. The fluid does not travel back on the meshed part, because the teeth mesh closely in the center. Gear pumps see wide use in car engine oil pumps and in various <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>packs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The simple {{design of}} a shell and tube heat {{exchanger}} makes it an ideal cooling solution {{for a wide variety}} of applications. One of the most common applications is the cooling of hydraulic fluid and oil in engines, transmissions and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>packs.</b> With the right choice of materials they can also be used to cool or heat other mediums, such as swimming pool water or charge air. One of the big advantages of using a shell and tube heat exchanger is that they are often easy to service, particularly with models where a floating tube bundle (where the tube plates are not welded to the outer shell) is available.|$|R

50|$|The A380's 350 bar (35 MPa or 5,000 psi) {{hydraulic}} {{system is a}} significant difference from the typical 210 bar (21 MPa or 3,000 psi) hydraulics used on most commercial aircraft since the 1940s. First used in military aircraft, high-pressure hydraulics reduce the weight and size of pipelines, actuators and related components. The 350 bar pressure is generated by eight de-clutchable hydraulic pumps. The hydraulic lines are typically made from titanium; the system features both fuel- and air-cooled heat exchangers. Self-contained electrically <b>powered</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>packs</b> serve as backups for the primary systems, instead of a secondary {{hydraulic system}}, saving weight and reducing maintenance.|$|R
50|$|A Spring Starter uses {{potential}} energy {{stored in a}} spring {{wound up with a}} crank to start an engine without a battery or alternator. Turning the crank moves the pinion into mesh with the engine’s ring gear, then winds up the spring. Pulling the release lever then applies the spring tension to the pinion, turning the ring gear to start the engine. The pinion automatically disengages from the flywheel after operation. Provision is also made to allow the engine to be slowly turned over by hand for engine maintenance. This is achieved by operating the trip lever just after the pinion has engaged with the flywheel. Subsequent turning of the winding handle during this operation will not load the starter. Spring starters can be found in engine-generators, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>packs,</b> and on lifeboat engines, with the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels.|$|R

50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> can be {{attached}} to the SPMT to provide power for steering, suspension and drive functions. This power pack is driven by an internal combustion engine. A single power pack can drive a string of SPMTs. As SPMTs often carry the world's heaviest loads on wheeled vehicles, they are very slow, often moving at under one mile per hour while fully loaded. Some SPMTs are controlled by a worker with a hand-held control panel, while others have a driver cabin. Multiple SPMTs can be linked (lengthwise and side-by-side) to transport massive building-sized objects. The linked SPMTs can be controlled from a single control panel.|$|E

There are three versions of this carriage which include a standard carriage and the option of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> so that the angle of the launch can be changed to suit the conditions. The carriage’s launch platform has a main bed which elevates through 10° to achieve this feature. The third variant of the carriage has the elevation bed mounted on a rail carriage system.|$|E
50|$|An {{electronic}} limited-slip differential will {{typically have}} a planetary or bevel gear set {{similar to that}} of an open differential and a clutch pack similar to that in a torque sensitive or gerotor pump based differential. In the electronic unit the clamping force on the clutch is controlled externally by a computer or other controller. This allows the control of the differential’s limiting torque, Trq d , to be controlled as part of a total chassis management system. An example of this type of differential is Subaru’s DCCD used in the 2011 Subaru WRX STi. Another example is the Porsche PSD system used on the Porsche 928. A third example is the SAAB XWD (Haldex Generation 4) with eLSD, it uses a common (electronically controlled via the vehicle computer network) <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> to control both the longitudinal and transversal torque transfer of the XWD system. The same Haldex system is used on several other GM Epsilon based vehicles such as the Cadillac SRX etc.|$|E

40|$|All {{structures}} have modal properties such {{as natural}} frequencies and damping. In engineeringit is often {{of interest to}} estimate these modal properties for certain structures, to be used whenmodelling for example fatigue. This is done by computing them from finite element models, by using experimental measurements or both. In the case of doing both, a finite elementmodel is usually established first and adjusted to fit measurements from experiments. Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB is the company where this thesis has been performed and the subject is experimental procedures related to estimating modal properties of the so calledpower pack, which essentially is a modularised engine and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> source of an Atlas Copco drill rig. Their current method for estimating these properties is a classical procedure which makes use of an impact hammer that an operator strikes the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> with to induce excitation. Due to concealment of behind other parts the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> when mounted inside the drill rig, the number of places where the operator is able to strike the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> in is limited. Another problem with the current procedure {{is that it can}} be difficult to strike the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> with a strong enough impulse to generate reliable results. In this thesis a new experimental procedure for Atlas Copco to use is suggested. It is based on operational modal analysis (OMA), which uses the machinery's excitation from its operational conditions to compute modal estimates. A comparison between different experimental procedures have been done and the suggested procedure is the following: excitation by engine sweep; modal identifcation by the PolyMAX method and mode shape scaling by the harmonic scaling method. An experiment was performed to compare two OMA procedures. The suggested procedure is the one that generated the better results of the two...|$|R

50|$|Standing Stem Harvesting, a {{selective}} harvesting method within Heli-Logging, {{was invented by}} Philip Jarman of Port Alberni, British Columbia between May and October 1997. The initial harvesting equipment used wire rope or chokers to rig the stem and a modified external hook to engage the choker and lift the stem clear of the stump. In this way, the process of harvesting, which includes climbing, measuring, cutting, rigging, and lifting was pioneered by a single pilot flying a light utility helicopter. In 1998, the inventor supervised the building of an experimental grapple {{which was to be}} operated by a K-Max Lift Truck helicopter. However, because the K-Max had no hydraulics, it was necessary to design and install an externally mounted, jettisonable sled carrying a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>pack,</b> to operate the grapple.Initial flight trials were carried out using the external hook and wire rope configuration on the 25th of April 1998. In late October 1998, a successful full-scale harvesting trial using a grapple designed by the inventor and funded by the timber licensee was carried out at Lunchtime Lake on Vancouver Island. Press releases and logging industry recognition followed. Patent applications in the United States and Canada were submitted and granted in 2001 and 2002 respectively.|$|E
40|$|When {{operating}} walking machines, only {{a coordinated}} movement of all cylinders and/or motors {{can lead to}} safe, stable walking. The large hydraulically driven walking machine ALDURO, which is investigated in this paper, has no external power supply, and therefore {{the size of the}} on-board <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> and its diesel engine is limited by its weight. When moving several cylinders with high speed, the hydraulic supply can become insu#cient and the resulting trajectories of feet and platform can become unpredictable. When the ALDURO is near its stability limit such behaviour can lead to instability and toppling of the system. The proposed solution under discussion here is to observe the position errors and time derivatives for the cylinders and based on this reduce the speed when necessary...|$|E

One in particular is when it is used in hot environments. Oil fires are devastating and hard to extinguish, the catastrophe in Bois du Cazier 1956 tells us this with its 262 casualties of which most were coal mining workers. The tragedy started with a simple short circuit. In Outotecs plants hydraulics is commonly used. With background in Outotecs customer demands this thesis investigates fire-resistant, non-mineral oil based, hydraulic fluids and implements them in an existent plant, Outotecs kaldo furnace TBRC. The components in the hydraulic system have been modeled using Solidworks and assembled as a <b>hydraulic</b> unit, <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> that has been placed within a 20 feet shipping container. A Life Cycle Cost-analysis has been made for the furnace with the hydraulics and lance systems. A hydraulic fluid analysis has been made using industrial standards, hydraulic- and tribologic theory and contact with leading hydraulic suppliers. The modeling of the system has been made using Solidworks with basis in performance demands, service and reliability, study visits and mechanical hydraulic theory. The LCC-analysis is based on Outotec experience and economic reports delivered by one of Outotecs operational organisations which contains operational characteristics from a similar TBRC in service. The primary choice of fire resistant hydraulic fluid is the polyol ester {{which is the result}} of a fatyt acid and an alcohol. The fluid can be used in the current system without any modifications. The alternative is a water and glycol based hydraulic fluid, if this liquid is used the pumps and motors have to be downrated in the current hydraulic system in the TBRC.
