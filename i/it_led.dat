5|$|Between December 1964 and February 1965 the royalists discerned four Egyptian {{attempts}} to drive {{directly into the}} Razih mountains. The intensity of these thrusts gradually diminished, and {{it was estimated that}} the Egyptians lost 1,000 men killed, wounded and taken prisoner. Meanwhile, the royalists were building up an offensive. The Egyptian line of communications went from San'a to Amran, then Khairath, where it branched off north-eastwards to Harf. From Harf it turned due south to Farah, and then South-eastwards to Humaidat, Mutamah and Hazm. From Hazm <b>it</b> <b>led</b> south-eastwards to Marib and Harib. A military convoy went over this route twice a month. Since the royalists had closed the direct route across the mountains from San'a to Marib, the Egyptians had no other way.|$|E
