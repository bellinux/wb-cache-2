50|$|The lighthouse's {{construction}} was completed on January 15, 1875. On {{top of the}} tower, there is an optical device made in France, from 1926. The lighthouse has a <b>drum</b> <b>lens,</b> made from forty-three prismatic crystals.|$|E
50|$|Tärnö has two lighthouses. A {{large wooden}} one {{featuring}} a <b>drum</b> <b>lens</b> at the island's highest point {{was built in}} 1910 to replace a predecessor. The other one is a simple structure for guiding coastal fishery which only has a 40 Watt bulb. A known sight apart from the picturesque cottages and the unique natural surroundings is the fiskgökaeken (a hollow centuries-old oak tree), a few Iron Age graves {{as well as a}} large naturally formed stone terrace. A number of military installations is still found on the island as a remnant of the time it formed part of the Swedish Navy's shooting range which made the island off-limits to all non-Swedes.|$|E
50|$|The {{first light}} at Cattle Point was a lens lantern on a post erected in 1888. In 1921, the U.S. Navy {{installed}} a radio compass station. The modern 34 ft, octagonal, concrete tower on Cattle Point was erected in 1935. Following automation {{in the late}} 1950s, the tower's lantern was removed and replaced with a 250-mm <b>drum</b> <b>lens</b> that sits on a short mast {{on top of the}} tower. The lighthouse received a temporary makeover in 1984, when it was used as a backdrop for an Exxon television commercial. The commercial's ahistorical additions were subsequently removed. The Coast Guard announced plans to reinforce the structure, which was in danger of collapse from the forces of erosion, during the summer of 2010.|$|E
5000|$|American Shoal Light {{was built}} in wrought iron on a screw-pile {{foundation}} with a platform and a skeletal tower. The Light is 109 ft above the water. The keeper's octagonal dwelling is on a platform 40 ft above the water. The tower framework and dwelling are painted brown, while the enclosed circular stair to the lantern is painted white. The original lens was a first-order <b>drum</b> Fresnel <b>lens,</b> producing a flash every 5 seconds. The light was automated in 1963, and a fourth-order lens with solar-powered light was installed, the current light is a VRB-25 aerobeacon. The light has a nominal range of [...] in the white sectors, and [...] in the red sectors.|$|R
50|$|Fowey Rocks Light {{is located}} seven miles {{southeast}} of Cape Florida on Key Biscayne. The lighthouse was completed in 1878, replacing the Cape Florida Light. It was automated on May 7, 1975 and is still in operation today. The structure is cast iron, with a screw-pile foundation, a platform and a skeletal tower. The light is 110 feet above the water. The tower framework is painted brown, while the dwelling and enclosed circular stair to the lantern is painted white. The original lens was a first-order <b>drum</b> Fresnel <b>lens</b> which stood about 12 ft high and weighed about a ton (tonne). The light has a nominal range of 15 miles in the white sectors, and 10 miles in the red sectors.|$|R
50|$|Throughout all its history, {{the basic}} {{technical}} design remained unchanged: when the shutter button is pressed, a <b>drum</b> carrying the <b>lens</b> is rotating {{from left to}} right. Inside the camera through a small slit {{on the back of}} the drum, the captured image is projected on the film, which in turn also sits on a curved carrier. By varying the width of the slit, the time each segment of film is exposed to light is changed. With this trick, different shutter speeds can be achieved without changing the rotating speed of the drum. The entire mechanism is powered by a spring. The focus of the lens is fixed on infinity, when stopped down to aperture 16, all objects from about 1 meter onwards will be pictured sharp. On 35 mm film, the camera produces frames of a size of 24x58 mm.|$|R
50|$|The Lime Kiln Light was {{established}} in 1914 when acetylene lights were placed on Lime Kiln Point, a name derived from the lime kilns built there in the 1860s. It was the last major light established in Washington. The light was updated five years later with a 38 ft octagonal concrete tower rising from the fog signal building, a design that matches the Alki Point Light in Seattle. Two keeper's houses and other structures also date from around this time. A fourth-order Fresnel lens was first exhibited from the new tower on June 30, 1919. The Coast Guard automated the Lime Kiln Lighthouse in August 1962, using photoelectric cells to turn the light on at dusk and off during daylight hours. In 1998, the <b>drum</b> <b>lens</b> was replaced with a modern optic, flashing a white light once every 10 seconds. Sitting on the rocky shoreline at a height of 55 ft, the beacon is visible for 17 mi.|$|E
