Strong N+–H/X –M hydrogen bonding interactions, as well as weaker C–H/p aromatic interactions occur in all seven structures, and two robust tetrameric hydrogen bonded zero-dimensional motifs are present in all seven structures. C–H/ Cl–M hydrogen bonding interactions are present in the structure of bis(2 -phenylethylammonium) tetrachlorozincate, and result in the distortion of the geometry of the 2 -phenylethylammonium cation. Comparison of the identified zero-dimensional hydrogen bonding motifs with those occurring in related structures reported in the literature shows that the motifs are robust and can tolerate changes in cation, metal and ligand to a large extent. www. rsc. org/crystengcom...|$|R

40|$|The {{neonatal}} handling paradigm {{has been}} used to examine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity under acute stress. Neonatally handled (H) animals exhibit decreased plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone (B) in response to some acute stressors relative to non-handled (NH) animals. However, relatively little is known about how animals that differ in HPA responsiveness to acute stress will respond to repeated exposure to the same stressor. We examined various aspects of HPA activity in adult, control <b>H</b> and <b>NH</b> animals (<b>H</b> CTL and <b>NH</b> CTL), and <b>H</b> and <b>NH</b> animals exposed to chronic, intermittent cold stress (4 h of 4 $ sp circ$C cold a day for 21 days; <b>H</b> CHR and <b>NH</b> CHR). <b>H</b> CTL and <b>NH</b> CTL animals displayed comparable ACTH and B responses to the first exposure. H CHR animals exhibited lower levels of ACTH, but not B, during the 22 nd exposure (the homotypic stressor) compared to the first exposure in H CTL. However, ACTH and B levels in NH CHR were not different from those in NH CTL. Upon exposure to restraint (the novel, heterotypic stressor), NH CHR animals hypersecreted ACTH and B compared to NH CTL more than did H CHR animals relative to H CTL animals. These endocrine responses were associated with increased basal median eminence levels of both CHR and AVP in <b>H</b> CHR and <b>NH</b> CHR relative to their control groups and with decreased GR densities in septum of both <b>H</b> CHR and <b>NH</b> CHR. Thus, the differential responses of <b>H</b> CHR and <b>NH</b> CHR to the homotypic and heterotypic stressors cannot be explained solely by changes in median eminence content of secretagogues or central GR density. We also examined three aspects of immune function. We first measured the plaque-forming cell (PFC) response, a T cell-dependent, B cell response, and plasma antibody titers to an injection of sheep red blood cells. Suppression of PFC response and antibody titers was similar in <b>H</b> and <b>NH</b> following either acute or chronic exposure to cold, but a greater suppression was seen in <b>NH</b> CHR than <b>H</b> CHR following a single re-exposure to cold. We then examined HPA responses to two doses of endotoxin and found that plasma ACTH and B responses to endotoxin depended on dose. Finally, we examined incidence of tumors in control and chronically cold stressed <b>H</b> and <b>NH</b> animals, as well as chronic intermittently restraint <b>H</b> and <b>NH</b> animals (20 min restraint a day for 21 days; <b>H</b> RES and <b>NH</b> RES) that had been injected with cells transfected with the Fujinami Sarcoma Virus. H RES animals exhibited the lowest incidence of tumors of all animals studied, and this decreased incidence was associated with adaptation of plasma B responses, decreased thymus GR levels, and decreases in some indices of sympathetic adrenomedullary activity. These data support the notion that exposure to chronic stress is associated with perturbations of immune function that may lead to the development of pathology, and that differences between <b>H</b> and <b>NH</b> animals in HPA responses to stress are relevant to the study of individual differences in the development of pathology.

The biodistribution of boron was determined after the injection of liposomal suspensions into BALB/c mice bearing EMT 6 tumors. Both [B 20 <b>H</b> 17 <b>NH</b> 3] 3 - isomers exhibited excellent tumor uptake and selectivity at very low injected doses, achieving peak tumor boron concentrations of 30 - 40 micrograms of B/g of tissue and tumor/blood boron ratios of approximately 5. The enhanced retention of the [B 20 <b>H</b> 17 <b>NH</b> 3] 3 - isomers by EMT 6 tumors may be attributed to their facile intracellular oxidation to an extremely reactive NH 3 -substituted [n-B 20 H 18] 2 - ion, the electrophilic [B 20 <b>H</b> 17 <b>NH</b> 3]- ion.
