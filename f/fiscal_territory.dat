40|$|The {{decentralization}} should transfer some attributions {{and services}} to the local level. In return, that implies that the local community should be awarded directly either a quota {{out of all the}} taxes that are collected from its <b>fiscal</b> <b>territory</b> or the entire amount of some taxes. One solution could be that the direct income taxes should be withhold at the local level whereas the indirect taxes should go to the general public Romanian budget for the overall needs of the country. decentralization, fiscal decentralization, territorial administrative reform, local budget, direct taxes, indirect taxes...|$|E

40|$|During {{the press}} conference on 3 December 2015, {{president}} Mario Draghi reiterated the readiness of the ECB to adopt additional measures {{in order to maintain}} an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation. Different options are available, including the increase in the amount of monthly purchases of assets, currently set at 60 billion EUR per month. However, there are risks involved in extending these asset purchase operations, including the renewed criticism against the ECB for not complying with its mandate and entering the <b>fiscal</b> financing <b>territory.</b> This paper reviews the available unconventional monetary policy options for the ECB and considers the potential risks involved with each. It also briefly discusses key credibility issues that ECB might eventually face...|$|R

The report makes a series of recommendations, particularly examining the prospect of state-based charters of budget honesty. A minority report by government senators is included in this report...|$|R

50|$|Spain is {{a diverse}} country {{made up of}} {{different}} regions with varying economic and social structures, as well as different languages and historical, political and cultural traditions. While the entire Spanish territory was united under one crown by the 16th century, {{this was not a}} process of national homogenization or amalgamation. The constituent territories—be it crowns, kingdoms, principalities or dominions—retained much of their former institutional existence, including limited legislative, judicial or <b>fiscal</b> autonomy. These <b>territories</b> also exhibited a variety of local customs, laws, languages and currencies until the mid nineteenth century.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} how the reform {{regulating}} fiscal federalism in Italy (L. 42 / 2009) addresses three problems. First, how to finance additional sub-central competencies with local taxes, especially when they involve the provision of minimum or essential levels of service (e. g. health). Second, how to solve the trade-off between the need for greater efficiency {{and the need to}} equalise the lower endowment of the poorer regions. Third, whether local governments should have a direct relationship with the central government or whether the regions may successfully fund and equalise the fiscal capacity of local governments within their <b>territories.</b> <b>Fiscal</b> federalism, Equalisation, Minimum standards...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{theme is}} important for the local economy and financial literature on local public finance. It is known that the tax base of the territories is quite uneven and providing quality public services is impossible based on their own sources. The support for less developed local public administration from the financial point of view requires fiscal decentralization and involves financial equalization procedures or other similar measures aimed at eliminating the effect of unequal distribution for potential funding sources. Financial equalization is a group of financial actions made in order to overcome economic and <b>fiscal</b> disparities between <b>territories.</b> The purpose of financial equalization is the additional funding of less developed territories in order to reduce regional disparities. financial equalization, fiscal decentralization, inter-budgetary relations, cost-benefit, economic efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Today {{we live in}} a globalizing economy: {{national}} {{open markets}} are steadily developing towards a global market. Within the European Union (EU), the internal market without internal frontiers has been established. However, the fiscal sovereignty of nation states (hereinafter: ‘states’) remains limited to economic activities taking place within their <b>territory.</b> <b>Fiscal</b> sovereignty is purely a domestic matter. The combination of a globalizing economy and the geographically restricted fiscal sovereignty of states lead to distortions in the allocation of tax among taxpayers and between states. These distortions are caused by obstacles, disparities and the inadequate ‘formula’ that is generally used by states to divide the ‘international tax pie’. In this article, I address the question of how these distortions may be dissolved with respect to the taxation of corporate business income in a global market...|$|R
40|$|Using {{current and}} {{available}} {{information on the}} land-use outcomes in the municipality, {{it is possible to}} independently analyze development tendencies in the territory and promote planned territory development. Tax revenues can with good reason be considered an important <b>fiscal</b> instrument in <b>territory</b> development planning. Application of this instrument in land-use management decision-making may prevent the so-called urban sprawl and reduce the risk of value decrease of inefficiently used infrastructure and environmental resources. The present research focuses on the application of the developed set of fiscal algorithms in land-use management and decisionmaking at a municipal level. The set of fiscal algorithms has been developed using the methodological framework for land-use efficiency assessment and the cost-benefit analysis method. The main research results have been substantiated having conducted the analysis of performance of municipalities, including the analysis of experience of the City of Riga in real estate data management. The application of the developed set of fiscal algorithms and the introduction of the specific municipal software module allow analyzing the impact of the changes in land-use objectives and their basic values on cadastral value of real estate objects, the amount of real estate tax and municipal budget revenues...|$|R
