5|$|There are {{intentional}} and unintentional modifications {{concerning the}} clitoris, including female genital mutilation (FGM), sex reassignment surgery, clitoris enlargement and genital piercings. For example, use of anabolic steroids by bodybuilders and other athletes {{can result in}} significant <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clitoris in concert with other masculinizing effects on their bodies. Abnormal <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clitoris may also {{be referred to as}} clitoromegaly, but clitoromegaly is more commonly seen as a congenital anomaly of the genitalia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spleen {{may occur}} in AML, {{but it is}} {{typically}} mild and asymptomatic. Lymph node swelling is rare in AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The skin is involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia cutis. Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.|$|E
5|$|If left untreated, DPB {{progresses}} to bronchiectasis, an irreversible {{lung condition}} that involves <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the bronchiolar passages. Daily treatment of DPB with macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin eases symptoms and increases survival time, but the disease currently has no known cure. The eventual result of DPB can be respiratory failure and heart problems.|$|E

5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|Most of the <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primate brain {{comes from}} a massive {{expansion}} of the cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal cortex and {{the parts of the}} cortex involved in vision. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy {{more than half of the}} total surface of the primate neocortex. The prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.|$|E

5|$|Operation Badr {{called for}} an <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridgeheads on October 8. To {{accomplish}} this, {{each of the five}} infantry divisions had to reorganize its forces. Mechanized infantry brigades in the second echelon of divisional lines were to advance between the two forward infantry brigades.

5|$|The M7 tank {{locomotive}} was {{the first}} design by Dugald Drummond upon replacing William Adams as Locomotive Superintendent of the LSWR in 1895. It was an <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> T1 with a sloping grate of increased area giving greater power. Drummond drew upon his previous experience with the successful London Brighton and South Coast Railway D1 class, whilst he was works manager at Brighton in the early 1870s, and his own 157 class of 1877, on the North British Railway in Scotland. It was the heaviest 0-4-4 type ever to run in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Poles, {{completely}} {{surprised by}} the Swedish invasion, in September attempted a counter-offensive, but were defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Gniew. The forces required serious modernization. The Sejm passed high taxation for the defense, but collections lagged behind. The situation was partially saved by the City of Danzig, which hurriedly embarked {{on the construction of}} modern fortifications, and by Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski. The accomplished commander of the eastern borderlands fighting quickly learned the maritime affairs and contemporary methods of European warfare. Koniecpolski promoted the necessary <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> naval fleet, modernization of the army, and became a fitting counterbalance for the military abilities of Gustavus Adolphus.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} “surface” enzymes of Escherichia coli (i. e., among those {{selectively}} released by osmotic shock) all displayed higher specific activities in extracts of minicells than in extracts of typical rod forms; these enzymes included alkaline phosphatase, cyclic phosphodiesterase, acid hexose monophosphatase, 5 ′-nucleotidase, and ribonuclease I. In addition, alkaline phosphatase, cyclic phosphodiesterase, and acid hexose monophosphatase were cytochemically localized to regions of minicell periplasm that resembled reactive polar <b>enlargements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periplasm in rod forms. In contrast, {{a number of}} “internal” cytoplasmic enzymes (inorganic pyrophosphatase, β-galactosidase, glutamine synthetase, polynucleotide phosphorylase, and ribonuclease II) showed elevated or similar specific activities in extracts of rod forms versus extracts of minicells. A specific heat-labile inhibitor for 5 ′-nucleotidase, known {{to occur in the}} cytoplasm, also showed no enrichment in minicells. These findings indicate that the “surface” enzymes are segregated in vivo into the terminal minicell buds, possibly because these enzymes are concentrated in <b>the</b> polar <b>enlargements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periplasm in typical rod forms...|$|R

5|$|Chagas disease, {{also known}} as American trypanosomiasis, is a {{tropical}} parasitic disease caused by the protist Trypanosoma cruzi. It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change {{over the course of}} the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people.|$|E
5|$|Derek da Cunha has {{proposed}} that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, {{the large number of}} voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular vote. This was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the PAP garnered an average of 67.04% of the votes in a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and remained stable at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may be attributable to the <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus (obstruction of {{the flow}} of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid) may complicate SAH in both the short and long term. It is detected on CT scanning, on which there is <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles), or occasionally a permanent shunt. Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person's condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases.|$|E
