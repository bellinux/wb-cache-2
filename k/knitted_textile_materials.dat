Designing interactive textiles means communicating new expressional forms through <b>textile</b> <b>material.</b> This thesis aim {{to contribute to the}} exploration of designing interactive <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> with focus on linking interactive properties, especially visual and tactile, to different ways of expressing them. Design examples and experiments presented are meant to show new possibilities for designing <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> able to change structure, colour and temperature in different ways in response to environmental stimuli.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the Smart Textiles field opens possibilities for designers to combine traditional surface fabrication techniques with advanced technology in the design process. The purpose of this work is to develop knowledge on interactive <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> as <b>materials</b> for architecture {{and to do so}} through practice-based design research. The thesis formulates a research program in order to frame the design explorations, in which scale and material expression are major placeholders. Consequently, Relational Textiles for Space Design is defined as a research program with focus on surface aesthetics and the program is illustrated by design experiments exploring the expressiveness of light, heat and movement as design materials. As a result of the research presented in this thesis, a new methodological framework for interactive textile design is proposed. The framework defines field of reference and frame of reference as basic notions in surface design. These notions form a basic frame used to revise and present the methods behind the design examples Knitted Light, Touching Loops, Designing with Heat, Tactile Glow, Repetition and Textile Forms in Movement. Relating the space of Relational Textiles for Space Design to existing surface methodology in architecture gives rise to new issues that need to be addressed. For which levels of the design process will these textiles be integrated? The last chapter reflects on the role of Relational Textiles for Space Design as possible methods or expressions in the existing space of surface prototyping...|$|R
40|$|A scaled-up fiber wet-spinning {{production}} of electrically conductive and highly stretchable PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers is demonstrated {{for the first}} time. The PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers possess the mechanical properties appropriate for <b>knitting</b> various <b>textile</b> structures. The <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> exhibit strain sensing properties that were dependent upon the number of PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers used in <b>knitting.</b> The <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> show sensitivity (as measured by the gauge factor) that increases {{with the number of}} PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers deployed. A highly stable sensor response was observed when four PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers were co-knitted with a commercial Spandex yarn. The <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> sensor can distinguish different magnitudes of applied strain with cyclically repeatable sensor responses at applied strains of up to 160 %. When used in conjunction with a commercial wireless transmitter, the <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> responded well to the magnitude of bending deformations, demonstrating potential for remote strain sensing applications.

40|$|In {{this ongoing}} practise-based design {{research}} project, {{a new technique}} for designing textile patterns is developed and explored; a non chemical burn-out (ausbrenner) technique. As a {{first part of the}} project, experiments with conductive and traditional <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> in <b>knitted</b> structures were designed. The knitted samples were made in cotton, wool, viscose, polyester and Kevlar (Kevlar 2008), and have all been combined with Kanthal heating wires (Kanthal 2008). When a voltage is applied to the textile, the heating wire leaves burned out patterns in the <b>textile</b> <b>material.</b> The result is a new technique, where we can design irreversible textile patterns. We also suggest new design variables of relevance when designing dynamic textile patterns. The overall aim is to explore different materials, material combinations and techniques for developing textile circuits and designing dynamic <b>textile</b> patterns. The <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> patterns change over time when a voltage is turned on or off in the textile circuits...|$|R

40|$|LUX {{studies the}} {{combination}} of electronics and <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> from a textile design perspective. The thought of experiencing textiles without touching them sparked the idea of designing textiles where touch {{is essential for the}} visual appearance. The aim is to design <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> that light up when touched, in order to create an interactive experience for the viewer. Optical fibres were chosen because of their ability to transmit light and copper yarn works as an electrical conductor that triggers the reaction of light. The shapes of the <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> have been created by utilising the characteristics of the optical fibre. LUX introduces a working method in which the optical fibre is given an important role not only as a light source but also as a tool for shaping the textiles.

40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in seamless knitting technology are opening up signiﬁcant {{opportunities in the}} design, production and application of <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> preforms. Introduced in the mid 1990 ’s, seamless machinery enables shaped, 3 -dimensional knitted forms to be produced entirely by machine. While garment producers globally adopted the technology for its economic efficiencies, the standardised templates in the technology’s software have generally reduced the sophistication of designs produced. Although the signiﬁ cant unrealised potential in seamless technology is widely acknowledged, designers and manufacturers are facing diffi culties in understanding and integrating the complex technology into their practice. There remains a fundamental gap in knowledge and skills, {{in part due to}} a simpliﬁed and modular garment based user interface, which fronts a complex and sophisticated technology. Of the limited research in this area, most relates to garment shaping. More recently, we have started to see sophisticated applications of this technology in highly technical or artisanal design outcomes emerging from textile research centres. The design and production of <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> forms in 3 -dimensions, as opposed to the 2 -dimensional ﬂ at pattern and construction of the past, is a signiﬁcant conceptual shift for traditional textile design practice. Traditional craft and design practices are often disrupted by the emergence of new technologies. We believe that the disruption created by seamless knit technology has the potential to vastly change both the design and application of <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles,</b> moving <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> manufacturing up the value chain. This installation showcases the advanced capabilities of seamless knitting technology for innovative, 3 -dimensional form building and high-end design outcomes. The group submitting this proposal consists of a knitwear designer, <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> designer and <b>knit</b> technician. All are experienced in this ﬁeld, and will draw on current research and developments to work collaboratively in producing a collection of seamless knitted products that demonstrate unique shaping, 3 -dimensionality, pattern and texture.

40|$|As {{computational}} {{technology and}} new materials {{enter the world}} of textiles, our view on <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> is challenged. <b>Textile</b> interaction design suggests a new design space in which the fields of textile design and interaction design are merged. This work contributes {{to the introduction of}} <b>textiles</b> as <b>material</b> for interaction design and focuses on spatial and temporal design of the dynamic elements of textiles – the elements that enable interaction. The result is various interactive <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> examples which are meant to inspire new expressional uses of <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> thought of as slow, interacting hardware able to inhabit our everyday environments through responsive light, tactile connections, and informative decorations etc. Design experiments conducted within this thesis are framed by a research programme, which is set up as an initial guideline to explore visual and tactile interactive properties of <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles.</b> Together with practical knowledge, the result is a theoretical framework that frames essential features of an interactive textile design where the defined design variables introduce a way to formulate what it is we design when we design for dynamic elements. By introducing notions such as the potential and precision of interaction, design variables relating to both physical and programming design are derived from the design of the dynamic elements of a material. A retrospective analysis of the experiments in relation to four acknowledged interaction design dimensions establish a link between the fields of interaction design and textile design. This work is based on the design experiments Electrical Burnouts, Costumes and Wall Hanging, Touching Loops, Designing with Heat, Functional Styling, Repetition and Stretching Loops, where the implemented structures are seen both as materials for further design and examples meant to provide inspiration in a more general sense.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is to compute the effective in-plane tension and shear behaviour of textile-like elastic materials, that is, plates or shells with a periodic micro-structure composed of long woven or knitted fibres. The knitting or weaving results in multiple periodic contact between fibres. Mathematically the problem can be formulated as an in-plane elasticity problem defined in a heterogeneous domain with ε-periodic micro-structure, including multiple micro-contact between the structural components, which is described by the Signorini and Tresca-friction contact conditions. The asymptotic analysis and homogenized limit for such problems was recently obtained by Damlamian et al. via periodic unfolding strategy. These results are briefly recalled in the paper. The obtained two-scale algorithm is implemented for some specific <b>textile</b> <b>materials,</b> which are macroscopic shells with a 3 -D microstructure including contact. For each macroscopic deformation state, a contact problem in the periodicity cell or representative volume element is solved and the corresponding non-linear macroscopic stress–strain relation is obtained.
