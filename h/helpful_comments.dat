40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} concave compositions, an {{extension}} of partitions that were considered by Andrews, Rhoades, and Zwegers.

40|$|We {{describe}} an algebraic structure on chain complexes yielding algebraic models which classify homotopy types of Poincare duality complexes of dimension 4. Generalizing Turaev's fundamental triples of Poincare duality complexes of dimension 3, we introduce fundamental triples for Poincare duality complexes of dimension n > 2 {{and show that}} two Poincare duality complexes are orientedly homotopy equivalent {{if and only if}} their fundamental triples are isomorphic. As applications we establish a conjecture of Turaev and obtain a criterion for the existence of degree 1 maps between n-dimensional manifolds.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Linear RE models {{often have}} more than one {{dynamically}} stable solution. Consider, however, the requirement that the solution coefficients must be continuous in the model’s structural parameters. In particular, we require that the solutions should be continuous in the limit as those parameters, which express quantitatively the extent to which expectations affect endogenous variables, go to zero. The paper shows that under this condition there is, for a very broad class of linear RE models, only a single solution. � I am grateful to Seonghoon Cho, Robert Lucas, Albert Marcet, and Holger Sieg for <b>helpful</b> <b>comment...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{investigates the}} {{valuation}} effects of reinsurance purchases in a contingent claims framework. The comparative statics {{of the model}} suggest that, other things equal, the demand for reinsurance will be greater, 1) the higher the firm’s leverage, 2) the lower {{the correlation between the}} firm’s investment returns and claims costs, 3) for firms which write “longer tail ” lines of insurance, and 4) the more the firm concentrates its investments in tax-favored assets. These predictions are tested in an empirical analysis of the reinsurance behavior of U. S. property-liability insurance firms during the period 1980 - 1987. ‡Acknowledgments.
