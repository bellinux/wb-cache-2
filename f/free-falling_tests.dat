The main experiment on-board LISA Pathfinder {{is the so-called}} LISA Technology Package (LTP) which has the aim to measure the differential acceleration between two <b>free-falling</b> <b>test</b> masses with an accuracy of 3 x 10 (- 14) ms(- 2) Hz(- 1 / 2) between 1 mHz and 30 mHz. This measurement is performed interferometrically by the optical metrology system (OMS) on-board LISA Pathfinder. In this paper, we present {{the development of an}} experimental end-to-end testbed of the entire OMS. It includes the interferometer and its sub-units, the interferometer backend which is a phasemeter and the processing of the phasemeter output data.

At its present status it consists mainly of breadboard components. Some of those have already been replaced by engineering models of the LTP experiment.

Fluctuations in the temperature difference across the enclosure surrounding the <b>free-falling</b> <b>test</b> mass can produce noisy forces through several processes, including the radiometric effect, radiation pressure, and outgassing. We present here a detailed experimental investigation of thermal gradient-induced forces for the LISA gravitational wave mission and the LISA Pathfinder, employing high resolution torsion pendulum measurements of the torque on a LISA-like test mass suspended inside a prototype of the LISA gravitational reference sensor that will surround the test mass in orbit. The measurement campaign, accompanied by numerical simulations of the radiometric and radiation pressure effects, allows a more accurate and representative characterization of thermal-gradient forces in the specific geometry and environment relevant to LISA free-fall. The pressure dependence of the measured torques allows clear identification of the radiometric effect, in quantitative agreement with the model developed.

Because the satellite can't follow the two masses at the same time, the second mass must be forced to follow either the other one or the spacecraft. The actuation force applied to compensate this effect introduces a dominant source of force noise in the mission noise budget at frequency near and below the mHz. The free-fall mode actuation control scheme has been designed to suppress this noise source and avoid actuation instabilities: actuation is limited to brief periodic impulses, with test masses in free fall in between two kicks. This actuation-free motion is then analyzed for the remaining sources of acceleration ultra noise.

A series of tests was successfully conducted with <b>free-falling</b> trunks. The <b>tests</b> showed the behaviour of a rockfall protection system, also in comparison to similar rockfall events. Numerical simulations were performed to check performance against the field tests. It could be shown that barriers can be tested and designed for tree impacts according to similar rockfall impacts...|$|R
50|$|Originally an Armament Laboratory program codenamed Lazy Dog, the weapon's {{development}} involved Delco Products Corporation, F&F Mold and Die Works, Inc., Haines Designed Products, and Master Vibrator Company of Dayton. The {{project objective}} was to design and <b>test</b> <b>free-fall</b> missiles and their dispensing units for use in bombers and fighters. Lazy Dog anti-personnel missiles were designed to spray enemy troops with small projectiles with three times the force of standard air-burst bombs. The Armament Laboratory worked with the Flight Test Laboratory to conduct wind tunnel tests {{of a number of}} bomb shapes which design studies indicated to be the most efficient for stowage and release from high performance aircraft.|$|R
40|$|USA Pathfinder is a space mission {{dedicated}} to demonstrating {{technology for the}} Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). LISA is a joint ESA/NASA mission to detect low-frequency gravitational waves on the 0. 0001 to 0. 1 Hz frequency band. LISA is expected to observe 100 's of merging massive black hole binaries out z- 15, {{tens of thousands of}} close compact binary systems in the Milky Way, merging intermediate-mass black hole binaries, tens of stellar-mass black holes falling into supermassive black holes in galactic centers, and possibly other exotic sources. Several critical LISA technologies have not been demonstrated at the requisite level of performance. In spaceflight, and some fight hardware cannot be tested in a 1 -g environment. Hence, the LISA Pathfinder mission is being implemented to demonstrate these critical LISA technologies in a relevant flight environment. LISA Pathfinder mimics one arm of the LISA constellation by shrinking the 5 -million-kilometer armlength down to a few tens of centimeters. The experimental concept is to measure the relative separation between two test masses nominally following their own geodesics, and thereby determine the relative residual acceleration between them near 1 mHz, about a decade above the lowest frequency required by LISA. To implement such a concept, disturbances on the test masses must be kept very small by many design features, but chiefly by "drag-free" flight. A drag-free spacecraft follows a <b>free-falling</b> <b>test</b> mass which it encloses, but has no mechanical connection to. The spacecraft senses it's orientation and separation with respect to the proof mass, and its propulsion system is commanded to keep the spacecraft centered about the test mass. Thus, the spacecraft shields the test mass from most external influences, and minimizes the effect of force gradients arising from the spacecraft, and acting on the test mass. LISA Pathfinder will compare the geodesic of one test mass against that of the other. Only a metrology system based on interferometry can achieve the displacement sensitivity. Interferometers monitor the separation of both test masses with a sensitivity comparable to that required by LISA, and using the same technologies. LISA Pathfinder is scheduled to be launched {{in the first half of}} 1020 to a Lissajous orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrange point, L 1. In addition to a complete European technology package (the LISA Technology Package, or LTP), LISA Pathfinder will also carry thrusters and software, known as ST- 7, a part of NASA's New Millennium Program...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report the}} first {{results of the}} LISA Pathfinder {{in-flight}} experiment. The results demonstrate that two <b>free-falling</b> reference <b>test</b> masses, such as those needed for a space-based gravitational wave observatory like LISA, can be put in free fall with a relative acceleration noise with a square root of the power spectral density of 5. 2 ± 0. 1 [*][*]fm[*]s- 2 /Hz, or (0. 54 ± 0. 01) × 10 - 15 [*][*]g/Hz, with g the standard gravity, for frequencies between 0. 7 and 20  mHz. This value {{is lower than the}} LISA Pathfinder requirement by more than a factor 5 and within a factor 1. 25 of the requirement for the LISA mission, and is compatible with Brownian noise from viscous damping due to the residual gas surrounding the test masses. Above 60  mHz the acceleration noise is dominated by interferometer displacement readout noise at a level of (34. 8 ± 0. 3) [*][*]fm/Hz, about 2 orders of magnitude better than requirements. At f≤ 0. 5 [*][*]mHz we observe a low-frequency tail that stays below 12 [*][*]fm[*]s- 2 /Hz down to 0. 1  mHz. This performance would allow for a space-based gravitational wave observatory with a sensitivity close to what was originally foreseen for LISA...|$|R
