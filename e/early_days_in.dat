5|$|Astrid Kirchherr (born 20 May 1938) is a German {{photographer}} and artist and {{is well known}} for her association with the Beatles (along with her friends Klaus Voormann and Jürgen Vollmer), and her photographs of the band's original members – John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best – during their <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr {{worked as}} an advisor in 1994 on the film Backbeat, which portrayed Kirchherr, Sutcliffe and the Beatles during their <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Hamburg. She was {{impressed}} with Stephen Dorff (who played Sutcliffe in the film), commenting {{that he was the}} right age (19 years old at the time), and his gestures, the way he smoked, and talked were so like Sutcliffe's that she had goose pimples. Kirchherr was portrayed in the film by actress Sheryl Lee.|$|E

5|$|In rural Australia, meat ants are {{important}} to farmers as they place animal carcasses on their nests. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass will be consumed and reduced to bones. However, Iridomyrmex ants are sometimes considered pests, due to these ants entering human houses to feed on food and soil disturbance. Eradication of nests can be difficult, as nests can be repopulated from a rival colony or adjoining nests which were not affected. Particular species have adapted rather well to urbanisation; during the <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Canberra, newly constructed suburbs provided new nest sites for meat ants, and populations flourished. Other factors include plantations enriched with valuable food sources and home gardens. Workers also cause problems {{for those who are}} Citrus producers; they will affect the biological control of Hemiptera insects, specifically those who produce honeydew.|$|E
5|$|James Baird Weaver {{grew up on}} the Iowa frontier, and was {{involved}} with the Republican Party from its <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> the late 1850s. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the Union Army. Weaver saw action at the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh, and Resaca, and rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general. After the war, he continued to be active in Iowa Republican politics. Weaver sought nomination to the House of Representatives and the Governorship, but each time was defeated by candidates from the party's more conservative faction, led by William B. Allison. He campaigned for the Republican presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, but also attended the 1876 Greenback National Convention as an observer.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Chicago {{the following month}} and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York. Cleveland’s time {{on the national scene}} was brief, but Democrats hoped that his reputation as a reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and his reputation for scandal. They were correct, as reform-minded Republicans (called “Mugwumps”) denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. However, even as the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback Party, led by Benjamin F. Butler, Blaine’s antagonist from their <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> the House.|$|E

25|$|According to Percival Serle, Denison {{was a man}} of high {{character}} and a good administrator. In his <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Tasmania he spoke too frankly about the colonists in communications which he regarded as confidential, and this accentuated the feeling against him {{as a representative of the}} colonial office during the anti-transportation and responsible government movements. He showed great interest in the life of the colony, and helped to foster education, science and trade, during the period when Tasmania was developing into a prosperous colony. In New South Wales his task was easier, and he had no difficulty in coping adequately with the problems that arose during the early days of responsible government in Australia.|$|E

25|$|In 1999 {{there was}} talk of a reunion of the {{original}} lineup minus Howe. The original proposition included Dave Kilminster on guitar, who had previously toured and recorded with Wetton. While Howe was interested in participating, he was unable to because of his busy schedule with Yes. This reunion did not take place and John Payne continued to carry on Asia with Downes uninterrupted. Wetton and Palmer did, however, get together to form Qango, which included Kilminster and John Young, although the band was short-lived. Kilminster went on to work with Keith Emerson, The Nice and Roger Waters. In 2000, Geffen/Universal released a best-of entitled The Very Best of Asia: Heat of the Moment (1982–1990), which also included three rare B-sides from the <b>early</b> <b>days.</b> <b>In</b> May 2000 the band put out an all instrumentals album called Rare.|$|E

25|$|On May 31, 2011, DC Comics {{announced}} {{its plans to}} reboot its continuity and launch {{a new line of}} comics after that year's Flashpoint event. While the new Superman series portrays Superman's current adventures, Action Comics began its run telling the story of Superman's <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Metropolis. The story reintroduced many Golden Age concepts (Superman fighting political and social corruption, starting out with reduced powers, working at the Daily Star rather than the Daily Planet), and removed several aspects reintroduced in Secret Origin (Clark Kent and Lex Luthor as childhood friends, and his career as Superboy, though the Legion of Superheroes still played a part in Clark Kent's childhood). The story focuses on a young, social crusading Superman in a makeshift costume (shortly before acquiring the redesigned costume by Jim Lee), fending off the attacks of the Army and their consultant Dr. Lex Luthor, as well as contending with public fear resulting from his sudden appearance and defiance of the authorities.|$|E

C.K. released his sixth one hour special Live at The Comedy Store to his website in January 2015, which, unlike his past few specials, was recorded at a club, The Comedy Store in West Hollywood. C.K. said he intended the material as an exercise in creating an act that hearkened back to his <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> comedy clubs. The special premiered exclusively on FX on May 28, 2015.|$|E
