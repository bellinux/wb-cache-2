However, its use may be difficult when the process to be investigated is highly complex. The <b>EAR</b> <b>instrument</b> to be presented here is a method for valid ordinal measurement of political influence in complex decision-making at various levels. This assessment is based on triangulation: (1) political players’ own perception of their influence; (2) other players’ perceptions of the influence brought to bear; and (3) a process analysis by the researcher. The application of the instrument is illustrated by a case regarding the political influence of global NGOs on the Climate Convention.

40|$|Abstract Background The Uganda Hearing Project is a {{non-profit}} program assisting with teaching of ear surgery in Uganda. The project started with cadaveric temporal bone courses in 2003 and 2005, including donation of operating microscopes and <b>ear</b> <b>instruments.</b> In 2006, three surgical groups started regular surgical teaching visits. Methods A retrospective chart review {{of all cases}} of middle ear surgery performed in Uganda from 2003 to 2009. Surgeries by local surgeons without foreign presence were coded as ‘local’ and those performed with assistance of visiting surgeons were coded as ‘visitors’. Results In 2005, two middle ear surgeries using the operating microscope were done in the Ugandan teaching hospitals by Ugandan Otolaryngologists alone. From the onset of surgical visits in 2006, a total of 193 middle ear surgeries were performed - 115 tympanomastoidectomies, 77 tympanoplasties, and 1 cochlear implant. In 2006 (one surgical teaching visit), 6 middle ear surgeries were performed with visiting surgeon presence and 2 surgeries were performed by the local team alone. This increased in 2007 (2 visits) and again in 2008 (3 visits) to 34 cases with visiting surgeon presence and 48 local cases. Conclusions The temporal bone courses and donation of operating microscopes to Ugandan hospitals have revolutionized middle ear surgery in Uganda. The surgical visits by the Uganda Hearing Project {{have led to a}} 24 -fold increase in annual middle ear surgeries performed with the operating microscope by Ugandan Otolaryngologists. Increased frequency of surgical visits was correlated with an increase in local surgical output, hopefully resulting in improved care for Ugandans with ear disorders...|$|R

5000|$|Scalpelling is a {{body art}} {{procedure}} similar to body piercing {{for the creation of}} decorative perforations through the skin and other body tissue, and is most commonly used as a replacement for or enhancement of ear piercing. Whereas piercing is typically performed with a hollow piercing needle or an <b>ear</b> piercing <b>instrument,</b> scalpelling is performed by using a scalpel to cut a slit into the skin. Unlike dermal punching, no flesh is removed. The technique can immediately produce holes with a larger diameter than can be achieved by piercing. This is a more rapid means of accommodating larger gauge jewellery than stretching, a technique whereby piercings are enlarged by inserting gradually larger jewellery. Scalpelling is performed to quickly achieve a large-gauge piercing, when scar tissue is preventing further stretching, if tissue has thinned to the point where further stretching could cause it to break, or to combine two closely placed piercings into one hole.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used otoscopes—those used in emergency rooms, pediatric offices, general practice, and by internists- are monocular devices. They provide only a two-dimensional view of the ear canal, its contents, and usually at least {{a portion of the}} eardrum, depending on what is within the ear canal and its status. Another method of performing otoscopy (visualization of the ear) is use of a binocular microscope, in conjunction with a larger metal ear speculum, with the patient supine and the head tilted, which provides a much larger field of view and the added advantages of a stable head, far superior lighting, and most importantly, depth perception. A binocular (two-eyed) view is required in order to judge depth. If wax or another material obstructs the canal and/or a view of the entire eardrum, it can easily and confidently be removed with specialized suction tips and other microscopic <b>ear</b> <b>instruments,</b> whereas the absence of depth perception with the one-eyed view of a common otoscope makes removal of anything more laborious and hazardous. Another major advantage of the binocular microscope is that both of the examiner's hands are free, since the microscope is suspended from a stand. The microscope has up to 40x power magnification, which allows much more detailed viewing of the entire ear canal, and of the entire eardrum unless edema of the canal skin prevents it. Subtle changes in the anatomy are much more easily detected and interpreted than with a monocular view otoscope. Traditionally only ENT specialists (otolaryngologists) and otologists (subspecialty ear doctors) acquire binocular microscopes and the necessary skills and training to use them, and incorporate their routine use in evaluating patient's ear complaints. Studies have shown that reliance on a monocular otoscope to diagnose ear disease results in a more than 50% chance of misdiagnosis, as compared to binocular microscopic otoscopy. The expense of acquiring a binocular microscope is only one obstacle to its being more widely adapted to general medicine. The low level of familiarity with binocular otoscopy among pediatric and general medicine professors in physician training programs is probably a more difficult obstacle to overcome. Thus, the standard of general otologic diagnosis and ear care remains, for the most part, the largely antiquated monocular otoscope.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{portable}} ultra {{wide band}} radio direction finder has been constructed {{based on the}} principle of stereophonic direction recognition of sound by human <b>ears.</b> The <b>instrument</b> consists of two log periodic antennas having identical electrical properties. They are positioned in a plane, preferably parallel to the ground. The directivities of the antennas are aligned at slightly different directions with respect to each other. Their output powers are compared at the source frequency for the respective polarizations. The back lobes of the antennas have been reduced by symmetrically positioning two metallic plates (reflectors) behind the antennas. The antennas, reflectors and a compass are mounted over a video camera stand such that they could be manually positioned in the azimuth. Since the antennas are of identical make, ideally the radiation pattern of either antenna-reflector combination should behave as a flipped image of the other set. For any particular polarization and frequency, the outputs from the antennas are compared with each other. The antenna assembly is rotated between 0 and 360 ◦ in the azimuth until the power difference gets minimized. This position relates to the direction of the source and is indicated on the compass, provided there exits a single radio source at that frequency. 256 Joardar et al. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{potential}} {{routes of}} BLV transmission exist. Transmission through procedures that transmit blood between {{animals such as}} gouge dehorning, vaccination and <b>ear</b> tagging with <b>instruments</b> or needles that are not changed or disinfected between animals is a significant means of BLV spread. Rectal palpation with common sleeves poses a risk that is increased by inexperience and increased frequency of palpation.

[...] Embryo transfer and artificial insemination also account for {{a small number of}} new infections as long as common equipment and/or palpation sleeves are not used. While transmission has been documented via blood feeding insects, the significance of this risk is unclear. The bottom line appears to be that transmission relies primarily on the transfer of infected lymphocytes from one animal to the next and that BLV positive animals with lymphocytosis are more likely to provide a source for infection.|$|R

However, the results of recent research have suggested that may be because of its role in attentional control. In the present experiment, the authors inves-tigated that hypothesis by using an attentional interference task with musical stimuli. Lis-teners were asked to monitor one ear for either a clarinet or violin tone and to ignore any information in the other ear. On some of the trials, they heard only one tone and on other trials, either the same <b>instrument</b> in both <b>ears</b> or different <b>instruments.</b> Individual differ-ences were measured in working memory and musical experience.

5000|$|CAVEAT The {{petition}} of Antonio Meucci, of Clifton, in the County of Richmond and State of New York, respectfully represents:That he {{has made}} certain improvements in Sound Telegraphs, ... The following is {{a description of the}} invention, sufficiently in detail {{for the purposes of this}} caveat. I employ the well-known conducting effect of continuous metallic conductors as a medium for sound, and increases the effect by electrically insulating both the conductor and the parties who are communicating. It forms a Speaking Telegraph, without the necessity for any hollow tube. I claim that a portion or the whole of the effect may also be realized by a corresponding arrangement with a metallic tube. I believe that some metals will serve better than others, but propose to try all kinds of metals. The system on which I propose to operate and calculate consists in isolating two persons, separated at considerable distance from each other, by placing them upon glass insulators; employing glass, for example, at the foot of the chair or bench on which each sits, and putting them in communication by means of a telegraph wire. I believe it preferable to have the wire of larger area than that ordinarily employed in the electric telegraph, but will experiment on this. Each of these persons holds to his mouth an instrument analogous to a speaking trumpet, in which the word may easily be pronounced, and the sound concentrated upon the wire. Another instrument is also applied to the ears, in order to receive the voice of the opposite party. All these, to wit, the mouth utensil and the <b>ear</b> <b>instruments,</b> communicate to the wire at a short distance from the persons. The ear utensils being of a convex form, like a clock glass, enclose the whole exterior part of the ear, and make it easy and comfortable for the operator. The object is to bring distinctly to the hearing the word of the person at the opposite end of the telegraph. [...] To call attention, the party at the other end of the line may be warned by an electric telegraph signal, or a series of them. The apparatus for this purpose, and the skill in operating it, need be much less than for the ordinary telegraphing. When my sound telegraph is in operation, the parties should remain alone in their respective rooms, and every practicable precaution should be taken to have the surroundings perfectly quiet. The closed mouth utensil or trumpet, and the enclosing the persons also in a room alone, both tend to prevent undue publicity to the communication. I think it will be easy, by these means, to prevent the communication being understood by any but the proper persons. It may be found practicable to work with the person sending the message insulated, and with the person receiving it, in the free electrical communication with the ground. Or these conditions may possibly be reversed and still operate with some success. Both the conductors or utensils for mouth and ears should be, in fact I must say must be, metallic, and be so conditioned as to be good conductors of electricity. I claim as my invention, and desire to have considered as such, for all the purposes of this Caveat, The new invention herein set forth in all its details, combinations, and sub-combinations. And more especially, I claim First. A continuous sound conductor electrically insulated. Second. The same adapted for telegraphing by sound or for conversation between distant parties electrically insulated. [...] Third. The employment of a sound conductor, which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound between distant points. Fourth. The same in combination with provisions for electrically insulating the sending and receiving parties. Fifth. The mouthpiece or speaking utensil in combination with an electrically insulating conductor. Sixth. The ear utensils or receiving vessels adapted to apply upon the ears in combination with an electrically insulating sound conductor. Seventh. The entire system, comprising the electrical and sound conductor, insulated and furnished with a mouthpiece and ear pieces at each end, adapted to serve as specified.
