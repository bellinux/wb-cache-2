25|$|The {{first steps}} in {{understanding}} glycolysis {{began in the}} nineteenth century with the wine industry. For economic reasons, the French wine industry sought to investigate why wine sometime turned distasteful, instead of fermenting into alcohol. French scientist Louis Pasteur researched this issue during the 1850s, and the results of his experiments began the long road to elucidating the pathway of glycolysis. His experiments showed that fermentation occurs by the action of living microorganisms; and that yeast's <b>glucose</b> <b>consumption</b> decreased under aerobic conditions of fermentation, in comparison to anaerobic conditions (the Pasteur Effect).|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of mild {{hypothermia}} may be vague, with sympathetic {{nervous system}} excitation (shivering, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, fast respiratory rate, and contraction of blood vessels). These are all physiological responses to preserve heat. Increased urine production due to cold, mental confusion, and hepatic dysfunction may also be present. Hyperglycemia may be present, as <b>glucose</b> <b>consumption</b> by cells and insulin secretion both decrease, and tissue sensitivity to insulin may be blunted. Sympathetic activation also releases glucose from the liver. In many cases, however, especially in alcoholic patients, hypoglycemia {{appears to be a}} more common presentation. Hypoglycemia is also found in many hypothermic patients, because hypothermia may be a result of hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|The brain {{does not}} store glucose, its {{primary source of}} energy. When neurons become active, getting {{them back to their}} {{original}} state of polarization requires actively pumping ions across the neuronal cell membranes, in both directions. The energy for those ion pumps is mainly produced from glucose. More blood flows in to transport more glucose, also bringing in more oxygen in the form of oxygenated hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. This is from both a higher rate of blood flow and an expansion of blood vessels. The blood-flow change is localized to within 2 or 3mm of where the neural activity is. Usually the brought-in oxygen is more than the oxygen consumed in burning glucose (it is not yet settled whether most <b>glucose</b> <b>consumption</b> is oxidative), and this causes a net decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb) in that brain area's blood vessels. This changes the magnetic property of the blood, making it interfere less with the magnetization and its eventual decay induced by the MRI process.|$|E
30|$|Next, to {{investigate}} biochemical influences, glycometabolism and {{damage to the}} cytomembrane were assessed for the 10  kPa air-jet application, which never caused the peeling off of cells. The condition without the air-jet application {{was defined as the}} control. Generally, cells consume glucose and convert it into lactate in glycometabolism. Therefore, the concentration changes of both glucose and lactate in culture media were quantified during a 1 -day culturing after the air-jet application (Fig.  6 d, e). As a result, we saw no differences in the <b>glucose</b> <b>consumptions</b> and lactate productions between the control and air-jet application conditions. The released concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also quantified to assess damage to the cytomembrane, because LDH is normally located in the cytoplasm and released through a damaged cytomembrane (Fig.  6 f). The LDH release from cells showed {{no significant difference between the}} control and air-jet application conditions. Therefore, these results suggested that there were no influences on the cells during the wettability assessment in comparison with the control condition.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Information {{processing}} in {{the brain}} requires large amounts of metabolic energy, the spatial distribution of which is highly heterogeneous, reflecting the complex activity patterns in the mammalian brain. Results In this study, it was found, based on empirical data, that despite this heterogeneity, the volume-specific cerebral glucose metabolic rate of many different brain structures scales with brain volume with almost the same exponent: around - 0. 15. The exception is white matter, the metabolism of which seems to scale with a standard specific exponent of - 1 / 4. The scaling exponents for the total oxygen and <b>glucose</b> <b>consumptions</b> {{in the brain}} in relation to its volume are identical, at 0. 86 ± 0. 03, which is significantly larger than the exponents 3 / 4 and 2 / 3 that have been suggested for whole body basal metabolism on body mass. Conclusion These findings show explicitly that in mammals: (i) volume-specific scaling exponents of the cerebral energy expenditure in different brain parts are approximately constant (except brain stem structures), and (ii) the total cerebral metabolic exponent against brain volume {{is greater than the}} much-cited Kleiber's 3 / 4 exponent.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} magnesium (Mg 2 +) ion uptake by Chlorella vulgaris under mixotrophic {{growth conditions}} (10 g/L of glucose) in a stirred photo-bioreactor. The culture nitrate and <b>glucose</b> <b>consumptions</b> were followed and analyzed during the experiments. The cellular chlorophyll α concentration decreased during exponential growth, indicating an adaptation to heterotrophic metabolism. The partition of magnesium partitioned between the culture medium, the cell surface {{and within the}} cells was determined throughout the experiment. A clear relationship between the microalgal concentration and Mg 2 + ion removal-extent from the medium was observed. The removal rate was faster during mixotrophic growth than autotrophic growth and {{was related to the}} higher biomass production under the latter culture conditions. The Mg 2 + concentration per gram of dry biomass was 3. 44 mg/g under heterotrophic conditions and 6. 0 mg/g under autotrophic growth. At the end of the experiment (330 h), 90 % of the initial magnesium (17. 7 mg/L) in the medium was associated with the biomass, of which 4 % was adsorbed and 86 % absorbed by cells. This study was consistent with the kinetic model based on a reversible first-order reaction for Mg 2 + bioaccumulation in C. vulgaris. Mixotrophic growth conditions can be used at industrial scale to increase both the speed and the extent of Mg 2 + uptake by the microalgal...|$|R

After obtaining informed consent, the subjects received 60 g (2 serving) one of the four types of traditional breads (Sangak, Taftoon, Barbari, Lavash) in four visits. Blood samples were collected before and 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after beginning of eating. 24 -hour dietary recalls were obtained at the first, middle and end of the study.
