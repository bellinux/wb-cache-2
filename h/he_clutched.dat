500|$|Skelton's {{first major}} post-television {{recognition}} came in 1978, when the Golden Globe Awards named {{him as the}} recipient for their Cecil B. DeMille Award, which is given to honor outstanding contributions in entertainment.

When he was presented with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Governor's Award in 1986, Skelton received a standing ovation.

2500|$|Beginning in 1977 Sheen [...] "underwent {{a series}} of {{surgeries}} that sapped his strength and even made preaching difficult."

2500|$|By 1978, Wood's {{depression}} had worsened, {{and he and}} {{his wife}} Kathy had become alcoholics.

60|$|He {{has taken}} old Beer's second son; and now <b>he</b> <b>clutches</b> {{at the old}} man himself; then across the street to Gentleman Jan, his eldest: but he is driven out from both houses by {{chloride}} of lime and peat dust, and the colony of the Beers has peace awhile.|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} Mr. Harding {{sees the}} letter in its light blue envelope lying on the supper table. It has been lying right beside him for ten minutes. Everybody in the theater could see it and was getting uncomfortable about it. <b>He</b> <b>clutches</b> it and tears it open. There is a hunted look in {{his face as he}} reads.|$|R

60|$|With {{one hand}} <b>he</b> <b>clutched</b> at the hand-rail, then with both. For {{a moment the}} two men stood swaying.

60|$|But how Lomenie felt {{to see his}} cockatrice-egg (so {{essential}} to the salvation of France) broken in this premature manner, let readers fancy!
