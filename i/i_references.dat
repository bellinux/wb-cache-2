40|$|Background: Public health {{monitoring}} is commonly undertaken {{in social media}} but has never been combined with data analysis from electronic health records. This study aimed to investigate {{the relationship between the}} emergence of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) in social media and their appearance in a large mental health database. Methods: Insufficient numbers of mentions of other NPS in case records meant that the study focused on mephedrone. Data were extracted on the number of mephedrone (<b>i)</b> <b>references</b> in the clinical record at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK, (ii) mentions in Twitter, (iii) related searches in Google and (iv) visits in Wikipedia. The characteristics of current mephedrone users in the clinical record were also established. Results: Increased activity related to mephedrone searches in Google and visits in Wikipedia preceded a peak in mephedrone-related references in the clinical record followed by a spike in the other 3 data sources in early 2010, when mephedrone was assigned a ‘class B’ status. Features of current mephedrone users widely matched those from community studies.

40|$|Sexual script theorists present sexual {{encounters}} as learned interactions that follow predictable sequences or ‘scripts’. Feminist research on heterosexual negotiation uses self-report data {{to argue that}} these scripts are gendered such {{that it is difficult}} for women to refuse unwanted sex. In this paper, we suggest that, notwith-standing claims made for script theory as a form of social constructionism, it incorporates individualistic and cognitive assumptions that ignore the social context in which self-report data are produced. Illustrating our argument with our own data from young women in focus group discussions talking about refusing unwanted sex, we provide an alternative theoretical perspective on this kind of self-report data, drawn from Edwards’ (1995, 1997) concept of ‘script formulations’. In particular, we show how the ‘scripted’ quality of sexual interaction is actively produced as part of speakers’ orientation to issues of accountability. We describe five devices used to construct {{sexual encounters}} as scripted: (<b>i)</b> <b>references</b> to predictable stages; (ii) references to common knowledge; (iii) the production of consensus through seamless turn-taking and collaborative talk; (iv) the use of hypothetical and general instances; (v) active voicing. Through the use of script formulations, young women present the difficulty of saying no to unwanted sex as normatively difficult—as a commonplace, ordinary problem—such that they cannot be held accountable for their own specific difficulties, nor can negative dispositional attributes be made on that basis. Finally, we consider the differing implications of ‘script’ and ‘script formulation’ theories in working with young women to prevent unwanted sex...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This {{survey was}} {{designed}} to conduct the first nationwide dietary exposure assessment on hazardous substances including the intakes of functional food and herbal medicine. In this paper, we introduced the survey design {{and the results of}} the dietary exposure status and internal exposure levels of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg). Methods: We selected 4867 subjects of all ages throughout Korea. We conducted a food survey, dietary survey, biomonitoring, and health survey. Results: Pb and Cd were the highest (median value) in the seaweed (94. 2 μg/kg for Pb; 594 μg/kg for Cd), and Hg was the highest in the fish (46. 4 μg/kg). The dietary exposure level (median value) of Pb was 0. 14 μg/kg body weight (bw) /d, 0. 18 μg/kg bw/d for Cd, and 0. 07 μg/kg bw/d for Hg. Those with a blood Pb level of less than 5. 00 μg/dL (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reference value for those 1 to 5 years of age) were 99. 0 % of all the subjects. Those with a blood Cd level with less than 0. 30 μg/L (German Federal Environmental Agency, reference value for non-smoking children) were 24. 5 %.

40|$|Several conserved and/or gauge {{invariant}} quantities {{described as}} the second-order curvature perturbation have been given in the literature. We revisit various scenarios for the generation of second-order non-gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation ζ, employing {{for the first time}} a unified notation and focusing on the normalisation f_NL of the bispectrum. When the classical curvature perturbation first appears a few Hubble times after horizon exit, |f_NL| is much less than 1 and is, therefore, negligible. Thereafter ζ (and hence f_NL) is conserved as long as the pressure is a unique function of energy density (adiabatic pressure). Non-adiabatic pressure comes presumably only from the effect of fields, other than the one pointing along the inflationary trajectory, which are light during inflation (`light non-inflaton fields'). During single-component inflation f_NL is constant, but multi-component inflation might generate |f_NL| ∼ 1 or bigger. Preheating can affect f_NL only in atypical scenarios where it involves light non-inflaton fields. The curvaton scenario typically gives f_NL≪ - 1 or f_NL = + 5 / 4. The inhomogeneous reheating scenario can give a wide range of values for f_NL. Unless there is a detection, observation can eventually provide a limit |f_NL| 1, at which level it will be crucial to calculate the precise observational limit using second order theory.

40|$|Current {{information}} indicates that, {{regardless of}} location, American assets and citizens {{will continue to}} be targets of terrorist activities. Terrorists have demonstrated their willingness to employ nontraditional weapons to achieve their ends. One such class of nontraditional weapons is radiological/nuclear (RN) devices. RN devices pose new challenges to both law enforcement (LE) and public health (PH) officials in their efforts to minimize the effects of a RN attack, prevent or stop additional attacks, attribute the attack to the perpetrators, and apprehend those responsible for it. In the past, it was not uncommon for LE and PH officials to conduct separate and independent investigations. However, a RN attack requiresa high level of cooperation between these two disciplines to achieve their respective objectives of minimizing public panic and radiation exposure, preventing the spread of radioactive contamination, identifying the per- petrators, and apprehending/prosecuting those responsible for the attack. The lack of mutual awareness and understanding, as well as the absence of established communication procedures, could hinder the effectiveness of separate, but often overlapping, LE and PH investigations. The effective use of all resources will be critical to an efficient and appropriate response to any terrorist RN attack.

Some correspondence of Edith Neumann with non-family members, in Subseries 2 of Series <b>I,</b> <b>references</b> the nine years the couple spent in Palestine. Information on Edith Neumann will be found throughout this collection. The majority of documents date from the time following the death of her husband. Series I holds many papers originating from her, including personal and official papers, correspondence, papers relating to her professional life, and financial papers. Items that document Edith Neumann's daily activities, such as calendars and cash books with monthly financial information, comprise Series III. Photographs of Edith Neumann, including of significant events and with others, will be found in Series IV. Documentation of Edith Neumann's philanthropic work, including mention of donations she made, will be found in several areas of the collection, including Subseries 1 of Series I as well as in Subseries 2 of Series III. Papers of other family members are placed in several areas of the collection, but will primarily be found in Series II: Family Papers. The individual subseries of this series are formed of the papers of Edith Neumann's husband Frederick, her sister Hanna Spitzer, her parents-in-law Jakob and Antonie Neumann, and the papers of other Spitzer and Neumann family members. Other papers of Frederick Neumann include correspondence with his wife, which is located in Subseries 2 of Series I. Correspondence with Frederick Neumann while he was performing missionary work in Yugoslavia in the mid- 1930 s is located in Subseries 2 of Series I (letters sent to his wife) and in Subseries 3 of Series II (letters sent from his parents in Vienna). Additional locations of documentation pertaining to Hanna Spitzer include her recipes, found among the index cards of Subseries 1 of Series III, and her collected View-Master reels, with the visual material in Series IV. Material on Alfred Spitzer and his art collection include a brief biography of him among the memoirs and notes of Series I, Subseries 1 and in the papers of Subseries 4 of Series III. A small amount of material on restitution will also be found in various locations in the collection. Three folders of correspondence with Edith Neumann related to restitution are in Subseries 4 of Series I. Restitution correspondence and documentation pertaining to Friedrich Neumann will be found in Subseries 1 of Series II, and similar material for Hanna Spitzer is located in Subseries 2 of that same series. Austrian Heritage CollectionEdith Neumann was born Editha Spitzer in Vienna on May 26, 1902, the youngest child of the lawyer and art collector Alfred Spitzer and his wife Hermine. She had an elder sister named Hanna (Hansi). Her father invested in the work of artists such as Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka. Edith Spitzer studied chemistry and physics at the University of Vienna and received her doctorate in 1927; at that time she was the only woman studying such subjects there. Alfred Spitzer died in the spring of 1923. In 1924 she converted to Christianity, and in May 1925 became engaged to Friedrich (often referred to by Austrian friends and family as Fritz) Neumann, who was also a Christian convert. They met {{at a meeting of the}} Swedish Society for the Conversion of Jews to Christianity. Two years later, upon completing her doctorate, the couple was married on October 3, 1927. Frederick Neumann was a student of the philosopher Martin Heidegger. Edith supported them while Friedrich Neumann continued his studies, eventually gaining a reputation as a biblical scholar. In 1934 Friedrich went to Zagreb, Yugoslavia, where he worked as a missionary, and was later joined by Edith. Two years later they returned to Vienna. In 1938 the couple, fearing the arrest of Friedrich Neumann, fled Vienna via the Danube, travelling for a month through Zagreb, northern Italy, and Paris before finally arriving in London with the help of the British Society. While there they studied English until the Society offered Friedrich Neumann missionary work in Haifa, Israel. In 1948 the Neumanns immigrated to the United States, where they settled in New York. Edith Neumann had lost thirty-four family members due to Nazi persecution, and was able to bring a portion of her father's art collection with her when she came to the U. S. Friedrich, now Frederick (often referred to by American friends as Fred) Neumann became the pastor of the Bushwick Congregational Church in Brooklyn, a position he remained at until his death. Edith Neumann worked as a bacteriologist at the Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn, then received a position as microbiologist at Maimonides Hospital, remaining there for the next 20 years. After the death of Frederick Neumann in 1967, Edith Neumann moved to Manhattan and took a job as medical director of the Jetti Katz Clinical Laboratory. In 1982 she retired at the age of eighty. Among the work she was involved in following her retirement was the publication and translation into German of her husband's sermons. In 1983 she established the Frederick Neumann Memorial Lecture at Princeton Theological Seminary. Edith Neumann donated several paintings from her father's collection to the Oesterreichische Galerie in Vienna and further two more paintings by Kokoschka and Schiele to the Graphische Sammlung Albertina. In honor of her donations and work as a scientist, she was given the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art First Class in 1998. The rest of the artwork that Edith Neumann inherited from her father was donated to Bard College. Edith Neumann died on June 29, 2002 at the age of one hundred years old. digitize...|$|E
40|$|Traditional beer {{fermentation}} is a {{batch process}} in which an amount of yeast cells are suspended in the wort. The fermentation process usually takes five to ten days for complete attenuation. To increase the productivity, several strategies could be adopted, such as increasing the fermentation temperature, increased agitation, the application of continuous fermentation, the use of immobilised yeast, or a combination. However, these variables have a pronounced influence on beer flavour and on the physiology of the yeast. Another promising strategy may be to enhance the amount of suspended yeast cells in the batch fermenter, as this has beenproven effective in decreasing the fermentation time without major deleterious influences on beer quality. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} work was to contribute to a more systematic and complete understanding of the yeast physiology in relation to flavour formation upon so-called high cell density (HCD) fermentations. First of all, the response of different lager yeast strains to the HCD fermentation conditions was investigated. The results pointed out that the rate of fermentation was 2 - 4 times increased when high initial cell levels were used. High viabilities for all yeasts were observed throughout the fermentations. Except for diacetyl, the cell density had only an moderate influence on the flavour profile. Furthermore, yeast strain specific characteristics could not be overlooked as they determined the sensitivity of the yeast to the application of higher cell densities. As the oxygen availability decreased when higher yeast concentrations were pitched, the build-up of unsaturated fatty acids in the initial phase of the fermentation was repressed, and consequently, lower yeast growth rates were obtained. The expression levels of the genes HSP 104 and HSP 12 and the concentration of trehalose were higher with increased pitching rates, suggesting a moderate exposure to stress in case of higher cell concentrations. Though, the viability and the vitality of the yeast population were not affected. With exception of totaldiacetyl and the limited aerobic formation of essential membrane lipids, these results demonstrate that most aspects of the yeast physiology and flavour balance were not negatively affected when the pitching rate was changed. The decreased yeast net growth observed in HCD fermentations can have anegative impact on the physiological stability throughout subsequent yeast generations. Therefore, the use of different oxygen conditions was investigated to improve the growth yield during HCD fermentations. The results showed that increasing the oxygen supply to the yeast, by means ofpreoxygenation or intensive wort oxygenation, stimulated the build-up of essential membrane lipids essential for yeast growth. Wort oxygenationhad a significant decreasing effect on the formation of esters, which was caused by a decreased expression of ATF 1, compared with the other conditions. Lower glycogen and trehalose levels at the end of fermentation were observed in case of the HCD fermentations with oxygenated wort. Next to this, oxidative stress markers (CTT 1 and SOD 1) were induced in case of oxygenated wort, but this had no effect on the viability. However, repetitive exposure to too high concentrations of oxygen is known to be deleterious for the yeast viability. Therefore, optimum oxygen levels for HCD fermentations are needed through the application of yeast preoxygenation in combination with wort aeration. Preoxygenation increased the extent of growth without significantly affecting the yeast physiology, and was selected for further research. Next, successive fermentations of HCD populations were evaluated. It was shown that preoxygenating the yeast was essential for the yeast physiological stability and beer flavour compound consistency of high cell density fermentations during the process of serial repitching. In contrast,the use of non-preoxygenated yeast resulted in inadequate growth, whichcaused insufficient yield of biomass to repitch all eight generations, a decrease in viability, a moderate increase of yeast age, and a dramatic increase of the unwanted flavour compounds acetaldehyde and total diacetyl during the sequential fermentations. Therefore, in order to achievesustainable HCD fermentations throughout serial repitching, adequate yeast growth turned out to be essential. The combination of HCD and high gravity brewing (HGB) was investigated. It was shown that HGB exerted an extra source of stress upon the yeast cells in HCD populations. It was postulated that increased osmotic stress and ethanol stress, as a result of HGB, induced the expression of stress related genes (e. g., GPD 1, HSP 12, SSA 3, and CTT 1) and also triggered higher trehalose levels. Notonly the wort density, but also the relative proportion of sugars dramatically influenced the yeast fermentation performance. As sucrose fully activated the cAMP/PKA signal pathway, stress resistance decreased, lowering the viability of the yeast populations. Hence, it was suggested that the use of sucrose should be restricted to maintain a healthy yeast population. In addition, it was shown that optimisation of the wort FAN content clearly reduced the residual amount of total diacetyl in the HCD beers. Finally, pilot-scale fermentation trials showed that HCD beers could beproduced with similar characteristics as conventionally brewed beers. In conclusion, provided that an appropriate yeast strain is used and that the oxygen supply and wort composition are optimised, HCD fermentations do not negatively affect the yeast physiology and can produce beer ofacceptable quality with great time savings.
