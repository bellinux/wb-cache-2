In spite of the years that have passed and his many successes, the Phantom still longs {{to be reunited with}} her ("Til I Hear You Sing").

When the Phantom confronts her with his suspicions regarding Gustave's paternity, Christine confesses that the child is indeed his son, prompting the Phantom to vow that all his life's work will henceforth be for Gustave ("The Phantom Confronts Christine"). Unbeknownst to them, Madame Giry has overheard their conversation and is enraged, fearing that everything she and Meg have done for the Phantom over the years has been for nothing, as Gustave will be the sole beneficiary of his wealth and property.|$|E
