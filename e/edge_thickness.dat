2500|$|In its {{original}} form, iMac G3 had a gumdrop or egg-shaped look, with a CRT monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, translucent plastic case, which was refreshed early {{on with a}} sleeker design notable for its slot-loaded optical drive. The second major revision, iMac G4, moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an LCD monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, iMac G5 and the Intel iMac respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only {{up and down on}} a simple metal base. The fifth major revision (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used anodized aluminum and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the SuperDrive, and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an <b>edge</b> <b>thickness</b> of 5.9mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup, and includes solid-state drive (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple Fusion Drive, a hybrid of solid state and hard disk drives. This version of iMac was announced in October 2012, with the [...] version released in November and the [...] version in December; these were refreshed in September 2013, with new Haswell processors, faster graphics, faster and larger SSD options and 802.11ac Wi-Fi cards.|$|E

50|$|Identification of {{carnival}} glass is frequently difficult. Many manufacturers {{did not include}} a maker's mark on their product, and some did for only part of the time they produced the glass. Identifying carnival glass involves matching patterns, colors, sheen, <b>edges,</b> <b>thickness,</b> and other factors from old manufacturer's trade catalogs, other known examples, or other reference material. Since many manufacturers produced close copies of their rivals' popular patterns, carnival glass identification can be challenging even for an expert.|$|R

50|$|Index {{can improve}} the lens thinness, but at a point no more {{improvement}} will be realized.

This is also true with aspheric design lenses.|$|E
50|$|In a {{residential}} setting, solid surface {{can be used}} as kitchen countertops, bathroom vanity tops, and shower and tub surrounds.

50|$|Another {{factor is}} {{spectacle}} frame selection. Large eyesize fashion frames are impractical.

Furthermore, it was also reported recently that this method fails, when the knife-edges are made from pure materials. The artifacts introduced in the reconstructed beam shape and position depend strongly on the edge and input beam parameters, because the knife-edge is excited by the incoming beam. Here we show, that the actual beam shape and spot size of tightly focused beams can still be derived from knife-edge measurements for pure edge materials and different <b>edge</b> <b>thicknesses</b> by adapting the analysis method of the experimental data {{taking into account the}} interaction of the beam with the edge.

The results were positive, with Jones commenting that the X-4's flight qualities had been greatly improved, and the aircraft did not have pitch control problems up to a speed of Mach 0.92.|$|E

50|$|Once {{process and}} tool have been developed, {{precision}} glass moulding {{has a great}} advantage over conventionalproduction techniques. The majority of the lens quality characteristics are tool-bound. This means that lenses, whichare pressed with the same tool and process, usually have only insignificantly small deviations. For example, an important characteristic of a lens is {{the form of the}} optical surface. In the case of aspherical lenses the measurement of optical surfaces is very difficult and connected to high efforts. Additionally, when working with tactile measurement systems there is always a risk that the optical surface might be scratched. For precision moulded lenses such measurements are only necessary for a small amount of sample lenses in order to qualify the tool. The series production can then be executed without further need for measurements. In this case, only the cleanliness of the optical surface has to be monitored. Another advantage is that the lens' center thickness can be estimated from the easily measurable <b>edge</b> <b>thickness</b> or by applying a contactless measurement system.|$|E

40|$|The {{installation}} {{and operation of}} hydrokinetic turbines in riverine habitats may impact local and migratory fish populations. One of the primary concerns associated with hydrokinetic projects {{is the potential for}} fish to be struck and injured or killed by turbine blades. To address this issue, we conducted laboratory evaluations of turbine blade strike mortality and fish entrainment through hydrokinetic turbines. The blade strike studies were conducted with trout and sturgeon and evaluated survival and injury for various fish lengths, blade leading <b>edge</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> and strike velocities. The resulting data set allows for blade strike mortality rates to be estimated for most teleost species and sturgeons {{for a wide range of}} turbine designs and operating conditions for both conventional hydro and hydrokinetic units. Flume testing with three hydrokinetic turbine designs provided survival and behavioral data for fish approaching and passing through the blade sweep of each unit. These tests included an evaluation of white sturgeon juveniles with an axial-flow, ducted turbine. The results of these studies have produced valuable data that can be used to assess the potential for sturgeon to be entrained and injured when encountering hydrokinetic turbines in the field...|$|R

5000|$|Modern beveled {{glass is}} machine made. The {{automation}} of this traditionally hand made craft was {{facilitated by the}} development of plastic based metal deburring wheels which provided adequate smoothing of the ground glass face without the difficulties involved with traditional aluminum oxide and natural sandstone smoothing stones. The best natural smoothing stones came from a quarry in Newcastle, England and would be round wheels with a central hole several feet in diameter and 8" [...] thick. The stone's quality was dictated by the consistency of the sandstone, as any imperfection would scratch the glass being smoothed. These large stones would smooth the rough scratches created by the grinding process. The type of grinding and smoothing equipment depended upon whether one was creating straight line, outside or inside curved bevels. Outside curves and straight lines are ground on a flat rotating platter covered in a thin slurry of silicon carbide and water. Inside curves were ground on a silicon carbide grinding wheel of appropriate grit with water running on the wheel. Smoothing the ground face was done using the Newcastle stone for outside curves and straight line bevels and a cone shaped polishing wheel of relatively fine grit aluminum oxide. Despite the advantages of the plastic smoothing wheels, the crispness of the bevel edge is superior on the stone smoothed traditionally beveled pieces and can distinguish hand made beveled glass. The final step was polishing the beveled face using a felt covered wheel with a slurry of water and optical polishing powder. It was not uncommon to have pieces with a combination of outside and inside curve as well as straight line bevels. The objective was to have an even bevel width, even <b>edge</b> <b>thickness</b> with no facets in the bevel face and a crisp bevel edge. In the early 1900s in USA it was not uncommon to see beveled oval door glass 5' in length with 2" [...] wide bevels on 3/8" [...] thick plate glass. Creating such bevels required two craftsmen working as a team.|$|E

Experiments were performed for a core nozzle trailing <b>edge</b> <b>thickness</b> between 0. 38 mm and 3. 17 mm.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{successful}} {{design of}} high-lift, low-drag hypersonic configurations {{depends on the}} ability to incorporate sharp/blunt leading edges that combine good aerodynamic properties with acceptable heating rates. In this study, the hypersonic two-dimensional flow around a family of flat-nose leading edges at zero incidence is investigated by using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Effects of variation on the body surface temperature and on the leading <b>edge</b> <b>thickness</b> are investigated in terms of the aerodynamic surface quantities. The aerothermodynamic performance of the flat-nose leading edges is assessed by using the pressure, skin friction, heat transfer and total drag coefficients. The calculation results depict a weak effect of the leading <b>edge</b> <b>thickness</b> and of the wall temperature on total drag, while predict a strong dependence of stagnation point heating on the leading <b>edge</b> <b>thickness</b> over the range examined.
