The second, Nothing But Wind (1988), was performed by flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia and a 50-piece orchestra and takes the conceptual approach suggested in the title— that music is a natural phenomenon akin to various forms of air currents (e.g., the wind, breeze, tempest etc.).|$|E

5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The team at RIKEN has {{listed the}} {{synthesis}} of element 121 among their future plans after their attempts to synthesise element 120 in 2017–2018 and element 119 in 2019–2020. Their attempts at the latter two involve targets of 248Cm with projectiles of 54Cr and 51V respectively; the reaction of 248Cm with 55Mn would produce the same isotopes of element 121 as the JINR's suggested reaction of 249Bk with 54Cr in the 3n (300Ubu) and 4n (299Ubu) channels. Before this, the RIKEN team had successfully produced livermorium (element 116) in the <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> 248Cm with 48Ca, and will next try to produce new isotopes of oganesson (element 118) in the <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> 248Cm with 50Ti.|$|E

40|$|To {{characterize}} eye movements made {{by patients}} with intermittent exotropia when fusion loss occurs spontaneously and to {{compare them with}} those induced by covering 1 eye and with strategies used to recover <b>fusion.</b> Prospective study <b>of</b> a patient cohort referred to our laboratory. Thirteen patients with typical findings of intermittent exotropia who experienced frequent spontaneous loss <b>of</b> <b>fusion.</b> The position <b>of</b> each eye was recorded with a video eye tracker under infrared illumination while fixating on a small central near target. Eye position and peak velocity measured during spontaneous loss <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> shutter-induced loss <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> and recovery <b>of</b> <b>fusion.</b> In 10 <b>of</b> 13 subjects, the eye movement made after spontaneous loss <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> was indistinguishable from that induced by covering 1 eye. It reached 90 % of full amplitude in a mean of 1. 75 seconds. Peak velocity of the deviating eye's movement was highly correlated for spontaneous and shutter-induced events. Peak velocity was also proportional to exotropia amplitude. Recovery <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> was more rapid than loss <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> and often was accompanied by interjection of a disconjugate saccade. Loss <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> in intermittent exotropia is not influenced by visual feedback. Excessive divergence tone may be responsible, but breakdown of alignment occurs via a unique, pathological type of eye movement that differs from a normal, physiological divergence eye movement...|$|R

5|$|Although {{it is rare}} on Earth, helium is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} element in the known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic mass.
