5|$|In early 2010, Kieswetter {{achieved}} his target; {{some strong}} performances for the England Lions, {{especially in a}} match against the senior England team, won him {{a place in the}} squad to face Bangladesh.

25|$|The {{remaining}} {{threat from}} Polish forces generated calls for attacks on Warsaw. This {{had been planned}} for the first day, codenamed Wasserkante, or Operation Seaside. Just after midnight on 12/13 September, the Luftwaffe chief of staff Hans Jeschonnek ordered Löhr to prepare to attack ghettos in northern Warsaw, in retaliation for unspecified war crimes against German soldiers in recent battles. Richthofen's airmen flew 183 to 197 sorties, dropping Equal quantities of high explosives and incendiaries. Some bombs fell close to German forces conducting the Siege of Warsaw, and smoke {{made it impossible to}} assess damage. Richthofen confronted Hermann Göring over the need for a united air command for the Warsaw campaign, and hinted <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> for the job. He did not get his way until 21 September. Weather delayed the attack, which began on 22 September. Richthofen did not get the aircraft he wanted for the operation, in particular the Heinkel He 111, and instead was handed old Junkers Ju 52 transports, which delivered bombs by airmen throwing them out of the doors. His Ju 87s were also banned from using bomb loads greater than 50kg. On 22 September, Richthofen's command flew 620 sorties. German air units dropped 560 tonnes of high explosive and 72 tonnes of incendiaries. The bombing did great damage, causing 40,000 casualties and destroying one in ten of the buildings in the city, while only two Ju 87s and one Ju 52 were lost.|$|E
