40|$|Most {{processing}} plants use automatic samplers to extract ore aliquots along a producing shift. These aliquots {{are combined into}} a sample normally sent to lab analysis. The sampler used in the extraction of an aliquot from a continuous flow of ore, i. e. a belt conveyor is required to be both precise and accurate. Surprisingly, not all commercial automatic samplers exhibit these two mandatory propelties. Consequently, it is recommended {{the development of a}} procedure able to check sample assays reproducibility obtained using a given sampling protocol. This paper uses the Gy's sampling theory to evaluate coal quality control practices at a washing plant using an automatic sampler extracting coal increments from the ROM <b>feeding</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor. Gy's theory provides the means to establish the precision limits for a given sampling protocol. Various ore properties are required to be determined in combination with sample mass and mass of the lot sampled. All this inf 01 lllation leads to the definition of the precision limit. The precision limit obtained was checked via an experiment mimicking what happens in situations where both miner and consumer use the same and appropriate sampling practices. The experiment demonstrates that sampling theory precision limits were valid if unbiased samplers are used by both parties, i. e. miner and consumer...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. Polymers used as flocculants in the {{secondary}} sludge dewatering process {{are one of the}} most expensive inputs in these plants. The disadvantage is that these polymers cannot be recycled. Currently, controlling of polymer dosing rate is done by trial and error method. It has been shown that huge savings can be made by optimising the polymer dosing using rheological properties. It is not an easy task to optimise this process because of changing sludge characteristics on a daily, seasonal and annual basis. To try and optimise polymer dosing and polymer concentration, the variation in rheological properties needs to be understood first. The correlation between the process parameters and the rheological properties needs to be determined. There is currently no database of rheological properties of secondary wastewater sludge <b>feeding</b> <b>belt</b> filter presses available. To address these issues, a 12 week assessment of the rheological properties of the sludge feed to the belt filter press before and after conditioning in four wastewater treatment plants in Cape Town was conducted. The rheological properties were determined using an MCR- 51 rheometer with parallel plate geometry under controlled temperature. After concluding the assessment, a 3 -level Box-Behnken factorial trial was conducted at Plant K wastewater treatment plant to statistically analyse the correlation and/or interactions between the process parameters (sludge feed flow rate, polymer dosing concentration, polymer dosing rate and belt press speed) and the rheological properties of the sludge to optimise the plant performance...|$|E
40|$|Excellence of food {{products}} highly {{depends on the}} quality checks at different stages while preparation and processing at industry. With the evolution of technology, traditional methods are being put back and {{state of the art}} equipment taking the position. Being fast, efficient and automatic, computers and machines are potentially replacing the human deployment in the food industry. One of the early stages of food preparation is the ingredient evaluation on <b>feeding</b> <b>belt.</b> This is still carried out mostly by humans; however efforts have been made for the development of such system which is capable to inspect the ingredient quality in an automatic way. The research work involves developing and estimating such an arrangement which provide the quality information of ingredient without human deployment. X-ray imaging was employed for internal analysis of ingredients: pine, pistachio and hazelnuts. A captured x-ray image containing few non-overlapping ingredients was analyzed using image processing techniques to develop a method for automatic detection and extraction of independent ingredient. Individual ingredient image samples were further analyzed to calculate the strong features on the global as well as local level. A number of features including statistical, texture and moment invariant properties were extracted from each image sample and were organized in diverse combinations to be utilized further. Different databases have different percentage of representation for healthy and unhealthy nuts so correspondingly several classification techniques were exercised including logistic regression, artificial neural network, anomaly detection and support vector machines. In addition to accuracy, the percentage of correct recognition unhealthy ingredients was observed which is vital. Concluding fine classification accuracy was observed with comparatively better false positive rate than related studie...|$|E

50|$|Magnetic {{separation}} {{is a process}} in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet. In mines where wolframite was mixed with cassiterite, such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina, Tasmania, magnetic separation was used to separate the ores. At these mines a device called a Wetherill's Magnetic Separator (invented by John Price Wetherill, 1844-1906)1 was used. In this machine the raw ore, after calcination was fed onto a moving belt which passed underneath two pairs of electromagnets under which further belts ran at right angles to the <b>feed</b> <b>belt.</b> The first pair of electromagnets was weakly magnetised and served to draw off any iron ore present. The second pair were strongly magnetised and attracted the wolframite, which is weakly magnetic. These machines were capable of treating 10 tons of ore a day.This process of separating magnetic substances from the non-magnetic substances in a mixture {{with the help of a}} magnet is called magnetic separation..|$|R

50|$|A belt or {{ammunition}} belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm commonly used on machine guns. Belts were originally composed of canvas or cloth with pockets spaced evenly {{to allow the}} belt to be mechanically fed into the gun. These designs were prone to malfunctions due {{to the effects of}} oil and other contaminants altering the belt. Later belt designs used permanently connected metal links to retain the cartridges during <b>feeding.</b> These <b>belts</b> were more tolerant to exposure to solvents and oil. Some notable weapons that use belts are the M240, the M249, the M134 Minigun, and the PK Machine Gun.|$|R

50|$|The Bailey Machine Gun used a <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> {{system that}} did not remove the {{cartridges}} from the belt as the weapon was fired.

50|$|The <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> lever was {{connected}} to the <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> pawl at the front end, had a cam pin at the rear end which ran through a track {{in the top of the}} bolt, and a pin in the feed tray cover acted as the pivot between the two ends. The rearward movement of the bolt caused the rear end of the feed lever to pull to the right, causing the feeding pawl at the other end to move left over the belt. The pawl would pull the belt further to the right as the bolt came forward again, also sending the loose M1 link of the previous round to be taken out of the belt to fly out the right side of the receiver. A recoil buffer tube extended from the back of the receiver to make the cycle of the bolt smoother than previous designs, to absorb some of the recoil of the bolt, and formed a place for the pistol grip to be installed.|$|R

5000|$|The design drew on many common {{concepts}} in firearms manufacture of the period, such as stamped sheet metal construction, <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> (a modified mechanism for <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> from the MG42 {{with a single}} pawl), quick barrel replacement, a pistol grip and stock, and a Semi bullpup design similar to the FG 42 (much of the action occupies the weapon's stock). The M60's operating system of an operating rod turning a rotating bolt {{was inspired by the}} FG 42, which was based on the much earlier Lewis Gun. The M60 was even constructed with a secondary assisting firing pin spring that is used in the FG 42 in semi-automatic mode even though it is actually unnecessary in the M60 (which operates only in full automatic mode). The M60's gas operation is unique, and drew on technical advances of the period, particularly the White [...] "gas expansion and cutoff" [...] principle also exploited by the M14 rifle. The M60's gas system was simpler than other gas systems and easier to clean.|$|R
