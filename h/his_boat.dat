5|$|In the 1980s, Malaysian Marine Police boats {{entered the}} waters around Pedra Branca on several occasions. However, both Malaysia and Singapore acted with restraint, the Singapore Navy having been given strict {{instructions}} not to escalate matters. In 1989, the then Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad made an unannounced {{visit to the}} vicinity of the island. <b>His</b> <b>boat</b> was intercepted by Singapore naval vessels. To avoid an international incident, he directed <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> to leave.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) Skypes {{into the}} office from <b>his</b> <b>boat.</b> He is {{severely}} sunburned, loses his supply of fresh water in the ocean, and is going mad from lack of human contact despite only been on the boat for two days.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{promoted}} as ideal for lake-fishing and duck-shooting, and being {{exhibited in the}} Great Exhibition of 1851, Halkett's boat designs were not commercially successful and never entered general use outside the specialised field of Canadian exploration. Later promoted to Captain, Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the manufacture of <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> designs was abandoned. John Rae gave <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall, and it lay forgotten on the rafters of a Kirkwall woodyard. It was identified and recovered many years later, and is now displayed in the Stromness Museum at Orkney. A second surviving example is held in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.|$|E
5|$|When Dexter visits Rita {{the next}} morning, Gail—who {{suspects}} {{that he is}} hiding something—announces {{that she will be}} staying in Miami and will live with Rita. Dexter realizes that he must protect his secrets, so he begins by cleaning <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> that night with a black light to detect any blood. He is unaware that the marina is being videotaped by the Miami-Metro Police, who believe that the Bay Harbor Butcher may be keeping <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> at that marina.|$|E
5|$|Low's new fleet {{captured}} {{many more}} sloops, including one Low kept, naming it the Fortune.

5|$|Rainfall from Florence {{reached over}} 7inches (178mm) at one {{location}} in southeastern Mississippi, while a station 3miles (4.8km) south-southeast of Brewton, Alabama reported a storm-wide peak rainfall total of 10.67inches (271mm). Despite the rainfall, no damage {{was reported in}} Alabama or Mississippi. In Mobile Bay in Alabama, one man died while attempting to secure <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> — the only direct fatality related to the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|September 25, 2004– Heavy surf from Hurricane Jeanne kills {{a man to}} {{the east}} of Oak Island after he is thrown {{overboard}} from <b>his</b> <b>boat.</b> Three days later the storm's remnants cross the western portion of the state, causing the third flood in a month; the flood from Jeanne is less severe and shorter in duration than that from Ivan and Frances.|$|E
5|$|Sustained {{winds of}} 25–35mph (40–55km/h), with gusts up to 55mph (90km/h), were {{reported}} throughout Long Island. Damage {{on the island}} was mainly limited to downed trees and power lines, although the Long Island Power Authority reported that at least 93,000 homes lost power during the day on September 11. One person was killed when <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> capsized in the Long Island Sound.|$|E

5|$|Although Josephine {{remained}} well offshore {{of the eastern}} United States, the effects from the storm and an area of high pressure produced strong winds and high seas along the coast. In North Carolina, high tides caused severe beach erosion and minor damage to ocean-front houses. Minor coastal flooding occurred in New York and New Jersey. In addition, one fatality occurred when a man drowned after falling off <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> while sailing a river in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Although Richard tracked {{north of}} Honduras, strong winds along the {{coastline}} downed trees and power lines. Mudslides stranded up to 15,000 people across 40 different towns. The island of Roatán received {{a gust of}} 58mph (93km/h). Farther north and west in Belize, the Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center—popular attractions for tourists—were heavily damaged. About 80% of the grapefruit and nearly 25% of the orange crop were lost there. Two deaths were observed: one man was killed when <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> capsized in rough seas, while a second man was mauled to death by a jaguar that escaped after a tree mangled its cage. The damage cost topped $80 million.|$|E

5000|$|The {{captain of}} the second-eighth Natchez, Thomas P. Leathers, {{sometimes}} nicknamed [...] "Old Push", was described as savage, reckless, and colorful. He loved to prove <b>his</b> <b>boats</b> were the fastest. He would sometimes throw fatty bacon and hog fat into the engine to dramatically increase the speed of <b>his</b> <b>boats.</b> He would sometimes cause other boats to slow down by quickly racing in front of them. He died in June 1896, {{at the age of}} 80, after being hit by a bicyclist while walking down a New Orleans street.|$|R

5|$|Early in its duration, {{the storm}} dropped {{rainfall}} across the Yucatán Peninsula. Upon striking Louisiana, Florence produced a moderate storm surge, causing severe beach erosion in some locations. Gusty winds were also reported, causing power outages to over 100,000people. In Alabama, one man died {{while trying to}} secure <b>his</b> <b>boat.</b> Rainfall from the hurricane caused severe river flooding in portions of the Florida Panhandle in an area already severely affected by heavy rainfall; the flooding damaged or destroyed dozens of houses in Santa Rosa County. Throughout its path, damage totaled about $2.9million (1988USD, $5.3million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Following Carmen's passage, {{officials}} {{feared the}} worst for {{an area of}} 1,000mi2 (2,590km2) where communication was lost in Belize.

One person was killed {{off the coast of}} Belize after being washed off <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> by large swells produced by Carmen. Three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents. Thousands of people moved from coastal areas inland to escape the storm. Crop damage in the country was reportedly severe.|$|E
5|$|On Amity Island, Martin Brody, {{famous for}} his role as Police Chief and his heroism during the {{previous}} events, has recently died from a heart attack. His wife, Ellen, attributes it to the fear of sharks. She now lives with Brody's younger son, Sean and his fiancée, Tiffany. Sean works as a police deputy, and is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy a few days before Christmas. A great white shark attacks and kills him, sinking <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> in the process.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and 1960s Piver {{designed}} and built a series of simple three-hulled, plywood yachts starting with a 16 footer and culminating in a 64-footer that was built in England for charter in the Caribbean. (The word [...] "trimaran" [...] was coined by Viktor Tchetchet, a Ukrainian emigrant to the US who tested <b>his</b> <b>boats</b> on Long Island sound in the late 1940s.) Piver crossed the Atlantic on <b>his</b> first ocean-going <b>boat,</b> the demountable 30 foot Nimble, departing from Swansee, Mass, stopping in the Azores, and successfully reaching Plymouth, England. He then began selling do-it-yourself plans through a company called Pi-Craft. He thought anyone could build one of <b>his</b> <b>boats</b> {{even if they had}} no experience.|$|R
5|$|On March 5, 1735, George Mason III {{died when}} <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> capsized while {{crossing}} the Potomac.

5|$|Still {{maintaining}} {{strong winds}} {{by the time}} it struck Canada, the former hurricane washed one boat ashore, left three missing, and capsized one. One person was presumed killed when <b>his</b> <b>boat</b> sunk in Lockeport, Nova Scotia. The storm dropped heavy rainfall across the region, including 1.1in (27mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and about 3in (75mm) in 15hours in Gagetown, New Brunswick; there, the rains flooded roads and damaged crops. At Harvey Station in the same province, high rainfall washed out a 75ft (22m) portion of a rail line.|$|E
5|$|The scenes at {{the marina}} where Dexter keeps <b>his</b> <b>boat,</b> Coral Cove, were filmed at the Leeward Bay Marina in Los Angeles' Wilmington neighborhood, {{in spite of}} the show's Miami setting. The episode opens in a coffee bar at Coral Cove Marina, which was filmed at Leeward Bay's {{floating}} diner, the Chowder Barge. One of the empty barns at Long Beach, California's Shoreline Village was set up as the comic book store. Doakes and LaGuerta discuss the homicide case while standing on the Shoreline Village boardwalk, and the Village car park was used to film Doakes and LaGuerta's stake out.|$|E
