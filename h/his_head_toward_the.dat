60|$|Clayton nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{prostrate}} {{form of the}} Russian. For a time neither spoke.|$|E
60|$|He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> little orchestra, {{which was}} playing a low and tremulous waltz tune.|$|E
6000|$|... "King! War!" [...] said McTurk, jerking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> wall, where hung a {{small wooden}} West-African war-drum, a gift to McTurk from a naval uncle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't go that way!" [...] cried Andy, {{as he saw}} <b>his</b> cousin <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> brook. [...] "You'll {{get stuck}} and you'll never get out." ...|$|R
60|$|Andrew turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>his</b> friend. <b>The</b> tone puzzled him.|$|R
6000|$|Here the boy turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> water, without {{directly}} answering Phonny, {{though he}} called {{out at the same}} time in an audible voice, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{could draw}} like that, maâ€™am," [...] he said, with a jerk of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ruined castle, [...] "I should {{give up the}} sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|While Dot and Tot {{were trying}} to make up their minds whether to be afraid or not, the Alligator turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Queen and said, gently: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{regarded}} her darkly. [...] "Well, I trust you. You won't give me away. I'm {{not so sure}} of her." [...] He nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open door.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly he paused, his slender {{hand up to}} <b>his</b> lips, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door, an {{expression}} of tense expectancy in every line of his face.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a sudden}} deep buzz from outside the building. Shouts drifted up from below. Reinhart turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> window, <b>his</b> heart frozen with fear.|$|R
60|$|The white dog {{had risen}} and stood warily {{shifting}} his nose. He sniffed the wind, turned round and round, and slowly stiffened with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> pointed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> eastern {{rise of the}} plateau.|$|R
6000|$|The Florist: [...] "Dropic? With icepergs on the wintows?" [...] He nods <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> frosty panes, {{and wraps}} {{a sheet of}} {{tissue-paper}} around the cotton and the flowers.|$|E
60|$|The ape-man {{turned and}} raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> jungle, while there pealed from his lips, time after time, the fearsome {{cry of the}} bull-ape who would summon his fellows.|$|E
60|$|He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door {{by which}} he had entered, for there was an altercation {{going on in the}} hallway and Mr. Conant's voice could be heard angrily protesting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] cried Mavering, and {{the fact}} seemed to {{brighten}} him immediately. [...] "If you want to, stuff these things in, while I'm doing up these other things." [...] He nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> side-wise <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> desk.|$|R
60|$|I saw Spears shake <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and look}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> bench. It was plain what that meant.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Walters {{eyed him}} uneasily, {{and with his}} cap firmly gripped {{in his left hand}} saluted him with the right. Then he turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{sideways}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> passage. The captain repeated his question in a voice, if anything, louder than before.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{all come}} from there," [...] he said. [...] "After a while we go there." [...] And this time he jerked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> north. [...] "Be Galus," [...] he concluded.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} in the smoking room there, a few moments ago," [...] he began, jerking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door. [...] "There were some men talking--decent fellows, not dirty scandalmongers. They spoke of Louise Maurel." ...|$|E
60|$|He motioned with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> window {{which was}} behind them, and which {{looked out over}} the river. They were all three silent for a moment. Then Weiss struck the table lightly with his clenched fist.|$|E
60|$|The vaqueros {{were paying}} no further {{attention}} to him, and the Indian passed out and sought his pony; {{but when he}} had mounted and ridden from town he took a strange direction for one whose path lies to the east, since he turned <b>his</b> pony's <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Keswick, hurriedly {{shaking hands}} with him. [...] "I am afraid {{something}} very unexpected has happened, and so beg you will excuse me. Good-morning." [...] And passing through the gateway, he rapidly strode <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house, while Lawrence prepared to turn <b>his</b> horse's <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Springs.|$|R
60|$|Just then it {{occurred}} to Tarzan of the Apes that Numa had loitered beneath the tree for a sufficient length of time, so he raised <b>his</b> young <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> heavens, and there rang out upon the terrified ears of the two old men the awful warning challenge of the anthropoid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those inner {{doors are}} open," [...] said Orme, nodding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> great portals upon the farther {{side of the}} square. [...] "Let's go {{see if we can}} shut them. Otherwise we shan't hold this place long." ...|$|E
60|$|Unhesitatingly, {{he stepped}} into the tangle of {{branches}} close to the panther's side, still voicing his friendly and conciliatory purr. The cat turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> man, eyeing him steadily--questioningly. The long fangs were bared, but more in preparedness than threat.|$|E
60|$|Fray Juan Perez, a truly guileless priest, {{started at}} the name; then he gazed intently, and {{with a sort of}} pity, at the youth; after which he bent <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> tiles beneath his feet, smiled, and shook his head like one whose {{thoughts}} were very active.|$|E
60|$|The {{rays of the}} nearer moon, {{swinging}} low {{across the}} valley, touched his jewel-incrusted harness with a thousand changing lights and glanced from the glossy ebony of his smooth hide. Twice he turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> forest, after the manner of one who is upon an evil errand, though he must have felt quite safe from pursuit.|$|R
50|$|The protodynastic tombs were oval, 1.0 - 1.5m {{long and}} 1.5 - 2.0m deep. They {{contained}} simple pits, {{in which the}} deceased was laid down in a fetal pose, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> facing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west. Beside and around the deceased, several bowls and vases were placed; {{in some of the}} tombs, precious artifacts made of ivory and stone were found.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{can make}} the venture, but I am a bit shaky over it," [...] said the freight agent, and with a face full of the concern he felt for <b>his</b> {{turn-out}} he <b>headed</b> <b>his</b> trotter <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sh-s-sh!" [...] he breathed, {{grasping}} her wrist, {{and holding}} it firmly in his powerful hand. The whole {{attitude of the}} man had altered swiftly, subtly. The listlessness was gone. His lithe body became rigid as he leaned forward, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ground, and turned slightly {{in a manner that}} betokened intent listening.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're yellow," [...] Grimshaw went on, [...] "yellow clean through." [...] He nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Mariner. [...] "Now there's {{the real}} thing as a man. No yellow in him. He never batted an eye, and I reckon he knew more about the danger than you did. If I was to choose being wrecked on a desert island with him or you, I'd take him a {{thousand}} times first. If--" ...|$|E
60|$|Dan {{was already}} lying down with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the}} tent and his feet near the oil-stove, which had been left burning because of the dampness, and Teddy crawled over {{by the side of}} him. Sam had decided to sleep by the side of his host, {{probably}} with the idea that he might appear to be on terms of greater intimacy, and all hands gave themselves up to slumber.|$|E
60|$|Burton turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and glanced}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> girl. She had raised her veil. Her eyes met his, met his {{question}} and evaded it. She studied {{the pattern of}} the carpet. When she looked up again, her cheeks were pink.|$|R
6000|$|The old {{man called}} out, [...] "Here, Abel!" [...] {{and the figure}} of what seemed an elderly boy came lurching and {{paddling}} round {{the corner of the}} cabin, and ducked <b>his</b> gray <b>head</b> hospitably <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stranger. [...] "Give this horse a feed while we're taking ours." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nelly waves a tearful {{goodbye to}} her friends in the jungle as she leaves for civilization, captivated {{by the idea of}} show business. Once she arrives in New York City, she is put to work singing jingles for [...] "Algonquin Rutabaga Tonic" [...] - a cure for ailments, puts on live stage shows, and {{produces}} a line of giraffe-neck sweaters. The camera closes in on a turtle reading a magazine article on the giraffe-neck clothing. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> turns <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> camera and he says, [...] "Well, that's show business".|$|R
