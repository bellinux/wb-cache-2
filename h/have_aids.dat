25|$|AIDS is a {{very serious}} problem in Gaborone. 17,773 Gaborone citizens, 17.1% of the total {{population}} of Gaborone, have tested positive for HIV. There is a higher prevalence of HIV among women; 20.5% of women have tested positive compared to 13.6% of men.

25|$|Controversy was {{prompted}} in 1987 {{with the arrival}} of Cindy Parker (Ellen Wheeler), who would later fall in love with Stuart. The character was revealed to <b>have</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, Skye Chandler. The tragedy of the attack shows the extremes of violence that occur every day to victims of the disease. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show's most watched episodes. ABC wanted changes at All My Children. The show was getting about 6.5 million viewers per episode, but there sentiment that the program had lost its unique sense of humor and was simply copying other soaps with action/adventure storylines. Efforts were made to bring the show back to the glory days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|HIV (human {{immunodeficiency}} virus) {{damages the}} body's immune system, which interferes with {{its ability to}} fight off disease-causing agents. The virus kills CD4 cells, which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections. HIV is carried in body fluids, and is spread by sexual activity. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood, breast feeding, childbirth, and from mother to child during pregnancy. When HIV is at its most advanced stage, an individual is said to <b>have</b> <b>AIDS</b> (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). There are different stages of the progression of and HIV infection. The stages include primary infection, asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the primary infection stage, an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, muscle aches) for about 2 weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened, and has a low cell count of CD4+ T Cells. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result. When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who had AIDS were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By suppressing the amount of virus in the body, people can lead longer and healthier lives. Even though their virus levels may be low they can still spread the virus to others.|$|E

[...] "As far as I'm concerned, people who <b>have</b> <b>AIDS</b> are a danger", Schaefer said. [...] "People {{should be able to}} know who has AIDS." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1980s, when no {{effective}} medication was yet available for AIDS treatment, Paul spoke publicly against all {{federal funding for}} AIDS research. He also wrote, in his book Freedom Under Siege, published in 1987, “Victims of the disease AIDS argue ... for crash research programs (to {{be paid for by}} people who don't <b>have</b> <b>AIDS),</b> demanding a cure... The individual suffering from AIDS certainly is a victim – frequently a victim of his own lifestyle – but this same individual victimizes innocent citizens by forcing them to pay for his care. Crash research programs are hardly something, I believe, the Founding Fathers intended when they talked about equal rights.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, Hudson {{traveled}} to Paris, France, {{for another round}} of treatment. After Hudson collapsed in his room at the Ritz Hotel in Paris on July 21, his publicist, Dale Olson, released a statement claiming that Hudson had inoperable liver cancer. Olson denied reports that Hudson had AIDS and would say only that he was undergoing tests for [...] "everything" [...] at the American Hospital of Paris. But, four days later, July 25, 1985, Hudson's French publicist Yanou Collart confirmed that Hudson did in fact <b>have</b> <b>AIDS.</b> He {{was among the first}} notable individuals to have been diagnosed with the disease. In another press release a month later, Hudson speculated he might have contracted HIV through transfused blood from an infected donor during the multiple blood transfusions he received during his heart bypass procedure in November 1981.|$|E

[...] The Tiyanjane Clinic offers palliative care to people with HIV and AIDS who have been treated at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH). [...] An estimated 70% of the patients at the hospital have HIV. [...] The clinic offers care and counseling to help people continue living their lives without agony. [...] Pain is reported by 74% of the patients and 56% of patients require oral morphine. [...] In order to better serves these patients, the EMMS sponsored the first Palliative Care conference of Malawi at the clinic. [...] In addition to the care offered at the Tiyanjane Clinic, the Umodzi Clinic helps children who are HIV positive, <b>have</b> <b>AIDS</b> or {{have been diagnosed with}} cancer. [...] It serves cancer patients who are 14 years old or younger. [...] It provides group support to mothers and children. [...] There are approximately 80 children who regularly attend the daycare center where they play and eat nutritious meals.|$|E

2500|$|On April 30, 1987, Petrelis and Robinson were at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. {{to disrupt}} an {{appearance}} by William Bennet, then Secretary of Education in the Ronald Reagan administration. In a speech, {{approved by the}} White House and given {{to a group of}} students {{on the last day of}} classes, Bennet advocated mandatory AIDS testing for people convicted of crimes, people admitted to hospitals or seeking care at clinics, “perhaps particularly those serving high-risk populations,” people applying to settle in the United States, and couples applying to marry. Petrelis and Robinson distributed leaflets saying, “No condoms, no sex, no privacy, no freedom, no choice, no reality, & no cure.” When Bennett invited questions from the audience, Petrelis and Robinson stood, unfurled a purple banner that said “Lavender Hill Mob,” and shouted, “Test drugs, not people. We’re dying. We’re dying.” [...] Petrelis screamed, “I <b>have</b> <b>AIDS,</b> but it’s taken President Reagan six years to say the word AIDS.” Campus security officers removed Petrelis and Robinson from the room, and detained them for half an hour before releasing them.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after Hudson's {{press release}} {{disclosing}} his infection, William M. Hoffman, {{the author of}} As Is, a play about AIDS that appeared on Broadway in 1985, stated: [...] "If Rock Hudson can have it, nice people can have it. It's just a disease, not a moral affliction." [...] At the same time, Joan Rivers was quoted as saying: [...] "Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn't get one major star to turn out. ... Rock's admission is a horrendous way to bring AIDS {{to the attention of}} the American public, but by doing so, Rock, in his life, has helped millions in the process. What Rock has done takes true courage." [...] Morgan Fairchild said that [...] "Rock Hudson's death gave AIDS a face." [...] In a telegram Hudson sent to a September 1985 Hollywood AIDS benefit, Commitment to Life, which he was too ill to attend in person, Hudson said: [...] "I am not happy that I am sick. I am not happy that I <b>have</b> <b>AIDS.</b> But if that is helping others, I can at least know that my own misfortune has had some positive worth." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{she grew}} up in Peoria, Illinois, she knew only one gay man. She said, [...] "the whole idea of {{homosexuality}} made me profoundly uneasy". She later acknowledged that she had been very square, and was uncomfortable about homosexuality. [...] "The women's movement was not about sex, but about equal opportunity in jobs {{and all the rest of}} it. Yes, I suppose you have to say that freedom of sexual choice is part of that, but it shouldn't be the main issue…." [...] She ignored lesbians in the National Organization for Women (NOW) initially, and objected to what she saw as their demands for equal time. [...] "'Homosexuality…is not, in my opinion, what the women's movement is all about.'" [...] While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of abortion and child care. But in 1977, at the National Women's Conference, she seconded a lesbian rights resolution [...] "which everyone thought I would oppose" [...] in order to [...] "preempt any debate" [...] and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution. She accepted lesbian sexuality, albeit not its politicization. In 1995, at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, she found advice given by Chinese authorities to taxi drivers that naked lesbians would be [...] "cavorting" [...] in their cars so that the drivers should hang sheets outside their cab windows, and that lesbians would <b>have</b> <b>AIDS</b> and so drivers should carry disinfectants, to be [...] "ridiculous", [...] "incredibly stupid" [...] and [...] "insulting". In 1997, she wrote that [...] "children…will ideally come from mother and father." [...] She wrote in 2000, [...] "I'm more relaxed about the whole issue now".|$|E

2500|$|Mark's friend Joe Wallace dies of an AIDS related illness, {{and after}} visiting {{him in the}} hospice, he meets a Scottish woman named Ruth Aitken (Caroline Paterson), who is also visiting a friend. After a brief conversation, the two decide {{to go for a}} drink together. They start dating and Ruth copes with his HIV status but her father, a strict Presbyterian minister, refuses to give his blessing to her {{relationship}} with Mark and disowns her when she announces her plans to marry Mark. They marry in Scotland but problems surface in their marriage. She persuades Mark - and herself - that she is happy about not having children, but it is soon clear that she is fooling herself. Mark is forced to confront the Square's prejudices when the residents discover his HIV status. Mark is devastated when Arthur dies of a brain haemorrhage after being involved in a prison riot. On the day of his father's funeral, Mark becomes angry that Willy Roper (Michael Tudor-Barnes) had framed Arthur for embezzlement and assaults Willy at the cemetery. He believes that {{he was the one who}} led to Arthur's death. The depth of ignorance concerning the illness doesn't help and, led by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), the residents begin to boycott Mark's fruit and vegetable stall, fearing they will catch the virus. Pauline springs to her son's defence and she and Peggy have a vicious fight, but even Pauline can't diffuse the prejudice, and Mark comes home to find the words [...] "AIDS scum" [...] graffitied on his wall. This is too much and he decides to present his neighbours with a few facts about his illness in The Queen Victoria; firstly by telling them that he doesn't <b>have</b> <b>AIDS</b> but is HIV positive, which is a noncontagious virus, forcing them to acknowledge their bigotry. Peggy remains uncertain, but is forced to realise that Mark might appreciate a bit of support when she is diagnosed with breast cancer.|$|E
