5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>in</b> some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
500|$|When asked {{from where}} she draws {{consolation}} {{in the face of}} aging and death, Streep responded: [...] "Consolation? I'm not sure I have it. I have a belief, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>in</b> the power of the aggregate human attempt – the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism – you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better. Where does that come from?" ...|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't {{say to a}} dollar, but I've got all {{the amounts}} down <b>in</b> a book. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> somewhere <b>in</b> the {{neighbourhood}} of nine thousand would cover it." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Today" [...] was {{the first}} song Corgan wrote for Siamese Dream. Corgan said, [...] "The day after I wrote 'Today,' my manager heard it and said, 'It's a hit,' and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> a way, it was." [...] Corgan played the self-recorded demo to {{producer}} Butch Vig and {{to the rest of}} his band, all of whom responded positively. [...] "Today" [...] already had a chord progression and a melody, but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening riff to the song. One day, [...] "out of the blue, I heard the opening lick note for note in my head", Corgan said. [...] "When I added the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song. Suddenly, I had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud." [...] Soon afterwards, Virgin Records executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan; as a result, he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself, including on the finished version of [...] "Today".|$|E
500|$|Waltrip, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 after {{crashing}} on lap 52, said he felt he had let everyone down but was thankful his team and his sponsor Aaron's had given him an opportunity to race in the Duels. Patrick, who was hit by Almirola on the final lap and crashed heavily into the wall, said, [...] "It sucks [...] You just have to brace yourself. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> these situations, I just have to be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip." [...] She also said the crash was [...] "a blessing in a big disguise". Patrick, along with Gilliland, Montoya and Menard, were required to drive their backup cars for the Daytona 500. After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up and I tried to clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Bow remembered: [...] "All {{this time}} I was 'running wild', <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>in</b> {{the sense of}} {{trying to have a}} good time... maybe this was a good thing, because I suppose a lot of that excitement, that joy of life, got onto the screen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In one sense," [...] drawled the {{representative}} of the Sun. [...] "I was too late to save the man, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> was <b>in</b> time to hear something of importance. I heard the dead man denounce his assassin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, stranger. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we're <b>in</b> luck, {{though it}} ain't a big one. I say, what sort o' brute was that, that had hold of him? Never seed sich a crittur {{in all my}} life." ...|$|R
6000|$|She was not mistaken, {{for when}} I {{opened the door}} a {{neighbor}} said, [...] "I've brought you Mrs. Fletcher. Met her walking to Fairmead across the prairie. No; <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I'm <b>in</b> a hurry, and won't get down." ...|$|R
2500|$|Also in 1947, Hayworth was {{featured}} in a Life cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed [...] "The Love Goddess". The term was adopted and used later {{as the title of}} a biopic and of a biography about her. In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, [...] "Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don't. I never made nude movies. I didn't have to do that. I danced. I was provocative, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>in</b> some things. But I was not completely exposed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with Bleeding Cool, Galligan again spoke {{about a third}} film saying that [...] "Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus {{wants to do it}} because he’d like to undo the Gremlins 2 thing as he wasn’t thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to do it I imagine – because he’s Spielberg – and why wouldn’t he want to do it." [...] He said that Columbus was now in control of the franchise and once confirmed {{that there will be no}} remake or reboot, only a sequel. He also said that that Columbus [...] "has been aggressively working on a Gremlins 3" [...] and Columbus even went into some detail about what the third film would be about. Gremlins 3 takes place in present day. He tantalizingly says there will be some new characters and some old characters – <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> the style of a [...] type sequel. One thing we know for sure is they have a writer on board. The only insight I can give is the following: There was a 6-year gap between Gremlins and Gremlins 2; most of that time was spent with them writing and rejecting ideas and re-writing. One of the ideas that was rejected was ‘gremlins in Vegas.’ They went with that for 18 months and felt it was too expensive. Eventually they came up with the tower idea, where essentially I’m working for Donald Trump, our new President! That took six years to happen. Carl Ellsworth has been apparently working on the script for a year and a half now." [...] Galligan said. It is unknown if Joe Dante will return to direct the third film.|$|E
6000|$|... "The old man" [...] (meaning {{my uncle}} Ro) [...] "must {{have plenty of}} gold watches about him," [...] he said, [...] "to be so plaguy partic'lar consarnin' his bed. Peddlin' sich matters is a ticklish trade, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>in</b> some parts?" ...|$|E
60|$|I saw Madonna Paola's eyes gleam with {{a sudden}} light of admiration, and <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that <b>in</b> the matter of Giovanni's valour her {{opinions}} were undergoing the same change as the verses had caused them to undergo {{in the matter of}} his intellect.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Gregson," [...] {{said the}} American, looking across at the official, [...] "I don't {{know what your}} British point of view may be, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>in</b> New York this lady's husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There's {{a lovely}} crowd, {{and a real}} Boston one too, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>in</b> here!" [...] cried Mr. Filer, now banging very hard. [...] "I've handled prima donnas, and I've handled natural curiosities, but I've never seen {{anything}} up to this. Mind what I say, ladies; if you don't let me in, I'll smash down the door!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Jake judiciously disregarded this suggestion. [...] "There's one trick most dogs learn quite easy. It's to guard. You {{put down}} some of your clothes, for instance, and make him see that nobody's to touch them until you come back. Then he'll sit tight until you do, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> this fellow's case there'd be mighty little wrong with the nerves of the man who'd {{put a hand on}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'All right, partner, we {{will talk}} it over and fix about who had best be asked. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> {{two or three days}} we can make up the number. The boys were pretty well riled last night at Wyoming's goings on, and if it hadn't have been that {{they did not want to}} make a muss, with that girl in the saloon, I fancy some of them would not have gone without shooting.' ...|$|E
50|$|Cornell stated:The way MTV's {{programming}} {{works is}} like a commercial radio station, the shorter the video, the more videos they can play, and—they figured <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>in</b> the normal hours people watch videos they're {{not going to want}} to watch something for six minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{heard the}} redskins coming nearer and nearer, and {{they stopped at}} the stream {{a quarter of a}} mile or so above us. We listened, I can tell you, for the sound of their going on again; but no such luck, and after a quarter of an hour we knew as they were going to camp there. I felt pretty thankful as it was late in the afternoon, for <b>I</b> <b>guessed,</b> <b>in</b> the first place, as they would light their fire and cook their food, so none of them war likely to be coming down our way until it was after dark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we'll go <b>in</b> an' say how-d'ye-do," [...] {{continued}} Cap'n Bill, {{attempting to}} enter the doorway. But a soldier barred his way with a lance.|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear. Why, it'll be {{a couple}} of years before the ship is paid off, and by then he'll have {{forgotten}} all about her. I bet he was pretty mad when he woke up and found he'd been shanghaied, and I shouldn't wonder but he wanted to fight somebody. But he'd got to grin and bear it, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> a month he was thinking it the best thing that had ever happened to him that he got away from the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look! Look {{over in the}} ferns!" [...] and Mr. Bunny pointed excitedly {{with one}} paw. [...] "There's Mrs. Bunny herself! I reckon she thinks you may be here {{with the idea of}} {{starting}} another club, and she has come after me. She's got Sonny Bunny by the paw, which is the same as saying if I don't do as she wants she'll take him and go to her mother's, so <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>in</b> order to keep peace in the family, I'd better say good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 23rd. Mail day.--The Ebb Tide, all but (I take it) fifteen pages, {{is now in}} your hands--possibly {{only about}} eleven pp. It is hard to say. But there it is, {{and you can do}} your best with it. Personally, I believe I would in this case make even a {{sacrifice}} to get Gordon Browne and copious illustration. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> ten days I shall have finished with it; then I go next to D. Balfour, and get the proofs ready: a nasty job for me, as you know. And then? Well, perhaps I'll take a go at the family history. I think that will be wise, as I am so much off work. And then, I suppose, Weir of Hermiston, but it may be anything. I am discontented with The Ebb Tide, naturally; there seems such a veil of words over it; and I like more and more naked writing; and yet sometimes one has a longing for full colour and there comes the veil again. The Young Chevalier is in very full colour, and I fear it for that reason.--Ever, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jefferson, reflectively, [...] "I {{have seen}} men who looked smarter, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you'll do. <b>In</b> fact, I'm {{beginning}} to feel sure of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear child, <b>I</b> cannot <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> the least. Perhaps the Egremont {{property}} {{will not}} concern you, and only go to male heirs. That {{would be the}} best thing, since in any case you must be sufficiently provided for. Your father must do that.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Mark {{sat back}} in his chair, moved but holding himself, his elbows squared on each arm, his hands a bit convulsively {{interlocked}} across him--very much in fact as he had appeared an hour ago in the old tapestry bergère; but as his rigour was all then that of the grinding effort to profess and to give, so it was considerably now for the fear of too hysterically gushing. Somehow too--since his wound was to that extent open--he winced at hearing the author of it branded. He hadn't so much minded the epithets Mrs. Folliott had applied, for they were to the appropriator of her securities. As the appropriator of his own he didn't so much want to brand him as--just more [...] "amusingly" [...] even, if one would.--to make out, perhaps, with intelligent help, how such a man, in such a relation, could come to tread such a path: which was exactly the interesting light that Winch's curiosity and sympathy were there to assist him to. He pleaded at any rate immediately his advertising no grievance. [...] "I feel sore, I admit, and it's a horrid sort of thing to have had happen; but when you call him a brute and a hog I rather squirm, for brutes and hogs never live, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>in</b> the sort of hell in which he now must be." ...|$|E
60|$|As we went {{we began}} to pass a {{considerable}} accumulation of floating rushes, weed, boughs of trees, and other rubbish, brought, Good supposed, to this spot by some current, which he was much puzzled to account for. Whilst we were speculating about this, Sir Henry pointed out a flock of large white swans, which were feeding on the drift some little way ahead of us. Now I had already noticed swans flying about this lake, and, having never come across them before in Africa, was exceedingly anxious to obtain a specimen. I had questioned the natives about them, and learnt that they came from over the mountain, always arriving at certain periods {{of the year in}} the early morning, when it was very easy to catch them, on account of their exhausted condition. I also asked them what country they came from, when they shrugged their shoulders, and said that on the top of the great black precipice was stony inhospitable land, and beyond that were mountains with snow, and full of wild beasts, where no people lived, and beyond the mountains were hundreds of miles of dense thorn forest, so thick that even the elephants could not get through it, much less men. Next I asked them if they had ever heard of white people like ourselves living on the farther side of the mountains and the thorn forest, whereat they laughed. But afterwards a very old woman came and told me that when she was a little girl her grandfather had told her that in his youth his grandfather had crossed the desert and the mountains, and pierced the thorn forest, and seen a white people who lived in stone kraals beyond. Of course, as this took the tale back some two hundred and fifty years, the information was very indefinite; but still there it was again, and on thinking it over I grew firmly convinced that there was some truth in all these rumours, and equally firmly determined to solve the mystery. Little did <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> what an almost miraculous way my desire was to be gratified.|$|E
