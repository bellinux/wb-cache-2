5|$|As a {{proxy for}} his father, Romulus made no {{decisions}} and left no monuments, though coins bearing his name were minted in Rome, Milan, Ravenna, and Gaul. Several months after Orestes took power, a coalition of Heruli, Scirian and Turcilingi mercenaries demanded that he <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> third {{of the land in}} Italy. When Orestes refused, the tribes revolted under the leadership of the Scirian chieftain Odoacer. Orestes was captured near Piacenza on 28 August 476 and swiftly executed.|$|E

5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> contract.|$|E

Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E

5|$|The bee-eaters are a {{group of}} near {{passerine}} birds in the family Meropidae. Most species are found in Africa but others occur in southern Europe, Madagascar, Australia and New Guinea. They are characterised by richly coloured plumage, slender bodies and usually elongated central tail feathers. All are colourful and have long downturned bills and pointed wings, which <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> swallow-like appearance when seen from afar.|$|E
5|$|The {{score for}} the Bourne Identity was {{composed}} by John Powell. Powell was bought in to replace Carter Burwell, who had composed and recorded a more traditional orchestral {{score for the}} film, which director Doug Liman rejected. Since {{a lot of the}} music budget had been spent recording the rejected score, Powell's score was initially conceived to be entirely non-orchestral, making extensive use of percussion, guitars, electronics and studio techniques. However, a string section was later overdubbed onto many of the cues to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 'cinematic' quality.|$|E

In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> broad field of fire; when fully armored, this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored, a barbette.|$|E

5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> sense of financial and personal independence. Women {{who are able to}} work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E

After defeating South Africa in their quarter-final, Fiji lost to eventual winners New Zealand in their semi-final. In 1995, Serevi captained Fiji to the Hong Kong Sevens final. He scored three tries in their semi-final victory over Australia. They then faced New Zealand in the final, and although leading 17–14 at one point, eventually lost the game 35–17. In the 1996 tournament, Fiji again met New Zealand in the final; New Zealand led after Serevi tripped Christian Cullen close to Fiji's try line. This {{was followed by a}} break from Serevi to give Setareki Naivaluwaqa a try. New Zealand scored twice more however, to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 19–17 victory. Serevi finished the year by leading Fiji to victory in the Dubai Sevens.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.|$|E
5|$|After {{their first}} {{victory of the}} season, the Flyers were {{challenged}} by the Muncie Offers More AC. The game was labelled as the Muncie City Championship. Since {{most of the other}} local teams' seasons were finished, both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game. The field was muddy, which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times. In the third quarter, the Flyers scored two touchdowns to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 14–0 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Flyers added 10 more points—a touchdown and a field goal—in the final quarter to win the Championship 24–0.|$|E

5|$|BMC {{came to the}} Giro {{without a}} real overall {{classification}} hopeful. Sporting director Fabio Baldato stated that the team's nine-man squad was designed to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> chance at a stage win every day, with Kristoff for the sprints, Kohler, Wyss, and Zahner for the breakaways, and Tschopp and Frank for the climbs. Rounding out the squad were young Americans Barton, Beyer, and Butler, riding the Giro mainly for experience. They constituted three of the seven Americans in the Giro peloton. The team's preparation for the Giro was also affected by the Mantova investigation, {{which resulted in the}} team's banning of Ballan and Santambrogio for the second time, after a previous ban in April 2010. Again just as in 2010, the two were reactivated shortly after the Giro concluded.|$|E
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E

This surprises Bill and Marty, who believed that nobody would ever choose an elephant, and thus have no elephant to give away. They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, prompting their boss to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> choice: either arrange for delivery of the elephant, or lose their jobs.
