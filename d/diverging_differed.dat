5000|$|Substitution {{matrices}} such as BLOSUM {{are used}} for sequence alignment of proteins. A Substitution matrix assigns a score for aligning any possible pair of residues. In general, different substitution matrices are tailored to detecting similarities among sequences that are <b>diverged</b> by <b>differing</b> degrees. A single matrix may be reasonably efficient over a relatively broad range of evolutionary change.The BLOSUM-62 matrix {{is one of the}} best substitution matrices for detecting weak protein similarities. BLOSUM matrices with high numbers are designed for comparing closely related sequences, while those with low numbers are designed for comparing distant related sequences. For example, BLOSUM-80 is used for alignments that are more similar in sequence, and BLOSUM-45 is used for alignments that have diverged from each other. For particularly long and weak alignments, the BLOSUM-45 matrix may provide the best results. Short alignments are more easily detected using a matrix with a higher [...] "relative entropy" [...] than that of BLOSUM-62. The BLOSUM series does not include any matrices with relative entropies suitable for the shortest queries.|$|R

40|$|The {{bioclimatic}} temperatures {{that mountain}} plants experience {{are very different}} from the macroclimatic temperatures and vary according to the exposition, relief, and growth form. This is shown in the example of boundary layer temperatures recorded in the Tyrolean Alps between the timberline and the nival zone over several years. Microsite temperatures were compared to the air temperatures provided by meteorological stations of the official weather service nearby. In winter plant temperatures below the snow are largely uncoupled from the free air temperatures. During the growing season, across all zones, plant temperatures <b>diverge</b> to <b>differing</b> degrees from free air temperatures depending on the growth form of plants and the canopy structure. In Vaccinietum communities and in closed grassland, average temperature differences between the free air and plant canopy were 0. 5 K in July and August. Prostrate mats of the Loiseleuria heath, rosette and cushion plants, however, heat up much more than erect plants during sunny periods, and mean plant temperatures were about 2 – 3 Kwarmer than the free air temperatures.

50|$|Another {{argument}} is that NaDene, Eskimo, and Aleut linguistic features are more {{similar to those of}} the Chukchi in Siberia than to Amerind linguistic features. This hypothesis suggests that the NaDene, Eskimo, Aleut, and Chukchi peoples descended from a single population, placing the timing of human arrival in North America at 30,000 to 43,000 years ago. It is possible that the Chukchi were isolated from the other linguistic populations due to the rising sea levels and the Na Dene and Aleut-Eskimo <b>diverged</b> due to <b>differing</b> adaptations in result of coastal and inland occupation.

40|$|Abstract Background Wheat leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks; Pt) {{and stem}} rust fungi (P. graminis f. sp. tritici; Pgt) are {{significant}} economic pathogens having similar host ranges and life cycles, but different alternate hosts. The Pt genome, currently estimated at 135 Mb, is significantly larger than Pgt, at 88 Mb, {{but the reason}} for the expansion is unknown. Three genomic loci of Pt conserved proteins were characterized to gain insight into gene content, genome complexity and expansion. Results A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was made from P. triticina race 1, BBBD and probed with Pt homologs of genes encoding two predicted Pgt secreted effectors and a DNA marker mapping to a region of avirulence. Three BACs, 103 Kb, 112 Kb, and 166 Kb, were sequenced, assembled, and open reading frames were identified. Orthologous genes were identified in Pgt and local conservation of gene order (microsynteny) was observed. Pairwise protein identities ranged from 26 to 99 %. One Pt BAC, containing a RAD 18 ortholog, shares syntenic regions with two Pgt scaffolds, which could represent both haplotypes of Pgt. Gene sequence is diverged between the species as well as within the two haplotypes. In all three BAC clones, gene order is locally conserved, however, gene shuffling has occurred relative to Pgt. These regions are further <b>diverged</b> by <b>differing</b> insertion loci of LTR-retrotransposon, Gypsy, Copia, Mutator, and Harbinger mobile elements. Uncharacterized Pt open reading frames were also found; these proteins are high in lysine and similar to multiple proteins in Pgt. Conclusions The three Pt loci are conserved in gene order, with a range of gene sequence divergence. Conservation of predicted haustoria expressed secreted protein genes between Pt and Pgt is extended to the more distant poplar rust, Melampsora larici-populina. The loci also reveal that genome expansion in Pt is in part due to higher occurrence of repeat-elements in this species. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{bluethroat}} Luscinia svecica is {{a particularly}} interesting species {{for the study of}} the mechanisms that control migration because it comprises several recently <b>diverged</b> subspecies that <b>differ</b> in migratory distance and direction. Here we use ringing data to describe the migration strategy and winter distribution of L. s. cyanecula and L. s. namnetum along the eastern Atlantic coast of Iberia and West Africa. No differences were found in autumn migration phenology between subspecies, ages and sexes. However, in contrast to L. s. namnetum, the mean wing length of L. s. cyanecula decreased and its body mass increased during this migratory period. The subspecies also differed in migration speed and stopover behaviour, with L. s. cyanecula travelling faster and refuelling during stopovers. The potential non-stop flight range was greater in L. s. cyanecula and increased with decreasing latitude, which is probably related to the need to overcome geographical barriers to reach the wintering grounds. During winter, the birds captured in sub-Saharan Africa were almost exclusively L. s. cyanecula, whereas L. s. namnetum wintered mainly in Iberia, and the probability of capturing adults increased with decreasing latitude. L. s. cyanecula captured in Africa had longer wings than those migrating through and wintering in Iberia, indicating a leapfrog migration pattern also within L. s. cyanecula populations...|$|R

40|$|Identification of {{candidate}} genes for trait variation in diverging lineages and characterization of mechanistic underpinnings of genome differentiation are key steps toward understanding the processes underlying {{the formation of}} new species. Hybrid zones provide a valuable resource for such investigations, since they allow us to study how genomes evolve as species exchange genetic material and to associate particular genetic regions with phenotypic traits of interest. Here, we use whole-genome resequencing of both allopatric and hybridizing populations of the European (Phylloscopus collybita abietinus) and the Siberian chiffchaff (P. tristis) —two recently <b>diverged</b> species which <b>differ</b> in morphology, plumage, song, habitat, and migration—to quantify the regional variation in genome-wide genetic diversity and differentiation, and to identify candidate regions for trait variation. We find that the levels of diversity, differentiation, and divergence are highly heterogeneous, with significantly reduced global differentiation, and more pronounced differentiation peaks in sympatry than in allopatry. This pattern is consistent with regional differences in effective population size and recurrent background selection or selective sweeps reducing the genetic diversity in specific regions prior to lineage divergence, but the data also suggest that postdivergence selection has resulted in increased differentiation and fixed differences in specific regions. We find that hybridization and backcrossing is common in sympatry, and that phenotype is a poor predictor of the genomic composition of sympatric birds. The combination of a differentiation scan approach with identification of fixed differences pinpoint a handful {{of candidate}} regions that might be important for trait variation between the two species...|$|R

The holes are approximately 3. 12 mm (. 123 in) deep on average with a hole area to surface area ratio of 43 %. The L/d ratio of the seals is approximately 0. 75. Taper designs for the three seals include clearance ratios (CR, exit clearance / inlet clearance) of 1. 00 (straight-bore), 1. 42, and 2. 15. Data is presented for tests taken at 10, 200 rpm, 15, 200 rpm, and 20, 200 rpm and at exit-to-inlet pressure ratios of 40 % and approximately 53 %. Comparisons are given between the three seals for direct and cross-coupled impedances; mass flow rate and effective stiffness and damping coefficients. Results show that an optimum effective damping is obtained with the medium taper geometry. However, the direct damping values are relatively unchanged. Furthermore, a decrease in effective stiffness with increasing taper angle is observed. The tapered seals displayed significantly higher leakage values than the straight seals, with the 2. 15 CR seal showing the highest leakage under all test conditions. Measurement data is compared with theoretical predictions generated with the ISOTSEAL modeling code, using the two-control-volume model developed by Kleynhans and Childs (1997). Impedance data is approximated moderately well by the analytical prediction. Effective stiffness and damping values are closely predicted by theory. Although, peak damping values occur at higher frequencies than predicted. This is likely due to varying hole depths. The 1. 42 CR seal performance is better predicted by theory than the 2. 15 CR seal...|$|R
60|$|When, {{leaving the}} {{development}} of single plants and animals, we pass {{to that of the}} Earth's flora and fauna, the course of our argument again becomes clear and simple. Though, as was admitted {{in the first part of}} this article, the fragmentary facts Paleontology has accumulated, do not clearly warrant us in saying that, in the lapse of geologic time, there have been evolved more heterogeneous organisms, and more heterogeneous assemblages of organisms, yet we shall now see that there must ever have been a tendency towards these results. We shall find that the production of many effects by one cause, which as already shown, has been all along increasing the physical heterogeneity of the Earth, has further involved an increasing heterogeneity in its flora and fauna, individually and collectively. An illustration will make this clear. Suppose that by a series of upheavals, occurring, as they are now known to do, at long intervals, the East Indian Archipelago were to be, step by step, raised into a continent, and a chain of mountains formed along the axis of elevation. By the first of these upheavals, the plants and animals inhabiting Borneo, Sumatra, New Guinea, and the rest, would be subjected to slightly modified sets of conditions. The climate in general would be altered in temperature, in humidity, and in its periodical variations; while the local differences would be multiplied. These modifications would affect, perhaps inappreciably, the entire flora and fauna of the region. The change of level would produce additional modifications: varying in different species, and also in different members of the same species, according to their distance from the axis of elevation. Plants, growing only on the sea-shore in special localities, might become extinct. Others, living only in swamps of a certain humidity, would, if they survived at all, probably undergo visible changes of appearance. While still greater alterations would occur in the plants gradually spreading over the lands newly raised above the sea. The animals and insects living on these modified plants, would themselves be in some degree modified by change of food, as well as by change of climate; and the modification would be more marked where, from the dwindling or disappearance of one kind of plant, an allied kind was eaten. In the lapse of the many generations arising before the next upheaval, the sensible or insensible alterations thus produced in each species would become organized--there would be a more or less complete adaptation to the new conditions. The next upheaval would superinduce further organic changes, implying wider divergences from the primary forms; and so repeatedly. But now let it be observed that the revolution thus resulting would not be a substitution of a thousand more or less modified species for the thousand original species; but in place of the thousand original species there would arise several thousand species, or varieties, or changed forms. Each species being distributed over an area of some extent, and tending continually to colonize the new area exposed, its different members would be subject to different sets of changes. Plants and animals spreading towards the equator would not be affected in the same way as others spreading from it. Those spreading towards the new shores would undergo changes unlike the changes undergone by those spreading into the mountains. Thus, each original race of organisms, would become the root from which <b>diverged</b> several races <b>differing</b> more or less from it and from each other; and while some of these might subsequently disappear, probably more than one would survive in the next geologic period: the very dispersion itself increasing the chances of survival. Not only would there be certain modifications thus caused by change of physical conditions and food, but also in some cases other modifications caused by change of habit. The fauna of each island, peopling, step by step, the newly-raised tracts, would eventually come in contact with the faunas of other islands; and some members of these other faunas would be unlike any creatures before seen. Herbivores meeting with new beasts of prey, would, in some cases, be led into modes of defence or escape differing from those previously used; and simultaneously the beasts of prey would modify their modes of pursuit and attack. We know that when circumstances demand it, such changes of habit do take place in animals; and we know that if the new habits become the dominant ones, they must eventually in some degree alter the organization. Observe now, however, a further consequence. There must arise not simply a tendency towards the differentiation of each race of organisms into several races; but also a tendency to the occasional production of a somewhat higher organism. Taken in the mass these divergent varieties which have been caused by fresh physical conditions and habits of life, will exhibit changes quite indefinite in kind and degree; and changes that do not necessarily constitute an advance. Probably in most cases the modified type will be neither more nor less heterogeneous than the original one. In some cases the habits of life adopted being simpler than before, a less heterogeneous structure will result: there will be a retrogradation. But it must now and then occur, that some division of a species, falling into circumstances which give it rather more complex experiences, and demand actions somewhat more involved, will have certain of its organs further differentiated in proportionately small degrees,--will become slightly more heterogeneous. Thus, in the natural course of things, there will from time to time arise an increased heterogeneity both of the Earth's flora and fauna, and of individual races included in them. Omitting detailed explanations, and allowing for the qualifications which cannot here be specified, we think it is clear that geological mutations have all along tended to complicate the forms of life, whether regarded separately or collectively. The same causes which have led to the evolution of the Earth's crust from the simple into the complex, have simultaneously led to a parallel evolution of the Life upon its surface. In this case, as in previous ones, we see that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous is consequent upon the universal principle, that every active force produces more than one change.|$|R
