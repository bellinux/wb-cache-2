5|$|During the 1949–50 tour of South Africa, Harvey met {{his first}} wife Iris Greenish. At the time, Greenish was only 16 years old and Harvey 21, and their {{relationship}} {{became the subject of}} controversy when her <b>father</b> <b>told</b> the media that he would object to the couple's engagement until his daughter turned 18.

5|$|Two years later, Plante {{was playing}} for five {{different}} teams – the local factory team, and {{teams in the}} midget, juvenile, junior and intermediate categories. Plante demanded a salary from the factory team's coach after his <b>father</b> <b>told</b> him that the other players were being paid because they were company employees. The coach paid Plante 50cents per game to retain him and maintain the team's popularity. Afterwards, Plante began to receive various offers from other teams; he was offered $80 per week—a considerable sum in those days—to play for a team in England, and a similar offer {{to play for the}} Providence Reds of the American Hockey League. Plante passed them up because his parents wanted him to finish high school. He graduated with top honours in 1947. Upon graduation, he {{took a job as a}} clerk in a Shawinigan factory. A few weeks later, the Quebec Citadels offered Plante $85 per week to play for them; he accepted, marking the beginning of his professional career.|$|E

5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His <b>father</b> <b>told</b> him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da's <b>father</b> <b>told</b> Rudi of his son's onetime {{aspiration}} {{to become}} a Lutheran minister. Feeling that he needed better grounding, in 1965 Rudi insisted that he marry Nina, find steady employment, lose weight, end his drug use, and begin preparatory studies to enter the seminary. As a student at Philadelphia's Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1967, Adi Da described undergoing a terrifying breakdown. Taken to a hospital emergency room, a psychiatrist diagnosed it as an anxiety attack. It {{was the first in}} a series of such episodes he would experience throughout his life, each followed by what he explained to be profound awakenings or insights. Feeling none of his Lutheran professors understood this experience, Adi Da left and briefly attended St. Vladimir's Russian Orthodox Seminary in Tuckahoe, New York. Disillusioned, he moved back to New York City and got a job working for Pan American Airlines, in hopes this would facilitate his being able to visit Swami Muktananda's ashram in India. He did so for four days in April 1968. Swami Muktananda encouraged Adi Da to end his studies with Rudi and study with himself directly.|$|E
5|$|Bure {{was born}} in Moscow in 1971 to Vladimir and Tatiana Bure. At age 12, his parents separated, and he {{remained}} with his mother. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school {{at the age of}} six, despite his limited skating ability. Until that point, Bure had only played ball hockey on the streets. After Bure failed to impress in his first tryout, his <b>father</b> <b>told</b> him that if he did not show significant improvement within two months, he would withdraw him from the hockey school. By age 11, he was named the best forward in his league. Around that time, in July 1982, Bure was selected as one of three young Russian players to practice with Wayne Gretzky and Soviet national goaltender Vladislav Tretiak in a taped television special. By the time he was 14 years old, he was named to the Central Red Army's junior team.|$|E

5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's <b>father</b> <b>told</b> the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E

Miller finished the game with two goals and three assists in the win. His brother Drew is currently a free agent and three cousins (Kelly Miller, Kip Miller and Kevin Miller) all played in the NHL.
