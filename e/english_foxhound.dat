It is {{possible}} to use a sight hound such as a Greyhound or lurcher to pursue foxes, though this practice is not common in organised hunting, [...] and these dogs are more often used for coursing animals such as hares. There is also one pack of beagles in Virginia that hunt fox. [...] They are unique {{in that they are}} the only hunting beagle pack in the US to be followed on horseback.

40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) vertebral ratio values representing vertebral canal height, vertebral canal shape, and vertebral body shape in Doberman Pinschers with and without disk-associated cervical spondylomyelopathy (DACSM) and clinically normal <b>English</b> <b>Foxhounds.</b> Animals-Doberman Pinschers with (n = 18) and without (20) DACSM and clinically normal <b>English</b> <b>Foxhounds</b> (18). Procedures-All dogs underwent low-field MRI of the cervical vertebral column. From 5 specific measurements made at C 3 through C 7, 4 linear vertebral ratios were calculated and assessed for correlation: vertebral canal height-to-body height ratio (CBHR), vertebral canal height-to-body length ratio (CBLR), caudal canal height-to-cranial canal height ratio (CCHR), and vertebral body length-to-height ratio (BLHR). The CBHR and CBLR described vertebral canal height, CCHR described vertebral canal shape, and BLHR described vertebral body shape. A midvertebral canal-occupying ratio (mVCOR) for the spinal cord was calculated at C 5. Results-Compared with both groups of unaffected dogs, CBHR, CBLR, and BLHR for Doberman Pinschers with DACSM were significantly smaller. The C 7 CCHR was significantly larger in DACSM-affected Doberman Pinschers, compared with clinically normal <b>English</b> <b>Foxhounds.</b> Ratios {{did not differ significantly}} between unaffected Doberman Pinschers and clinically normal <b>English</b> <b>Foxhounds.</b> Correlation coefficients between CBHR, CBLR, and mVCOR were low and not significant. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Doberman Pinschers with DACSM had significantly smaller vertebral canal heights and more square-shaped vertebral bodies, compared with unaffected Doberman Pinschers, combined with a funnel-shaped vertebral canal at C 7 Breed-specific differences were not evident. Linear MRI vertebral canal-to-body ratios do not appear to predict relative vertebral canal stenosis...|$|R

50|$|The <b>English</b> <b>Foxhound</b> {{was created}} in the late 16th century, {{as a result of the}} {{perception}} of the depletion of deer in England.

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} {{demonstrated that}} {{an outbreak of}} severe respiratory disease in a pack of <b>English</b> <b>foxhounds</b> in the United Kingdom in September 2002 was caused by an equine infl uenza A virus (H 3 N 8). We also demonstrated that canine respiratory tissue possesses the relevant receptors for infection with equine infl uenza virus. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes according to the serologic reactivity of the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (H 1 –H 16) and neuraminidase (N 1 –N 9). Aquatic birds are regarded as the natural reservoir for influenza A viruses; a few mammalian hosts are infected by {{a limited number of}} virus subtypes. The first evidence of the H 3 N 8 subtype, which currently circulates in horses, crossing species barriers was reported after an outbreak of respiratory disease among racing greyhounds in Florida in 2004. Isolation of virus from 1 case and detection of specific antibodies in other cases identified equine influenza virus as the cause of the outbreak (1).

5000|$|Jackal {{coursing}} was {{an occasional}} pastime for sportsmen in British India. <b>English</b> <b>Foxhounds</b> were usually imported to India for the purpose.

5|$|The terrier of {{this period}} was short of leg, built in a chunky fashion, and had a skull that was broad across the top.

Gradually the pace of the hunt became faster, and the terriers were bred with longer legs for more speed {{towards the end of the}} 18th century.

50|$|Sources have widely {{conflicting}} {{stories about}} the origins of this breed.

40|$|Abstract Background Disk-associated {{cervical}} spondylomyelopathy (DA-CSM) is a multifactorial {{neurological disorder}} in which progressive caudal cervical spinal cord compression is {{mainly caused by}} one or more intervertebral disk protrusions. The Doberman pinscher breed seems predisposed for this condition. The underlying cause and pathophysiology of DA-CSM are currently unknown. Recently, wider intervertebral disks have been put forward as a risk factor for development of clinically relevant DA-CSM. However, little is known about other factors affecting intervertebral disk width. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the association between intervertebral disk width, measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and clinical status, age, gender and intervertebral disk location in dogs with and without clinical signs of DA-CSM. Methods Doberman pinschers with clinical signs of DA-CSM (N= 17),clinically normal Doberman pinschers (N= 20), and clinically normal <b>English</b> <b>Foxhounds</b> (N = 17), underwent MRI of the cervical vertebral column. On sagittal T 2 -weighted images, intervertebral disk width was measured from C 2 -C 3 to C 6 -C 7. Intra –and interobserver agreement were assessed on a subset of 20 of the 54 imaging studies. Results Intervertebral disk width was not significantly different between Doberman pinschers with clinical signs of DA-CSM, clinically normal Doberman pinschers or clinically normal <b>English</b> <b>Foxhounds</b> (p= 0. 43). Intervertebral disk width was positively associated with increasing age (p= 0. 029). Each monthly increase in age resulted in an increase of disk width by 0. 0057 mm. Intervertebral disk width was not significantly affected by gender (p= 0. 056), but was significantly influenced by intervertebral disk location (p Conclusions The present study does not provide evidence that wider intervertebral disks are associated with clinical status in dogs with and without DA-CSM. Instead, it seems that cervical intervertebral disk width in dogs is positively associated with increase in age. </p...|$|R
