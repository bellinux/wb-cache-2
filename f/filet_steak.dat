50|$|Beef Wellington is a {{preparation}} of <b>filet</b> <b>steak</b> coated with pâté (often pâté de foie gras) and duxelles, {{which is then}} wrapped in puff pastry and baked. Some recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a crêpe to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy.|$|E

Asparagus soup with plenty of shredded carrot and onion sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, tilapia in escargot sauce and <b>filet</b> <b>steak</b> with fresh mushroom and baby potatoes are also popular in these restaurants.|$|E

50|$|The shooter's {{sandwich}} is a steak sandwich {{prepared by}} filling a hollowed-out long {{loaf of bread}} with cooked <b>filet</b> mignon <b>steak,</b> cooked mushrooms, salt and pepper. Weights are then placed atop the sandwich to squeeze it down, and it is typically left weighed down overnight, which causes the juices from the meat to soak into the bread.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of Persian-style kabob, the main one being kubideh kabob, which is {{seasoned}} ground beef that is skewered and barbecued outside on a charcoal flame. There is also a marinated chicken kabob called jujeh kabob, and a <b>filet</b> mignon <b>steak</b> kabob called kabob barg. Both are skewered as well. All three main types of Persian kabob are usually served with Iranian style saffron rice and salad Shirazi, but can also be eaten with Middle Eastern lavash bread.|$|R
50|$|Beef {{skeletal}} muscle meat {{can be cut}} into roasts, short ribs or <b>steak</b> (<b>filet</b> mignon, sirloin <b>steak,</b> rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.). Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden {{where there is a}} danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.|$|R
50|$|The term {{may also}} be used in France to denote the sirloin cut {{properly}} known as a contre-filet, being {{the portion of the}} sirloin {{on the opposite side of}} the bone from the filet, or tenderloin. In English, a steak cut from the contre-filet may be called a Porterhouse steak (as the term is understood in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), a sirloin steak, a strip steak, a striploin steak, a wing steak, a club steak, a Delmonico steak, a New York strip steak. or a Kansas City strip steak. As well, if the contre-filet is left on the bone with the <b>filet,</b> the entire <b>steak</b> is called a Porterhouse steak (as the term is understood in the United States and Canada) or a T-bone steak.|$|R
40|$|This thesis solves a {{question}} of ostrich breeding and carcass processing of ostrich meat. Furthermore the quality of ostrich meat and its position on today market. Ostrich is the biggest living bird on earth whose meat is red and very similar to beef composition but properties are more similar to poultry meat. Ostrich meat, compared to other animal meat, contain low percentage of fat, cholesterol and proteins. For most kind of meat with low fat reflected {{at the expense of}} subtlety, but ostrich meat is an exception. Despite its dietary character it provides full-value proteins and important vitamins B. The best quality meat comes from ostriches in the age of 9 ? 14 months, who reached weight of 90 - 120 kg. The meat gain in the age of 14 months ranges about 32 kg and 42 kg in adult ostriches. Substantial part of the marketable meat comes from ostrich legs (74 %). Ostrich meat unlike beef meat is sold in individual muscles. Meat is divided into <b>steaks,</b> <b>filets,</b> biltong and meat for smoked production...|$|R
40|$|Shark populations {{worldwide}} {{are suspected}} {{to be in}} severe decline due to domestic and international markets for trade in shark products, especially dried fins in Asian markets, {{and as a result}} of bycatch mortality in multi-species fisheries. The management of sharks on a species-specific basis has become imperative for shark conservation, particularly in regions where numerous species are heavily fished, because sharks with differing life-history characteristics respond differently to exploitation. However, many commercially exploited sharks are morphologically similar and not easily identifiable to the species level. This problem is exacerbated when it comes to identifying detached fins, processed carcasses (logs), and <b>filets</b> or <b>steaks</b> at the dock or in trade. To address these species-identification problems and make available an accurate but practical, DNA-based forensic method for use in conservation and management of sharks, I have developed a highly streamlined genetic assay based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and species-specific primers derived from interspecific DNA sequence differences in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS 2) locus of sharks. This forensic assay allows accurate identification of body parts from ten shark species commonly exploited worldwide for their meat and/or fins. In this thesis, I report on the development and use of this assay in the form of two separate suites of species-specific PCR primers that can be used in a high-density multiplex format to achieve rapid and accurate species identification. Chapter 1 of this thesis describes a suite of species-specific primers and multiplex PCR assay that simultaneously distinguishes among seven pelagic shark species: four species of mackerel sharks: shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), longfin mako (Isurus paucus), porbeagle (Lamna nasus) and salmon (Lamna ditropis); and the three species of alopiid (thresher) sharks: common thresher (Alopias vulpinus), bigeye thresher (Alopias superciliosus) and pelagic thresher (Alopias pelagicus). The second species-specific primer suite, described in chapter 2, simultaneously identifies the three globally distributed and most commercially important species of hammerheads: the great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), scalloped hammerhead (Sphyna lewini) and the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena). The species-specific PCR primers and forensic approach described here provide an efficient, straightforward technique that can be used in conservation and management relevant contexts where large volumes of samples need to be screened quickly. Preliminary testing of dried fins from the Hong Kong market and confiscated fins from U. S. and South African law enforcement activities suggests that this genetic technique will be useful for large-scale survey applications, such as monitoring the species composition of the fin trade as well as improving fisheries law enforcement capabilities. The efficient nature of the general forensic approach reported here may also make it useful as a model applicable to monitoring trade in other wildlife products on a global scale...|$|R
