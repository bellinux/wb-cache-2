The Metropole is a roccoco ballroom which has operated as a public gallery since 1950, hosting exhibitions by Henry Moore, Bridget Riley, Tacita Dean, Michael Landy. Artists were invited to make a direct response to the space exploring the relation between contemporary practice and decoration. I installed a 30 ft in situ work The Black Sun in the Weed Garden interacting with the plasterwork of the venue and posing questions about the processes and field relations of painting. Alongside Frenzy I co-organised a screening The Devil is in the Detail which included my animation The Eye of a Dream: a key {{in the development of the}} installed work, both a tool of production and a reformulation of the elements of the site specific piece. The animation was subsequently shown <b>in</b> <b>Transiti,</b> Spaca Cultura, Hotel Aemilia, Bologna, Italy and reproduced in a press review, then at London Assembly L’Academie Royale des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, 2007. The Black Sun was reproduced in the review in the Guardian Guide and also used as the poster for London Assembly. Five Years is an artist led collective operating from London since 1999 and now based in Hackney alongside MOT and Transition Galleries. I have worked closely with 5 Years since its inception and was invited in 2007 to become a member of the committee. Five Years has provided a space for my research into painting as collaborative, site-specific and event-based practice. My exhibitions there have included :Drop-Out, 2001,The Difference Between You 2001 and Us,,Or Not 2002, Sound and Visions 2002, The Invention of Painting 2002. Goo Goo Muck 2007. and a solo show Huis Clos 2007...|$|E
40|$|The {{first year}} of {{teaching}} is the deciding factor w hether a new teacher will embrace this noble profession or quit {{at the end of}} the school year. N o matter how equipped a beginning teacher is, there are intricacies and challenges that arise especially in the first few months of being in the battleground called classroom. Studying the liv ed experience of new teachers can serve a two-fold purpose: it can be therapeutic on their pa rt and it can help improve the experiential learning courses of undergraduate students. Using a hermeneutic phenomenological design, this study aims to explore on the meaning of lived experience of 20 De La Salle Lipa Education graduates batch 2014 employed in various schools within and outside the province of Batangas. Following Lichtman’s (2006) six-step p rocess of Codes, Categories and Concepts, key themes illuminated from the study: th e real classroom is an entirely different world, the first step to teaching is really full of challenges, some positive personal traits are essential to survive teaching, teaching competencie s are crucial in the practice of the teaching profession and Lasallian education plays an importa nt role in creating a positive attitude towards teaching and <b>in</b> facilitating their <b>transiti</b> on to it. Results will be important in enhancing current practices in teaching pedagogy co urses and in designing interventions necessary for curriculum improvement...|$|R
