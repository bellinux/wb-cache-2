500|$|Gilliam {{used the}} same filmmaking style as he had in Brazil (1985), {{including}} the art direction and cinematography (specifically using fresnel lenses). The appearance of the interrogation room where Cole is being interviewed by the scientists {{was based on the}} work of Lebbeus Woods; these scenes were shot at three different power stations (two in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore). Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a [...] "nightmarish intervention of technology. You try to see the faces on the screens in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> but the real faces and voices are down there and you have these tiny voices in your ear. To me that's the world we live in, the way we communicate these days, through technical devices that pretend to be about communication but may not be." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Georgia Taylor {{was cast}} as Toyah {{and the role}} marked her acting debut. Taylor was {{studying}} for her A-levels when she originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall. She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I just sat there open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It is all very different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't right there in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At {{the time of her}} casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E
500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, Łukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel it in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> and you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E

In an interview Sackheim commented on the Jon and Sansa reunion stating [...] "Sometimes as a director, you're just looking at what's in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> and not {{taking into account the}} bigger picture and the epic nature of two siblings who have been separated for six seasons — and have never had scenes together, and were both really looking forward to it — reuniting. The only note I gave them during the scene was, [...] "Hold yourself back. As much as it's joyous to see each other, you're equally as scared. You don't know what to expect."

He then handed the band a fragile 78rpm 10-inch acetate record. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and planned to put it up for auction at Sotheby's, but sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. McCartney later had the two songs digitally re-mastered and pressed 50 copies, giving them to friends as a Christmas present, although the two songs were released on 21 November 1995, as part of The Beatles Anthology (Anthology 1). McCartney later said, [...] "The strangest thing for me, listening to it, is that it's like drowning, it's like your life flashing by in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> From the earliest things by me and John when we used to sag off school and the earliest demo tape we ever made, to the first little record we made which was a version of John singing [...] "That'll Be The Day", and a little song of mine [...] on the other side that's never been released before." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, the NHL and NHLPA honoured Näslund with a tribute and {{ceremonial}} puck drop prior to a game held in Stockholm, Sweden, between the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets. Several months later, the Canucks retired his number 19 jersey prior to a home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on 11 December 2010. Attending the on-ice ceremony were his wife, three children, parents and sister, as well as former Canucks teammates, coaches and executives. The night included a video tribute highlighting his hockey career, speeches from team personalities and gift presentations from the organization. In honour of Näslund and his wife's past philanthropy in the Vancouver community, the team also announced the establishment of a sports equipment centre for underprivileged children. [...] Prior to the jersey raising, Näslund thanked those involved in his career. Reflecting on his career, he commented, [...] "Young hockey players from northern Sweden never dream of a night like this...To go from sitting up in the press box as a healthy scratch to be standing here in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> is quite amazing."

500|$|Shane Rangi as Asterius the Minotaur and Josh Campbell as {{the voice}} of Asterius. An elderly minotaur who aids Caspian. He is killed during the raid while holding the gate open to allow some of the army to escape. Rangi also stood in for Aslan, the Bulgy Bear, the Werewolf, another Minotaur, and the Wild Bear on set. Rangi played General Otmin in the {{previous}} film and Tavros in The Voyage of The Dawn Treader. He was able to see more in the redesigned animatronic minotaur heads, though [...] "in order to make the eye line straight and correct, you've actually got to hold your head down, so your view is only about {{a foot and a half}} in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> which still makes it a little bit hard". This resulted in Rangi knocking himself against the rising gate of the Telmarine castle, although he was fine and it was the animatronic head that bore the brunt of the damage. The costumes were still very hot, reducing him to a [...] "walking waterfall". Although a head sculpt of Aslan was used to stand in for the character on the first film, Rangi had to portray the character on set because Lucy interacts with him more. Rangi lost four kilograms wearing all his costumes.|$|E
500|$|Some {{television}} {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic about the}} episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as I want this show {{to find some way}} to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son get shot in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{time-frame}} of {{the original}} band's career, Van der Graaf Generator have been frequently {{referred to as a}} progressive rock band. Writing in Record Collector, Toby Manning said the music was [...] "philosophical, even intellectual, complex [...]. at times, terrifying". While the music on The Aerosol Grey Machine (September 1969) has a more pastoral, hippie feel, with prominent use of Hammill's acoustic guitar, later work featured more complex instrumentation and arrangements. Hammill thinks the style of the band evolved due to the culture of music in the late 1960s, stating [...] "the whole of music was laid out in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you...</b> it was the blues in wonky time signatures." [...] Both Hammill and Banton have stated that Jimi Hendrix was an influence on the band's sound, with Hammill remarking that [...] "there'd been distortion before, but there hadn't been that real out-there attitude to sound in itself". The group's experimental style has also been compared to Krautrock bands such as Can. Because of their musical influences and line-up, the band tended to play darker musical themes than other progressive bands, {{with the possible exception of}} King Crimson. However, Hammill has stated that the group is still fun to work with, stating [...] "as far as we're concerned, it's serious fun, but fun nonetheless." ...|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London, with Madonna and co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Engineer David Reitzas performed the mixing of the track at Larrabee North Studios, utilizing their Solid State Logic 9000 J series consoles for the mix. For the first day's sessions, music supervisor David Caddick suggested to record [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] with the 84 piece orchestra backing Madonna's vocals. However, Lloyd Webber was critical of [...] the recording arrangements done in the studio. The cast was also nervous. Flick noted that Banderas found the experience [...] "scary" [...] while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterwards. I thought I had done a terrible job", the singer recalled. Conductor John Mauceri remembered another challenge the production faced was adapting the stage numbers into a feature film; [...] "On film, it's different than being on stage because the person on the screen in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> is never farther than someone on the pillow in bed next to you". Parker declared the first day of recording as [...] "Black Monday", since it was [...] "filled with trepidation and nerves... All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were very apprehensive".|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1854, in {{the centre}} of the city, Haussmann's workers tore down {{hundreds}} of old buildings and cut eighty kilometres of new avenues, connecting the central points of the city. Buildings along these avenues were required to be the same height and in a similar style, and to be faced with cream-coloured stone, creating the signature look of Paris boulevards. Baron Haussmann achieved Paris being of a particular shape, uniform. Victor Hugo mentioned that it was hardly possible to distinguish what the house in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> was for: theatre, shop or library.
