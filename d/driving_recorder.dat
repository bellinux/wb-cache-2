40|$|In {{order to}} examine factors that caused vehicle-cyclist {{collisions}}, vehicle-cyclist collisions at intersections that were recorded on a car <b>driving</b> <b>recorder</b> were {{compared to that of}} near-miss incidents. It was found that unless the cyclist took action to avoid the collision, collisions occur when the car needed a deceleration of 9. 8 m/s 2 or more to avoid the collision. Two different types of collisions were observed: delays of drivers to start braking after a cyclist is present, and the sudden appearance of the cyclist. The percentage of incidents where the cyclist suddenly appeared was higher in collisions cases compared to near-miss incidents...|$|E

Significant correlations were observed between the driving instructor's evaluation for actual driving and occupational therapist's evaluation for drive recorder images. The results also demonstrated that those whose driving instructor's evaluation scores were low tended to show high self-evaluation prior to the actual driving test, Pre-test high self-evaluation decreased in the post-test evaluation. The present study suggest that self-evaluation for driving behavior is significantly contributing to the safe and appropriate driving behaviors in the elderly drivers...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 We propose an {{automatic}} system which dynamically tracks video objects (human and vehicle) and create their 3 -D visualization from big visual data. Big visual data implies that all videos are collected from either static or mobile surveillance cameras. Our {{goal is to}} track a video object within such a surveillance camera network. To achieve this goal, several tracking scenarios must be carefully dealt with. In this work, we focus on tracking under a single static camera, tracking under a single moving camera, and tracking across multiple moving cameras. In the case of tracking under a single static camera, our proposed work is mainly based on constrained multiple-kernel tracking framework. For human tracking, the system adopts a Kalman filter to predict and refine the tracking results. A pre-trained human detector is further applied to solve initial merging issues. For human tracking across multiple static cameras, a self-organized and scalable multiple-camera tracking system that tracks human across cameras with nonoverlapping views is proposed. For vehicle tracking, our proposed approach regards each patch of the 3 -D vehicle model as a kernel, and track the kernels under certain constraints facilitated with the 3 -D geometry of the vehicle model. Meanwhile, a kernel density estimator is designed to fit the 3 -D vehicle model during tracking. By elegant application of the constrained multiple-kernel (CMK) tracking facilitated with the 3 -D vehicle model, the vehicles are able to be tracked efficiently and located precisely. As for tracking under a single moving camera, we propose a robust moving platform based object tracking system, and apply to human tracking. Our work effectively integrates Visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping, pedestrian detection, ground plane estimation, and kernel-based tracking techniques. The proposed system systematically detects the pedestrians from recorded video frames and tracks the pedestrians in the V-SLAM inferred 3 -D space via a tracking-by-detection scheme. In order to efficiently associate the detected pedestrian frame-by-frame, we propose a novel tracking framework, combining the CMK tracking and the estimated 3 -D (depth) information, to globally optimize the data association between consecutive frames. By {{taking advantage of the}} appearance model and 3 -D information, the proposed system not only achieves high effectiveness but also handles efficiently occlusion in the tracking. Based on the results of tracking under a single moving camera, we propose a new framework to track on-road pedestrians across multiple <b>driving</b> <b>recorders.</b> More specifically, we treat the problem as a multi-label classification task, determining whether a specific pedestrian belongs to one or several cameras’ field of views by considering the association likelihood of the tracked pedestrians. The likelihood is calculated based on the pedestrians’ motion cues and appearance features, which are necessarily transformed via brightness transfer functions obtained by some available spatially overlapping views for compensating for the diversity of the cameras. When a pedestrian is leaving a camera’s field of view, the proposed framework predicts and interpolates the possible moving trajectories facilitated by an open map service which can provide routing information. Moreover, based on the GPS locations, we can also reconstruct a 3 -D visualization on a 3 -D virtual real-world environment, so as to show the dynamic scenes of the recorded videos...|$|R

We analyzed eye movement data of a driving instructor {{when he drove}} a vehicle equipped with a <b>driving</b> <b>recorder</b> and four cameras, Through conducting hearing survey with the recorded images and analyzing the experimental data, we concluded that the instructor assumed crossing bicycles closed to a pedestrian crossing from four directions and he checked the existence of crossing bicycles by three steps. Finally, we revealed the sequence of normative precautionary observation which could prevent the accidents with crossing bicycles in all directions...|$|E
40|$|OVERVIEW: Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the practical application of ACC (adaptive cruise control) systems, which measure the following distance to the preceding vehicle by radar and automatically maintain an appropriate following distance, and lane keeping systems, which recognize lanes using vision sensors and keep the vehicle from deviating from the lane. Current systems are based on the premise of highway driving, but in the future, we can expect that these systems will come to be used on regular roads as well, in pursuit of even greater safety and comfort. Achieving this goal will require advancements in various related fields, including: (1) technologies for accurately recognizing the environment surrounding the vehicle; (2) technologies for controlling the vehicle’s speed by controlling engine, transmission, and brake operations; and (3) technologies for controlling vehicle dynamics. In “vehicle dynamics control, ” driving dynamics information is passed between various components via an on-board network. Services are gradually being developed to analyze and utilize this driving dynamics information based on ITs (see Fig. 1). Hitachi, Ltd. is developing three types of sensor technologies for recognizing the conditions around the vehicle: millimeter wave radar, vision sensors, and sensor fusion. The company is also developing technologies for controlling the vehicle’s movements, as well as <b>driving</b> <b>recorder</b> technologies for analyzing vehicle dynamics control information (physical values recorded in the <b>driving</b> <b>recorder</b> that express the vehicle’s behavior) and diagnosing driving conditions and drivers ’ characteristics, and services that apply these technologies...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an automatic region detection based method to reconstruct street scenes from <b>driving</b> <b>recorder</b> images. The <b>driving</b> <b>recorder</b> {{in this paper}} is a dashboard camera that collects images while the motor vehicle is moving. An enormous number of moving vehicles {{are included in the}} collected data because the typical recorders are often mounted in the front of moving vehicles and face the forward direction, which can make matching points on vehicles and guardrails unreliable. Believing that utilizing these image data can reduce street scene reconstruction and updating costs because of their low price, wide use, and extensive shooting coverage, we therefore proposed a new method, which is called the Mask automatic detecting method, to improve the structure results from the motion reconstruction. Note that we define vehicle and guardrail regions as “mask” in this paper since the features on them should be masked out to avoid poor matches. After removing the feature points in our new method, the camera poses and sparse 3 D points that are reconstructed with the remaining matches. Our contrast experiments with the typical pipeline of structure from motion (SfM) reconstruction methods, such as Photosynth and VisualSFM, demonstrated that the Mask decreased the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the pairwise matching results, which led to more accurate recovering results from the camera-relative poses. Removing features from the Mask also increased the accuracy of point clouds by nearly 30 %– 40 % and corrected the problems of the typical methods on repeatedly reconstructing several buildings when there was only one target building...|$|E
40|$|Adolescence {{is often}} seen as a period of higher risk-taking, which may {{contribute}} to the high rate of motor vehicle crash mortality among US adolescents. In Vehicle <b>Driving</b> <b>Recorder</b> (IVDR) technology is an increasingly popular research tool for objectively measuring risky driving. The participants (n = 106) in this study were a subsample of participants from wave 4 of the NEXT Generation Health Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study. A DriveCam Vehicle Event Recorder (VER) was installed in their personal cars. The VER contained, among other technologies, an accelerometer which measured longitudinal and lateral acceleration. The rate of extreme g-force events was recorded and a median split of this rate was used to create a dichotomous variable (high- vs. low-rate groups), which was the dependent variable in a logistic regression. The primary independent variable was alcohol use. When controlling for gender and mileage also included in the model, alcohol use was significantly [Odds ratio = 1. 72, p <. 05] associated with higher risk g-force events. Increased amounts of alcohol use were associated with a greater likelihood of being in the high g-force-rate group. With the use of a newly developed technology, these findings affirm previous reports that alcohol use and risky driving are associated, suggesting a common pattern of risk taking behavior among adolescents...|$|E
