40|$|The {{angle and}} {{amplitude}} changes for acoustic waves refracted by a circular open jet shear layer were determined. The generalized refraction theory was assessed experimentally for on axis and off axis acoustic source locations as source frequency varied from 1 kHz to 10 kHz and free stream Mach number varied from 0. 1 to 0. 4. Angle and amplitude changes across the shear layer show good agreement with theory. Experiments {{confirm that the}} refraction theory is independent of shear layer thickness, acoustic source frequency, and source type. A generalized theory is, thus, available for correcting far field noise data acquired in open jet test facilities. The effect of <b>discrete</b> <b>tone</b> scattering by the open jet turbulent shear layer was also studied. Scattering effects were investigated over the same Mach number range as frequency varied from 5 kHz to 15 kHz. Attenuation of <b>discrete</b> <b>tone</b> amplitude and tone broadening were measured {{as a function of}} acoustic source position and radiation angle. Scattering was found to be stronger at angles close to the open jet axis than at 90 deg, and becomes stronger as the acoustic source position shifts downstream.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of turbulent velocity fluctuations of the inflow with rotor blades {{and the resulting}} acoustic radiation is examined in terms of: dipole sources due to blade loading, monopole sources due to thickness of the rotating blades, and quadrupole sources due to velocity fluctuations in the flow region. Depending upon the length and time scales of the turbulence, sufficient number of blades may interact with a coherent eddy to radiate noise with discrete peaks at blade passing frequency and its harmonics. Theoretical estimates of acoustic radiation to on-axis points from a typical subsonic rotor are presented, and {{it is noted that}} the <b>discrete</b> <b>tone</b> noise is primarily from dipole radiation. <b>Discrete</b> <b>tone</b> noise levels observed in narrow band analysis of test data show reasonable agreement with analytical predictions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{generation}} of <b>discrete</b> acoustic <b>tones</b> in the compressible flow around an aerofoil is {{addressed in this}} work by means of nonlinear numerical simulations and global stability analyses. The nonlinear simulations confirm the appearance of <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> in the acoustic spectrum and, for the chosen flow case, the global stability analyses of the mean-flow dynamics reveal that the linearized operator is stable. However, the flow response to incoming disturbances exhibits important transient growth effects that culminate in the onset of aeroacoustic feedback loops, involving instability processes on the suction- and pressure-surface boundary layers together with their cross-interaction by acoustic radiation at the trailing edge. The features of the aeroacoustic feedback loops {{and the appearance of}} <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> are then related to the features of the least-stable modes in the global spectrum: the spatial structure of the direct modes displays the coupled dynamics of hydrodynamic instabilities on the suction surface and in the near wake.

40|$|The {{reduction}} is discussed of the <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> generated by jet engines which {{is essential for}} jet aircraft to meet present and proposed noise standards. The <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> generated by the blades and vanes propagate in the inlet and exhaust duct {{in the form of}} spiraling acoustic waves, or spinning modes. The reduction of these spinning modes by the cancellation effect of the combination of two acoustic fields was investigated. The spinning mode synthesizer provided the means for effective study of this noise reduction scheme. Two sets of electrical-acoustical transducers located in an equally-spaced circular array simultaneously generate a specified spinning mode and the cancelling mode. Analysis of the wave equation for the synthesizer established the optimum cancelling array acoustic parameters for maximum sound pressure level reduction. The parameter dependence of the frequency ranges of propagation of single, specified circumferential modes generated by a single array, and of effective cancellation of the modes generated by two arrays, was determined. Substantial sound pressure level reduction was obtained for modes within these limits...|$|R

The acoustic characteristics are obtained from far- and near-field measurements with an array of microphones in an anechoic chamber. First the effects of incorporating a step between the annular exit slot and the Coanda surface are investigated. The step is incorporated to ensure that the breakaway pressure is raised to a level well above the maximum operating pressure. It substantially increases the complexity of the flow field and acoustic characteristics. In particular, it promotes the generation of two groups of <b>discrete</b> <b>tones.</b> A theoretical model based on a self-generated feedback loop is proposed to explain how these tones are generated.

40|$|The {{discrete}} frequency sound {{produced by the}} flow of air at low subsonic speeds over a deep cavity was investigated. A long aspect ratio rectangular cavity with a leading edge overhang that cut off of the cavity opening was placed flush with the top surface of a wind tunnel. The approach flow velocity was maintained at 50 m/s for the benchmark problem although results are also presented for other conditions. Boundary layer measurements conducted with a single element hotwire anemometer indicated that the boundary layer thickness just upstream of the cavity was equal to 17 mm. Sound pressure level measurements were made at three locations in the cavity: {{the center of the}} leading edge wall, the center of the cavity floor, and the center of the trailing edge wall. Three <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> were measured at all three locations with corresponding Strouhal numbers (based on cavity opening length and approach flow velocity) equal to 0. 24, 0. 26, and 0. 41.

40|$|The factors {{influencing}} the stream segregation of <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> {{and the perceived}} continuity of <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> as continuing through an interrupting masker are well understood as separate phenomena. Two experiments tested whether perceived continuity can influence the build-up of stream segregation by manipulating the perception of continuity during an induction sequence and measuring streaming in a subsequent test sequence comprising three triplets of low and high frequency tones (LHL-[ellipsis (horizontal) ]). For experiment 1, a 1. 2 -s standard induction sequence comprising six 100 -ms L-tones strongly promoted segregation, whereas a single extended L-inducer (1. 1 s plus 100 -ms silence) did not. Segregation {{was similar to that}} following the single extended inducer when perceived continuity was evoked by inserting noise bursts between the individual tones. Reported segregation increased when the noise level was reduced such that perceived continuity no longer occurred. Experiment 2 presented a 1. 3 -s continuous inducer created by bridging the 100 -ms silence between an extended L-inducer and the first test-sequence tone. This configuration strongly promoted segregation. Segregation was also increased by filling the silence after the extended inducer with noise, such that it was perceived like a bridging inducer. Like physical continuity, perceived continuity can promote or reduce test-sequence streaming, depending on stimulus context.

40|$|Under certain {{parameter}} regime, aerofoil flows {{can display}} substantial levels of noise radiation. In {{the case of}} moderate-to-high Reynolds number, small angles of incidence and low-turbulence incoming flow, experiments {{have shown that the}} acoustic spectrum is characterized by strong <b>discrete</b> <b>tones.</b> Such phenomenon, known as 'tonal noise', is associated with the ringing of coherent structures near the trailing edge, and involves complex interaction between hydrodynamic features of separated boundary layers and acoustics radiation in the near wake (Nash et al., 1999). However, owing to the limitations and shortcomings of classical hydrodynamic stability theory, a complete description of tonal noise phenomenon is still missing. In this work, the tonal noise phenomenon is analysed by means of global stability theory applied to the flow around a NACA 0012 aerofoil section at 2 degrees of incidence, Reynolds number 200000 and Mach number 0. 4. The nonlinear simulations confirm the appearance of equally-spaced <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> in the acoustic spectrum, and the impulse response of the linearized operator shows the existence of aeroacoustic feedback loops involving the dynamics of the pressure surface, the suction surface of the aerofoil together with acoustic radiation at the trailing edge. These features will be described in terms of the features of the global spectrum of the linearized operator and the spatial structure of direct and adjoint global modes.

In contrast, inactivation of the LA disrupted conditioning to the <b>discrete</b> <b>tone</b> CS, but also either impaired or enhanced contextual conditioning, {{depending on whether}} the context was in the foreground or in the background. Hence, these findings refine the current model of the amygdala function in emotional learning by showing that the BLA and the LA not only differentially contribute to elemental and context–US association, but also promote, through their interaction, the most relevant of these two associations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Discrete</b> <b>tone</b> sound {{generation}} in a subsonic fan subject to three-dimensional disturbances is investigated.

40|$|Several noise {{criteria}} methods {{commonly used in}} architectural acoustics have been quantitatively related to human noise perception and task performance {{under a variety of}} heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems-induced background noise conditions. The five criteria examined were: Noise Criteria (NC), Balanced Noise Criteria (NCB), Room Criteria (RC), Room Criteria Mark II (RC Mark II), and A-weighted Equivalent Sound Pressure Level (LAeq). ^ The project was completed over three phases. Phase I included twelve background noise conditions controlled to be non-varying over time and non-tonal, while exhibiting neutral, rumbly, roaring, or hissy characteristics. Phase II was conducted as an intermediate study to examine specifically the effects of exposure time length and types of performance tasks used. Phase III investigated the effects of background noise exposures containing various levels of <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> across a frequency range from 120 to 595 Hz. Under each noise condition, subjects completed performance tasks and answered questions about their perception of the acoustic environment. ^ Results show that task performance is significantly affected by occupant perception of noise, but this relationship is not fully demonstrated by the criteria systems analyzed. It was also found that the five criteria analyzed are generally well suited in describing subjective loudness perception, but that some discrepancies in criteria ratings of spectral quality and subjective perception exist. Finally, perception of annoyance and tonality changed based on the frequency and prominence of <b>discrete</b> <b>tones</b> in noise, but these changes were not reflected in the criteria level or spectral quality ratings.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In a {{previous}} continuation tapping study (Ammirante, Thompson, & Russo, in press), each tap triggered a <b>discrete</b> <b>tone</b> {{in a sequence}} randomly varying in pitch height and contour. Although participants were instructed to ignore the tones, pitch distance and pitch contour influenced intertap interval (ITI) and tap velocity (TV). The current study replicated these findings with original melodies. Results were interpreted as an effect of apparent tonal motion, with deviation in ITI and TV mirroring implied tonal acceleration. Due to overlapping perceptual and motor representations, participants may have failed to disambiguate acceleration implied by tonal motion from the acceleration of their finger trajectory. Dissociative effects of pitch distance on ITI and pitch contour on TV implied that pitch distance influences the initial finger extension while pitch contour influences later finger flexion. Acceleration in ITI and TV were also both correlated with melodic accent strength values from perceptual data (Thomassen, 1982), suggesting that perception and production of melodic accent emerge from shared action associations...|$|E

40|$|Closed form {{asymptotic}} expressions for computing {{high frequency}} noise generated by an annular cascade in an infinite duct containing a uniform flow are presented. There are two new elements in this work. First, the annular duct mode representation does not rely on the often-used Bessel function expansion resulting in simpler expressions for both the radial eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the duct. In particular, the new representation provides an explicit approximate formula for the radial eigenvalues obviating the need for solutions of the transcendental annular duct eigenvalue equation. Also, the radial eigenfunctions are represented in terms of exponentials eliminating the numerical problems associated with generating the Bessel functions on a computer. The second new element is {{the construction of an}} unsteady response model for an annular cascade. The new construction satisfies the boundary conditions on both the cascade and duct walls simultaneously adding a new level of realism to the noise calculations. Preliminary results which demonstrate the effectiveness of the new elements are presented.
