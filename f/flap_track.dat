50|$|Modern jet {{aircraft}} use supercritical airfoils which decrease wave drag significantly. Further optimization {{can be achieved}} through careful design of wing body fairings, engine nacelles, <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairings, and wingtip fuel tanks. Due to the prevalence of supercritical airfoils, other design features with {{the sole purpose of}} minimizing wave drag (such as the anti-shock bodies on the Convair 990) are rare in modern aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Most jet airliners have a {{cruising}} speed between Mach 0.8 and 0.85. For aircraft {{operating in the}} transonic regime (about Mach 0.8-1.2), wave drag can be minimized by having a cross-sectional area which changes smoothly {{along the length of}} the aircraft. This is known as the area rule. On subsonic aircraft such as jet airliners, this can be achieved by the addition of smooth pods on the trailing edges of the wings. These pods are known as anti-shock bodies, Küchemann Carrots, or <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairings, as they enclose the mechanisms for deploying the wing flaps.|$|E

It was flown to Australia for analysis. It was later found on a Boeing manual sheet that that piece had a stencilled code 676EB, which was an inboard <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> wing fairing located aft of the right hand outboard flap on the right wing. Later in March, Australian officials said that it was highly likely that both pieces of debris were from Flight 370, and Malaysian authorities confirmed that with almost certainty it had originated from the flight; transport Minister Darren Chester said that investigators had found the pieces were consistent with panels from a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft. On 24 March 2016, the Geoscience Australia and ATSB confirmed that two panels recovered from Mozambique match that of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777. The location where both pieces were retrieved was found to be consistent with the drift model performed by CSIRO, further corroborating it could have come from Flight 370. In April 2016, the Australian analysis concluded that the Mozambique debris had [...] "almost certainly" [...] originated from the aircraft. The items have been identified as coming from the right stabiliser and right wing respectively.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} a {{continuation}} of the NASA AFC-Enabled Simplified High-Lift System Integration Study contract (NNL 10 AA 05 B) performed by Boeing under the Fixed Wing Project. This task is motivated by the simplified high-lift system, which is advantageous due to the simpler mechanical system, reduced actuation power and lower maintenance costs. Additionally, the removal of the <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairings associated with conventional high-lift systems renders a more efficient aerodynamic configuration. Potentially, these benefits translate to a approx. 2. 25 % net reduction in fuel burn for a twin-engine, long-range airplane...|$|E
40|$|Methods are {{presented}} for reducing {{time and effort}} when performing aerodynamic optimisation using response surface models. Significant time savings are made possible by monitoring the convergence of computational fluid dynamics simulations and omitting regions of poor designs. In so doing, optimal regions of the design space can be highlighted and surface refinement commenced early in the convergence of the design point set. A strategy employing surface updates with new data at points of maximum expected improvement is shown to perform more efficiently than reducing the design space to {{the region of the}} optimum. The response surface evolution methods are demonstrated through an example two parameter optimisation of a <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairing on a commercial airliner wing...|$|E

This test case has been selected a ``computational/meshing challenge'' in the 4 th International Workshop on High-Order CFD Methods due to its geometrical and computational complexity. In this article, we demonstrate the applicability of current grid generation technology (CENTAUR) to generate a quadratic curved mesh for this configuration. Furthermore, we employ a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin discretization for the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with the Wilcox-kω turbulence model which is sufficiently stable to be applicable to this test case. Finally, a 3 rd-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) flow solution is computed on the quadratic (3 rd-order) computational mesh.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between inertial, elastic and aerodynamic forces for structures {{subjected to a}} fluid flow may cause unstable coupled vibrations that can endanger the structure itself. Predicting these interactions is a time consuming but crucial task in an aircraft design process. In {{order to reduce the}} computational time surrogate reduced order models can be used in both structural and aerodynamic models. More over it is possible to avoid launching CFD computations at every time step. A database of aerodynamic pressure distribution on the structural component can be created conveniently sampling the space of the structural model DoF. Starting from the knowledge of the precomputed data-set a Gaussian Process can be applied to predict the pressure distribution on an unexplored point of the space of DoF. The knowledge of the standard deviation can be used to give indications on where to launch further CFD computations to enrich the database. This technique will be first applied to a database of pressures obtained using the software Xfoil®, later it will be applied to CFD simulations of type RANS launched with elsA® on one <b>Flap</b> <b>track</b> Fairing of an Airbus aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} numerical {{studies by}} DLR {{devoted to the}} computation of the DLR F- 11 high lift configuration {{as part of the}} 2 nd phase of the AIAA High Lift Prediction Workshop. The model geometry is representative for a wide-body commercial aircraft with a classical three element high lift system at the wing leading and trailing edge in a landing setting. Being a follow-up of the NASA Trapezoidal wing of the 1 st phase of the workshop, the F- 11 wing/body wind tunnel model features only a modest overall complexity increase in the basic set-up. Yet, the most complex geometry representation includes model details, such as slat tracks, <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairings, and pressure tube bundles. According to the available experimental evidence, low and high Reynolds numbers have been investigated. In addition to force, moment, and pressure distributions, surface streamlines have been analyzed. The studies have been carried out using the DLR TAU code in conjunction with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model in the original formulation. DLR contributed to the grid generation activities by providing a set of hexahedral-based hybrid unstructured grids for all complexity stages and both Reynolds-numbers. For the most simplified configuration, a family of three grids has been generated to study grid resolution aspects. In general, a good agreement to the experimental data is obtained. It turns out that for the present wind tunnel configuration, the inclusion geometry details of the wind tunnel model, such as slat tracks and even pressure tube bundles, is essential for the agreement to the experimental evidence and the prediction of maximum lift...|$|E
40|$|The {{functionality}} of the overset, static aeroelasticity, Navier-Stokes flow solver OVERAERO {{was increased}} by adding capability to the flow solver and enhancing code performance. Improvements {{were made to}} the fluids/structure interface, an MLP version of the parallel OVERAERO code was developed, and the OVERAERO-MPI code was ported to the Cray T 3 E. The OVERFLOW-MPI and OVERAERO-MPI codes were tested successfully on the IPG testbed and a means of reducing communication overhead within OVERFLOW-MPI was investigated. To solve an aeroelastic problem computationally, a structures grid surface definition and a fluids grid surface definition are required. Typically, the structures grid surface has a lower fidelity than the fluids grid surface. Thus, the methods developed to transfer data between the two grid systems are vital to the accuracy and efficiency of the aeroelasticity code. The fluids/structures interface developed for the OVERAERO code was improved to more accurately treat fluids surfaces that bridge between two different structural surfaces. For example, the method allowed the forward portion of a <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairing to deform with the wing and the aft end of the fairing to deform with the flap. A tightly-coupled version of the code based on OVERFLOW-MLP was developed to improve code performance on the SGI Origin 2000. This required a new parallelization strategy to couple the fluids and structures codes. The OVERAERO-MPI code was ported to the Cray T 3 E to extend the usability of the code. The port required extensive use of dynamic memory management techniques to fit large problems within the memory limitations of the T 3 E. The OVERFLOW-MPI and OVERAERO-MPI codes were tested on the IPG testbed being developed within NASA. For small problems with minimal data transfer between grids, there was little to no performance penalty spreading the computation across two machines. For very large problems, methods were developed to minimize intermachine communication via the grid partitioning scheme. By minimizing the intermachine communication requirements of the problem, it may still be beneficial to run a tightly-coupled flow solver across two machines within the IPG...|$|E
