50|$|The laser {{range finder}} only detects the {{distance}} of one point in its <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Thus, the scanner scans its entire field of view one point at a time by changing the range finder's <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> to scan different points. The view direction of the laser range finder can be changed either by rotating the range finder itself, or by using a system of rotating mirrors. The latter method is commonly used because mirrors are much lighter and can thus be rotated much faster and with greater accuracy. Typical time-of-flight 3D laser scanners can measure {{the distance of}} 10,000~100,000 points every second.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{interpretations of}} the Cosmic Ray Diurnal Variation gener-ally assume that the mean <b>viewing</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the {{stations}} concerned remains constant over each 24 -hour period. At {{the lower end of}} the energy range to which ground-based neutron monitors respond, two effects combine to question the va-lidity of this assumption. Firstly, distortion of the geomagnetic field by the solar wind causes the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>of</b> a ground-based station at a specified en-ergy to vary according to the local time-of-day. Secondly, there is a seasonal effect due to the tilt of the earth’s rotation axis. At lower energies and some stations both these effects can be significant. Furthermore, the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>viewing</b> are also affected by the degree of disturbance in the geomagnetic field. We report here the results <b>of</b> calculating the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>viewing</b> for Mawson at representative neutron monitor energies for each three-hour period throughout 1999, using the Tsyganenko model of the geomagnetic field and the appropriate value of Kp for each period, and discuss how these results affect the interpretation of the observed diurnal variation. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Other {{painters}} in this tradition, such as Gerrit Dou (1613-1675), depicted attractive maids with symbolic {{objects such}} as jugs and various forms of game and produce.

In Dou's 1646 painting, Girl Chopping Onions (now in the British Royal Collection), a pewter tankard may refer to {{both male and female}} anatomy, and the picture contains other contemporary symbols of lust, such as onions (said to have aphrodisical properties), and a dangling bird. Milk also had lewd connotations, from the slang term melken, defined as [...] "to sexually attract or lure" [...] (a meaning that may have originated from watching farm girls working under cows, according to Liedtke). Examples of works using milk this way include Lucas van Leyden's engraving The Milkmaid (1510) and Jacques de Gheyn II's engraving The Archer and the Milkmaid (about 1610).|$|E

50|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} a liquid mirror is its small cost, about 1% of a conventional telescope mirror. This cuts down {{the cost of the}} entire telescope at least 95%. The University of British Columbia's 6 meter Large Zenith Telescope cost about a fiftieth as much as a conventional telescope with a glass mirror.The greatest disadvantage is that the mirror can only be pointed straight up. Research is underway to develop telescopes that can be tilted, but currently if a liquid mirror was to tilt out of the zenith, it would lose its shape. Therefore the mirror's view changes as the Earth rotates and objects cannot be physically tracked. An object can be briefly electronically tracked while in the field of view by shifting electrons across the CCD at the same speed as the image moves; this tactic is called time delay and integration or drift scanning Some types of astronomical research are unaffected by these limitations, such as long-term sky surveys and supernova searches. Since the Universe is believed to be isotropic and homogeneous (this is called the Cosmological Principle), the investigation of its structure by cosmologists can also use telescopes which are highly reduced in their <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The twitch {{gameplay}} in Vendetta Online {{revolves around}} lining up a correct shot against enemy ships, while avoiding incoming fire. The dynamics {{of this can}} be complex, as ships are moving through 3-D space, and the weapons fire itself has a specific velocity, modified by the ships' absolute velocity. The ships mostly obey the laws of Newtonian Mechanics although a few artificial limits are put in place to increase the playability of the game. The control scheme includes a full six degrees of freedom, allowing users to assign keys or control axes (via joystick, thumb-stick, throttle, accelerometer, or touch area) to yaw, pitch, roll, and thrust along three axes. Ships can also be controlled with the mouse and keyboard using [...] "mouselook" [...] mode, in which the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is controlled by the mouse and the ship's nose auto-corrects to catch up. Ships each have detailed specifications such as mass, thrust, torque, cargo capacity, top speed, turbo energy drain, armor, and weapon ports. There are also many variants of the main ship types, some holding certain advantages over others, with some advanced variants belonging to special factions. Depending on what equipment is being used, and what is carried in the cargo hold, the mass of the ship (and consequently maneuverability) will change greatly, affecting combat.|$|E
