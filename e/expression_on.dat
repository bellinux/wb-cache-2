5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> one or both sides of the face.|$|E

25|$|The Piraeus Athena {{is often}} {{mentioned}} to seem approachable by the scholar, Neer. This {{serves as a}} stark contrast from the Archaic style, where gods were often depicted as stern according to Neer One reason Athena here is perceived approachable is due to her stance.

This position portrays {{the idea that she}} is almost stooping towards the mortal viewer. The passive and gentle <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> her face is also denoted with an air of approachability according.|$|E
25|$|<b>Expression</b> <b>on</b> {{instruments}} can {{be closely}} related {{to the role of the}} breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions. Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion, ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners. The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.|$|E
