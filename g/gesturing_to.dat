5|$|In England's second innings, Lindwall bounced Washbrook and the England opener {{went for}} the hook shot. The ball flew in the air {{straight}} towards fine leg, where Hassett dropped {{the ball on the}} third attempt. At the time, Washbrook was on 21. The English batsman had moved to 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman before humorously <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> indicate that he was ready for the next catch, much to the amusement of the crowd. On 80, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack. After the day's play, Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink; England were in a strong position at 3/174, with an overall lead of 316. Luckily for Australia, the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little. Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition to their score midway through the last day; the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain. Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to reach 1/92 and ensure that the match ended in a draw.|$|E

Ninety-three Dutch prisoners had been removed, and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men. As the gale intensified, it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain, and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message [...] "The ship is sinking". Reacting at once, boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels. Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat, from Veteran, to Heilberg, but the Dutch officer refused, <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> the immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying [...] "But how can I leave these men?". In response, Bullen cried out [...] "God bless you, my brave fellow! Here is my hand; I give you my word I will stay her with you!". The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell, and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay. Before further help could arrive, however, Delft suddenly foundered, Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank. Both were seen in the water but only Bullen reached safety, swimming to Monmouth alone.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} identified {{version of}} the pursuit or chase is from {{the third quarter of}} the 7th century BC. Next chronologically is the best known version on the François Vase by Kleitias. The number of characters shown on pottery scenes varies with {{the size and shape of}} the space available. [...] The François Vase is decorated with several scenes in long narrow strips. This means that the Troilus frieze is heavily populated. In the centre, (which can be seen at the Perseus Project at ,) is the fleeing Troilus, riding one horse with the reins of the other in his hand. Below them is the vase—which Polyxena (partially missing), who is ahead of him, has dropped. Achilles is largely missing but it is clear that he is armoured. They are running towards Troy [...] where Antenor gestures towards Priam. Hector and Polites, brothers of Troilus, emerge from the city walls in the hope of saving Troilus. Behind Achilles [...] are a number of deities, Athena, Thetis, (Achilles' mother,) Hermes, and Apollo (just arriving). Two Trojans are also present, the woman <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> draw the attention of a youth filling his vase. As the deities appear only in pictorial versions of the scene, their role is subject to interpretation. Boitani, sees Athena as urging Achilles on and Thetis as worried by the arrival of Apollo who, as Troilus' protector, represents a future threat to Achilles. He does not indicate what he thinks Hermes may be talking to Thetis about. The classicist and art historian Professor Thomas H. Carpenter sees Hermes as a neutral observer, Athena and Thetis as urging Achilles on and the arrival of Apollo as the artist's indication of the god's future role in Achilles' death. As Athena is not traditionally a patron of Achilles, Sommerstein sees her presence in this and other portrayals of Troilus' death as evidence of the early standing of the prophetic link between Troilus' death and the fall of Troy, Athena being driven, above all, by her desire for the city's destruction.|$|E

2500|$|Sreesanth's most {{significant}} performance {{to date in}} Test cricket was {{his role in the}} first Test of India's 2006 tour to South Africa at Johannesburg. After losing the limited-overs series 4–0, Sreesanth produced took 5–40 in a display of pace and swing to help dismiss South Africa. This performance helped to bowl South Africans out for just 84, leading to first Indian win on South African soil, for which he was named man of the match. Again, Sreesanth's emotional antics, which have led him to be regarded by some commentators as eccentric, were frequently noted. He was fined after breaching the International Cricket Council's advertising logo policy, and also for [...] "conduct contrary to the spirit of the game" [...] after sending off Hashim Amla after dismissing him. He was also involved in a highly publicised confrontation while batting against paceman André Nel. Nel delivered a series of fast balls at Sreesanth's upper body and after Sreesanth ungainly evaded one delivery, taunted him by <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> his chest, indicating that he felt Sreesanth was lacking in courage. On the next ball, Sreesanth gave him the charge and hit the ball straight over the bowler's head into the stands for a six. He then whirled his bat in enthusiasm and danced down the wicket, making fun of Nel and performing a dance. Later, Sreesanth said that he would not repeat anything of the sort, since he could be suspended for violating the code of conduct. Even though he went unpunished for the Nel incident, he was fined 30% of the match fee for running towards Hashim Amla after picking up his wicket, and wearing a branded garment under the jersey.|$|E

30|$|But, was the {{information}} in the teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the equations actually more redundant than {{the information}} in the teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the graphs? Perhaps so. As noted above, the teacher's speech referred quite unambiguously to the digits in the equations (e.g., pointing to the “ 2 ” in the equation while saying “ 2 ”), and in this sense, her gestures were redundant with her speech. The information expressed in <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the graph was also redundant with speech (e.g., the teacher said, “we go over to the 2 on the x-axis” while tracing along the x-axis from the origin to (0, 2)). However, there are inherent differences in how verbal and visuospatial representations present information; Schnotz (2002) characterized this difference in terms of the distinction between descriptive representations (such as text or equations), which represent content via convention, and depictive representations (visual displays, such as diagrams or graphs), which represent content via common structural features that are either concrete or abstract. One potential consequence of these differences is that <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> visuospatial representations may be inherently less redundant with speech about those representations than are <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> symbolic representations that occur with speech about those representations. If this is the case, then <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> equations, by virtue of being more redundant with speech, should be more likely than <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> graphs to evoke extraneous processing that can be detrimental to performance.|$|R
30|$|All of {{the lessons}} made {{connections}} between equations and graphs in speech; the lessons varied only in which representations the teacher referred <b>to</b> using <b>gestures.</b> We varied whether the teacher referred to the equations in gestures (or not), and whether the teacher referred to the graphs in gesture (or not), yielding four conditions: teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> both equations and graphs, teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> equations only, teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> graphs only, and teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> neither equations nor graphs. To assess learning, we developed assessment items that required students to understand connections among representations – that is, to generate a graph given an equation and/or a story, or to generate an equation given a graph and/or a story. We evaluated students’ success at representing both slope and intercept in the equations and graphs that they constructed. We hypothesized {{that there would be}} beneficial effects of referring to the equations in gestures, as well as beneficial effects of referring to the graphs in gestures. Moreover, we expected that these effects would be additive, such that <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> both representations would be better than <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> one representation only. We also considered the possibility that these effects might be interactive, with the combination leading to enhanced performance above and beyond the added effects of <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> each representation on its own. Thus, we predicted that students would show the greatest learning in the condition in which the teacher referred to both the equations and the graphs with gestures and speech.|$|R
