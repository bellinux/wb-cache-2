30|$|Another {{potential}} mechanism linking ORMDL 3 to asthma {{is through}} alterations in sphingolipid homeostasis and <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> sphingolipid <b>synthesis.</b> The <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> pathway of sphingolipid synthesis which originates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) {{is a key}} mechanism for regulating cellular levels of ceramide and other sphingolipids [7]. ORMDL proteins act as inhibitors of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme for <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> sphingolipid <b>synthesis</b> [59 – 61], and regulate cellular ceramide levels [22, 61, 62]. ORMDL 3 is localized to the ER and is highly expressed in airway epithelial cells [51]. The first step in <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> sphingolipid <b>synthesis</b> begins with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA by SPT. The reaction product, 3 -ketosphinganine, is unstable and is rapidly converted to sphinganine. Sphinganine is further metabolized by distinct ceramide synthases to dihydroceramides which can then generate ceramides via dihydroceramide desaturase [10]. ORMDLs {{have been shown to}} mediate the regulation of sphingolipid homeostasis in response to overall cellular sphingolipid levels and maintain physiologic sphingolipid concentrations in the face of external perturbations [6, 59, 61 – 63].|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the {{reactive}} cytochrome P450-reactive metabolite formed by paracetamol (acetaminophen), which becomes toxic when GSH is depleted by an overdose of acetaminophen, glutathione is an essential antidote to overdose. Glutathione conjugates to NAPQI and helps to detoxify it. In this capacity, it protects cellular protein thiol groups, which would otherwise become covalently modified; when all GSH has been spent, NAPQI begins to react with the cellular proteins, killing the cells in the process. The preferred treatment for an overdose of this painkiller is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (often as a preparation called Mucomyst), which is processed by cells to L-cysteine and used in the <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>synthesis</b> of GSH.|$|E

25|$|The rodent AFP {{system can}} be {{overridden}} with massive injections of estrogen, which overwhelm the AFP system and will masculinize the fetus. The masculinizing effect of estrogens may seem counter-intuitive since estrogens are critical for the proper development of female secondary characteristics during puberty.

Without these hormones the fetus will develop into a phenotypic female even if genetically XY. Interestingly, the conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase in many tissues may be an important step in masculinization of that tissue.

In this study, we identified a <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> dTMP <b>synthesis</b> pathway in mammalian mitochondria. Mitochondria purified from wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and HepG 2 cells converted dUMP to dTMP in the presence of NADPH and serine, through the activities of mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT 2), thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and a novel human mitochondrial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) previously thought to be a pseudogene known as dihydrofolate reductase-like protein 1 (DHFRL 1). Human DHFRL 1, SHMT 2, and TYMS were localized to mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane, confirming the presence of this pathway in mitochondria. Knockdown of DHFRL 1 using siRNA eliminated DHFR activity in mitochondria.
