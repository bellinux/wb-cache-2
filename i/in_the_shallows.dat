5|$|Wildflowers {{are found}} {{throughout}} Pettigrew State Park. Atamasco lily, periwinkle, buttercup, Jack-in-the-pulpit, maypops, and jewelweed are sometimes {{found on the}} banks and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows</b> of Lake Phelps. The Scuppernong River provides a habitat for swamp dogwood, evening primrose, blue flag iris and cardinal flowers. The roughleaf dogwood is also found near the river. This particular dogwood is rare in North Carolina and the type along the Scuppernong is rarer still.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows,</b> at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of <b>the</b> simulated result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region {{may not be}} well guaranteed. Furthermore, the modeled fault does not reach the free surface. These factors result in an underestimation of <b>the</b> final slips <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region compared to the inversion results. However, we point out that a significant effect from <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region is not required for the multi-event generation.|$|R
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that the stress state is very different between <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> and deeper regions. Though <b>the</b> initial stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region is barely above the dynamic strength, the reflected waves inside the front wedge induce a high transient stress drop and large final slip, but no significant overshoot is found. Based on the consistency of our result and the observations, we infer that <b>the</b> initial stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region is very low compared to the static strength. Thus, {{it would be difficult to}} nucleate an earthquake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region, but <b>the</b> final slip will always be amplified once the rupture propagates through. This behavior should naturally exist in shallow subduction events. A lower initial stress (e.g. equal to the dynamic strength) still allows the rupture to break up to the trench, but leads to a small final slip (< 50 m) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallower</b> region.|$|R

5|$|Many humans enjoy {{venturing into}} the sea: {{children}} paddle and splash <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows,</b> while others swim or relax on the beach. This {{was not always}} the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after Dr. William Buchan advocated the practice for health reasons. Surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, {{with or without a}} surfboard. Other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull a skier.|$|E
5|$|The Marines {{withdrew from}} their {{positions}} {{to the interior}} of Noddle's Island, and Stark's men left Crooked Creek to join {{the main body of}} his forces on Hog Island. Diana and the other vessels continued northeast up Chelsea Creek in pursuit. By sunset, hundreds of cattle, sheep, and horses had been driven from Hog Island to the mainland. Also around sunset, Diana turned about in an attempt to avoid being trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows</b> of the creek. However, Lieutenant Graves realized he would require assistance, and raised a signal. Vice-Admiral Graves ordered barges manned by marines into the creek to tow Diana out, along with the sloop Britannia, tender of HMS Somerset (under the command of another of Graves nephews, Lieutenant John Graves) to assist and provide additional firepower.|$|E
5|$|Many frogs {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows</b> to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase {{the area of the}} skin available for respiration.|$|E
30|$|Both {{increases}} in hydrothermal flux {{from the deep}} {{part of the system}} and reduction <b>in</b> permeability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> part of <b>the</b> conduit cause pressurization and heat accumulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallow</b> part of <b>the</b> edifice. Crater temperature shows complex behaviors depending on the amount of increase in hydrothermal flux and the amount of reduction in permeability.|$|R

25|$|The seals are the ringed seal, {{the harp}} seal and the grey seal. These animals {{for the most}} part were common in the Littorina Sea but are not found in the Baltic Sea now. Again, they could have been taken on land or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows.</b>|$|E
25|$|As one travels {{from east}} to west across the island, the dune age increases. This leads to the {{progressive}} maturing of vegetation in the same direction, except for some areas along the western coast where soil leaching has decreased the nutrient soil layer to a depth beyond the reach of plant roots. Each lake on Fraser Island is surrounded by concentric vegetation zones. Typically these zones range from rushes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows,</b> then a mix of pioneer species on the beaches, through to sedges, heath, paperbarks, shrubs and finally eucalypt or banksia woodlands.|$|E

25|$|The {{events that}} led to the {{building}} of the bridge started in August 1826 when the Lord Mayor of London made a ceremonial progress down the Thames from Oxford to London. The Mayoral barge grounded on the rocky outcrops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows</b> at Clifton Ferry and was stuck for several hours whilst the weirs further upstream were opened to raise the water level. This episode led to the building of Clifton Lock and weirs in 1835 which allowed better water management on the reach. Whilst the deeper channel was welcomed by river traffic it prevented the fording of the river by herds of cattle and thus prompted demands for a bridged crossing.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{fishing for}} pike {{from the shore}} is {{especially}} effective during spring, when the big pike move into the shallows to spawn in weedy areas, and later many remain there to feed on other spawning coarse fish species to regain their condition after spawning. Smaller jack pike often remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows</b> for their own protection, and for the small fish food available there. For the hot summer and during inactive phases, the larger female pike tend to retire to deeper water and/or places with better cover. This gives the boat angler good fishing {{during the summer and}} winter seasons. Trolling (towing a fairy or bait behind a moving boat) is a popular technique.|$|E
25|$|The fish {{population}} draws birds to {{the waters of}} Holman Lake. Bald eagles and osprey do not nest at Little Buffalo State Park, but they do fish the waters. Great blue heron and green heron wade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows</b> of the lake in search of fish, frogs and crayfish. Wood ducks make their home at the lake along with mallards and Canadian geese. The woods and field surrounding the lake are {{the home of the}} once rare bluebird. These birds became endangered due to the loss habitat. They nested only in tree cavities. People have helped the bluebird by constructing birdhouses that mimic the woodpecker holes that bluebirds would naturally use to build their nests. Turkeys and ruffed grouse live in and thrive in the forests of Little Buffalo State Park.|$|E

25|$|Spain's Admiral Mendez Núñez {{sent two}} of his most {{powerful}} ships (frigates Villa de Madrid and Reina Blanca) south to destroy the combined Chilean-Peruvian fleet. The allied squadron had been placed {{under the command of}} Peruvian Captain Manuel Villar and had taken refuge at Abtao, a well-protected inlet near the gulf of Chiloé in southern Chile. The Spanish squadron appeared at the entrance of the inlet on February 7, 1866, but the Spanish did not enter as {{they did not want to}} risk their ironclads running aground <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shallows.</b> A cannonade lasting several hours was exchanged with little effect. In spite of being at anchor, without steam, and with some ships with their engines undergoing overhaul, the Allies mounted an energetic fight. The Covadonga, under the command of Lieutenant Manuel Thomson, managed to fire over an island and scored several hits on the frigate Blanca. The battle ended indecisively without further developments. Reluctant to enter shallow waters and realizing that a long range gun duel served no purpose but to waste ammunition, the Spanish commanders withdrew.|$|E
