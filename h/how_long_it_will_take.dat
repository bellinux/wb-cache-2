25|$|So {{while all}} three {{statements}} are true, progressively {{more information is}} contained in each. In some fields, however, the big O notation (number 2 in the lists above) would be used more commonly than the Big Theta notation (bullets number 3 in the lists above). For example, if T(n) represents the running time of a newly developed algorithm for input size n, the inventors and users of the algorithm might {{be more inclined to}} put an upper asymptotic bound on <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> to run without making an explicit statement about the lower asymptotic bound.|$|E
25|$|Software {{development}} is a complex process, and developers are often uncertain <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> to complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up {{a significant portion of}} its development time, and developers are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.|$|E

2500|$|Wisconsin {{governor}} Jim Doyle {{announced on}} June 10 {{that the state}} would repair the lake. He described the lake as crucial to the billion-dollar Wisconsin Dells tourism area. Engineers with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) were studying the lake, and Doyle said it will only take about two weeks for water from the river to refill the [...] lake. It is unknown, however, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> to divert and correct the river's current path back into the lake. Dell Creek is still flowing down to the Wisconsin River, and the lake would be refilled from the creek, once the breach in the highway and collaterally damaged areas are repaired.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to several}} {{standard}} interpretations of quantum mechanics, microscopic phenomena are objectively random. That is, {{in an experiment}} that controls all causally relevant parameters, {{some aspects of the}} outcome still vary randomly. For example, if a single unstable atom is placed in a controlled environment, it cannot be predicted <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> for the atom to decay—only the probability of decay in a given time. Thus, quantum mechanics does not specify the outcome of individual experiments but only the probabilities. [...] Hidden variable theories reject the view that nature contains irreducible randomness: such theories posit that in the processes that appear random, properties with a certain statistical distribution are at work behind the scenes, determining the outcome in each case.|$|E

60|$|For {{the moment}} our world is still convulsed, and art {{of every kind}} trails a lame foot before a public whose eyes are fixed on the vast and bloody stage of the war. When the last curtain falls, and rises again on the scenery of Peace, shall we have to revalue everything? Surely not the {{fundamental}} truths; these reflections on the spirit which underlie all true effort in dramatic art may stand much as they were framed, now five years ago. Fidelity to mood, to impression, to self will remain what it was--the very kernel of good dramatic art; whether that fidelity will find {{a more or less}} favourable environment remains the interesting speculation. When we come to after-war conditions a sharp distinction will have to be drawn between the chances of sincere drama in America and Britain. It is my strong impression that sincere dramatists in America are going to have an easier time than they had before the war, but that with us {{they are going to have}} a harder. My reasons are threefold. The first and chief reason is economic. However much America may now have to spend, with her late arrival, vaster resources, and incomparably greater recuperative power, she will feel the economic strain but little in comparison with Britain. Britain, not at once, but certainly within five years of the war's close, will find that she has very much less money to spend on pleasure. Now, under present conditions of education, when the average man has little to spend on pleasure, he spends it first in gratifying his coarser tastes. And the average Briton is going to spend his little on having his broad laughs and his crude thrills. By the time he has gratified that side of himself he will have no money left. Those artists in Britain who respect æsthetic truths and practise sincerity will lose even the little support they ever had from the great public there; they will have to rely entirely on that small public which always wanted truth and beauty, and will want it even more passionately after the war. But that little public will be poorer also, and, I think, not more numerous than it was. The British public is going to be split more definitely into two camps--a very big and a very little camp. What this will mean to the drama of sincerity only those who have watched its struggle in the past will be able to understand. The trouble in Britain--and I daresay in every country--is that the percentage of people who take art of any kind seriously is ludicrously small. And our impoverishment will surely make that percentage smaller by cutting off the recruiting which was always going on from the ranks of the great public. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> Britain to recover even pre-war conditions I do not venture to suggest. But I am pretty certain that there is no chance for a drama of truth and beauty there for many years to come, unless we can get it endowed in such a substantial way as shall tide it over--say--the next two decades. What we require is a London theatre undeviatingly devoted to the production of nothing but the real thing, which will go its own way, year in, year out, quite without regard to the great public; and we shall never get it unless we can find some benevolent, public-spirited person or persons who will place it in a position of absolute security. If we could secure this endowment, that theatre would become in a very few years the most fashionable, if not the most popular, in London, and even the great public would go to it. Nor need such a theatre be expensive--as theatres go--for it is to the mind and not to the eye that it must appeal. A sufficient audience is there ready; what is lacking is the point of focus, a single-hearted and coherent devotion to the best, and the means to pursue that ideal without extravagance but without halting. Alas! in England, though people will endow or back almost anything else, they will not endow or back an art theatre.|$|E
