50|$|Interviews for admissions at MSTPs tend {{to focus}} on the applicant's career goals and past {{experiences}} in scientific research. These may include short research talks or presentations followed by rigorous questioning by an interviewer or <b>interviewing</b> <b>committee.</b> MSTP applicants are often required to demonstrate a deep understanding of their past research projects. Multiple interview sessions conducted by different interviewers that last for 2 days are very common. At some MSTPs, applicants may also be required (or be offered the chance) to interview with the MD-only program.|$|E

As {{a result of}} the field work three conclusions were reached: (1) conflicts over grazing decisions have been significantly reduced by the stewardship process, (2) available data is insufficient to support conclusions about changes in the ecological status of the plant communities within the stewardship areas and (3) the annual economic value of rangeland recreation exceeds all other rangeland outputs on all three areas studied...|$|R
5000|$|... 1. Mainline church {{denominations}} generally require their pastors to {{have graduated}} from {{one of their own}} denominational theological colleges in order to be ordained. This is not the case in the ACC. Pastors and leaders can be ordained as long as they meet certain conditions set by the ACC, yet the academic conditions do not require that candidates have studied at Alphacrucis or any other registered ACC college. At one level this allows for an autonomy at a local church level which is unheard of in mainline churches. However, it also has called into question how there can even be a true and official ministry training college for the ACC.2. Mainline churches generally require a bachelor's degree in either ministry or theology plus units which cover the denominational distinctives. This usually equates to about five years full-time higher educational study. Again, at the ACC this is not the case. In fact the minimum academic requirement by the ACC is that candidates [...] "have undertaken a recognised Bible study course and/or given evidence to the <b>interviewing</b> <b>committee</b> that he/she is equipped by private reading and study to fulfill the relevant ministry." [...] This generally equates to a Certificate IV in Ministry. This is in line with ACC's understanding of priority of the empowerment of the Holy Spirit over and above academic training and allows a lot of autonomy at a local church level. But again, it has called into question how there really can be any official training colleges for the ACC, as whether someone has studied there or even done any formal study at all is unnecessary for ordination.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the recruitment and selection procedures of senior officials into the Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The study argued that recruitment and selection of staff in KZN Department of Education is faced {{with a number of}} problems as posts are advertised, withdrawn, delayed or cancelled. The study used interviews and document analysis as data collection instruments. Deputy Directors, Chief Education Specialists and Deputy Chief Education Specialists participated in interviews. Having investigated and correlated all the results, the researcher concluded that the problems pertaining to recruitment and selection, include: The contents of policies regarding recruitment and selection are not known by the officials. There is inconsistency between advertisement and short-listing. The <b>interviewing</b> <b>committee</b> is not properly constituted and the principles of objectivity and fairness are not adhered to. The study recommends that the Education Department must ensure that workshops on policies and legislations are organized and conducted for all officials and educators. Job evaluation must be thoroughly done. The Human Resources Department must ensure that the requirements on the advertisements are in line with the set criteria for short-listing...|$|E

Although there were minor discrepancies here and there in the evidence, the first two members of the committee, Khan and Maitra, concluded that Bose had died in the plane crash in Taihoku on 18 August 1945.|$|R

The present study explored the leadership experience of Jordanian special education teachers, and their perceptions of common constraints to leadership. A mixed method design was used, including a survey (n = 136) and an interview (n = 23). Results indicated that special education teachers had little experience of leadership roles. They regarded the provision of cognitive and emotional support to colleagues as their most important leadership role, and participating in <b>interview</b> <b>committees</b> and selecting new teachers as the least important. There were no significant mean differences {{between male and female}} special education teachers in their level of enacted leadership. Level of education and years of experience were found to {{have a significant effect on}} the level of teachers’ leadership...|$|R

5000|$|Roth {{served as}} Dean of the Rabbinical School from 1981 to 1984 {{as well as}} in 1992-1993, resigning both times after a major sexual scandal. Roth {{resigned}} in 1984 as part of a settlement of a potential lawsuit by the family of a student whom Roth had allegedly sexually harassed. [...] The accusation was kept secret at the time, though it came to light when an anonymous letter surfaced in 1993 during Roth's second term as Dean. [...] Then, on March 29, 1993, Roth resigned after he allegedly made a sexually explicit statement to a student at the seminary's West Coast affiliate, the Los Angeles-based University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University), during a group interview. “He said inappropriate things to the student,” said Rabbi Eliot Dorff, the university provost {{and a member of the}} <b>interview</b> <b>committee.</b> Roth has “some deep-seated problems for which he needs help,” Dorff said.|$|R

40|$|Research ethics {{committees}}—animal ethics committees (AECs) for animal‐based {{research and}} institutional research boards (IRBs) for human subjects—have {{a key role}} in research governance, but there has been little study of the factors influencing their effectiveness. The objectives of this study were to examine how the effectiveness of a research ethics committee is influenced by committee composition and dynamics, recruitment of members, workload, participation level and member turnover. As a model, 28 members of AECs at four universities in western Canada were <b>interviewed.</b> <b>Committees</b> were selected to represent variation in the number and type of protocols reviewed, and participants were selected to include different types of committee members. We found that a bias towards institutional or scientific interests may result from (1) a preponderance of institutional and scientist members, (2) an intimidating atmosphere for community members and other minority members, (3) recruitment of community members who are affiliated with the institution and (4) members joining for reasons other than to fulfil the committee mandate. Thoroughness of protocol review may be influenced by heavy workloads, type of review process and lack of full committee participation. These results, together with results from the literature on research ethics committees, suggested potential ways to improve the effectiveness of research ethics committees...|$|R
