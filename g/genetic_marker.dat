5|$|In 2011, DNA {{tests were}} {{performed}} on a sample of 45 men with the surname MacLeod, 47% were found to share a common ancestor in the male line (the remaining 53% of the sample contained 9 different genetic male line lineages).

40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to screen out <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> {{applicable}} to early diagnosis for colorectal cancer and to establish apoptotic regulatory network model for colorectal cancer, thereby providing theoretical evidence and targeted therapy for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Taking databases including CNKI, VIP, Wanfang data, Pub Med, and MEDLINE as main sources of literature retrieval, literatures associated with <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> applied to early diagnosis of colorectal cancer were searched to perform comprehensive and quantitative analysis by Meta analysis, hence screening <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> used in early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were employed to establish apoptotic regulatory network model based on screened <b>genetic</b> <b>markers,</b> and then verification experiment was conducted. Through Meta analysis, seven <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> were screened out, including WWOX, K-ras, COX- 2, p 53, APC, DCC and PTEN, among which DCC shows highest diagnostic efficiency. GO analysis of <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> found that six <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> played role in biological process, molecular function and cellular component. It was indicated in apoptotic regulatory network built by KEGG analysis and verification experiment that WWOX could promote tumor cell apoptotic in colorectal cancer and elevate expression level of p 53. The apoptotic regulatory model of colorectal cancer established in this study provides clinically theoretical evidence and targeted therapy for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer...|$|R

40|$|Assuming no interference, a multi-locus genetic {{likelihood}} {{is implemented}} {{based on a}} mathematical model of the recombination process in meiosis that accounts for events up to double crossovers in the genetic interval for any specified order of <b>genetic</b> <b>markers.</b> The mathematical model is realized with a straightforward algorithm that implements the likelihood computation process. The time complexity of the straightforward algorithm is exponential without bound {{in the number of}} <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> and implementation of the model for more than 7 <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> is not feasible, motivating the need for a novel algorithm. A recursive linking algorithm is proposed that decomposes the pool of <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> into segments and renders the model implementable for a large number of <b>genetic</b> <b>markers.</b> The recursive algorithm is shown to reduce the order of time complexity from exponential to linear. The improvement in time complexity is shown theoretically by a worst-case analysis of the algorithm and supported by run time results using data on linkage group-I of the fungal genome Neurospora crassa...|$|R

25|$|Whilst {{such studies}} are insightful, {{even if the}} dates {{postulated}} by authors are correct, they do not necessarily imply that the spread of a particular <b>genetic</b> <b>marker</b> represents a distinct population, 'tribe' or language group.

25|$|Linkage {{analysis}} may {{be either}} parametric (if {{we know the}} relationship between phenotypic and genetic similarity) or non-parametric. Parametric linkage analysis is the traditional approach, whereby {{the probability that a}} gene important for a disease is linked to a <b>genetic</b> <b>marker</b> is studied through the LOD score, which assesses the probability that a given pedigree, where the disease and the marker are cosegregating, is due to the existence of linkage (with a given linkage value) or to chance. Non-parametric linkage analysis, in turn, studies the probability of an allele being identical by descent with itself.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{application}} of molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> {{has been widely}} used in modern experimental fish-farming in recent years. This methodology is currently presented by a differentiated approach with individual mechanisms and clearly defined possibilities. Numerous publications in the scientific literature that are dedicated to molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> {{for the most part}} offer purely practical data. Thus, the synthesis and analysis of existing information on the general principles of action and the limits of the main methods of using molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> is an actual problem. In particular, such a description will make it possible to plan more effectively the experiment and to obtain the desired results with high reliability. Findings. The main types of variable parts of DNA that can be used as molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> in determining the level of stock hybridization, conducting genetic inventory of population and solving other problems in modern fish-farming are described in this paper. Also, the article provides an overview of principal modern methods {{that can be used to}} identify molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>markers.</b> Originality. This work is a generalization of modern ideas about the mechanisms of experiments with molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> in fish-farming.

25|$|DNA barcoding is a taxonomic {{method that}} uses a short <b>genetic</b> <b>marker</b> in an organism's DNA to {{identify}} it as belonging to a particular species. It differs from molecular phylogeny in that the main {{goal is not to}} determine patterns of relationship but to identify an unknown sample in terms of a preexisting classification. Although barcodes are sometimes used in an effort to identify unknown species or assess whether species should be combined or separated, These provide poor resolution for land plants, and a call was made for regions to be assessed that could complement rbcL and matK.|$|E
25|$|By {{comparing}} {{the parts of}} the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor. Each time a certain mutation (SNP) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants, a haplogroup is formed including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation. By comparing mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose <b>genetic</b> <b>marker</b> is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 90,000 to 200,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|The other protein, TAS1R3, {{is present}} and {{identical}} {{to that of other}} animals, and the relevant taste buds are still present but inactive. Such a <b>genetic</b> <b>marker</b> found in the entire family and not other animals must be the result of a mutation in an early ancestor; as a deletion mutation it could not revert, and thus would be inherited by all descendants, as the evolutionary tree branched out. Some scientists now believe this is the root of the cat family's extremely specialized evolutionary niche as a hunter and carnivore. Their modified sense of taste would cause them to some degree to ignore plants, a large part of whose taste appeal derives from their high sugar content, in favor of a high-protein carnivorous diet, which would still stimulate their remaining taste receptors.|$|E

40|$|Background Microsatellite <b>markers</b> {{are popular}} <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> {{frequently}} used in forensic biology. Despite their popularity, the characterisation of polymorphic microsatellite loci {{and development of}} suitable markers takes considerable effort. Newly-available genomic databases make it feasible to identify conserved <b>genetic</b> <b>markers.</b> We examined the utility and characteristics of conserved microsatellite markers in Charadriiformes (plovers, sandpipers, gulls and auks). This order harbours many species with diverse breeding systems, life histories and extraordinary migration biology whose genetics warrant investigation. However, research has been largely restrained by the limited availability of <b>genetic</b> <b>markers.</b> To examine the utility of conserved microsatellite loci as <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> we collated a database of Charadriiformes microsatellites, searched for homologues in the chicken genome and tested conserved markers for amplification and polymorphism {{in a range of}} charadriiform species.

40|$|Most of the {{bacterial}} typing {{methods used}} to discriminate isolates in medical or food safety microbiology are based on <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> used as targets in PCR or hybridization experiments. These DNA typing methods are important tools for studying prevalence and epidemiology, for conducting surveillance, investigations and control of biological hazard sources. In that perspective, {{it is crucial to}} insure that the chosen <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> have the greatest specificity and sensitivity. The wealth of whole-genome sequences available for many bacterial species offers the opportunity to evaluate the performance of these <b>genetic</b> <b>markers.</b> In the present study, we have developed GTEvaluator, a bioinformatics workflow which ranks <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> depending on their sensitivity and specificity towards groups of well-defined genomes. GTEvaluator identifies the most performant <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> to target individuals among a population. The individuals (i. e. a group of genomes within a collection) are defined by any kind of particular phenotypic or biological properties inside a related population (i. e. collection of genomes). The performance of the <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> is computed by a distance value which takes into account both sensitivity and specificity. In this study we report two examples of GTEvaluator application. In the first example Bacillus phenotypic markers were evaluated for their capacity to distinguish B. cereus from B. thuringiensis. In the second experiment, GTEvaluator measured the performance of <b>genetic</b> <b>markers</b> dedicated to the molecular serotyping of Salmonella enterica. In one in silico experiment it was possible to test 64 markers onto 134 genomes corresponding to 14 different serotypes...|$|R
25|$|With {{very large}} pedigrees or with very dense <b>genetic</b> <b>marker</b> data, such as from whole-genome sequencing, it is {{possible}} to precisely locate recombinations. With this type of genetic analysis, a meiosis indicator is assigned to each position of the genome for each meiosis in a pedigree. The indicator indicates which copy of the parental chromosome contributes to the transmitted gamete at that position. For example, if the allele from the 'first' copy of the parental chromosome is transmitted, a '0' might be assigned to that meiosis. If the allele from the 'second' copy of the parental chromosome is transmitted, a '1' would be assigned to that meiosis. The two alleles in the parent came, one each, from two grandparents. These indicators are then used to determine identical-by-descent (IBD) states or inheritance states, which are in turn used to identify genes responsible for diseases.|$|E
25|$|In two {{recently}} published books, Blood of the Isles, by Brian Sykes and The Origins of the British, by Stephen Oppenheimer, both authors state {{that according to}} genetic evidence, most Welsh people, like most Britons, descend from the Iberian Peninsula, {{as a result of}} different migrations that took place during the Mesolithic and the Neolithic eras, and which laid the foundations for the present-day populations in the British Isles, indicating an ancient relationship among the populations of Atlantic Europe. According to Stephen Oppenheimer 96% of lineages in Llangefni in north Wales derive from Iberia. Genetic research on the Y-chromosome has shown that the Welsh, like the Irish, share a large proportion of their ancestry with the Basques of Northern Spain and South Western France, although the Welsh have a greater presumed Neolithic input than both the Irish and the Basques. <b>Genetic</b> <b>marker</b> R1b averages from 83–89% amongst the Welsh.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, several genetic {{studies have been}} {{conducted}} on men bearing surnames traditionally associated with patrilineal descendants of Somerled. The results of one such study, published in 2004, revealed that five chiefs of Clan Donald, who all traced their patrilineal descent from Somerled, were indeed descended from a common ancestor. Further testing of men bearing the surnames MacAlister, MacDonald, and MacDougall, found that, of a small sample group, 40% of MacAlisters, 30% of MacDougalls, and 18% of MacDonalds shared this <b>genetic</b> <b>marker.</b> These percentages suggest that Somerled may have almost 500,000 living patrilineal descendants. The results of a later study, published in 2011, revealed that, of a sample of 164 men bearing the surname MacDonald, 23% carried the same marker borne by the clan chiefs. This marker was identified as a subgroup of haplogroup R1a, known to be extremely rare in Celtic-speaking areas of Scotland, but very common in Norway. Both genetic studies concluded that Somerled's patrilineal ancestors originated in Scandinavia.|$|E

25|$|A recent {{analysis}} of Y-DNA {{of men with}} Scottish surnames has revealed that a large genetic lineage of men with the surname Macaulay, {{many of whom are}} from Lewis and Harris, have their genetic origins in the south-west of Ireland. The specific Y-DNA marker borne by these men appears to be extremely rare in Scotland, where it is only found in the Western Isles, and the Northern Isles. One hypothesis, suggested by population geneticist Jim Wilson and author Alistair Moffat, is that this marker may represent Irish slaves brought to Scotland by the Vikings. According to Wilson, this may explain why such a distinctive Irish marker is found areas where Vikings were once active, and why it is borne by Scots with surnames of Norse origin. Scottish radio presenter Fred MacAulay is {{one of the men who}} has been found to bear this marker. According to Moffat, there is a larger and unrelated genetic lineage of men with the same surname. The <b>genetic</b> <b>marker</b> of these men suggests that they descend from Vikings.|$|E
