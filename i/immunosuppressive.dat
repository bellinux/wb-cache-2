5|$|<b>Immunosuppressive</b> {{drugs are}} used to control {{autoimmune}} disorders or inflammation when excessive tissue damage occurs, and to prevent transplant rejection after an organ transplant.|$|E
5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or <b>immunosuppressive</b> drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E
5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of <b>immunosuppressive</b> drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of <b>immunosuppressive</b> drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E

5|$|Cytotoxic drugs {{inhibit the}} immune {{response}} by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects. <b>Immunosuppressive</b> {{drugs such as}} cyclosporin prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The <b>immunosuppressive</b> drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe <b>immunosuppressive</b> {{drugs such as}} prednisolone and ciclosporin if the patient is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, {{the side effects of}} these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.|$|E

40|$|Background & Aims: The {{benefit to}} risk ratio of {{concomitant}} <b>immunosuppressives</b> with scheduled infliximab (IFX) maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease {{is an issue}} of debate. We aimed to study the influence of <b>immunosuppressives</b> discontinuation in patients in remission with combination therapy in an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. Methods: Patients with controlled disease >= 6 months after the start of IFX (5 mg/kg intravenously) combined with <b>immunosuppressives</b> were randomized to continue (Con) or to interrupt (Dis) <b>immunosuppressives,</b> while all patients received scheduled IFX maintenance therapy for 104 weeks. Primary end point was the proportion of patients who required a decrease in IFX dosing interval or stopped IFX therapy. Secondary end points included IFX trough levels, safety, and mucosal healing. Results: A similar proportion (24 / 40, 60 % Con) and (22 / 40, 55 % Dis) of patients needed a change in IFX dosing interval or stopped IFX therapy (11 / 40 Con, 9 / 40 Dis). C-reactive protein (CRP) was higher and IFX trough levels were lower in the Dis group (Dis: CRP, 2. 8 mg/L; interquartile range [IQR], 1. 0 - 8. 0; Con: CRP, 1. 6 mg/L; IQR, 1. 0 - 5. 6, P <. 005; trough IFX: Dis: 1. 65 mu g/mL; IQR, 0. 54 - 3. 68; Con: 2. 87 mu g/mL; IQR, 1. 35 - 4. 72, P <. 0001). Low IFX trough levels correlated with increased CRP and clinical score. Mucosal ulcers were absent at week 104 in 64 % (Con) and 61 % (Dis) of evaluated patients with ongoing response to IFX. Conclusions: Continuation of <b>immunosuppressives</b> beyond 6 months offers no clear benefit over scheduled IFX monotherapy but is associated with higher median IFX trough and decreased CRP levels.

5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns <b>immunosuppressive</b> drugs are commenced and they have to take <b>immunosuppressive</b> medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|As the autobodies {{are found}} mainly in {{patients}} that have characteristics of several different autoimmune diseases, the clinical symptoms {{of these patients}} can vary widely. The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical symptoms of the individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, myositis and scleroderma. Treatment of these patients is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either <b>immunosuppressive</b> or immunomodulating drugs.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of <b>immunosuppressive</b> medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
50|$|Disease {{progression}} may be slowed with <b>immunosuppressives</b> {{and other}} medications, and esophageal reflux, pulmonary hypertension and Raynaud phenomenon {{may benefit from}} symptomatic treatment. However, {{there is no cure}} for this disease as there is no cure for scleroderma in general.|$|R
30|$|In the past, {{surgeons}} suggested keeping eyes aphakic {{for better}} visual outcomes and lensectomies and vitrectomies were procedures of preference in these eyes [38 – 40], {{but all of}} these earlier reports failed to control ocular inflammation and systemic <b>immunosuppressives</b> were not used.|$|R
40|$|Background: Episodic {{infliximab}} (IFX) {{treatment is}} associated with the formation of antibodies to IFX (ATIs) in the majority of patients, which can lead to infusion reactions and a shorter duration of response. Concomitant use of <b>immunosuppressives</b> (IS) reduces the risk of ATI formation. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, <b>immunosuppressive</b> drugs, or other medical problems. It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be <b>immunosuppressive.</b> Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with <b>immunosuppressive</b> effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E

5|$|Selective {{glucocorticoid}} receptor modulators (SEGRMs) {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) {{formerly known as}} dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable anti-inflammatory, <b>immunosuppressive,</b> or anticancer properties of classical glucocorticoid drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional <b>immunosuppressive</b> medication is often needed.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{large number}} of oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved {{structural}} motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or <b>immunosuppressive</b> drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{urticaria}} has a {{wide spectrum}} of clinical presentations and causes. Still, despite our best efforts no cause may be found in the majority of cases.

40|$|Diabetic amyotrophy is a {{subacute}} asymmetric neuropathy with pains, hypotrophy {{and weakness}} in the muscles of upper leg and difficulty walking. The goal of our research was to compare efficiency of intravenous immunoglobulins, corticosteroids and <b>immunosuppressives</b> within the treatment of 12 patients with the complication of diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis was set {{on the basis of}} Electromyoneurographical findings and by exclusion of the other forms of neuropathies, and, within the treatment, we applied intravenous immunoglobulins in 2 patients; intravenous high-dose pulse corticosteroids in 3 patients, the oral corticosteroids in 5 patients, and <b>immunosuppressives</b> in 2 patients. The assessment of muscular strength on lower limbs was realized by The Medical Research Council scale, and the function of walking was assessed {{on the basis of the}} walking distance (distance in meters that the patient is able to pass before they have to stop due to weakness in legs). After a year from the beginning of treatment, nine patients (75 %) had the excellent recovery (regular walking), and 3 patients (25 %) had the moderate recovery (moderate weakness in legs, however, they can walk independently). We achieved the best results in the treatment applying intravenous immunoglobulins and pulse doses of steroids, which is in accordance with results in the majority of the other studies (all 5 patients treated by the stated drugs had excellent recovery), and poorer results by the application of peroral steroid 1 s and <b>immunosuppressives...</b>|$|R
25|$|The acute uveitis {{phase of}} VKH is usually {{responsive}} to high-dose oral corticosteroids; parenteral administration {{is usually not}} required. However, ocular complications may require an subtenon or intravitreous injection of corticosteroids or bevacizumab. In refractory situations, other <b>immunosuppressives</b> such as cyclosporine, or tacrolimus, antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate), or biological agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or infliximab may be needed.|$|R
