Furthermore, nothing is known about the genetic relationships among them. In this study, we collected six populations from Mainland China, four populations from Japan and one population from Taiwan, and examined the genetic distances in the COI and 16 sRNA regions of mtDNA among them. The results showed that the genetic distances based on single gene or the combined sequences among eleven leafhopper populations were 0. 3 - 1. 2 %, which were all less than the species boundary of 2 %. Moreover, there were at least two haplotypes shared by two distinct populations from different regions. The phylogenetic analysis based on single gene or combined sets also supported that tea <b>green</b> <b>leafhoppers</b> from Mainland China, Taiwan and Japan were closely related to each other, and there were at least two specimens from different regions clustered ahead of those from the same region. Therefore, we propose that the view of recognizing the dominant species of tea <b>green</b> <b>leafhoppers</b> in three adjacent tea production regions of East Asia as different species is unreliable or questionable and suggest that they are a single species...|$|E

It is important therefore, to study the virulences and the genetic diversities of tungro viruses derived from the endemic areas in Indonesia. This study was aimed to identify the virulence and the molecular diversity of tungro viruses from endemic areas in Indonesia. Susceptible variety TN 1 was used in the study. Surveys and collection of the infected plants and <b>green</b> <b>leafhoppers</b> were conducted in some tungro endemic areas, including: West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, Central Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, Bali and West Nusa Tenggara.

The virulence of tungro viruses was determined based on diseases indexes (DI). Results showed that the virulence of tungro viruses varied among region in the endemic areas in Indonesia. The Central Java virus isolate was the most virulence; however, not all isolates from endemic areas in the island of Java were more virulent than those from outside of Java. The presence of RTBV and RTSV was detected in the infected TN 1 plants. The existences of molecular diversities of tungro viruses from the endemic areas were observed. The relationship between combination of DNA bands of RTBV and RTSV with the virulence in endemic areas outside of Java was more complex than it was in West Java and Central Java.

Nusantara Bioscience 4 : 32 - 35. Tungro virus is one of most important diseases of rice plants caused by double infection with RTBV and RTSV which is transmitted by Nephotettix virescens Distant. The interaction between host and virus-vector are still quitted difficult to understand. The aims of this study were: (i) to know {{the character of the}} total protein band pattern of rice plants infected with tungro virus compared to the health one, (ii) to look at the different between the band profiles of total protein of N. virescens that consume the host rice plants infected by tungro virus and that of the healthy rice plants. Total protein band profiles of rice plants were identified using SDS-PAGE. To extract the leaves, buffer merchapto-ethanol was used, while the sample extraction of <b>green</b> <b>leafhoppers</b> employed buffer PBS IX, and for staining the protein coomassie brilliant blue was used. Data were analyzed descriptively based on the score of the migration of the band (Rf). The results showed that the protein contains of every 0. 5 g of healthy leaves and the infected by the virus were 0. 567 g and 1. 011 g respectively. Clear difference of the protein pattern was found in the healthy plant and the infected one. In general, the entire band in the infected plant was much thicker compared to the infected leaves. Protein bands with a higher quantity were expressed by the protein on the molecular weight of 108, and 117 kDa. These proteins are presumably from the group of β-galactosidase and bovine serum albumin. The function of such proteins is still unknown, but it {{may be related to the}} plant’s responses to virus infection, because the protein did not appear in the healthy plants. The total protein content of both N. virescens which acquired the healthy leaves and the infected one were 0. 1395 g and 0. 1546 g respectively.

40|$|Rice tungro disease (RTD) is a {{significant}} yield constraint in rice-growing areas of South and Southeast Asia. Disease symptoms are caused largely by infection by the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). Two host transcription factors, RF 2 a and RF 2 b, regulate expression of the RTBV promoter and are important for plant development. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of these factors in transgenic rice resulted in phenotypes that mimic the symptoms of RTD, whereas overexpression of RF 2 a and RF 2 b had essentially no impact on plant development. Conversely, lines with elevated expression of RF 2 a or RF 2 b showed weak or no symptoms of infection after Agrobacterium inoculation of RTBV, whereas control plants showed severe stunting and leaf discoloration.

The number of N. virescens was higher in non-endemic area with less intensive use of insecticide than in non-endemic area with intensive use of insecticides. Nephotettix virescens was found in the low (1000 m). In the higher altitude, N. nigropictus was the only <b>green</b> rice <b>leafhopper</b> species collected and it was also present in the mid and lower levels in non-RTV-endemic area with lower intensity of insecticide use. Rice tungro virus disease was not endemic in the areas where N. nigropictus was found in this study. The significance of the present study results on the management of RTV and its vectors is discussed...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the studies}} on the pipunculid flies in paddy fields, their {{seasonal}} abundance and percentage parasitism in the <b>green</b> rice <b>leafhopper</b> N. cincticeps were studied in insecticide-treated and untreated paddy fields. Four pipunculid species were frequently caught from August to October. The percentage of parasitism in host adults by the flies was high in June- July and in October-November...|$|R
40|$|Tungro {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} viral diseases of rice in South and Southeast Asia. It is associated with two viruses [...] -rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV),and rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) (Hibino et al 1978). Both viruses are transmitted by the <b>green</b> <b>leafhopper</b> (GLH) Nephotettix virescens (Ling 1979), However, prior acquisition of RTSV is required for Ihe transmission of RTBV alone (Hibino 1983). Plants infected with both viruses show severe stunting and yellowing. Those infected with RTBV alone show mild stunting but no leaf discoloration whereas those infected with RTSV alone do not show any apparent symptoms (Hibino el al 1978). Since the late 1960 s, tungro has been mainly managed through varietal resistance (Khush 1989). The instability of resistant varieties in the field (Dahal et. a 1 1990) led to a reexamination of the nature of the incorporated sources of resistance and to the adoption of more precise and more accurate screening methods...|$|R
40|$|Of {{recent years}} the {{population}} density of the rice <b>green</b> <b>leafhopper</b> in paddy-fields has increased. One of the reasons of this increase {{is said to be}} the result of the decrease of the natural enemies of this hopper owing to the wide application of insecticide in the paddy-fields. And so the more informations concerning in the natural enemies of this hopper are needed. Up to now, following natural enemies of this hopper has been listed from Japan. Among these, Nos. 3, 8, 10, 14 and 17 are said to be most useful for the check of this hopper. On the parasitic Dorilaidae, there has been no further informations since the valuable paper of Esaki and Hashimoto (1937). Thus the members of this family have long been throughly neglected. But these flies no doubt play a very important part in helping to keep this pest in check, juding from the high percentage of parasitism found in the data of the hoppers disected and the abundance of hovering adult flies in the paddy-fields. In this paper, four species of the Dorilaid fly reared from the <b>green</b> rice <b>leafhopper</b> are described, of which three are new to the science and one is new to the fauna of Japan- Ecological items and about immature stages of these flies will be given in the forthcoming Series of paper. Before going further, I wish to express my sincer gratitude to the entomologists mentioned below for the loan of materials; Dr. S. Ito of the College of Agriculture, University of Osaka Prefecture, Messrs. H. Hasegawa and N. Fukuhara of the National Institute of Agric. Sciences, Tokyo and Mr. A. Tsuboi of the Okayama Agric. Exp. Station...|$|R
