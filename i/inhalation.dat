5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by <b>inhalation</b> should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by <b>inhalation</b> at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E

40|$|CONCLUSIONS: In {{order to}} confirm these {{preliminary}} results, a prospective double-blind {{study has been}} instituted in Padova University ENT Section to compare the efficacy of sulphurous-arsenical-ferruginous thermal water nasal irrigations vs isotonic sodium chloride solution nasal irrigations after functional endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis. OBJECTIVES: Despite their widespread use, much uncertainty exists about the indications and therapeutic mechanisms of nasal thermal water <b>inhalations</b> {{in the treatment of}} sinonasal chronic disease. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effects of sulphurous-arsenical-ferruginous thermal water <b>inhalations</b> on nasal respiratory flow, mucociliary transport, nasal cytology, and chemo-physics of nasal mucus in a group of consecutive patients with chronic sinonasal disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with chronic sinonasal disease underwent a 12 -day course of sulphurous-arsenical-ferruginous thermal water warm vapour <b>inhalations</b> (38 degrees C) followed by nasal aerosol of the same thermal water (7 microns micelle). RESULTS: This preliminary study showed that a course of sulphurous-arsenical-ferruginous thermal water <b>inhalations</b> determined a significant improvement in nasal flow and reduction of nasal resistance; a statistically significant reduction of mean mucociliary transport time, from pathologic to physiologic values, has also been shown. Statistical analysis of our data confirmed that the presence of nasal bacteria was significantly reduced by thermal water <b>inhalations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon <b>inhalation,</b> 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both <b>inhalation</b> and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
