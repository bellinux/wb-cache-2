25|$|The Persian Journal {{reports that}} the 1975 Algiers {{agreement}} that defines the current Iran-Iraq boundary does not delimit the border beyond the shoreline into the territorial seas in the Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq have different approaches to the method that should be used. Iran wishes to divide its maritime boundaries {{on the basis of}} the equidistance principle, whereas Iraq believes the entrance of the Persian Gulf requires special criteria. This incident may have happened in an area that both sides consider as their own territory. Military units may have the right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> in each other's waters, but this incident involved boarding and compliance inspection and was not simple <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.|$|E
25|$|In April 1959 Iran {{altered the}} legal status of the strait by {{expanding}} its territorial sea to 12-nautical-mile (22km) and declaring that it would recognize only transit by <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> through the newly expanded area. In July 1972, Oman expanded its territorial sea to 12nm by decree. Thus, by mid-1972, the Strait of Hormuz was completely “closed” by the combined territorial waters of Iran and Oman. During the 1970s, neither Iran or Oman attempted to impede the passage of warships through the strait, but in the 1980s, both countries asserted claims that were different with customary (old) law. Upon ratifying UNCLOS in August 1989, Oman submitted declarations confirming its 1981 royal decree that only <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> is permitted through its territorial sea. The declarations further asserted that prior permission was required before foreign warships could pass through Omani territorial waters. Upon signing the convention in December 1982, Iran entered a declaration stating “that only states parties to the Law of the Sea Convention shall be entitled to benefit from the contractual rights created therein”, including “the right of transit passage through straits used for international navigation”. In May 1993, Iran enacted a comprehensive law on maritime areas, several provisions of which conflict with UNCLOS provisions, including a requirement that warships, submarines, and nuclear-powered ships obtain permission before exercising <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> through Iran’s territorial waters.The United States does not recognize any of the claims by Oman and Iran and has contested each of them.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} the {{incident}} a British MoD investigation report was released which stated that {{the area in which}} the incident took place was not covered by any internationally agreed delineation. US forces had defined an operational boundary, but that had not been published to Iran, and Iranian forces crossed this operational boundary an average of 12 times per month. Since the 1975 Algiers Agreement the Shatt al-Arab channel had shifted in favour of Iran, and any Iranian notional boundary was not known to the US coalition. While <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> is permitted in each other's waters, boarding and compliance inspections in another state's waters would not be lawful.|$|E
50|$|If {{a single}} act of folly was more {{responsible}} for this explosion than any other, it was the arbitrary and dangerous announced decision that the Straits of Tiran would be closed. The right of <b>innocent,</b> maritime <b>passage</b> must be preserved for all nations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Basil" [...] was {{the second}} work of fiction which I produced. On its appearance, it was {{condemned}} off-hand, by a certain class of readers, as an outrage on their sense of propriety. Conscious of having designed and written, my story with the strictest regard to true delicacy, as distinguished from false--I allowed the prurient misinterpretation of certain perfectly <b>innocent</b> <b>passages</b> in this book to assert itself as offensively as it pleased, without troubling myself to protest against an expression of opinion which aroused in me no other feeling than a feeling of contempt. I knew that [...] "Basil" [...] had {{nothing to fear from}} pure-minded readers; and I left these pages to stand or fall on such merits as they possessed. Slowly and surely, my story forced its way through all adverse criticism, to a place in the public favour which it has never lost since. Some of the most valued friends I now possess, were made for me by [...] "Basil." [...] Some of the most gratifying recognitions of my labours which I have received, from readers personally strangers to me, have been recognitions of the purity of this story, from the first page to the last. All the indulgence I need now ask for [...] "Basil," [...] is indulgence for literary defects, which are the result of inexperience; which no correction can wholly remove; and which no one sees more plainly, after a lapse of ten years, than the writer himself.|$|R
5000|$|Fifth, {{the crisis}} underlines the {{importance}} of respect for political independence and territorial integrity of all {{the states of the}} area. We reaffirmed that principle at the height of this crisis. We reaffirm it again today on behalf of all.This principle can be effective in the Middle East only on the basis of peace between the parties. The nations of the region have had only fragile and violated truce lines for 20 years. What they now need are recognized boundaries and other arrangements that will give them security against terror, destruction, and war.There are some who have urged, as a single, simple solution, an immediate return to the situation as it was on June 4. As our distinguished and able Ambassador, Mr. Arthur Goldberg, has already said, this is not a prescription for peace but for renewed hostilities. Certainly troops must be withdrawn, but there must also be recognized rights of national life, progress in solving the refugee problem, freedom of <b>innocent</b> maritime <b>passage,</b> limitation of the arms race, and respect for political independence and territorial integrity." ...|$|R
500|$|The Foreign Office, meanwhile, was {{determined}} not to back down {{in the face of what}} was seen as a further affront to British prestige and a challenge. Thorneycroft argued that if the Victorious did not pass through the Straits on her return journey, Britain [...] "should suffer a substantial political defeat with unpredictable effects on our military position in the Far East," [...] and was supported in this view by Admiral Mountbatten and David Luce, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff. Mountbatten went even further, warning Thorneycroft that a failure to meet the challenge would have [...] "serious repercussions" [...] on Britain's [...] "whole military stature, not only in the Far East but worldwide." [...] Luce and Mountbatten also thought this the perfect opportunity to put pressure on Jakarta for the first time, Luce stating that the return passage [...] "might pass the initiative to us" [...] and Mountbatten seeing it as an opportune moment to divert Sukarno from his Malaysian raiding. At the very least, <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> through the Strait had to be defended.|$|E
500|$|In the Cabinet {{meeting of}} the next morning, Butler raised the issue once more, informing them that Indonesia was {{attempting}} to prevent the <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> of the Victorious through the Sunda Strait on the pretext of naval exercises. Thorneycroft then spoke, stating that Sukarno would [...] "gain in prestige" [...] if he stopped the vessels from sailing through and that he might close other waters to the Royal Navy should he be successful. He acknowledged that he had originally planned to send the carrier through the Strait herself, but after discussion with Head and Begg decided to send the destroyers through instead, and send the Victorious north around Sumatra. The ships would {{still be able to}} uphold the right of passage while forcing Sukarno to either attack them or let them through. If Indonesia did attack the ships, [...] "it would be an act of war... and we [...] should have to retaliate in force." [...] Though the Cabinet noted that the destroyers could be lost if attacked, it was deemed necessary not to bend to Sukarno. Britain and Indonesia were on the precipice of all-out war.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{incident}} was more serious. On 22 October 1946, a Royal Navy flotilla {{composed of the}} cruisers HMS Mauritius and HMS Leander, and the destroyers [...] and HMS Volage, was ordered northward through the Corfu Channel with the express orders to test the Albanian reaction to their right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage.</b> The crews were instructed to respond if attacked.|$|E
5000|$|Letters {{from the}} Earth was written after {{the deaths of}} Twain's {{daughter}} Suzy (1896) and of his wife Olivia (1904). Textual references make clear that sections, at least, of Letters from the Earth were written {{shortly before his death}} in April 1910. (For instance, Letter VII, in discussing the ravages of hookworm, refers to the $1,000,000 gift of John D. Rockefeller Jr. to help eradicate the disease - a gift that was announced on October 28, 1909, less than six months before Twain's death.) However, the following excerpt appears in a discussion of the Palestinian town of Nablous, in The <b>Innocents</b> Abroad. This <b>passage</b> was written more than four decades before his death, in 1867 or 1868, and appears to be an oblique reference to the idea that later became Letters from the Earth.|$|R
500|$|The present Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) {{was drafted}} in 1982 and came into force in 1994. It states that [...] "the high seas {{are open to}} all states, whether coastal or land-locked" [...] and {{provides}} a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, the building of artificial islands, fishing, and scientific research. It extended territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles (...) from a baseline generally (but not always) equivalent to the low-water line; this area is subject to national laws but free to both <b>innocent</b> and transit <b>passage.</b> (The [...] "internal waters" [...] landward of the baseline are solely under national control.) A [...] "contiguous zone" [...] of a further 12 nmi are permitted for hot pursuit of vessels charged with violating customs, taxation, immigration, or pollution laws in the territorial waters. An [...] "exclusive economic zone" [...] or EEZ places all exploitation of marine life and minerals within 200 nmi (...) of the baseline under national supervision. For legal purposes, the [...] "continental shelf" [...] {{is considered to be}} the actual continental shelf (to a depth of [...] ) contiguous to the baseline or 200 nmi, whichever is greater; the marine life and minerals [...] "attached to" [...] (or below) the seabed within this area also fall under national supervision.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Innocent</b> <b>passage</b> is {{a concept}} in {{the law of the}} sea that allows for a vessel to pass through the {{territorial}} waters of another state, subject to certain restrictions.

50|$|At {{the time}} the Soviet Union {{recognized}} the right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> for warships in its territorial waters solely in designated sea lanes. The United States believed there was no legal basis for a coastal nation to limit warship transits to sea lanes only. Subsequently the U.S. Department of State found that unlike the English-language text of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Russian-language text of Article 22, paragraph 1 allowed the coastal state to regulate the right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> whenever necessary. Following the incident, the Soviet Union expressed a commitment {{to resolve the issue}} of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> in Soviet territorial waters.|$|E

50|$|The Black Sea bumping {{incident}} of 12 February 1988 occurred when American cruiser USS Yorktown tried {{to exercise the}} right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> through Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea during the Cold War. The cruiser was bumped by the Soviet frigate Bezzavetny {{with the intention of}} pushing the Yorktown into international waters. This incident also involved the destroyer USS Caron, sailing in company with USS Yorktown, which, also claiming the right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage,</b> was intentionally shouldered by a Soviet Mirka-class frigate SKR-6. The Yorktown reported minor damage to its hull, with no holing or risk of flooding. The Caron was not damaged.|$|E
5000|$|In inland waters, {{sovereignty}} {{of the state is}} equal to that which it exercises on the mainland. The coastal state is free to make laws relating to its internal waters, regulate any use, and use any resource. In the absence of agreements to the contrary, foreign vessels have no right of passage within internal waters, and this lack of right to <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> is the key difference between internal waters and territorial waters. The [...] "archipelagic waters" [...] within the outermost islands of archipelagic states are treated as internal waters with the exception that <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> must be allowed, although the archipelagic state may designate certain sea lanes in these waters.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, [...] "The Rules of Navigation and Sojourn of Foreign Warships in the Territorial Waters and Internal Waters and Ports of the USSR," [...] {{enacted by}} the Soviet Council of Ministers in 1983, {{acknowledged}} the right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> of foreign warships only in restricted areas of the Soviet territorial waters in the Baltic, Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan; no sea lanes for <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> in the Black Sea were designated. The Soviet vessels and aircraft were routinely dispatched to observe US warships there. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union viewed the US presence in the Black Sea {{as an attempt to}} undermine improving Soviet-American relations.|$|E
5000|$|State {{practice}} and {{customary international law}} is that ships of all states have a right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> through territorial seas. That Egypt had consistently granted passage {{as a matter of}} state practice until then suggests that its opinio juris in that regard was consistent with practice. Moreover, during the Egyptian occupation of the Saudi islands of Sanafir and Tiran in 1950, it provided assurances to the US that the military occupation would not be used to prevent free passage, and that Egypt recognizes that such free passage is [...] "in conformity with the international {{practice and}} the recognized principles of international law.". In 1949 the International Court of Justice held in the Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania) that where a strait was overlapped by a territorial sea foreign ships, including warships, had unsuspendable right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> through such straits used for international navigation between parts of the high seas, but express provision for <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> through straits within the territorial sea of a foreign state was not codified until the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone.|$|E

50|$|It made {{it clear}} that the text of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) {{reflected}} customary international law, and every ship, regardless of cargo, does not need permission to enter another state's territorial sea so long as it adheres to the definition of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> in Article 19 of UNCLOS.|$|E

"The Rules of Navigation and Sojourn of Foreign Warships in the Territorial Waters and Internal Waters and Ports of the USSR", {{enacted by}} the Soviet Council of Ministers in 1983, {{acknowledged}} the right of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> of foreign warships only in restricted areas of the Soviet territorial waters in the Baltic, Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan. There were no sea lanes for <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> in the Black Sea. The United States meanwhile, starting from 1979, conducted a freedom of navigation program as the U.S. government believed that many countries were beginning to assert jurisdictional boundaries that far exceeded traditional claims. The program was specifically implemented because diplomatic protests seemed ineffective. The U.S. actions in the Black Sea were challenged by the Soviet Union several times prior to the 1986 incident, particularly on 9 December 1968, August 1979 and on 18 February 1984.|$|E

50|$|The Corfu Channel case (Affaire du Détroit de Corfou) was {{a public}} {{international}} law case heard before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) between 1947 and 1949, concerning state responsibility for damages at sea, {{as well as the}} doctrine of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage.</b> A contentious case, {{it was the first of}} any type heard by the ICJ after its establishment in 1945.|$|E
50|$|On the {{question}} of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage,</b> the Court found {{in favor of the}} United Kingdom, voting fourteen to two. Notably, the Court held that a right to <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> existed during times of peace through straits like the Corfu Channel, which connected two parts of the high seas. The Court accepted that some Albanian regulation of passage through the Channel would have been acceptable, but not to the extent of demanding prior authorization, or of barring the passage of warships outright. This served to clarify the 1930 Hague Conference with respect to international straits. Bing Bing Jia stated that this decision meant that in peacetime, a country could not prohibit the passage of all vessels, or otherwise require authorization. Jia goes on to argue that, because Albania was unable to rapidly distinguish between the passage of Greek and other vessels during times of high political tensions, the requirement of prior notification could be lawful.|$|E
50|$|Straits {{used for}} {{international}} navigation through the territorial sea between {{one part of}} the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and another part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone are subject to the legal regime of transit passage (Strait of Gibraltar, Dover Strait, Strait of Hormuz). The regime of <b>innocent</b> <b>passage</b> applies in straits used for international navigation (1) that connect a part of high seas or an exclusive economic zone with the territorial sea of coastal nation (Strait of Tiran, Strait of Juan de Fuca, Strait of Baltiysk) and (2) in straits formed by an island of a state bordering the strait and its mainland if there exists seaward of the island a route through the high seas or through an exclusive economic zone of similar convenience with respect to navigational and hydrographical characteristics (Strait of Messina, Pentland Firth).
