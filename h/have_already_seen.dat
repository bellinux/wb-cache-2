5|$|Last Night in Twisted River took 20 {{years to}} {{conceive}} and write, {{and is a}} story within a story that shows {{the development of a}} novelist and the writing process. It uses many of the themes and plot devices that <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> treatment in other works by the author. The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself, making it Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel.|$|E
5|$|The boom {{in urban}} {{development}} and modern architecture has brought some {{changes to the}} city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> massive urban development. Ørestad now has seen most of the recent development. Located near Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts {{one of the largest}} malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the IT University and a high school.|$|E
25|$|Those {{representatives of}} the bourgeoisie who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture {{are a bunch of}} counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once {{conditions}} are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them we <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> through; others we have not. Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like Khruschev for example, who are still nestling beside us.|$|E

25|$|By taking limits, certain {{rational}} {{products with}} infinitely many factors can be evaluated {{in terms of}} the gamma function as well. Due to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, analytic functions can be written as infinite products, and these can sometimes be represented as finite products or quotients of the gamma function. We <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> one striking example: the reflection formula essentially represents the sine function as the product of two gamma functions. Starting from this formula, the exponential function as well as all the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions can be expressed {{in terms of the}} gamma function.|$|E
500|$|... "While it's easy to {{complain}} about a stretch of so-so movies," [...] wrote Matt Patches at Hollywood.com as 2012 began, [...] "the twist is we should really be thanking the studios for catering to niche audiences all month." [...] For most viewers, it {{is a chance to}} catch up on the major awards contenders released in December. But studios and the filmgoers who <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> those two films can benefit from creative risk-taking by filmmakers. He points to Cloverfield as one such gamble that succeeded. Smaller film distributors also take advantage of the dump months to bring little-seen but highly praised films like Kill List to wider audiences via home-media releases.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} a [...] "minor plot point" [...] {{in the third}} season of House of Cards, in which Frank Underwood plays the game; he is {{inspired}} by video gamer reviewer Thomas Yates's elegant description of Monument Valley to bring the reviewer on as his biographer. According to the studio Ustwo, they were approached by Netflix about including {{the game in the}} story, and the studio readily agreed without any financial compensation. They made a specialized version of the game for the show to aid in filming and to meet a description of the game provided within the script for the first episode in which it appeared. Ustwo saw the opportunity to introduce the title to a different audience set, and <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> an increase in sales {{as a result of this}} appearance. The game re-entered the top of the most download app charts on the major app stores a few days after the February 2015 release of the season on Netflix. Monument Valley characters were added to the cast of Crossy Road in late 2015.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for its depth. IGN's Doug Perry called GoldenEye 007 an immersive game which [...] "blends smart strategy gameplay with fast-action gunmanship". Similarly, Greg Sewart of Gaming Age {{remarked that}} players have [...] "a bit of freedom {{as to what}} they want to do in any given situation, and what order the directives are completed in". Reviewers also enjoyed the wide variety of weapons and the multi-objective-based missions, stating that they make the game stay [...] "fresh by never having you do the same thing twice". The controls were praised for being more intuitive than Acclaim's earlier well-received Nintendo 64 first-person shooter [...] Game Revolution credited the gameplay for being realistic and different from other shooters, but also criticised the campaign for being badly paced. The publication noted that GoldenEye 007 [...] "takes it for granted that you <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> the movie" [...] and that players may get stuck due to the game's lack of orientation. At the time, the multiplayer mode was considered the best multiplayer game on the system, [...] "edging Mario Kart 64 by a hair" [...] according to IGN. Edge called it addictive and praised the originality of some of the scenarios such as You Only Live Twice.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN was {{positive}} about [...] "Homer The Whopper", giving it an 8.6/10 rating. He {{commented that the}} first act of the episode was the strongest, while the others were weaker. Canning believed {{the reason for this}} was that the viewers <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> Homer [...] "struggle with his weight countless times, and Rogen's trainer, though funny much of the time, will likely never be remembered as a classic guest role." [...] He added, however, that Rogen and Goldberg are able to find [...] "a few new angles with the weight jokes, so it's not a complete loss." [...] Overall, Canning thought [...] "Homer The Whopper" [...] was a good start to the twenty-first season, and although the plot may not be very original, the writers added [...] "freshness to the proceedings." [...] The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff did not think the script was as good as Gervais', but commented that Rogen and Goldberg [...] "managed to make a mostly amusing season premiere." [...] He added that he thought the Hollywood satirizing featured in this episode had been overused on the show, but [...] "the specificity of what the [...] was making fun of—trainers who help stars slim down (in this case, helping Homer slim down)—went a long way toward making the episode palatable." [...] VanDerWerff concluded that while the episode [...] "didn’t try anything new , [...] had fun with it all the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is quite}} clear, that {{whatever}} {{may be the}} operation of such an act, {{due process of law}} makes no part of it. Does it deprive any person of property? A very large proportion of the property of civilized men exists in the form of contracts. These contracts almost invariably stipulate for the payment of money. And we <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> that contracts in the United States, prior to the act under consideration, for the payment of money, were contracts to pay the sums specified in gold and silver coin.|$|E
2500|$|With Guo Jing's assistance, the Mongol army conquers the Jin dynasty and {{subsequently}} turns its attention towards the Song dynasty. Guo Jing {{is unwilling to}} aid the Mongols in attacking his native land so he leaves Mongolia. Guo Jing returns to the Song dynasty and helps his fellow Han Chinese counter the impending Mongol invasion. On the other hand, Yang Kang dies from poisoning after attempting to kill Huang Rong with a palm strike, but ends up hitting her spiked soft armour, which was stained with poison. He leaves behind Mu Nianci and their unborn son, whom Guo Jing named [...] "Yang Guo". In the meantime, the Mongol invasion temporarily stops when Genghis Khan dies unexpectedly, although Guo Jing and Huang Rong <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> countless civilian deaths due to the Mongol conquests.|$|E

2500|$|Some would {{maintain}} that the premier animal of the Indo-European sacrifice and ritual was probably the horse. We <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> how its embedment in Proto-Indo-European society lies not just in its lexical reconstruction {{but also in the}} proliferation of personal names which contain [...] "horse" [...] as an element among the various Indo-European peoples. Furthermore, we witness the importance of the horse in Indo-European rituals and mythology. One of the most obvious examples is the recurrent depiction of twins such as the Indic Asvins [...] "horsemen," [...] the Greek horsemen Castor and Pollux, the legendary Anglo-Saxon settlers Horsa and Hengist [...] or the Irish twins of Macha, born after she had completed a horse race. All of these attest the existence of Indo-European divine twins associated with or represented by horses.|$|E
2500|$|... "Picasso's {{interest}} in stoneware was further {{stimulated by the}} examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> at Vollard's) was the gruesome Oviri. Until 1987, when the Musée d'Orsay acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) {{it had never been}} recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the Demoiselles. Although just under 30 inches high , Oviri has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by Oviri. 50 years later he was delighted when [...] Cooper and I told him that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his Cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to primitivism." ...|$|E
2500|$|French critic Georges Sadoul commented: [...] "more than in {{the sheer}} scale of the battle scenes", the film's [...] "merit lies in its sense of the Russian landscape", to continue: [...] "Though perhaps an {{impressive}} example of film-making on large scale," [...] it was [...] "ponderous by any standard" [...] and [...] "tediously faithful" [...] to the novel, with [...] "none of its narrative flair or spirit [...] Occasional bravura or touching episodes are not adequate for the dogged pedantry." [...] Claude Mauriac wrote in Le Figaro littéraire that [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> many Soviet films [...] But {{this is the most}} beautiful I have seen since, well, since when?" [...] Peter Cowie noted that Bondarchuk brought to his adaptation [...] "the epic sweep that had eluded King Vidor." [...] Joseph Gelmis of Newsday agreed that the film was [...] "superior [...] as drama and spectacle. Bondartchouk isn't an innovator. Instead he uses virtually every movie technique extant ... an antiwar film that celebrates life, love, renewal".|$|E

2500|$|That {{dispersion}} of power, though seen by many, then and later, {{as a major}} weakness of the Republic, was actually the foundation stone of De Witt's political system, that he called de Ware Vrijheid (the [...] "True Freedom"). We <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>seen</b> that De Witt primarily defended Oldenbarnevelt's and Grotius' claim to supremacy of (Holland's) provincial sovereignty over {{the sovereignty of the}} Generality under this moniker. But the doctrine went further. [...] "True Freedom" [...] implied the rejection of an [...] "eminent head", not only of the federal state (where it would have conflicted with provincial sovereignty), but also of the provincial political system. De Witt considered Princes and Potentates as such, as detrimental to the public good, because of their inherent tendency to waste tax payer's money on military adventures in search of glory and useless territorial aggrandizement. As the province of Holland only abutted friendly territory, the Holland regents had no territorial designs themselves, and they looked askance at such designs by the other provinces, because they knew they were likely to have to foot the bill anyway. The Republic therefore from time to time threw its weight around in the German principalities to the East, but always to protect strategic interests, not for territorial gain. Likewise, after the dispute over the Overmaas territory (which still had been left over from the Munster treaty) was settled with the partition treaty of 1661 with Spain, there were no further territorial claims in the Southern Netherlands, till after the War of Spanish Succession fundamentally changed the strategic situation.|$|E

U have the same venom moss [...] look at Palestine [...] noo u must be bushed alive and skinned and your off used as garden fertiliser [...] ". The Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation responded with a statement wherein it [...] "views the hateful post by Velaphi Khumalo in a serious light. Our key mandate is nation-building and social cohesion. His sentiments take our country backwards and do not reflect what the Gauteng provincial government stands for.” Khumalo was suspended on full pay while an investigation was undertaken, was found to be guilty by an internal disciplinary procedure, and issued with a warning, whereafter he resumed his work at the department.|$|E
