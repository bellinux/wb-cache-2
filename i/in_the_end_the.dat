5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>the</b> Māoris {{remained}} in position until 17 April. Throughout {{the previous two}} days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received the order to fall back. With isolated platoons still {{in contact with the}} Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging. Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>the</b> battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00am.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> {{choice of}} {{armament}} and armor {{meant that the}} South Carolinas top speed was lower than HMS Dreadnought, the namesake British ship built shortly before the South Carolinas, and all future US battleships.|$|E

50|$|Gas, often air, {{is drawn}} into the pump through an inlet port <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> casing. The gas is trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{compression}} chambers formed by the impeller vanes and the liquid ring. <b>The</b> reduction <b>in</b> volume caused by the impeller rotation compresses the gas, which reports to <b>the</b> discharge port <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> casing.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{consider this}} one of the earliest, and most deadly, biological attacks in world history, though <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>the</b> Mongols were forced to retreat. Early sources state that the plague began its spread in the spring of 1346 at the River Don near the Black Sea, then spread throughout Russia, the Caucasus, and the Genovese provinces within the year.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} {{speculation}} that the rejection may have been, in part, retaliation for French involvement in convincing the Swiss not to purchase American-made LTV A-7 Corsair II aircraft that had been competing against a French design, the Dassault Milan. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> Swiss did not purchase either aircraft, opting for the Northrop F-5E Tiger II instead.|$|E
5|$|A day later, {{the owners}} of the {{previous}} bridge — the International Railway Company (IRC) — as well as the Minister of Highways Thomas Baker McQuesten announced intentions to construct a new span; a long political battle ensued for several years over the merits of private or public ownership of border crossings. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> Niagara Falls Bridge Commission (NFBC) paid the IRC $615,000 to purchase the right-of-way of the old bridge as well as the rights to construct the new one.|$|E

5|$|After Nicho el Millonario did {{not show}} up for a {{scheduled}} title match CMLL decided to vacate the championship and left it vacant for approximately five months. In late November 2003, CMLL held an eight-team, three-week tournament to crown new champions. Most of the teams in the tournament had not teamed up on a regular basis prior to the show, except for Los Nuevo Infernales. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> team of El Felino, Safari and Volador Jr., who was paired up for the tournament, defeated Alan Stone, Super Crazy, and Zumbido to win the titles.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt by Marge {{to win the}} money on the game show Jeopardy!, the Simpsons arrive home to find {{everyone}} in Springfield gathered on their lawn and Marge thinks they have forgiven them. However, while that is the case, they steal all of their belongings in order to cover the $15,000 debt. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> family playfully fight over a tattered washcloth, {{the only thing they}} have left.|$|E
5|$|After {{capturing}} Fort Duperre, the commandos received {{reports that}} a force of some 2,000 Zouaves were moving up to recapture the position. The French attack did not eventuate, however, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>the</b> commandos marched {{all the way to}} Maison Blanche. Having only been issued with rations for a day, they had to rely on fruit and bread that they obtained by bartering with the locals on the way. Eventually they arrived at the port, where they embarked upon the destroyers HMS Wheatland and Lammerton and in company with a force of US Rangers they set out to capture the airfields at Allerlick and Duzzerville, near Bone.|$|E

5|$|After initial {{organizational}} problems, the weakened detachment {{reached an}} {{area near the}} village of Košute where they were engaged by Ustaše Militia backed by Italian reinforcements. After a day of fighting and the death of one of their commanders, members of the detachment began to retreat. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> Partisans suffered four killed in action and 25 taken prisoner, while 13 managed to escape. All but three of the prisoners were later executed by firing squad. A Split Detachment was reformed, but most of its fighters were part of the 3rd Dalmatian Assault Brigade.|$|E
5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the concession to operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.|$|E
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 that the North Coast Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>the</b> train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after a rash of derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the North Coast Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> victorious {{imperial}} faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted {{a policy of}} continued modernization {{with an eye to}} eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E
5|$|As ABC's {{overexposure}} of the primetime Millionaire led {{the public}} to tire of the show, there was speculation that the show would not survive beyond the 2001–02 season. The staff planned on switching it to a format that would emphasize comedy more than the game and feature a host other than Philbin, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> primetime show was canceled, with its final episode airing on June 27, 2002.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts {{had little to do with}} the situation on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was not supposed to be longer than seven minutes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious {{force to be reckoned}} with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E
