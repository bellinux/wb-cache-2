40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} thermal comfort properties of surgical gowns made of dual <b>functional</b> <b>finish</b> cotton and nonwoven fabrics which have barrier properties of blood and micro-organism. Four types of surgical gowns, which were made of nonwoven fabrics with finish or without and were made of cotton with finish or without, were tested. The thermal insulations of four surgical gowns were measured with thermal manikin. Subjective experiments on thermal comfort, skin temperature and clothing microclimate were conducted. Six male subjects, between 26 and 28 years age old, participated in the wear trials tests. Typical activities for surgeons in the operation theater were simulated during the experimental sessions. Air temperature in a climate chamber was kept at 22 ℃ and its humidity was 60 %RH. Air velocity was controlled at less than 0. 15 m/s. Inner radiant temperature was almost equal to the air temperature. Basic thermal insulation of the dual functional finished nonwoven surgical gown was 0. 87 clo, which was slightly higher than that of untreated (0. 84 clo). However, the skin temperature of the subj ect wearing a dual functional finished surgical gown was significantly lower at P. 05. When the subject wears the dual functional finished gown, the amount of sweating was less than that when wearing untreated. Microclimate temperature and humidity of dual functional finished surgical gown were lower than untreated and it was statistically significant. There was no significant difference in subjective humid and overall comfort sensation between finished and untreated ones. Thermal sensation of dual functional finished one was significantly different from untreated one only during the first exercise. The results of this study indicate that the dual <b>functional</b> <b>finish</b> surgical gown allowed heat to be transferred from the skin of subject to the atmosphere better than untreated.

40|$|Chitosan, a {{naturally}} available biopolymer {{which is now}} increasingly used as a <b>functional</b> <b>finish</b> on textile substrates to impart antimicrobial characteristics and increase dye uptake of fabrics, was blended with different ratios of gelatinized starch. The chitosan was extracted and characterized by IR, 1 H-NMR, and X-ray powder diffraction. These blends were tested as thickeners in textile screen printing using Curcuma tinctoria as natural dye. The rheological properties and the viscosity of the printing paste were measured. The effect of chitosan on the printing properties of different fabrics (natural, blends, and synthetic fabrics) was studied by measuring the color strength value (K/S) and related color parameters of the printed fabrics. The antimicrobial properties of printed fabrics were assessed. The results proved that the printed fabrics using these new thickeners showed increase in the color strength value (K/S) giving darker color which means that chitosan increased the dye uptake on fabrics. Fastness properties of the printed fabrics to washing, rubbing, perspiration, and light have also been improved. The treated fabrics {{were found to be}} antimicrobial...|$|E

However, there are some defects of cotton cellulose fabrics which are easily wrinkling after being washed or immersed in water and sensitive to fire causing fatalities. Applying wrinkle-resistant finishing and flame-retardant finishing on cotton cellulose are the major issues studied in this thesis. The formulations of the two <b>functional</b> <b>finishes</b> were modified with addition of metal oxides and varying the curing condition in order to attain the best fabric performance after treatment. Different combinations of curing temperature and curing time have been studied to investigate the performance of <b>functional</b> <b>finishing.</b> It was found that curing temperature and curing time have significant effect on the wrinkle-resistant performance and the flame-retardant performance. Higher curing temperature and longer curing time resulted in a better performance as there was sufficient energy and duration for the reaction occurred. Moreover, it was confirmed that the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) have positive influence to the fabric functional performance with lower curing temperature. The treatment effectiveness can be enhanced by the addition of metal oxides which can improve the adverse effects of the treatment. The surface morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy and other advanced analytical techniques that gave the structural information of the treated fabrics. Besides, the role of TiO₂ in the two finishing treatments had been proposed.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} awareness of environmental pollution and the extensive 	consideration of mankind health, {{there has been}} an increased demand for natural fibers 	in textile materials recently. As a typical natural fiber, ramie is an increasingly popular 	because of its excellent properties including a high tensile strength, excellent thermal 	conductivity, coolness, ventilation function, moisture absorption, and antibacterial 	function. However, ramie fiber and ramie fabric have some disadvantages such as poor 	elasticity, low wrinkle recovery, low resilience, itchiness, harsh handle, which decreases 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric in the high-grade garment-fabric market. It is 	necessary to use the advanced technologies in the dyeing and finishing for enhancing 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric. This study is aimed to study the natural dyeing and 	<b>functional</b> <b>finishing</b> of ramie fabric. At present, ramie fabrics are mostly dyed with synthetic colorants which can give rise 	to serious environmental pollution and potential harm to mankind health. Thus the 	natural and healthy features of ramie fabric are greatly weakened. In this study, ramie 	fabrics were dyed with the several natural extracts. But heavy metal ions, which lead to 	environmental pollution, are usually used as mordant in natural dyeing. In this study, the 	eco-friendly rare earth was used as mordant in natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. The 	influences of dyeing conditions were studied. The ramie fabrics dyed using rare earth as 	mordant exhibited higher color shade stability against pH variation. Using rare earth as 	mordant in natural dyeing apparently enhanced the color fastness to washing, rubbing 	and light of the ramie fabrics. As compared with Fe 2 + and Cr 6 +, rare earth was more 	efficient, resulting in decrease of mordant concentration in natural dyeing. Thus rare 	earth was effective mordant in the natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. One of the shortcomings of ramie fabric is its lower wrinkle recovery. The typical 	wrinkle resistant finishing via cross-linking usually decreases strength of cellulose 	fabrics. In this study, ramie fabrics were pretreated with liquid ammonia (NH 3) prior to 	wrinkle resistant finishing. Meanwhile, a kind of thermally reactive polyurethane (PU) 	emulsion was used as strength protector. The liquid NH 3 pretreatment was proved todecrease crystallinity of ramie fiber and bring about apparent swelling effect. As a result, 	the accessibility of the ramie fabrics treated by liquid NH 3 was elevated. The liquid NH 3 	pretreatment prior to resin finishing gave rise to better wrinkle resistant effect and less 	strength loss. The thermally reactive PU emulsion was proved to decrease strength loss 	of ramie fabric without influencing wrinkle resistant effect. Using liquid NH 3 	pretreatment and employing reactive PU as protector in the wrinkle resistant finishing 	of ramie fabric can raise strength retention up to 80 %. After 10 laundry cycles, the flat 	appearance and the crease retention of these ramie fabrics were over grade 3. 0. Developing electromagnetic shielding textiles has drawn increasing attention recently 	since electromagnetic pollution is harmful to mankind health. In this study, super critical 	carbon dioxide (scCO 2) fluid technology was used to develop electromagnetic shielding 	ramie fabric. The scCO 2 treatment could remove the impurities of the ramie fibers 	prominently. The scCO 2 fluid could result in the swelling of ramie fiber and thus 	increase the absorbency of ramie fiber to additives. Using scCO 2 fluid, the Palladium 	(II) -hexafluoroacetylacetonate could be impregnated into the ramie fiber under 	appropriate conditions. After thermal decomposition at high temperature, the Palladium 	film formed on ramie fibers. The ramie fabrics bearing Palladium catalyst were plated 	with a cooper film via electroless cooper plating. The cooper coated ramie fabrics 	exhibited good shielding effect. This study presented a new way for developing 	electromagnetic shielding fabric. Nanoparticles have been extensively used for the <b>functional</b> <b>finishing</b> of textiles. But 	the nano finishing of ramie fabrics has less been studied. In this study, the 	multifunctional ramie fabrics coated by TiO 2 nanoparticle were developed. The optimal 	dispersion conditions of TiO 2 nanoparticles in aqueous suspension were studied in 	details. A kind of hydrophilic silica aerogel product was proved to be suitable for 	serving as dispersant for dispersion of TiO 2. Using the TiO 2 suspension prepared in 	optimal conditions, ramie fabrics were coated with TiO 2 via a dip-pad-dry process. In 	order to enhance the finishing durability the ramie fabric were pretreated by citric acid 	prior to nano finishing. The ramie fabric finished with working bath containing 0. 8 g/L 	TiO 2 was proved exhibited excellent UV protection and antibacterial property, and high capability for decomposing formaldehyde. Treating fabric with citric acid before coating 	could improve the washing durability of the resultant TiO 2 loaded ramie fabrics. This study explored several ways for developing healthy and highly functional ramie 	fabrics with high added value. The resultant ramie fabrics exhibited high quality. The 	newly developed dyeing and finishing processes are supposed to be helpful for raising 	the competitiveness of ramie and expanding its application...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOn today's markets {{has become}} {{increasingly}} complex since products contain more functions and have to meet increasing demands such as user-friendliness, manufacturability and ecological considerations. Eco-friendly <b>functional</b> apparel <b>finishing</b> for health and amenity using scented material has been applied by micro-encapsulation method. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop complex-functional textiles by sticking cinnamon, pine and lemon scented microcapsules on sports-towel which can be given effect with refresh fragrance features for user’ healthy. The microcapsule wall was made from urea-formaldehyde (UF) and scented materials were produced by in-situ polymerization using UF. In the subjective evaluation, scented sports-towel questionnaires consist of 22 items. 204 subjects are first divided into gender blocks before they are randomly assigned group. On the other results of emotional evaluation, using Principle Components Analysis (PCA) for Category Identification and Regression Analysis for Quantification Theory, 5 emotion factors were categorized. Most specific factors correlated moderately with “refreshment” and “eco-friendly” emotion. Special attention is given to the relation between emotional evaluation and “refreshment” of emotion. Furthermore, many studies about the emotional clothing's performance and future ability of the design to increase the value of the emotional connection of the customer would be developed...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} factor in high performance sportswear is the thermo-physiological wear comfort. The sportswear {{is responsible to}} support the thermal comfort of the wearer and consequently the thermoregulation, which means helping in body’s heat regulation by maintaining the skin temperature of 33 °C and body’s core temperature of 37 °C. Each sport has its own requisites and rowing is no exception. In the following investigation there were examined three different groups of water-repellent <b>finished</b> <b>functional</b> rowing shirts, featuring different knitting structures. The shirts were tested in a climatic chamber with a thermal manikin under constant conditions and afterwards analyzed using infrared thermography. The objective was {{to find out which}} sample shirts and knitting structures provide the best performance under different environmental conditions. FC...|$|R
40|$|Brno Lesna {{is ranked}} among the most highly {{regarded}} housing estates in Czechoslovakia ever since {{it was built in}} the 1960 s. Mainly due to its ideal location at southern slopes around natural ravine and timeless urban design. This settlement at the time also constituted the most perfect realization of the current method of construction in our country. It was fully <b>functional</b> and completely <b>finished</b> even before first residents moved in. However, cultivated expression of housing architecture was recently severely affected by inappropriate revitalization. Change of ownership after the events of November 1989 also opened the way for development companies desiring to open spaces to build new apartment buildings. Original inhabitants, though, fight against it and seek for protection of whole settlement as heritage...|$|R
