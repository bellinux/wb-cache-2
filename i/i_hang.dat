500|$|After {{pitching}} {{the strategy}} to RCA, Miguel first marketed Kaleidoscope Dream virally with a three-volume series of EPs entitled Art Dealer Chic, which were released as free downloads during February to April 2012 and previewed {{songs from the}} album. He released two more EPs—Kaleidoscope Dream: Water Preview on July 31 and Air Preview on September 11— to digital retailers. In an interview for The Village Voice, Miguel said that the strategy allowed listeners to absorb the songs at his desired pace and called it [...] "a great {{way for me to}} reconnect with my peers ... the people that <b>I</b> <b>hang</b> out with—that go to the same shows, listen to the same music, read the same blogs, same magazines." ...|$|E

The introspective track [...] "The Line" [...] has a downtempo, spiritual sound with lyrics about dealing with some unnamed adversity. According to one critic, it [...] "could be about his MIA status ('Will <b>I</b> <b>hang</b> or get left hangin?/Will I fall off or is it bangin?/I say it's up to God'), or about anyone facing doubters with a revolver loaded with talent and self-confidence ('I'm gonna {{put my finger on}} the trigger/I'm gonna pull it, and then we gon' see/What the deal/I'm for real')". Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be [...] "unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which a young black man lays out the reasons he's ready to die-leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should have to think about it". Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet viewed that the adversity is [...] "the price of fame" [...] or [...] "lamenting a lost lover".|$|E
