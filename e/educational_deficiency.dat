40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of Durban-Westville, 1996. Statistics {{suggest that}} there are {{approximately}} 15 million educationally deficient adults in South Africa (Population Census, 1991). Given the widespread extent of <b>educational</b> <b>deficiency</b> among black adults, and the weak adult education base that exists currently, the study is formulated on the notion that alternative adult education provision can serve as a vehicle to transform the educational status of this sector. Methodologically the study is a theoretically based one, with a component of empirical analysis which utilizes census data and secondary analysis. The study applies radical theory to develop a historical perspective of the socio-political conditions of black schooling which were characterized by inadequate access, high drop-out rates, widespread failure, and a low quality of provision. Despite periodic expansionist and reformist strategies black educational provision remained inadequate and inferior. Four changing reformist strategies which reflect contradictory aspects are identified during the period 1953 - 1990, namely self-help (1953 - 1963), black education and the bantustan strategy (1963 - 1973), educational reform for economic expansion and political stability (1973 - 1983), and the repression of popular mobilization (1983 - 1990). It is in this context that the widespread extent of <b>educational</b> <b>deficiency</b> among black adults is interpreted as a consequence of poor educational provision within specific socio-political circumstances. In advancing a critical theory of schooling, the study utilizes a marxist paradigm reflecting deterministic, voluntaristic, and autonomous functions of the black education system in South African society. These changing roles of the educational system have reflected dominant theoretical positions in particular sequence, namely reproduction (1800 s- 1975), resistance (1976 - 1990), and transformation (1990 onwards). This critical theory of schooling is further contextualized to serve as a basis to transform adult education provision, so that it may effectively address the needs of the educationally deficient adult population. To achieve this, the study proposes that adult education provision must be reformulated along the lines of critical literacy and cultural power. An indepth analysis of adult education as a field of study is provided, focusing on definitions, issues relating to content, purpose, and practice, ideological debates, strategies, purposes, providers, target groups, and factors affecting participation and recruitment. The main conclusions of the study relate to the conditions of the black schooling system as a contributory factor in black adult <b>educational</b> <b>deficiency,</b> the extent of adult <b>educational</b> <b>deficiency,</b> sociological implications, and current educational provision in South Africa. The recommendations of the study focus on transforming initial basic educational provision, developing a culture of learning, and the implementation of a policy of adult education...|$|E

40|$|The {{essence of}} the problem facing {{education}} systems in Africa is that the expansion of enrolments, in response to public demand, is exceeding the capacity of African economies to maintain educational quality. The gap in learning achievements between African students {{and those of the}} industrial countries is widening to unbridgeable proportions. This extent of <b>educational</b> <b>deficiency</b> has implications for the state of health, ferti 1 ity and agricultural productivity of the populace and threatens a condition of perpetual intellectual dependency. There is an empirical re 1 ationship between educational attainment and the increase in human we 1 l-being and potentia 1 but much remains to be learned about its precise magnitude and the mechanisms that can strengthen it. Associated with the practical problem of inadequate basic education and the research problems of incomplete understanding is a shortage of trained analysts and researchers that make up the problem-solving capability of the African nations. The significance of education in the debate about the means of fostering improvement in Africa lies in the demonstrated relationship between education and different forms of economic and social development. From the standpoint of this evidence, it is the low level of investment in human resources that accounts for much of the stagnation and decline that are aff 1 icting most African countries. Despite impressive expansion of education enrolments in the last twenty-five years, {{there is a need for}} more education. The urgent questions facing African governments and donor agencies are what kind of education should be provided, what po 1 icies should govern its provision, and how can it be financed? This paper offers a broad review of the condition of education in Africa in an attempt to provide information and insight that can assist in thinking about these questions and about the ways in which education can contribute to development on the continent...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study that}} aims to discern whether there are any {{differences}} between upper secondary level school textbooks published both before The Living History Forum (a government agency that works with issues on tolerance, democracy and human rights) was founded and after with regards to their depiction of Judaism in general and anti-Semitism and the Holocaust in particular. Underscoring the relevancy of this topic, in 1997 CEIFO (The Centre for Research in International Migration and Ethnic Relations) and Brå (Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention) conducted a survey among school children which revealed {{a lack of knowledge}} regarding the Holocaust (including whether it had even occurred). With this <b>educational</b> <b>deficiency</b> in mind, this study attempts to determine if there is an active development in text-book authoring regarding this subject. Using Norman Fairclough's critical discourse analysis (CDA) eight textbooks (four old and four new) are examined and compared in order to see if there have been changes in discourse regarding this topic over time. Fairclough's critical discourse analysis is a method used to analyse the relationship between discourse and changes in social and cultural development, and is thus employed in this case to determine if any significant changes have been made in textbooks regarding this topic. As a future teacher in religion it is important for me (and others) to be aware of this type of issue {{in order to be able}} to combat it when encountered in schools.

This Note argues that courts should instead base remedies on state statutes that permit states to disestablish-i. e., to withdraw authority from-deficient school districts. Disestablishment, like other structural remedies, is largely self-implementing and avoids judicial entanglement in day-to-day administration.

40|$|With {{changes in}} policy {{relating}} to juvenile offenders being {{heavily influenced by}} the perceived public opinion of juvenile crime, {{the opinion of the}} public on the appropriate punishment for young offenders is important within contemporary society (Mukherjee, 1997). Public opinion research suggested that while society remains unsatisfied with current methods used to punish juvenile offenders, they believe a juvenile 2 ̆ 7 s punishment should be proportionate to the crime and that rehabilitation should be the main goal of juvenile punishment (Barber 2 ̆ 6 Doon, 2004). This research further suggested that ignorance of both the juvenile 2 ̆ 7 s circumstances and the perceived prevalence of juvenile crime may account for the harsh attitude that has been directed towards juvenile offenders in recent decades (Covell 2 ̆ 6 Howe, 1996). The literature examining the relationship between childhood factors and juvenile offending suggests that both childhood stability and <b>educational</b> <b>deficiencies</b> influence the likelihood of a child becoming involved in criminal behaviour (Lane, 2003). While the impact on offending behaviour of both of these childhood factors has been examined thoroughly by the scientific community, little research has investigated the influence the public perceives these factors should have on punishment. Therefore future research should investigate the Australian public 2 ̆ 7 s opinion on how severely juveniles should be punished, what forms the punishment should take, what the appropriate goals of juvenile punishment should be and whether childhood factors that predispose criminal behaviour such as childhood stability and <b>educational</b> <b>deficiencies</b> should be considered. While {{research in the area of}} childhood factors that predispose youths to criminal behaviour has developed a comprehensive theoretical basis, the current body of research fails to explore practical applications of this knowledge in the justice system. The purpose of this research was to bridge this gap in the literature by exploring whether society believes that childhood factors, such as an unstable childhood and educational difficulties, should influence the severity of the consequence a young offender should receive and the appropriate goal of punishment for the consequence. The study consists of a 2 x 2 (childhood stability x educational difficulties) between subjects design with the implementation of a quantitative research approach which also involved participants explaining their responses. 120 participants were randomly assigned to four experimental groups in which they received a questionnaire with a scenario containing experimentally manipulated information. The results indicate that participants believe the stability of the young offender 2 ̆ 7 s childhood and any difficulties they had with their education should not influence the severity of the consequence they receive. The results further indicate that in theory participants believe that the consequence given to a young offender should act as an individual deterrent, while in practise they suggest specific consequences that reflect a general deterrence goal of punishment. However participants do believe that young offenders with unstable childhoods and difficulties with their education are more suited to a rehabilitative goal of punishment than those with more stable childhood backgrounds...|$|R

The {{construction of an}} illiterate population {{has been part of}} an "othering " process by the state and serves to create a national ideology of illiteracy that locates the blame for <b>educational</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in the individual, rather than in the structural inequalities within society. Women must move beyond looking at individuals to the processes of production to see how the practices of the dominant discourse are lodged in social relations. An emerging feminist discourse is exploring the issue of literacy. First, it is examining the social forces that restrict women from pursuing their desire to engage in literacy practices that reflect the specificity of their needs, including social disapproval and situational barriers, the sexual division of labor, the control of women's sexuality. Second, this feminist discourse is exploring what must change to meet women's needs. Research shows that women in literacy programs want both social contact and an educational event. Women-positive programs can be a first step in reducing women's isolation. Small groups could move from the personal to the political. Third, the feminist discourse is investigating what resistance literacy workers might encounter as they actively begin to support women. The resistance comes from funders, colleagues, male students, and the male partners of the women students. (Contains 44 references.)

We found a statistical difference between the residents of two centers compared to the third with P= 0. 04 and 0. 02 respectively. After one month of rotation in PEM, we observed a decrease in the post-rotation test scores as compared to the pre-rotation scores. Since the reasons for the lower scores could not be identified by this study, <b>educational</b> <b>deficiencies</b> should be identified and perhaps a focused teaching and allotted study time to optimize the residents educational objective could be advised...|$|R

The need {{to redress}} the <b>educational</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of the {{workforce}} and adult population generally is enormous, especially in the poverty stricken rural areas of the country. While the government has committed itself to redressing adult illiteracy, there are other issues like the language policy which make the situation even more complex. Although the country has eleven official languages, {{all of which have}} been recognized and given equal status, it is generally accepted that English will remain an important language of wider communication and of international communication for South Africa. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the teaching of literacy in English as a second language (ESL) in literacy programmes in a rural area of Mapulaneng, in the Mpumalanga Province. For this aim to be achieved, an interpretive design is applied, and qualitative data-collection methods are used, which include the analysis of written documents, observations and interviews. The major finding of this investigation is: The teaching of literacy in ESL is not successful in Mapulaneng, a rural area of the Mpumalanga Province. The main reasons for this are: • The teaching of English literacy is approached inappropriately. Adult learners are not literate in the first language commonly used at the centres - Northern Sotho. The main implications of the findings are: There is a need for the training of literacy teachers in this rural area of Mapulaneng. There is a need for some form of communication between the Department of Education and Culture and all the stakeholders involved in adult education. Although not replacing the other languages, English should remain as the main language of learning...|$|R
