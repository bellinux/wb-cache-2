5|$|Edward habitually smoked twenty {{cigarettes}} and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, {{a type of}} cancer affecting the skin next to <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>was</b> cured with radium. Towards {{the end of his}} life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999 Don King and Oscar De la Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, agreed to co-promote a mega-fight for the Lineal, WBC and IBF welterweight championships on September 18, 1999, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. Early in the fight De la Hoya {{employed}} boxing to connect combinations while avoiding Trinidad's attacks. The second round began with both boxers trading punches but De la Hoya quickly returned to his previous tactic, which he employed in the third round. In the fourth round Trinidad pressured the offense while De la Hoya tried to avoid his punches by moving, both boxers eventually exchanged punches. In the fifth round Trinidad continued in the offensive while De la Hoya attempted {{to remain on the}} outside corners of the ring, Trinidad's eye was swollen following a trade of punches, and <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> also bleeding. Trinidad was having a lot of problems finding De La Hoya and couldn't connect as flush as usual with his punches, although he scored at times, Oscar's movement was not letting him land in combination and it was proclaimed by many to have been a lackluster fight. In the eighth round the swelling on Trinidad's eye was worsening. Oscar was scoring on Trinidad but halfway through the tenth, De La Hoya stopped sticking and basically disengaged. De La Hoya gassed out and had remained on his toes {{for the remainder of the}} bout, and Trinidad won all the final rounds.The judges gave Trinidad a very controversial majority decision, with scores of 115–113, 115–114 and 114–114.|$|E
25|$|Ring is {{believed}} to have been a cricketing fatality. It seems that <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> broken in the summer of 1800 by a practice ball bowled by his brother George. Ring became ill and was bedridden for several weeks before dying on 25 October, evidently of a fever that developed as a result of his accident.|$|E

25|$|In late 1915, Robeson {{became the}} third African-American student ever {{enrolled}} at Rutgers, {{and the only}} one at the time. He tried out for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team, and his resolve to make the squad was tested as his teammates engaged in excessive play, during which <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> broken and his shoulder dislocated. The coach, Foster Sanford, decided he had overcome the provocation and announced that he had made the team.|$|E
25|$|Canutt {{had been}} {{perfecting}} tricks {{such as the}} Crupper Mount, a leapfrog over the horse's rump into the saddle. Douglas Fairbanks used some in his film The Gaucho. Fairbanks and Canutt became friends and competed regularly at Fairbanks' gym. Canutt took small parts in pictures to get experience. It was in Branded a Bandit (1924) that <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> broken in a 12-foot fall from a cliff. The picture was delayed several weeks, and when it resumed, Canutt's close shots were from the side. A plastic surgeon reset the nose, which healed, inspiring Canutt to remark that he thought it looked better.|$|E
25|$|Mero {{began playing}} {{football}} in {{his senior year}} at Liverpool High School, with his team winning the New York State Public High School Athletic Association Title {{under the tutelage of}} future University of Central Florida coach George O'Leary. In the same year, Mero began training as a boxer under Golden Gloves coach Ray Rinaldi. Mero went on to win four New York State titles, including the New York Golden Gloves tournament. Mero intended to become a professional boxer, but his career was sidelined after <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> broken in an accident. He briefly pursued a bodybuilding career, placing third in the Mr. New York State bodybuilding contest.|$|E

50|$|After Noah Bennet confronts Mohinder {{about the}} {{painting}} depicting {{him with a}} Company-issue gun and a broken nose, Mohinder explains that he hasn't <b>been</b> given one. <b>His</b> <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> also fine. When Maury Parkman attacks the Company and corrupts Niki Sanders, however, <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> broken by her. After she injects herself with the modified virus, which Mohinder cannot cure, Bob suggests tracking down Claire Bennet, whose ability {{might be able to}} produce a viable cure.

500|$|In {{addition}} to his distinctive name, Z. Marcas has a remarkable appearance which his neighbors notice immediately. The story's first line refers to his [...] ("striking") appearance. As usual in his later work, Balzac describes Marcas by relating him to an animal: [...] "L'animal de Marcas était le lion. Ses cheveux ressemblaient à une crinière, son nez était court, écrasé, large et fendu au bout comme celui d'un lion, il avait le front partagé comme celui d'un lion par un sillon puissant, divisé en deux lobes vigoureux." [...] ("The animal for Marcas was the lion. His hair was like a mane, <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> short and flat; broad and dented at the tip like a lion's; his brow, like a lion's, was strongly marked with a deep median furrow, dividing two powerful bosses.") ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The {{first thing that}} comes to mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|The idea of Lisa dating Nelson {{had been}} around for a while, with several {{different}} versions being pitched. The writers wanted a [...] "silly" [...] Homer story to balance the episode out, and the idea of using the telemarketing scam for this had also {{been around for a}} while. By this time, the show had begun to have episodes revolving around secondary characters. This was the first episode to revolve around Nelson, and was done to partly explain why Nelson acts the way he does. The words to Nelson's song were contributed by Mike Scully's daughters. The scene in which Milhouse passes Lisa's note to Nelson was written by Bill Oakley, with the line, [...] "He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze", being George Meyer's line. There was a debate as to how injured Milhouse should look without it looking disturbing, and the drop of blood coming from <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> decided to be enough. Milhouse liking Vaseline on toast was based on a child from Josh Weinstein's school days who everyday would get onto the bus with a piece of toast, which had Vaseline on it.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Arnett's {{early days}} in journalism were in Southeast Asia, {{particularly}} Bangkok. He started out running a small English-language newspaper in Laos in 1960. Eventually, {{he made his way}} to Vietnam where he became a reporter for the Associated Press, based in Saigon. [...] Writing articles such as [...] "Death of Supply Column 21" [...] attracted the ire of the American government.

50|$|The Prince {{ordered his}} entourage of courtiers {{to leave him}} and wandered, disconsolate. For {{the first time in}} his life, he was alone. He meets the Fairy, a little old woman who takes quite some time {{adjusting}} her spectacles to look him over.

The Prince is stunned to find the Fairy thinks <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> ridiculous. He sees that everyone flatters her and assumes they have deceived her into believing her tiny <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> not a fault. How foolish some people are, he thinks, not to see the reality of their own character. At dinner, which he is very glad to get, his hunger prompts him to put up with her repeated observations about the length of <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> Finally, he asks her to stop mentioning <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> She agrees, promising that she will not only stop talking about it, she will even try to believe he has an ordinary nose, though clearly it could make three reasonable sized ones.
