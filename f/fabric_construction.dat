The VCP-1 was powered by a Wright-built [...] Hispano-Suiza 8 V-8 engine and had tapered single-bay biplane wings.

Of wood and <b>fabric</b> <b>construction,</b> it was a conventional, low-wing monoplane with a tailwheel undercarriage and a single seat, open cockpit, though there was the option of a bubble hood. The constant chord wings were almost square ended and the tailplane, fin and rudder also angular.

H 577 P ITC 2015 Wongxvii, 271 pages :illustrationsThe {{alarming}} {{increase of}} incidence {{of skin cancer}} has hastened the development and research of ultraviolet (UV) protective clothing. Although various fabric parameters that affect the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission were studied by researchers, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approaches for enhancing UV protection. Knitwear is an indispensable clothing in summer but there were few studies concerning knitted fabrics, in particular the influence of <b>fabric</b> <b>constructions</b> on ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and structural properties. This thesis aimed at studying the UV protective property of knitted fabrics at a fundamental level by investigating the influence of different knit structures upon UPF with the three main knit stitches incorporated in the cotton knitted <b>fabric</b> <b>constructions,</b> namely, knit, tuck and miss stitches. The impacts of yarn characteristics, <b>fabric</b> <b>constructions,</b> coloration, end-use conditions including stretching, wetting and laundering, on UV protection were comprehensively studied. A metallic biaxial stretching equipment was specially developed {{for the evaluation of}} UV protection of fabrics in stretched condition. The results showed that fabrics with different knit structures have distinct performances in UV protection. A fabric with miss stitches offered remarkable UV protection whereas a fabric with tuck stitches exhibited poor UV protection. The colored knitted fabric with miss stitches imparted relatively better UV protection in a lighter color depth than the fabric with tuck stitches that were dyed in a darker shade. It infers the potential for reducing usage of dyestuffs and chemical auxiliaries in manufacturing UV protective clothing. Besides, knitted fabrics with miss stitches retained good UV protection under the stretched and wet conditions that simulating the daily wearing conditions of knitwear. The results of this study would provide value-added information to textile designers, manufacturers, and consumers for the enhancement of UV protection and selection of UV protective knitwear.

The P.V.2 {{was a small}} single engined biplane, powered by a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine driving a four blage propellor. [...] It was of wood and <b>fabric</b> <b>construction,</b> and of sesquiplane configuration, i.e. with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing (both of which used the high-lift wing sections pioneered by the P.V.1). Unusually, the aircraft's wing bracing struts also carried the aircraft's floats, forming a [...] "W" [...] shape when viewed from the front.

2500|$|The Westland Weasel was {{designed}} by Westland Aircraft of Yeovil to meet the Royal Air Force's Type IIIA Specification for a two-seat fighter/reconnaissance aircraft to replace the successful Bristol Fighter. An order for three prototypes was placed in April 1918, together with orders for competing designs from Bristol (the Badger) and Austin Motors (the Greyhound). The Weasel was a two-bay biplane of wood and <b>fabric</b> <b>construction,</b> with the pilot and observer/gunner seated close together in separate cockpits, with the upper wing above the pilot being cut away to improve the upwards view. Armament {{was similar to the}} Bristol Fighter, with two synchronised Vickers guns and one or two Lewis guns for the observer. [...] Like the other two competitors, the Weasel was powered by the officially encouraged ABC Dragonfly 9-cylinder air-cooled radial engine.|$|E
2500|$|The Parnall Elf was {{designed}} by Harold Bolas, chief designer of the reformed George Parnall & Co. The type made its public debut at Olympia in July 1929. The Elf was a biplane of wood and <b>fabric</b> <b>construction</b> with staggered wings set well forward on the fuselage as a feature to assist crew escape in an emergency. The wings were unusually braced with 'vee' interplane struts which dispensed with any flying wires [...] and could be folded for ease of hangarage. The main fuel tank was fitted in the fuselage, while a pump raised the fuel to a small tank in the wing centre section where it was then fed to the engine by gravity. An Elf placed fifth in the 1930 King's Cup Air Race out of a field of 88 entrants. The purchase price of the aircraft at this time was between £875 and £890.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by a {{visit to}} the Whitney Museum's {{exhibition}} [...] "Abstract Design in American Quilts," [...] in the early 1970s, Loving takes his canvases off the stretcher bars and begins experimenting. He started hanging strips of canvas from the walls and ceilings, playing with our perception of pictorial and sculptural ideals. Then, he reattached the fragments together with a sewing machine, creating large flowing <b>fabric</b> <b>constructions.</b> At first he painted the pieces of canvas, but later switched to dying the fabric. This way of working was not born out of a vacuum; Sam Gilliam, Alan Shields, and Richard Moch were also using the sewing machine. In fact, Loving considered himself within the context of abstract expressionism at this phase in his career; though he was not a painter but a material abstractionist.|$|R
40|$|Clothing {{provides}} intrinsic ultraviolet (UV) {{protection that}} can be improved by colouration. However, the daily wearing condition can undermine the UV protection of coloured clothing wherein garments are stretched by body movement and/or wetted by perspiration of wearers.

This article aimed at narrowing the research gap {{by focusing on the}} UV protection against stretch and wetness provided by various knitted <b>fabric</b> <b>constructions</b> incorporating the knit, tuck and miss stitches. The results show that the black knitted fabrics exhibit a significant reduction in the UV protection factor by 53 % on average at a 10 % stretch level.
