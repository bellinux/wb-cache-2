40|$|Purpose This paper {{explores the}} {{recruiting}} and organising methods used by Irish <b>full-time</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> to recruit new {{members in the}} private sector of the economy. Design/methodology/approach The analysis is based on a survey of <b>full-time</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> in eight Irish trade unions. Findings Results indicate that the use of organising techniques by officials had no significant impact on changes in membership numbers but did have a significant and positive impact on reported changes in new members. However, the variance explained was extremely modest. Research limitations and implications A potential limitation is that we assess the organising model solely from the perspective of <b>full-time</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials.</b> An area for future research would be t...|$|R

40|$|This {{book is a}} {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between <b>full-time</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> and shop stewards across the whole of British industry (public and private, manufacturing and services) in 1986 – 91. It is the first major study of <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> for 20 years, {{and one of the most}} detailed studies of workplace collective bargaining and union organisation following the recession of the early 1980 s. In the wake of recession, union decline, industrial restructuring, anti-union legislation, and changes in union policies (towards a new realism), Britain is said by some commentators to be entering a new era of industrial relations. This book provides a unique body of evidence that throws new light on this claim, and casts serious doubt on its validity. It combines survey, interview, questionnaire and observation data and thus overcomes the well known limitations of both large-scale surveys and individual case studies...|$|R
40|$|Enpirical {{case study}} {{analysis}} of shop steward organisation within three specific manufacturing plants in Merseyside {{has been conducted}} {{with the aim of}} contributing {{to an understanding of the}} dynamics of steward organisation, activity and consciousness within British manufacturing industry more generally. This involves not merely a snap-shot of contemporary developments but an historical overview of the past 20 years that will be of relevance to an understanding of potential future trends. Methods of data collection include extensive interviews - with shop stewards, union members, managers and <b>full-time</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> - analysis of documentary evidence and personal observation. The research is informed by a Marxist analytical framework, namely that there is a contradiction in the nature of workplace trade unionism - between conflict and acconinodation in stewards' relationship to management, between democracy and bureaucracy in stewards' relationship to rank and file members and between independence and dependence in stewards' relationship to <b>full-time</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials.</b> Because the balance struck between these interrelated and overlapping tendencies varies, depending on the level of workers' confidence, activity and militancy vis-a-vis management, an evaluation is made of the different 'micro-level' factors which affect the balance of bargaining power in each workplace and of the way these are located within the much broader 'macrolevel' social, economic and political context of the changing balance of class forces in society, with a contrast being drawn between the broad upturn in workers' struggles during the 1970 s and the downturn of the 1980 g. A central concern is a critique of Eric Batstone's 'strong bargaining relations' model of pragmatic shop steward organisation, which, as the case studies illustrate, merely serves to reinforce the limitations and compromises of workplace trade unionism within capitalist society. The distinctive potential role of revolutionary socialist organisatlon and leadership is posed as a vital missing element...|$|R

40|$|The Great Recession {{has left}} {{in its wake}} an {{expected}} “age of austerity” where deficits accumulated to stave off economic collapse, are being addressed through steep cuts to government spending, with profound implications for social services and public sector employment.
