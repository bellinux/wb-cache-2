5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (mass) density of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless <b>dissipation</b> <b>factor.</b> For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' low-energy thermal state with little internal temperature gradient, and an 'excited' high-energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a low-energy state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E

40|$|The {{bilateral}} {{control of a}} teleoperator in Cartesian space with time-varying delay is studied in this paper. Compared with the traditional joint-space teleoperation mode, {{bilateral control}} in Cartesian space has advantages when dealing with the kinematically dissimilar (KDS) teleoperation systems. A Cartesian space-based PD-like bilateral controller with <b>dissipation</b> <b>factors</b> is designed. Considering the fact that attitude errors derived by rotation matrix cannot be directly used for PD control, a quaternion-based approach is adopted to calculate the attitude errors in Cartesian space. In order to overcome the instability brought about by communication delay, local damping components are employed {{at both ends of}} the teleoperator system. The variation of time delay may generate extra energy and influence the stability of the system, thus <b>dissipation</b> <b>factors</b> are introduced into the controller. The stability of the proposed bilateral controller is proved and the simulations show the effectiveness of the approach...|$|R

A major result is that, when realistic (e. g., finite conductivity) materials are used, small antenna systems exhibit <b>dissipation</b> <b>factors</b> which scale as $(ka) ^{- 4 }$, rather than $(ka) ^{- 2 }$ as previously predicted under the assumption of lossless external tuning.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of PhysicsRobert SzoszkiewiczProteins are {{involved}} {{in many of the}} essential cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, muscle function, enzymatic activity or signaling. It has been observed that the biological function of many proteins is critically connected to their folded conformation. Thus, the studies of the process of protein folding have become one of the central questions at the intersection of biophysics and biochemistry. We propose to use the changes of the nanomechanical properties of these biomolecules as a proxy to study how the single proteins fold. In the first steps towards this goal, the work presented in this thesis is concentrated on studies of unfolding forces and pathways of one particular multidomain protein, as well as on development of the novel method to study elastic spring constant and mechanical energy <b>dissipation</b> <b>factors</b> of simple proteins and peptides. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we present the results of the mean unfolding forces of the NRR region of the Notch 1 protein. Those results are obtained using force spectroscopy techniques with the atomic force microscope (AFM) on a single molecule level. We study force-induced protein unfolding patterns and relate those to the conformational transitions within the protein using available crystal structure of the Notch protein and molecular dynamics simulations. Notch is an important protein, involved in triggering leukemia and breast cancers in metazoans, i. e., animals and humans. In the second part of this thesis we develop a model to obtain quantitative measurements of the molecular stiffness and mechanical energy <b>dissipation</b> <b>factors</b> for selected simple proteins and polypeptides from the AFM force spectroscopy measurements. We have developed this model by measuring the shifts of several thermally excited resonance frequencies of atomic force microscopy cantilevers in contact with the biomolecules. Next, we provided partial experimental validation of this model using peptide films. Ultimately, our results are expected to contribute in the future to the developments of medical sciences, which are advancing at a level, where human health and disease can be traced down to molecular scale...|$|R
25|$|Charging a {{capacitor}} (due to a voltage between the capacitor plates) causes an electric field {{to be applied}} to the dielectric between the electrodes. This field exerts a torque on the molecular dipoles, causing the directions of the dipole moments to align with the field direction. This change in the molecular dipoles is called oriented polarization and also causes heat to be generated, resulting in dielectric losses (see <b>dissipation</b> <b>factor).</b> The orientation of the dipoles does not follow the electric field synchronously, but is delayed by a time constant that depends on the material. This delay corresponds to a hysteresis response of the polarization to the external field.|$|E

For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) cable fault locators, in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E
