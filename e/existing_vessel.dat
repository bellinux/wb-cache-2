It was however permissible to modify or [...] "rebuild" [...] an <b>existing</b> <b>vessel.</b> The best information available indicates that the registration of a much smaller, two-masted vessel built in Cacilhas in 1883, named Gazella (spelled with two Ls), was transferred by the owners to the newly built vessel in 1901.

40|$|Angiogenesis {{refers to}} the {{formation}} of new blood vessels, or neovascularization, and is essential for normal tissue growth and development (Folkman and Klagsbrun, 1987; Klagsbrun and D’Amore, 1991). The angiogenic process begins with capil-lary proliferation and culminates in formation of a new micro-circulatory bed composed of arterioles, capillaries and venules. The initial component of angiogenesis, capillary proliferation, consists of at least three processes: (1) fragmentation of the basement membrane of the <b>existing</b> <b>vessel,</b> (2) migration of endothelial cells (the primary cell type constituting capillaries) from the <b>existing</b> <b>vessel</b> toward the angiogenic stimulus and (3) proliferation of endothelial cells (Folkman and Klagsbrun, 1987; Klagsbrun and D’Amore, 1991).

40|$|Cancer is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} in the world after {{cardiovascular}} diseases. Some types of cancer cells often travel {{to other parts of the}} body through blood circulation or lymph vessels, where they begin to grow. This process is recognized as metastasis. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from <b>existing</b> <b>vessel.</b> Normally angiogenesis is a healthy process, that helps the body to heal wounds and repair damaged body tissues, whereas in cancerous condition this process supports new blood vessels formation that provide a tumor with its own blood supply, nutrients and allow it to grow. The most important proximal factor for angiogenesis is the vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF. Angioinhibition is a form of targeted therapy that uses drugs to stop tumors from making new blood vessels. Therefore, in this paper we analyse the importance of VEGF as target of cancer therapy, analysing murine models...|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{above-mentioned}} results {{in conjunction with}} the total cost of the separator, it was decided to opt for Case 3 as the best configuration. It should be mentioned that the smaller the diameter, the less the vessel will weigh and therefore the lower it cost (Stewart and Arnold 2008; Mulyandasari 2011). A high condensate–water separation performance along with a low water content at the condensate outlet was predicted for this case. In addition, the high condensate percentage at the gas outlet in this case could have been decreased by using a suitable mist extractor. It should also emphasize that vessel number three can effectively handle increasing the gas and water flow rates. The dimensions of this vessel were compared with the length and diameter of the existing three-phase separator of NIOC, which was a three-phase horizontal separator with a seam to seam length of 5000  mm and a diameter of 1850  mm. No difference in dimensions of the Case 3 and <b>existing</b> <b>vessel</b> was observed.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that vascular neoformation {{can be divided}} into three main stages (which may be overlapping) : (1) changes within the <b>existing</b> <b>vessel,</b> (2) formation of a new channel, (3) maturation of the new vessel.

In this model, a single layer of endothelial cells is separated by a vascular wall from an extracellular tissue matrix. A coupled system of ordinary and partial differential equations is derived which, in the presence of an angiogenic agent, predicts the aggregation of the endothelial cells and the collapse of the vascular lamina, opening a passage into the extracellular matrix. We refer to this as the onset of vascular sprouting. The model admits extension to several angio [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the development}} of a low wash design for a river patrol craft. The new design was to replace an <b>existing</b> <b>vessel</b> which creates substantial wave wash at normal operating speeds and high speeds. In order to assess the potential contending designs a series of computational and model scale tests were carried out on a monohull and two catamaran designs. This entailed measurements of resistance, trim and wave wash heights. Near full scale tests were carried out on the three hull forms and wash measurements were made. Broad agreement between the computational, model and near full scale wave wash prediction was achieved. The results of the investigation were used to develop a final design which was of catamaran form. Construction of the vessel is described including materials selection and the build processes, with the aim of minimum impact upon the environment. Overall, the research, development and design programme has added substantially to the potential for improved safety in inland waterway and inshore patrol and rescue craft, while also providing benefits to both the riverbank, atmospheric and water environment...|$|E
40|$|Blood vessel {{networks}} {{expand in}} a 2 -step process {{that begins with}} vessel sprouting and is followed by vessel anastomosis. Vessel sprouting is induced by chemotactic gradients of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates tip cell protrusion. Yet {{it is not known}} which factors promote the fusion of neighboring tip cells to add new circuits to the <b>existing</b> <b>vessel</b> network. By combining the analysis of mouse mutants defective in macrophage development or VEGF signaling with live imaging in zebrafish, we now show that macrophages promote tip cell fusion downstream of VEGF-mediated tip cell induction. Macrophages therefore play a hitherto unidentified and unexpected role as vascular fusion cells. Moreover, we show that there are striking molecular similarities between the pro-angiogenic tissue macrophages essential for vascular development and those that promote the angiogenic switch in cancer, including the expression of the cell-surface proteins TIE 2 and NRP 1. Our findings suggest that tissue macrophages are a target for antiangiogenic therapies, but that they could equally well be exploited to stimulate tissue vascularization in ischemic disease...|$|E
