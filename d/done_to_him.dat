5|$|Back in {{the present}} Fox Mulder is dismayed to hear what his father was {{involved}} in. He asks Dales how Skur escaped and Dales speculates that someone might have helped Skur escape hoping that {{the truth of what}} was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> may one day be revealed. The episode ends with a final flashback of Bill Mulder driving down a road with Skur and giving Skur the keys to the car and walking away.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Machination's attempted takeover, Sunstreaker and Hunter are successfully separated by Ratchet. Hunter has a happy reunion with Verity and Jimmy, but Sunstreaker, angry over what has been <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> abandons his former partner. After the initial battles on Earth, the Decepticons lie low, experimenting with creating new life and eventually creating the Insecticons {{to take advantage of a}} now captured Hunter, as well as thousands of failed experiments eventually dubbed the Swarm. As the Autobots have reinforced their position on Earth, the Decepticons lure them into a trap by planting disinformation about a Decepticon trap with the help of Sunstreaker, who is convinced that he is in fact helping Starscream kill Megatron. His motives are darker than merely helping the Autobots win by disposing of Megatron - he asks the Decepticon to kill all the humans in revenge for what was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Armed with the disillusioned Autobot's knowledge, unified and with their new weapon - Devastator - the Decepticons decimate the Autobots. Planning to dispose of them through a portal to Cybertron, Prime manages to fight them off long enough for his troops to escape through the portal, though at great cost - Prime is heavily damaged and rendered comatose by the damage he takes, and the Autobots are marooned on Cybertron.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than going}} to war, Helmichis, Rosamund and their {{followers}} escaped to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis {{in order to be}} free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.|$|E

5|$|Shinra pursue Zack and Cloud, {{and catch}} up with them just outside Midgar. Leaving the still semi-conscious Cloud hidden away, Zack fights off an {{enormous}} number of Shinra troops, but is ultimately fatally wounded. Cloud manages to crawl to Zack's body after Shinra has left, and Zack, in his dying breath, bequeaths the Buster Sword to Cloud, as Angeal had <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Cloud then begins to walk to Midgar. The epilogue recreates the opening scenes of Final Fantasy VII, as Cloud, his memories confused, claims to be a former SOLDIER.|$|E
5|$|Book One, Awake to Emptiness, {{begins with}} Bold and Psin, scouts in Timur's army, {{discovering}} a Magyar village {{where all the}} inhabitants have died from a plague. Timur turns his army around and orders the scouting party executed to avoid the plague, but Bold escapes and wanders through the dead lands of Eastern Europe (encountering only one lone native). Upon reaching the sea he is captured by Turkish Muslim slave-traders and sold into Zheng He's Chinese treasure fleet. Bold befriends a young African slave, named Kyu, whom he cares for after the Chinese castrate him. In China, they are kept as kitchen slaves until escaping and eventually making their way north to Beijing where they find work at the palace of Zhu Gaozhi, heir to the Yongle Emperor. The vengeful Kyu hates the Chinese for what they have <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and he incites violence between the eunuchs and the Confucian administrative officials.|$|E

Hrothgar tells both Beowulf and Wiglaf, who had been sleeping outside the hall during the attack, {{that it was the}} work of Grendel's mother. She is the last of the Water Demons, who were thought to have left the land. Beowulf and Wiglaf travel to the demon's cave to slay her. Beowulf enters the cave alone and encounters the demon, who {{takes the form of a}} beautiful woman. She offers to make him the greatest king who ever lived, in exchange for Hrothogar's drinking horn and a son, to replace Grendel.|$|E

25|$|Suffolk {{fell from}} {{power at the}} {{beginning}} of 1450, and Heydon and Tuddenham immediately found themselves under attack by their principal opponents in East Anglia. Sir John Fastolf, a kinsman of John Paston's wife, Margaret, immediately requested a servant to provide him with a list of the wrongs which Heydon had <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> over the previous thirteen years, and in October 1450, a commission was empowered to inquire into complaints in East Anglia. Indictments were drawn up which provided details of Heydon's and Tuddenham's actions during the previous fifteen years; according to Richmond, these allegations were perhaps biased, since Fastolf, John Paston, and the City of Norwich were among the principal informants, but it is 'likely that much of the shire was hostile to the pair of them'. During the years 1450–51 the Duke of Norfolk, John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, and Fastolf also exerted efforts to remove Suffolk's former agents from positions of local power. These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, however. By the spring of 1451 Suffolk's widow, Alice (d.1475), and Thomas Scales, 7th Baron Scales, had regained Suffolk's former dominance in East Anglia.|$|E
25|$|The palace was {{occupied}} by Pope Vigilius, the first pope of the Byzantine Papacy, in 547 during a papal visit to Constantinople. In 550, Vigilius decided that the Placidia Palace was not secure enough for his needs, and moved into the basilica of St. Peter of Hormisdas. From the basilica, Vigilius drafted a document of excommunication of Patriarch Menas and his followers, signed by another dozen Western bishops. Upon its publication, Comitas Dupondiaristes, the praetor of the Plebs, was dispatched to the basilica to arrest Vigilius and the African bishops with him. According to one account, Vigilius clung to the altar, and as the guards attempted to drag him, it toppled, nearly crushing him. The praetor withdrew, leaving several bishops injured. The next day, a group of Byzantine dignitaries convinced Vigilius that no more harm would be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> if {{he returned to the}} Placidia Palace, which he did. There, Vigilius was more or less placed under house arrest. On the night of December 23/24, 551, Vigilius fled across the Bosporus to the Church of St. Euphemia in Chalcedon. In February, the other bishops, but not Vigilius, were arrested. On June 26, the pope and the emperor reconciled and Vigilius returned to the Placidia.|$|E
25|$|The ardu was a slave, his master's chattel, {{and formed}} a very {{numerous}} class. He could acquire property and even own other slaves. His master clothed and fed him and paid his doctor's fees, but took all compensation paid for injury <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> His master usually found him a slave girl for a wife (the children were then born slaves), often set him up in a house (with farm or business) and simply took an annual rent of him. Otherwise, he might marry a free woman (the children were then free), who might bring him a dower that his master could not touch, and at his death, one-half of his property passed to his master as his heir. He could acquire his freedom by purchase from his master, or might be freed and dedicated to a temple, or even adopted, when he became an amelu and not a mushkenu. Slaves were recruited by purchase abroad, from captives taken in war, or by freemen degraded for debt or crime. A slave often ran away; if caught, the captor was bound to restore him to his master, and the Code fixes a reward of two shekels that the owner must pay the captor. It was about one-tenth of the average value of a slave. To detain or harbour a slave was punishable by death. So was aiding him to escape the city gates. A slave bore an identification mark, removable only by a surgical operation, that later consisted of his owner's name tattooed or branded on the arm. On the other hand, on the great estates in Assyria and its subject provinces there were many serfs, mostly of subject race, settled captives, or quondam slaves; tied to the soil they cultivated and sold with the estate, yet capable of possessing land and property of their own. There is little trace of serfs in Babylonia, unless the mushkenu is really a serf.|$|E

Furthermore, Walter detects electromagnetic energy in the area. Meanwhile, Meegar inadvertently causes a packaging machine to malfunction, severely injuring his boss right after Meegar is fired.

500|$|In modern times, Dorothy Dunnett's novel King Hereafter aims {{to portray}} a {{historical}} Macbeth, but proposes that Macbeth and his rival and sometime ally Thorfinn of Orkney {{are one and}} the same (Thorfinn is his birth name and Macbeth his baptismal name). John Cargill Thompson's play Macbeth Speaks 1997, a reworking of his earlier Macbeth Speaks, is a monologue delivered by the historical Macbeth, aware of what Shakespeare and posterity have <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Scottish author Nigel Tranter based one of his historical novels, MacBeth the King, on the historical figure. David Greig's 2010 play Dunsinane takes Macbeth's downfall at Dunsinane as its starting point, with his just-ended reign portrayed as long and stable in contrast to Malcolm's.
