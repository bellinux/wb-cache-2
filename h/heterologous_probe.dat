In sequential tissue samples from a 58 year old woman with recurrent chronic active gastritis the C pylori probe hybridised with bacteria whenever they were histologically visible. When no bacteria were visible histologically, hybridisation was negative with one exception. In a single biopsy specimen without visible C pylori, hybridisation occurred with the surface of the antrum epithelium, while control hybridisation with a <b>heterologous</b> <b>probe</b> remained negative. From a parallel biopsy specimen taken {{at the same time the}} C pylori culture was positive. It is concluded that DISH, although more laborious than routine staining techniques, may be more sensitive in that it detects bacteria very easily, even when sections are not counterstained or when they are present in low numbers, and that bacteria which do hybridise are unequivocally identified as C pylori and not Campylobacter-like organism...|$|E

We sequenced two restriction enzyme fragments of this gene, and the deduced amino acid sequences show strong homology with the regions of muscle myosins that contain the reactive thiols and the ATP binding site. Our identification of a myosin IB heavy chain gene demonstrates that myosin IB, despite the unusually low molecular weight of its heavy chain, is a true gene product.

Overexpression of the previously isolated KS cDNA from pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) (CmKS) in the ga 2 mutant was able to complement the mutant phenotype. A genomic clone coding for KS, AtKS, was isolated from A. thaliana using CmKS cDNA as a <b>heterologous</b> <b>probe.</b> The corresponding A. thaliana cDNA was isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein.

The cosmid pDUB 1911, from a representative genomic library of C 58 C 1, was identified and found to contain a cluster of chemotaxis-related genes. A 9. 6 kb region of pDUB 1911 was completely sequenced (GenBank Accession No. AF 044495), in both directions, and found to contain an 8 kb chemotaxis cluster. The cluster begins with orf 1, followed by orf 2, cheYl, cheA, cheR, cheB, cheY 2, orf 9 and orflO. All of the identified homologues showed {{a high degree of}} sequence conservation with their counterparts in the chemosensory regions of the related bacteria S. meliloti and R. sphaeroides, and were arranged in a similar order. A homologue of the flagellar gene fliF was identified directly downstream of the che cluster. This arrangement is similar to that seen in S. meliloti, where the che operon is followed by a large region containing flagellar/motility-related genes. It was therefore postulated that the region identified in this work could be linked to the cluster of flagellar/motihty-related genes previously identified in A. tumefaciens. Mutant strains were created by in-frame deletion of cheA and orflO, and insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette in orfl, cheA and fliF. The oifl and cheA mutants showed wild type motility, but impaired chemotactic capabilities. Deletion of orflO appeared to have no effect on either motility or chemotaxis, under the conditions studied. Mutation of fliF resulted in a non-motile, non-flagellate phenotype. A "gutted" strain was created by deletion of the entire che cluster. As with the orfl and cheA mutant strains, the gutted strain showed severely impaired chemotaxis, but wild type patterns of motility. Preliminary work was conducted on the construction of a selectively-infective phage (SIP) system for studying bimolecular interactions within, and between, the che and vir systems of A. tumefaciens. A phage vector was constructed, which following further testing, should allow such work to begin. Probing with a fragment coding for the conserved region of an MCP recently identified m R. leguminosarum, suggested that A. tumefaciens could contain a number of proteins resembling the classical MCPs of E. coli. A putative MCP homologue was also identified in pDUB 1911, downstream of the main che cluster.

Northern analysis of RNA extracted from fruit samples of different ripening stages {{as well as from}} roots, leaves and flower petals was used to examine the expression pattern of the corresponding mRNA. The transcript corresponding to MEL 5 is present at low quantities in unripe (green) fruit, reaches its highest levels when the fruit turns from green to orange and persists at lower levels during later ripening stages.

Deletion of a 30 -kb DNA fragment from this cluster in the chromosome resulted in loss of validamycin production, confirming a direct involvement of the gene cluster in the biosynthesis of this important plant protectant.

Sequence analysis shows that ccSod 1 and ccSod 2 are different genes. The inferred amino sequences show that all essential residues of the active site are strictly conserved, which suggests both genes encode functional Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD). Phylogenetic analysis by the maximum parsimony method with bootstrap resampling of previously known Cu/Zn SOD reveals two monophyletic groups, vertebrates and insects. The position of ccSOD 2 in this phylogeny is undefined with respect to dipteran ccSOD 1, vertebrate, plant, fungal, and extracellular Cu/Zn SOD, {{which suggests that the}} duplication detected in Ceratitis is ancient, perhaps as old as the origins of the arthropod phylum in the Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes places the genes on different chromosomes, which is consistent with an ancient gene duplication...|$|E

Comparison and {{integration}} of genetic maps generated from F 2 and BC 1 -type mapping populations in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). ? Plant Breeding, 121, (6), 501 - 507. Sponsorship: BBSRC RASP Initiative; EC FAIR CT 98 - 4063 Linkage maps of perennial ryegrass were constructed from F 2 and BC 1 -type populations using, predominantly, {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} data based on <b>heterologous</b> <b>probes</b> used in mapping other grass species. The maps identified seven linkage groups, which covered a total of 515 cM (F 2) and 565 cM (BC 1). They were aligned using 38 loci identified in both populations (common loci) and a possible marker order for all mapped loci in either population was identified in an integrated map. The estimated recombination frequencies and map distances between adjacent common loci were compared between the two data sets and regions of heterogeneity identified. Overall, the common markers identified a map distance of 446 cM in the F 2 population and 327 cM in the BC 1 population, reflecting a higher recombination frequency in the former, although the difference was not evenly spread over the seven linkage groups.

40|$|Gene clones {{encoding}} phycocyanin and allophycocyanin {{were isolated}} from an Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 -Charon 30 library {{by using the}} phycocyanin (cpc) genes of Agmenellum quadruplicatum and the allophycocyanin (apc) genes of Cyanophora paradoxa as <b>heterologous</b> <b>probes.</b> The A. variabilis cpcA and cpcB genes occur together in the genome, as do the apcA and apcB genes; {{the two sets of}} genes are not closely linked, however. The cpc and apc genes appear to be present in only one copy per genome. DNA-RNA hybridization analysis showed that expression of the cpc and apc genes is greatly decreased during nitrogen starvation; within 1 h no cpc or apc mRNA could be detected. The source of nitrogen for growth did not influence expression of the genes; vegetative cells from nitrogen-fixing and ammonia-grown cultures had approximately the same levels of cpc and apc mRNAs. Heterocysts had less than 5 % as much cpc mRNA as vegetative cells from nitrogen-fixing cultures. Northern hybridization (RNA blot) analysis showed that the cpc genes are transcribed to give an abundant 1. 4 -kilobase (kb) RNA as well as two less prominent 3. 8 - and 2. 6 -kb species. The apc genes gave rise to two transcripts, a 1. 4 -kb predominant RNA and a minor 1. 75 -kb form...|$|R
