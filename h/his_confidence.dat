5|$|Heydrich was, for {{all intents}} and purposes, {{military}} dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His changes to the government's structure left President Emil Hacha and his cabinet virtually powerless. He often drove alone in a car with an open roof—a show of <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> in the occupation forces and in his government's effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Introduced to hockey {{by family}} friends, Bégin began playing at age six {{and was an}} offensively minded player in his minor hockey years. He wore {{second-hand}} equipment as his father struggled to pay the costs of hockey, but from a young age expressed <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> he would {{make it to the}} National Hockey League (NHL).|$|E
5|$|After joining up {{with the}} team for batting {{practice}} in June 1923, Gehrig was sent by Yankees manager Miller Huggins to the Hartford Senators. After a good start, Gehrig went through a long slump and suffered depression which led him to consider quitting baseball. Upon hearing this, Krichell was sent to Hartford {{to speak with the}} star player. He discovered that Gehrig was drinking, boosted <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> and gave him batting advice, including one of Ty Cobb's batting tricks. Gehrig started hitting again, and eventually joined the Yankees.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} the fire, murmuring <b>his</b> <b>confidences</b> to the {{smouldering}} ashes. Then he seemed to repeat his talk with Checco.|$|R
6000|$|The {{conjecture}} recalled Fulkerson to {{the object}} of <b>his</b> <b>confidences.</b> [...] "Ah, there's where your help comes in. I've exhausted all the influence I have with Dryfoos--" ...|$|R
60|$|Key felt relieved. From {{what he knew}} of Collinson's vagaries he {{believed}} him. He was wise in not admitting him to <b>his</b> <b>confidences</b> at the beginning; he might have thought it his duty to tell others.|$|R
5|$|As he grew older, Sadler {{generally}} {{remained in}} good health, {{with the exception}} of a condition that led to the removal of an eye. He died on April 26, 1969, at 93 years of age. Christensen recalls that Sadler was visited by friends and family while on his deathbed; he spoke to them of <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> in a joyful life after death. He received a full-column obituary in the Chicago Tribune, which discussed his success as a doctor but not his association with The Urantia Book.|$|E
5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|He {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1972–73 season, <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> and form suffered as defenders marked him more closely and poor diet saw his weight rise to over 14 stone. Captain Frank McLintock remarked to the management that Kennedy was only operating at 60% capacity, and Kennedy was fined £200 before he began to shed weight and rediscover his form. Arsenal finished the season in second place, and he scored just nine league goals throughout the campaign. Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Sunderland.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he says, without interest, with {{something}} of the tone of an abstracted elder speaking to a child, [...] "I dare {{say it will be}} all very fine here." [...] And he lapses, thwarted from <b>his</b> <b>confidences,</b> into musing.|$|R
6000|$|Isaline blushed and laughed. [...] "I do not cry for M. Claude," [...] she said. [...] "I {{may have}} other matters {{of my own}} to cry about. But M. Claude is very free with <b>his</b> <b>confidences,</b> if he tells such things to a stranger." ...|$|R
60|$|He hesitated, {{suddenly}} {{losing some}} part of <b>his</b> immense <b>confidence.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Kaurava's {{learn about}} Kichaka's death {{due to a}} woman married to five Gandharvas in mysterious circumstances. They doubt that the Pandavas are hidden in Matsya and launch {{an attack on the}} kingdom's cattle. With all the {{soldiers}} engaged in war with Kauravas' allies, Virata's palace is almost empty. When Kauravas attack the remaining cattle, Uttara Kumara swears to fight against them. However, after watching their military troops, Uttara Kumara loses <b>his</b> <b>confidence.</b> Brihannala, who is his charioteer, volunteers to fight if Uttara Kumara handles the chariot, to which Uttara Kumara agrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{operations}} {{which followed}} may be summarized by the phrase everything went wrong; after an angry scene with his brother, Prince William {{retired from the}} army, and when Frederick gave Winterfeldt renewed marks of <b>his</b> <b>confidence,</b> the general animosity reached its height. As it chanced, however, Winterfeldt fell a victim to his own bravery in a skirmish at Moys near Görlitz on 7 September. His wound proved fatal and he died on 8 September.|$|E
5|$|There {{is not the}} {{slightest}} {{doubt in my mind}} that this brainy man was hoodwinked, and that <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> was betrayed by the so-called mediums that he tested. His powers of observation were blinded and his reasoning faculties so blunted by his prejudice in favor of anything psychic or occult that he could not, or would not, resist the influence.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{continued}} the duchess, slipping {{her arm around}} Helen's waist, [...] "Sir James has honored ME--as became my relations to YOU--with <b>his</b> <b>confidences.</b> As you haven't given me YOURS I suppose you have none, and that I am telling you news when I say that Sir James wishes to marry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Even to his ex-room-mate, Plain Smith, {{the grim}} and slovenly school-teacher {{who had called}} him [...] "bub" [...] and {{discouraged}} <b>his</b> <b>confidences,</b> Carl presented the attractions of Professor Frazer's lectures when he met him on the campus. Smith looked quizzical and [...] "guessed" [...] that plays and play-actin' were useless, if not actually immoral.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} casting round for some excuse by which I {{could get away}} from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen enough of the {{contrary}} nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be {{the surest way to}} stop <b>his</b> <b>confidences.</b>|$|R
5|$|Chaplin {{was nervous}} about the film's {{reception}} because silent films were becoming obsolete by then, and the preview had undermined <b>his</b> <b>confidence.</b> Nevertheless, City Lights became one of Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed works. Following the good reception by American audiences, with earnings of $2 million, a quarter of which came from its 12-week run at the Cohan, Chaplin went on a sixteen-date world tour between February and March 1932, starting with a premiere at London's Dominion Theatre on February 27. The film was enthusiastically received by Depression-era audiences, earning $5 million during its initial release.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Brulé {{worked with}} a sports {{psychologist}} to address the mental aspect of his game, including <b>his</b> <b>confidence.</b> Near {{the end of the}} Oilers' training camp, on October 2, 2011, he was placed on waivers for the purpose of being assigned to the team's AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons. While the departure of Andrew Cogliano in July 2011 made room for Brulé to move up the Oilers' depth chart at centre, the performance of Oilers rookies Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Anton Lander helped make him expendable. Regarding the move, Oilers General Manager Steve Tambellini described Brulé as having lacked consistency. Brulé cleared waivers two days later; an Edmonton Sun article suggested that he would have likely been picked up by another team if not for his $1.85 million salary.|$|E
5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn {{thought he looked}} more like a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything to escape from the mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
60|$|Richard, for all <b>his</b> sublime <b>confidence,</b> was {{a little}} {{staggered}} by the other's earnestness.|$|R
6000|$|She {{scarcely}} understood him; {{it seemed}} a question whether he were joking or not. Why should a man who struck her as having a great fund of reserve suddenly bring himself to be so confidential? This was his affair, however, and <b>his</b> <b>confidences</b> were interesting. [...] "I don't see why you should have renounced," [...] {{she said in a}} moment.|$|R
60|$|But in {{the delight}} of talking about himself, Berry was {{apparently}} unaware that Lemuel had not reciprocated <b>his</b> <b>confidences.</b> He celebrated <b>his</b> familiarity with Miss Swan and her friend, though no doubt he had the greater share of the acquaintance,--that was apt {{to be the case}} with him,--and from time to time he urged Lemuel to come up and call on them with him.|$|R
5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Overmars' first call-up to the Netherlands senior {{national}} squad came in February 1993 for a 1994 World Cup qualifier against Turkey. He scored {{five minutes}} into his debut, after good play from Wim Jonk. The team {{went on to}} win 3–1 and Overmars said the goal was good for <b>his</b> <b>confidence.</b> Dick Advocaat, the manager of the Netherlands, was complimentary of the debutant's performance. In April 1993, Overmars earnt the national team a penalty against England after Des Walker fouled him. Peter van Vossen converted the spot kick to complete a comeback for the Netherlands, who had been 2–0 down after 24 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{choice of}} a four-man team for the {{southern}} journey to the South Pole was largely determined {{by the number of}} surviving ponies. Influenced by his experiences on the Discovery Expedition, he had put <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> in ponies rather than dogs for the long polar march. The motor car, which ran well on flat ice, could not cope with Barrier surfaces and was not considered for the polar journey. The men chosen by Shackleton to accompany him were Marshall, Adams and Wild. Joyce, whose Antarctic experience exceeded all save Wild's, was excluded from the party after Marshall's medical examination raised doubts about his fitness.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{felt that}} victory would give <b>his</b> team <b>confidence</b> {{for the coming}} season.|$|R
60|$|He {{stepped forward}} {{with all of}} <b>his</b> old <b>confidence,</b> and did not regard a farthing my cold stare.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> serene <b>confidence</b> made me smile. 'But how do {{you know}} you can do all this?' I asked.|$|R
5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into the core of <b>his</b> <b>confidence,</b> and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of {{people who work for}} him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Häkkinen {{said that he was}} happy with his race victory which he believed would help <b>his</b> <b>confidence</b> throughout the remainder of the season. Häkkinen added that his team displayed pit boards which instructed him not to over rev his engine during the race's first half. Coulthard said that he was satisfied with the outcome of the first lap as it allowed him to drive a conservative race. He added that his strong finish would not mean that he would think about his potential to clinch the Drivers' Championship. Barrichello explained that his car was loose from contact with Trulli during the race's early stages which prevented him from challenging de la Rosa.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{lost the}} 1976 Republican nomination, Ronald Reagan ran again for the {{presidency}} in 1980, and succeeded in winning the nomination and election. During this second campaign, Nancy played a very prominent role, and her management of staff became more apparent. She arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers John Sears and Michael Deaver, and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control. After the Reagan camp lost the Iowa Caucus and fell behind in New Hampshire polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and {{decided it was time}} to fire Sears and his associates; she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal. Her influence on her husband became particularly notable; her presence at rallies, luncheons, and receptions increased <b>his</b> <b>confidence.</b>|$|E
60|$|Or {{apparently}} so. He had, in fact, {{lost some}} of <b>his</b> buoyant <b>confidence,</b> and doubt hindered his outgoing.|$|R
60|$|It {{is due to}} {{the doctor}} to relate that he had indeed {{justified}} <b>his</b> wife's <b>confidence</b> in him.|$|R
60|$|He handed Jude an {{advertisement}} list of several pages in booklet shape, ornamentally margined {{with a red}} line, in which were set forth the various clarets, champagnes, ports, sherries, and other wines with which he purposed to initiate his new venture. It took Jude more than by surprise that {{the man with the}} soul was thus and thus; and he felt that he could not open up <b>his</b> <b>confidences.</b>|$|R
