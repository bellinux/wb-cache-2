40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar o efeito dos períodos de diferimento e de pastejo sobre a densidade populacional de perfilhos, a massa dos componentes morfológicos da forragem e o índice de tombamento em pastagens de Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk. Dois ensaios foram conduzidos: o primeiro denominado ano 1 e, o segundo, ano 2. Adotou-se o esquema de parcelas subdivididas, segundo o delineamento em blocos casualizados, com duas repetições para cada combinação dos períodos de diferimento da pastagem com os períodos de pastejo. No ano 1, os períodos de diferimento foram 103, 121, 146 e 163 dias; e no ano 2, foram 73, 103, 131 e 163 dias. Os períodos de pastejo foram 1, 29, 57 e 85 dias. O aumento do período de diferimento elevou a densidade populacional de perfilhos reprodutivos (ano 2 : de 37 para 304 perfilhos/m²) e reduziu a de perfilhos vegetativos (ano 1 : de 1. 253 para 889 perfilhos/m²; ano 2 : de 1. 235 para 627 perfilhos/m²). Durante o período de pastejo, ocorreu diminuição no número de perfilhos vegetativo (ano 1 : de 988 para 868 perfilhos/m²) e reprodutivo (ano 1 : de 216 para 0 perfilhos/m²; ano 2 : de 203 para 0 perfilhos/m²) e aumento no número de perfilhos mortos (ano 1 : 463 para 1. 088 perfilhos/m²; ano 2 : de 341 para 1. 010 perfilhos/m²). Pastagens sob maiores períodos de diferimento e de pastejo apresentaram maior massa de colmo morto (6. 093 e 3. 819 kg/ha de MS nos anos 1 e 2, respectivamente) e menor massa de lâmina foliar verde (341 e 177 kg/ha de MS nos anos 1 e 2, respectivamente).

This worked {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>deferring</b> and grazing <b>periods</b> on the tiller population density, morphological component mass of forage and falling index on Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk pastures. Two assays were carried out: first year and second year. Subdivided plots were used according to a randomized block design with two replicates. The treatments were composed of combinations of <b>deferred</b> <b>periods</b> and grazing periods. In the first year, 103, 121, 146 and 163 -day <b>deferring</b> <b>periods</b> were used; and 73, 103, 131 and 163 -day <b>deferring</b> <b>periods</b> in the second year. The grazing periods were 1, 29, 57 and 85 days. The increase in the <b>deferring</b> <b>period</b> increased the population density of reproductive tillers (from 37 to 304 tillers/m² in the second year) and reduced the density of vegetative tillers (from 1, 253 to 889 tillers/m² {{in the first year}}; from 1, 235 to 627 tillers/m² in the second year).

The treatments encompassed four <b>deferred</b> grazing <b>periods</b> (18, 46, 74 and 121 days). A randomized block design with two replications was used.

A completely randomized block design was used in a split-plot scheme with three replications. The population density of vegetative basal and total tillers was influenced by the interaction between periods and initial heights of deferment, with lower values in the period of 85 days associated with the initial height of 40 cm and the period of 105 days associated with initial heights of 30 and 40 cm.

Shifts within amniotes tend to occur during periods of elevated extinction, with mass extinctions coinciding with numerous and larger shifts.

Mean discretionary accruals estimated from the Jones model (1991) were negative and significant in Q 4 1990, when the recession was at its most severe stage, and the lowest of the 19 quarters examined.

Mean discretionary accruals are mostly negative in quarters of very strong or very weak real GDP growth, and mostly positive in other quarters. Regression fitting a quadratic function to the relationship of mean discretionary accruals with real GDP growth confirms that the relationship has the shape of an inverted U. Given that the “true” corporate earnings (before manipulation) and real economic growth are likely to be highly correlated, the result is consistent with the hypothesis that managers <b>defer</b> income in <b>periods</b> of very weak earnings (when they have no chance of receiving bonuses linked to earnings) and periods of strong earnings (when the bonus cap has already been reached) to future periods and manipulate earnings upward in other periods.

In preparing for and developing the decommissioning strategy detailed studies have been undertaken on all relevant aspects. These have resulted in, for example, extensive information on the graphite radioactive inventories, {{the condition of the}} graphite throughout the quiescent deferral period, safety assessment, and, dismantling, waste management and disposal plans. Significant work has also been undertaken on the management of the graphite fuel element debris that has accumulated at the two stations. For example, work is well advanced at one of the stations to install equipment to retrieve this waste and package it in a form suitable for eventual deep geological disposal. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePatients {{with primary}} immune {{thrombocytopenia}} (ITP) may require treatment {{to reduce the}} risk of serious bleeding if platelets remain consistently below 30 [*]×[*] 10 /L. While approximately 70 – 80 % of patients respond to an initial course of corticosteroids, relapse is common. For steroid-refractory patients, there is a choice between surgical splenectomy and further medical treatments, based on many factors including the patient's bleeding history, fitness for surgery, comorbidities, tolerance of adverse events, lifestyle and preferences. Treatments that have traditionally been used (corticosteroids, azathioprine, danazol) suppress the immune system, potentially predisposing patients to infection. Recent insights into the underlying pathophysiology of the disease have allowed the development of targeted therapies, including the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists, which enhance platelet production. Phase III trials have found romiplostim and eltrombopag to be well tolerated and effective in elevating platelet counts and reducing bleeding in both splenectomised and nonsplenectomised patients with chronic ITP. The B-cell targeted monoclonal antibody rituximab has also shown some potential in this setting, although data are currently limited and there are toxicity concerns. The decision whether to proceed to splenectomy or try other medical therapies in corticosteroid-refractory patients remains patient-specific. Splenectomy has its risks (including perioperative and long-term risks), and relapse/nonresponse are relatively common, but it offers the possibility of cure in the majority of patients. However, newer treatments may potentially allow splenectomy to be <b>deferred</b> for prolonged <b>periods,</b> as well as providing alternative treatment options for patients who fail splenectomy...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 37). This report has been made on the deposit scheme of the Southeast Bank, especially on its Dhanmondi Branch. Deposit {{is the most important}} source of income of a banking institute. To get as much deposit as possible, different bank offer different deposit product to attract customers and get deposits from them. Southeast Bank on general offers nine kinds of deposit schemes. This scheme has their own special offer which <b>defer</b> with rates, <b>period</b> of time and terms and conditions. Among this different deposit schemes current account and savings account are most popular among their customers. As Dhanmondi Branch locates at residential area, they can have huge amount deposit for current account and savings accounts. All these schemes had been affected by political unrest situation in December. But this branch is much more structured compared to any other branches operating in Bangladesh. For that Bankers should try to develop healthy relationship with loyal customers so that these customers can bring more new customers. I have tried in my best to study the materials related with my topic. I observed the technique which performed by SEBL, used their officials’ data, published data, unpublished data and annual report and performed a field survey for preparing this report.

40|$|The British Post Office {{introduced}} {{two-tier pricing}} in the 1970 s. The basic {{idea was to}} differentiate First Class from Second Class mail according to service quality rather than content. Processing of Second Class Mail is <b>deferred</b> during peak <b>periods,</b> recognizing inter alia the added cost of meeting fixed service standards at such times. The introduction of two-tier pricing was a major breakthrough at the time, both from a practical {{as well as a}} theoretical point of view, and it has been employed successfully in varying forms by several other Post Offices (POs) since then. Crew, Kleindorfer and Smith (1990) (CKS) showed how two-tier pricing was related to the mainstream of the theory of peak-load pricing, which can be traced back at least to Boiteux (1949). CKS demonstrated that such servicedifferentiated pricing offered an efficient solution to the peak-load problem. In practice, the system of First Class and Second Class has continued basically unchanged from the original path-breaking idea of the 70 ’s, with some adjustments being made in the application, definition and measurement of service standards. In other areas of the postal sector, considerable change has taken place, not least in the continuation of the process of liberalization of postal markets worldwide and especially in the EU. In addition, POs are facing significant electronic competition, principally from the Internet, which was not envisaged a decade ago.
