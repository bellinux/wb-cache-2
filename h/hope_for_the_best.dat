We, however, are not a judge or a jury and don't want to be one any time soon. We are however a band that really just wants to continue playing music.

However, Dominic will no longer be playing music or working on behalf of Love Equals Death. This matter that he faces requires all of his attention right now and we wish him well as I know all of you do.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge. When the morning papers went to press, none carried news of casualties.|$|E

2500|$|The Royal Navy's best {{test pilot}}, Captain Eric Brown, chief naval test pilot and {{commanding}} officer of the Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight Royal Aircraft Establishment, who tested the Me 262 noted: [...] "This was a Blitzkrieg aircraft. You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> If you want to sight and fire, you need to double that time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, you could have done that." ...|$|E

In attendance were Emperor Selassie, the South African General Jan Smuts (who held an advisory brief for the region with Winston Churchill), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. A general plan of attack on Ethiopia, including the use of Ethiopian irregular forces, was agreed upon at the conference. In November 1940, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage when the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park broke the high grade cypher of the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).|$|E
2500|$|On 9 August 2009, {{speaking}} {{at the opening of}} his weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu promised not to repeat the [...] "mistake" [...] of the Gaza unilateral pullout, saying, [...] "We will not repeat this mistake. We will not create new evacuees", and adding that [...] "the unilateral evacuation brought neither peace nor security. On the contrary", and that [...] "We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and [...] a security settlement. In the case of Gaza, both of these factors were lacking". He also said, [...] "Should we achieve a turn toward peace with the more moderate partners, we will insist on the recognition of the State of Israel and the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state". In October 2014, Netanyahu said [...] "We don't just hand over territory, close our eyes and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> We did that in Lebanon and we got thousands of rockets. We did that in Gaza, we got Hamas and 15,000 rockets. So we're not gonna just replicate that. We want to see genuine recognition of the Jewish state and rock solid security arrangements on the ground. That's the position I've held, and it's only become firmer." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 March 1969, {{five years}} and twelve days after she left her husband, gravely ill, Meena Kumari {{reported}} for work again on Pakeezah. Kamal Amrohi organized a great reception. He gave his wife a peda (sweet) as a peace offering and made a documentary film on her arrival at the studio. Meena Kumari was determined to complete the film and, {{well aware of the}} limited time left for her to live, went {{out of her way to}} complete it at the earliest. Despite her rapidly deteriorating health, she gave the finishing touches to her performance. Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) shared an incident which occurred during the last days of the shooting of Pakeezah: [...] "On outdoor shooting Kamal Amrohi's unit travelled in two cars near a place called Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh, the cars all but ran out of petrol, and for miles around there was nothing except a long, deserted, straight road. It was discovered that a bus passed on this route every morning from which fuel could be purchased. Kamal Amrohi decided to spend the night in the desert; he ordered his unit to roll up the windows of the cars and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> A little after midnight the occupants of the vehicles were surrounded by a dozen armed men. The men knocked on the closed windows and forced their way in. When the armed gang leader learned that one of the people in the car was Meena Kumari, his attitude completely changed. He turned out to be a Meena Kumari fan, and welcomed his guests in true fan tradition. He organized music, dancing, and food. He provided a place to sleep. He instructed his juniors the next morning to fetch petrol for the unit. From Meena Kumari, he wanted a special favor. He sharpened his knife and took it to her. [...] "Please autograph my hand with this", he requested. Meena was not new to signing autographs but she had never attempted anything as ambitious as a knife. Nervously, she wrote her name on this man's hand. He said he was grateful for this favor. Once the unit left, they found at the next town that they had spent the night in the camp of Madhya Pradesh's renowned and dangerous dacoit - Amrit Lal." ...|$|E
