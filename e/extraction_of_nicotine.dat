40|$|Tobacco {{products}} {{are composed of}} {{a great variety of}} constituents. Nicotine, 1 -methyl- 2 (3 -pyridyl) pyrrolidine, is a highly toxic major alkaloid found in tobacco plants and plays an important etiological {{role in the development of}} human carcinogenesis. Nicotine is also accused of the addictive potential of smoking, being classified by the Drug Abuse Advisory Committee as an addictive substance. Carbon dioxide has been extensively used for the removal of nicotine from tobacco leaves in the production of new cigarettes with reduced nicotine content. Although detailed knowledge of phase behaviour is most important for the design of any separation process, solubility of nicotine in sub/supercritical CO 2 seems to have been scarcely studied. Reported measurements are restricted to the temperatures of 313 and 343 K, and covering a range of pressures of 0. 9 – 8 MPa and 0. 9 – 16 MPa, respectively. In this work we present a phase behaviour study of the CO 2 -nicotine binary system at 313. 1 K, in a pressure range of 6 to 9 MPa. The phase equilibrium measurements were performed using an apparatus that employs a high-pressure sapphire cell and allows sampling of both vapour and liquid phases. From the experimental work, it could be concluded that, according to the Scott and Van Konynenburg classification of fluid phase equilibria, the system nicotine + CO 2 most likely shows type-V fluid phase behaviour. The characteristic of this type of phase behaviour is a three-phase (VLL) equilibrium, with a discontinuous critical curve. As expected, the mutual miscibility increases with increasing pressure and the mixture will be homogeneous above the upper critical pressures. These data may help in further studies on sub/supercritical CO 2 <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> from nicotine-containing products...|$|E

The risks of using tobacco are significantly heightened when the tobacco is illicit due {{to the use of}} poor grade unregulated tobacco and sub-standard delivery systems. This research that was conducted in collaboration with Lancashire Trading Standards and allows for the profiling of a diverse range of different tobaccos using 88 samples collected from Lancashire Trading Standards, various licit retailers in Preston, France and Sweden. The aims of this research include; the elemental profiling of tobacco using X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy as a rapid handheld qualitative technique, the quantification and comparison <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> levels within licit, illicit and niche tobacco using Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry, including a single strand extraction study to determine the possibility of the natural spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> along the tobacco leaf and finally, the molecular profiling of tobacco using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy aided by multivariate data analysis. Through analysis of spectra collected using X-ray Fluorescence, we were able to determine elemental differences between dried leaf and treated tobacco using fluctuations in elements such as Potassium, Calcium and Iron.

40|$|Nicotine is a {{parasympathomimetic}} alkaloid {{found in}} the nightshade family of plants (Solanaceae) and is a cholinergic drug. It acts directly by stimulating the nicotinic or muscarinic receptors or indirectly by inhibiting cholinesterase, promoting acetylcholine release, or by other mechanisms. 3 % of tobacco or one cigarette yields 1  mg of nicotine. As nicotine enters the body, it disturbs the healthy functioning of the body. In this study, we isolated UMNSAH/DF- 1 cell line from Gallus gallus. For this, 9 ± 2  day old chicken embryo was taken.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{in the brain}} for acute toxicity <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> were investigated in rats. Age-related changes in acute toxicity <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> were also studied. An acute intraperitoneal (i. p.) or intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) injection <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> intensified convulsions and death dose-dependently. But those convulsive responses induced by nicotine (i. c. v.) were more rapid and shorter than those induced by nicotine (i. p.). Acute toxic effects <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> were dose-dependently antagonized by mecamylamine (i. p. or i. c. v.), but not by hexamethonium (i. p.). Nicotine (10 or 24. 5 mg/kg, i. p.) significantly increased dopamine, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in striatum. Furthermore, electrical lesion of striatum suppressed acute toxicities <b>of</b> <b>nicotine.</b> Pretreatment <b>of</b> SCH- 23390, but not of haloperidol or sulpiride, blocked nicotine-induced convulsions and death. Pretreatment of phenobarbioal, diazepam or MK- 801 also prevented acute toxicity <b>of</b> <b>nicotine.</b> Nicotine levels in the blood and cortex after an acute i. p. injection <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> (24. 5 mg/kg) were significantly higher in old rats than in young rats. Hepatic metabolisms <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> decreased age-relatedly. Also, nicotine (24. 5 mg/kg, i. p.) -induced lethality tended to increase in old rats.

40|$|A long-standing {{relationship}} between nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and cognition exists. Drugs that act at nAChRs can have cognitive-enhancing effects and diseases that disrupt cognition such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia {{are associated with}} altered nAChR function. Specifically, hippocampus-dependent learning is particularly sensitive to the effects <b>of</b> <b>nicotine.</b> However, the effects <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> on hippocampus-dependent learning vary {{not only with the}} doses <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> used and whether nicotine is administered acutely, chronically, or withdrawn after chronic nicotine treatment but also vary across different hippocampus-dependent tasks such as the Morris water maze, the radial arm maze, and contextual fear conditioning.

40|$|The {{behavioral}} effects <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> vary widely, yet {{investigation of}} the aversive effects <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> has been limited. A careful examination of how the aversive effects <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> results in punishment of behavior {{may contribute to the}} understanding of the control <b>of</b> behavior by <b>nicotine.</b> The overall goal of these studies was to develop punishment procedures to evaluate the aversive effects <b>of</b> intravenous <b>nicotine</b> in rats. Using punishment procedures, rats were trained to respond on a lever that delivered sucrose pellets, then the effects of response-independent and -dependent nicotine injections on sucrose-reinforced lever responding were examined. Manipulation of behavioral and pharmacological parameters included the dose <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> delivered per injection (0. 01 - 0. 18 mg/kg), the behavioral alternatives to punished responding (reinforced or non-reinforced), and the delay <b>of</b> scheduled <b>nicotine</b> delivery. Antagonist studies were also conducted to elucidate the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(s) in mediating the punishing effects <b>of</b> <b>nicotine.</b> In general, sucrose was a reinforcer of lever responding, whereas nicotine dose-dependently decreased sucrose-reinforced lever responding, such that higher doses <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> were required to decrease lever responding when it was administered response-independently compared to its response-dependent delivery. Punishment by nicotine was attenuated if scheduled delivery <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> was delayed after a response, or if the behavioral alternative to punished responding did not deliver a positive reinforcer.

The nicotine nasal spray does achieve rapid delivery <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> but lacks the inhalational cues of cigarettes and has demonstrated limited acceptability due to the local irritant effects <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> on the nasal mucosa. The nicotine vapour Inhaler, although simulating the behavioural aspects of smoking and presenting some sensory cues, delivers nicotine very much slower than a cigarette.|$|R
40|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} the {{foremost}} modifiable {{risk factor for}} adverse pregnancy outcomes. Nicotine is a suspected fetal neuroteratogen. There is concern that nicotine may achieve toxic levels during pregnancy if nicotine replacement therapies are prescribed at doses used in the nonpregnant state. Ten healthy, volunteer, pregnant smokers received infusions <b>of</b> deu-terium-labeled <b>nicotine</b> and cotinine during pregnancy and again postpartum. From blood and urine measurements, the following were determined: clearance (renal and nonrenal) <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> and cotinine, clearance <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> via the cotinine pathway (an indicator of CYP 2 A 6 activity), and daily intake <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> from smoking. The clearance <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> and cotinine was significantly higher (60 and 140 %, respectively), and the half-life of cotinine was much shorter (8. 8 versus 16. 6 h,...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} isradipine, a {{dihydropyridine}} calcium antagonist, on intravenous self-administration <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> in naive mice has been investigated. When nicotine injections were made contingent upon nose-poke response by naive mice, they increased their rate of nose poking {{with respect to}} animals receiving contingent saline injections or yoked control animals receiving noncontingent <b>nicotine</b> injections. Pretreatment <b>of</b> mice with mecamylamine (2. 4 mg/kg) inhibited self-administration <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> contingent upon a nose-poke response. The same effect was observed with isradipine (0. 5 - 1. 0 mg/kg) in a dose-related manner and stereospecifically. These data suggest that isradipine suppresses the reinforcing properties <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> and might be useful for treatment <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> abuse...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{concentrations}} <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> on the in vitro development of 1 -cell rabbit preimplantation embryos {{and on the}} DNA-synthesis of 4 -day-old rabbit blastocysts are investigated. Exposure of rabbit preimplantation embryos to concentrations <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> higher than 1 X 10 (- 3) M results in a marked decrease in the in vitro development and in DNA-synthesis. Concentrations <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> below 1 X 10 (- 3) M {{have no effect on}} these early embryos. It can be concluded that the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> which exert a direct embryotoxic effect are higher than the concentrations that may be expected in the blood circulation of humans considered to be "normal smokers"...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>nicotine</b> content <b>of</b> snus varies among brands, {{with the}} most common {{strength}} being 8 mg <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> per gram <b>of</b> tobacco. In recent years, snus manufacturers have released stark (strong or sterk) and extra stark (extra strong or extra sterk) varieties with greater nicotine content. Stark varieties contain, on average, 11 mg <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> per gram <b>of</b> tobacco, while extra stark varieties may contain up to 22 mg <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> per gram <b>of</b> tobacco. Recently, the Siberia brand released its [...] "Extremely Strong" [...] snus which boasts 42 mg <b>of</b> <b>nicotine</b> per gram <b>of</b> tobacco and is currently the highest nicotine-per-gram snus available.|$|R
