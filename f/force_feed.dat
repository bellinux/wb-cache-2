5|$|In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, {{receiving}} vital colostrum milk. Lambs {{that either}} fail to nurse or are prevented {{from doing so}} by the ewe require aid in order to live. If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work, one of several steps may then be taken. Ewes may be held or tied {{to force them to}} accept a nursing lamb. If a lamb is not eating, a stomach tube may also be used to <b>force</b> <b>feed</b> the lamb in order to save its life. In the case of a permanently rejected lamb, a shepherd may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb onto another ewe. Lambs are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother, either from the birth or other event.|$|E

[...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , I listened to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't.

She had trouble sleeping and was being given natural supplements and the drug chloral hydrate to help her sleep. A Church staffer noted that McPherson [...] "looked ill like measles or chicken pox on her face." [...] On repeated occasions she refused food and protein shakes that the staff offered. On November 26 and 30 and December 3 to 4, the staff attempted to <b>force</b> <b>feed</b> her, noting that she spat the food out. She was noted to be very weak, not standing up nor on some days moving at all. Scientologists who questioned this handling were told to [...] "butt out".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the force}} feeding process, the EU {{committee}} examined several experiments {{carried out by}} INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique) to detect pain or distress by looking at blood hormones, and found that no definite conclusions {{can be drawn from}} these studies. Other studies looked at behavioral aversion to the feeding process and found that force fed ducks avoided the feeding pen when given a choice, whereas a majority of the control group not being force fed would enter the feeding pen voluntarily. Daily hand-feeding of ducks and geese is normally associated with a positive response by the animals towards the person feeding them. In contrast, the working group observed that ducks and geese in a pen kept away from their force feeder when he entered the room. In an unpublished pilot experiment by INRA, ducks in cages reportedly displayed less avoidance behaviour to the force feeder’s visit than to the visit of a neutral person coming along the cages later. However, in the working group's own observations, [...] "Ducks in cages had little opportunity to show avoidance but sometimes moved their heads away from the person who was about to <b>force</b> <b>feed</b> them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{ignored the}} protests for six months, but on June20,1917, as a Russian {{delegation}} {{drove up to}} the White House, suffragists unfurled a banner which stated: [...] "We women of America tell you that America is not a democracy. Twentymillion women are denied the right to vote. President Wilson is the chief opponent of their national enfranchisement". Another banner on August14,1917, referred to [...] "Kaiser Wilson" [...] and compared the plight of the German people with that of American women. With this manner of protest, the women were subject to arrests and many were jailed. Another ongoing tactic of the National Woman's Party was watchfires, which involved burning copies of President Wilson's speeches, often outside the White House or in the nearby Lafayette Park. The Party continued to hold watchfires even as the war began, drawing criticism from the public and even other suffrage groups for being unpatriotic. On October17, Alice Paul was sentenced to seven months and on October30 began a hunger strike, but after a few days prison authorities began to <b>force</b> <b>feed</b> her. After years of opposition, Wilson changed his position in 1918 to advocate women's suffrage as a war measure.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the wood natural resistance of Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. of phenotypes (plants) with and without prickles to subterranean termite (Nasutitermes corniger Motsch.) in <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> and feeding preference assays, under laboratory conditions. Wood test samples measuring 2. 54 x 1. 50 x 0. 64 cm (<b>forced</b> <b>feeding)</b> and 10. 00 x 1. 50 x 0. 64 cm (feeding preference), with the largest measurement in the fiber direction, were obtained from three positions from pith to bark direction. The samples were exposed for 28 days (<b>forced</b> <b>feeding)</b> and 45 days (feeding preference) to Nasutitermes corniger Motsch. termites. In <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> assay the termites caused superficial attack in wood and lived during 8 to 10 days, thus the wood was classified as resistant. In <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> assay more mass loss and attack in wood of external positions to both phenotypes was observed. To the waste and survival time of termites were similar to both types. In feeding preference a larger mass loss and waste to inner position in both phenotypes was observed. In general, the plants with prickles lost more mass than the one without prickles. Therefore, the wood of plants without prickles is more suitable to be use in construction of fences, sheepfolds and other similar uses where the wood shall be subject to attack by termites...|$|R
50|$|AGD's Warp Feed is a <b>force</b> <b>feed</b> {{system used}} to feed paintballs into a marker. It is fed by a hopper {{set on the}} top of the actual warp feed system. The main purpose is to give a player a lower profile, while {{maintaining}} extremely high feed rates. This was the first commercially produced under-the-barrel <b>force</b> <b>feed</b> system on the market. The warp feed isn't really a loader but rather a ball accelerator. Paintballs are fed from a loader, and when the Warp Feed senses the vibration from the marker firing, the Warp Feed begins turning disks inside, and accelerates the paintballs into the elbow of the paintball marker.|$|E
