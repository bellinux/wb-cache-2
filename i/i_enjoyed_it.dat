500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Ian McShane {{was asked about the}} process of shooting his final scene where he is shown hanging after being killed by the Brotherhood, with McShane saying that the filming of the scene was [...] "very easy. You just have to hold your breath for 10 seconds and look sufficiently dead for them to get it." [...] He also noted in the interview, [...] "Rory was a delight to work with, and so was the director. The whole experience was five days in Belfast, and <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> a lot." [...] Prior to the season, in August 2015, reports emerged about the spotting of Rory McCann at a hotel frequented by actors during filming of the series, in Belfast. McCann, whose character is frequently shown chopping wood in the episode, previously spoke in interviews about his prior career with chopping down trees, revealing [...] "I was a lumberjack for years, [...] and I even trained myself to be a tree surgeon." ...|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club was {{generally}} {{favorable to the}} episode, giving it a B+. He wrote, [...] "Much like Fringe fan favorite 'The Arrival' (not a favorite of mine, sorry to say), 'The Dreamscape' is an episode more involved with insinuation and mythology-building than with telling a complete-in-one story. But perhaps because I've come to trust Fringe more over its recent run of entertaining episodes, <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> fairly well, and found myself {{trying to figure out}} what kind of thematic connections I could make using the notion of the body reacting to mere thoughts." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.8/10, explaining that it [...] "certainly moves in the right direction". Fickett found the [...] "coolest moment" [...] to be when Olivia witnesses John Scott's memory, and he also appreciated Peter's backstory ("It's more than Peter usually gets, but what we know isn't much and isn't very exciting."). Fickett criticized Olivia however for leaving the man at the hospital unsuitably protected.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a perfect four-star rating, calling it [...] "the most cheerfully exciting, bizarre, goofy, romantic {{adventure}} movie since Raiders, {{and it is}} high praise to say that it's {{not so much a}} sequel as an equal. It's quite an experience." [...] Vincent Canby felt the film was [...] "too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. They just went on and on and on, which is what Temple of Doom does with humor and technical invention." [...] Neal Gabler commented that [...] "I think in some ways, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. In some ways it was less. In sum total, I'd have to say <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> more. That doesn't mean it's better necessarily, but I got more enjoyment out of it." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun." [...] Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, claimed it was [...] "one of the most sheerly pleasurable physical comedies ever made." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as a [...] "slow-starting adventure romp with much ingenuity and too much brutality and horror." ...|$|E

500|$|Success {{finally came}} in the 2001–02 season. Arsenal regained the league, beating Manchester United at Old Trafford in the {{penultimate}} {{game of the season}} to complete the club's second double under Wenger; Arsenal defeated Chelsea 2–0 to win the FA Cup four days prior. Bergkamp played in 33 league matches, setting up 15 goals, one of which was against Juventus in the second group stage of the Champions League. Holding off two markers, he twisted and turned before feeding the ball to Freddie Ljungberg in the penalty box to score. Bergkamp headed in the winner against Liverpool in a FA Cup fourth-round tie on 27 January 2002, but was shown a red card for a two-footed lunge on defender Jamie Carragher, who himself was sent off for throwing a coin into the crowd. He was subsequently banned for three matches (two league, one FA Cup round). Bergkamp appealed for his ban, but was unsuccessful. He made his return against Newcastle United on 3 March 2002. Early in the match, Arsenal midfielder Robert Pirès played a low pass from the left flank to Bergkamp in the edge of the opponent area with his back to goal. Under pressure from his marker Nikos Dabizas, Bergkamp controlled the ball with one flick and went around the other side before placing the ball precisely into the bottom right-hand corner to score. Wenger described the goal as [...] "unbelievable", adding [...] "It was not only a magnificent goal but a very important one – <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> a lot". Bergkamp featured in nine out of the last ten league games, forming a productive partnership with Ljungberg.|$|E

Mr. Tobin rationalized his stepping out of the running as an opportunity for the Liberal Party to heal, revitalize and rejuvenate itself. In his words: [...] "... I think it's time for new blood and I think it's time for new players and I think this is an opportunity for the Liberal party to renew itself and, in the process, to heal itself a little bit as well." [...] and that: [...] "I think that I've had my opportunity and I made my contribution. <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> enormously." ...|$|E
2500|$|World War II {{determined}} Paul Wild's specialisation and intruded to foreshorten {{his entire}} university life to only five terms. In 1942, Wild {{went to the}} University of Cambridge (Peterhouse) to further his mathematics.

Thus he went straight into [...] "physics with radio": Part 2 Physics. He saidthe great majority of people in Part 2 Physics had already done two years of it before, so it was a real challenge.

2500|$|During August 2010, Blasko {{recorded}} an album, Seeker Lover Keeper, in New York for {{the group}} {{of the same name}} with fellow founding members and Australian singer-songwriters, Sally Seltmann and Holly Throsby. The group's debut album peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Albums Charts in June 2011, Blasko's highest chart entry. The trio embarked on a national tour to promote the album in June and July that year. Of the album's 12 tracks each of the artists had an equal share of four tracks, however Blasko takes lead vocal on five tracks including [...] "Rely on Me" [...] written by Throsby, Blasko described [...] "I was reluctant to do it but the girls kept asking me. I couldn't hear myself singing that one until Holly made me do it. <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> because the song has real generosity to it". Greenberg felt Blasko's lead vocals were on the [...] "most memorable tracks, using her signature form of lilting power".

2500|$|A {{month in}} advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the {{captaincy}} after the tournament. Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run-scorer behind team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India's Sachin Tendulkar. Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that [...] "captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly... It's rarely a job you will last long in... I also had a two-year stint, and <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it</b> at times, certainly on the field where our results showed we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Villumsen {{rode the}} New Zealand National Time Trial Championships in January before backing off until June. She rode the Giro Rosa and won La Route de France {{and the time}} trial at the Tour Cycliste Féminin International de l'Ardèche before heading to World Championships. [...] "It was a {{different}} year for me but a good year." [...] She said in an interview. [...] "I started late and with a different approach. I trained more at home and then did race after race. <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>it.</b> I was still there on the podium so I can thank my team for helping me this far." [...] Villumsen, a former a Danish national road race champion, switched her nationality in 2010 from Danish to New Zealandish. It was her fifth straight podium {{at the world championships}} in the time trial. She took her first bronze in 2009, 2010 and 2012, and won silver in her former home county in 2011. [...] "It's not bad luck." [...] Villumsen said. [...] "If someone is better, they deserve to win. Ellen van Dijk has been riding very well all throughout the year, she has won all kinds of time trials, short ones, long ones. She really deserved to win. A place on the podium is still nice. I go close every year but something is missing. I'll try to work it out and {{go all the way to}} the top perhaps next year." ...|$|E
