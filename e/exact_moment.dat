The BBC received many telephone calls from listeners alleging they experienced the sensation.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a theoretical development that extends {{results on the}} distribution of the sample correlation coefficient and the Fisher transform (Fisher, 1921). Several well known correlational procedures use the Fisher transform or its square as the basis of hypothesis testing. These procedures assume that the variance of the Fisher transform can be approximated adequately as 1 / (n − 3). We present results that demonstrate that for small sample size this is not necessarily true. We present results that demonstrate that for small sample size this is not necessarily true. <b>Exact</b> <b>moments</b> of the Fisher transform and its square are computed for both null and non-null correlations for small n (≤ 20). An extension of the classic series expansion formulae of Hotelling (Hotelling, 1953) for the moments of the Fisher transform and its square are discussed and compared with the <b>exact</b> <b>moments</b> of the Fisher transform and its square. Monte Carlo experiments are used to demonstrate how these results may produce significant improvements in the small sample performance of tests for pattern hypothesis on correlation matrices. 1...|$|R

25|$|The Cathedral has a {{prominent}} role in determining the beginning of the Pisan New Year. Between the tenth century and 1749, when the Tuscan calendar was reformed, Pisa used its own calendar, in which {{the first day of the}} year was March 25, the feast day of the Annunciation of Mary. Years were counted such that the Pisan New Year begins 9 months before the ordinary one.

In this way Petre was referring in a modest way to the original Gothic revival period as conceived by such architects as James Wyatt, rather than the later Gothic, after it had fallen under the ecclesiastical Anglo-Catholic influences of such architects as Augustus Pugin in England, and Benjamin Mountfort in New Zealand.|$|E

Only the Eighth has harp, and percussion besides timpani (though legend has it the Seventh is supposed to have a cymbal crash at the <b>exact</b> <b>moment</b> Wagner died). Bruckner's style of orchestral writing was criticized by his Viennese contemporaries, but {{by the middle of the}} twentieth century, musicologists recognized that his orchestration was modeled after the sound of his primary instrument, the pipe organ, i.e., alternating between two groups of instruments, as when changing from one manual of the organ to another.|$|E

Approach: In this study, a fast and robust template matching algorithm was proposed where <b>exact</b> Legendre <b>moment</b> invariants were used where a cross-correlation was employed to detect the most similar partial input image regardless of location, width and height.

During the congress, he came into open conflict with Lenin, after the latter voiced the Zimmerwald Left's opposition to the resolution (at one point, Rakovsky reportedly lost his temper and grabbed Lenin, causing him to temporarily leave the hall in protest). Later, he continued to mediate between Lenin and the Second International, a situation from which emerged a circular letter that complemented the Zimmerwald Manifesto while being more radical in tone. In October 1915, he reportedly did not protest Bulgaria's entry into the war—this information was contradicted by Trotsky, who also indicated that the Tesniatsy had {{been the target of}} a government crackdown at that <b>exact</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
