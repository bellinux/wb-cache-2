Usually, the LE and the TE have a common counterion, but the coions (having charges with the same sign as the analytes of interest) are different: the LE is defined by coions with high <b>ionic</b> <b>mobility,</b> while the TE is defined by coions with low <b>ionic</b> <b>mobility.</b> The analytes of interest have intermediate <b>ionic</b> <b>mobility.</b> Application of an electric potential results in a low electrical field in the leading electrolyte and a high electrical field in the terminating electrolyte. Analyte ions situated in the TE zone will migrate faster than the surrounding TE coions, while analyte ions situated in the LE will migrate slower; {{the result is that}} analytes are focused at the LE/TE interface.|$|E

40|$|In some {{living cells}} {{the order of}} {{penetration}} of certain cations corresponds to that of their mobilities in water. This {{has led to the}} idea that electrolytes pass chiefly as ions through the protoplasmic surface in which the order of <b>ionic</b> <b>mobilities</b> is supposed to correspond to that found in water. If this correspondence could be demonstrated it would not prove that electrolytes pass chiefly as ions through the protoplasmic surface for such a correspondence could exist if the movement were mostly in molecular form. This is clearly shown in the models here described. In these the protoplasmic surface is represented by a non-aqueous layer interposed between two aqueous phases, one representing the external solution, the other the cell sap. The order of penetration through the non-aqueous layer is Cs > Rb > K > Na > Li. This will be recognized as the order of <b>ionic</b> <b>mobilities</b> in water. Nevertheless the movement is mostly in molecular form in the nonaqueous layer (which is used in the model to represent the protoplasmic surface) since the salts are very weak electrolytes in this layer. The chief reason for this order of penetration {{lies in the fact that}} the partition coefficients exhibit the same order, that of cesium being greatest and that of lithium smallest. The partition coefficients largely control the rate of entrance since they determine the concentration gradient in the non-aqueous layer which in turn controls the process of penetration. The relative molecular mobilities (diffusion constants) in the non-aqueous layer do not differ greatly. The <b>ionic</b> <b>mobilities</b> are not known (except for K+ and Na+) but they are of negligible importance, since the movement in the non-aqueous layer is largely in molecular form. They may follow the same order as in water, in accordance with Walden's rule. Ammonium appears to enter faster than its partition coefficient would lead us to expect, which may be due to rapid penetration of NH 3. This recalls the apparent rapid penetration of ammonium in living cells which has also been explained as due to the rapid penetration of NH 3. Both observation and calculation indicate that the rate of penetration is not directly proportional to the partition coefficient but increases somewhat less rapidly. Many of these considerations doubtless apply to living cells...|$|R
