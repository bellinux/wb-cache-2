40|$|<b>Vegetable</b> <b>materials</b> {{are easily}} found around us but are {{frequently}} considered useless. The Metallothionein content in <b>vegetable</b> <b>materials</b> such in roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit of rice, corns, beans, and soybeans {{has not been}} investigated before. Metallothionein protein has the role to bind heavy metals and serves as means of detoxification of heavy metals.
