The people turned to the Ghost Dance ritual, which frightened the supervising agents of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Agent James McLaughlin asked for more troops.

A former agent, Valentine McGillycuddy, saw nothing extraordinary in the dances and ridiculed the panic that seemed to have overcome the agencies, saying: [...] "The coming of the troops has frightened the Indians.

Several regional councils in New Zealand, like Horizons, rely on whole <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> and continue to seek ways to achieve {{a high level of}} voluntary adoption by farmers. A single case study was used to examine the phenomena of adoption of whole <b>farm</b> <b>plans.</b> This research answered the question: What factors influence the adoption by farmers of whole <b>farm</b> <b>plans,</b> and why these factors are influential? A review of historical <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> identified plans most similar to Horizons Whole <b>Farm</b> Business <b>Plans.</b> These were located in the Wairarapa and this formed the case area. Farmers from two catchments in the Wairarapa, and key informants were interviewed to identify factors influencing adoption of <b>farm</b> <b>plans.</b> Findings from this study, in the main, support adoption diffusion literature for agricultural innovations. The specific mix of interrelated factors that influence the adoption of <b>farm</b> <b>plans,</b> and the reasons for their influence, were identified and described. Characteristics of this case included the widespread adoption of <b>farm</b> <b>plans,</b> and farmers' perceived <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> implementation as secondary to the core farm business. Factors associated with the compatibility of the innovation to the core farm business and the credibility of the organisation delivering <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> provided important influences on adoption of <b>farm</b> <b>plans.</b> The circumstances of the farmers and their farm did not strongly influence adoption in this study because <b>farm</b> <b>plans</b> are customised and take into account each individual's circumstances.

40|$|Abstract The {{main purpose}} of this study was to present a {{formulated}} Linear ProgrammingLP Model for 16 selected small scale farmers from 32 operational areas of Fanteakwa District in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The study considered ten 10 crops namely garden eggs water melon cabbage onion tomato cucumber okra pepper cocoa nursery and plantain. The formulated LP Model for this study assumed profit maximizing behavior a single-period planning and a certain environment. The formulated LP Model suggested no production of sole crop enterprises like cabbage onion cocoa nursery pepper grown on raised bed pepper and garden egg grown on raised bed irrigation. The model also prescribed no production for crop mixtures like garden eggokra and cabbagecucumberpepper. The formulated LP Model prescribed production of 1 acre of garden egg 3 acres of watermelon 4 acres of tomato 2 acres of cucumber 1 acre of plantain 2 acres of garden egg irrigation 1 acre of okragarden eggpepper and 1 acre of peppergarden egg. Comparison of results obtained by using existing <b>farming</b> <b>plan</b> and the LP Model indicate that results obtained from the LP Model were significant improvements of the existing <b>farming</b> <b>plan.</b> The LP Model saved 0. 2 and 0. 6 of available capital and labor requirement respectively. A 16. 25 significant increment of the net returns was obtained by the LP Model. This was as result of net returns increasing from GH 77848. 00 to GH 88177. 00. These results suggest the essence of application of formulated mathematical models like the LP Model to planning and management of limited resources...|$|E

Basically PNTPLAN allows farmers to “build ” farming plans on a farm-by-farm and field-by-field basis. The problems of the earlier PNTPLAN are: (1) It {{is based on the}} Corel Quattro Pro and the user interface is not friendly, especially for the farmers; (2) It requires the pre-installation of Corel Quattro Pro, which is expensive for both software and hardware; (3) The data of the <b>farming</b> <b>plan</b> is not organized systematically, especially for the accumulation of several years ’ data. Visual FoxPro is a Microsoft database development environment that simplifies data management. Visual FoxPro makes it easy to organize data, define database rules, and build applications. We can quickly create forms, queries, and reports with the visual design tools and wizards. It is also possible to rapidly create full-featured applications by providing an integrated development environment with powerful object-oriented programming tools, client/server capabilities, and Active X support. 3 A full cycle of software development processes has been performed. A stand-alone application with improved functionality for PNTPLAN has been developed using the Visual FoxPro 6. 0. Comparing to the original PNTPLAN, the user interface has been improved, the data management has also been enhanced with more flexibility and less cost. 4 CONTENT...|$|E

40|$|Pasture land {{represents}} an important {{portion of the}} total land in southern Iowa. One opportunity for increasing resource productivity and farm incomes {{in this part of}} the state is to invest capital in pasture improvement. Experiments show that capital invested in pasture improvement and renovation, and the livestock to utilize the increased forage production, can greatly increase the value of products produced on land unadapted to continuous cropping; yields of forage and livestock products can be increased as much as threefold. However, the practices of improving and renovating pastures are proceeding at a slow rate. One reason suggested is capital limitations. Most farmers operate with limited funds. Accordingly, if they are to make greatest profits, they must use each dollar, acre and labor hour where it will bring the greatest return. The question is not so much whether pasture improvement and renovation is profitable; but whether it is more profitable than alternative uses of scarce capital and labor. For example, pasture improvement may cost $ 5 per year and return $ 8 In the same period. It is profitable in this sense: Each $ 1 In costs returns $ 1. 60 in sales. However, if the same $ 1 invested in fertilizer for crops or in hogs returns $ 1. 80, pasture improvement should not be included in the <b>farming</b> <b>plan</b> until these more profitable opportunities have been fully exploited. It should, of course, be included before other investments which return less than $ 1. 60...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: Modified rice cultivation, Water-saving, Farm typology, Technology adoption, Policy interventions, Farmers livelihoods, Resource use {{efficiency}} and Linear programming. The looming water crisis and water-intensive nature of rice cultivation are driving {{the search for}} alternative management methods to increase water productivity in rice cultivation. Solely reducing water use in rice resulted in proportional reduction in yield, hence various management practices of rice cultivation have to change simultaneously to enhance water productivity, without reducing the productivity of other factors, primarily land (i. e. yield), labour and fertilizer. Experiments were conducted under on-station and on-farm conditions to compare rice production using modified methods of planting, irrigation, weeding, and nutrient management with conventional methods of cultivation. An yield advantage of up to 1. 5 t ha– 1 was achieved with a water-saving of 40 % for the combination of modified methods over conventional methods. However, adoption by farmers remained limited due to the increased labour demand for modified planting, unwillingness of agricultural labourers to change practices, difficulties with modified nursery preparation and gender issues related to mechanical weeding. Potential for adoption of novel cultivation practices depends on the structure and functioning of the farm, hence four rice-based farm types were identified based on biophysical and socio-economic characteristics of the farms using principal component analysis. Opportunities exists in all four farm types to adopt one or more components of modified rice cultivation, but change in government policies are needed to improve adoption such as rules and regulations, pricing, institution building and infrastructure development, as well as training and education to farmers. An identical set of policy interventions cannot be applicable in all farm types since current resource use efficiencies and adaptability to changes differed substantially. Hence, we quantified current use efficiency of water, labour, nutrient and capital in all four farm types both at crop and farm level and qualitatively assessed the possible impact of different policy measures differentiated per farm type. A multi objective linear programming (MGLP) model was developed to explore quantitatively the impact of government policies introducing water pricing and water quota on adoption of modified rice cultivation including water-saving irrigation and related impact on farm profit. The combination of modifying rice cultivation and water pricing was effective in achieving both the objectives of farmers (i. e. maximizing income) and the society at large (i. e. increasing the use efficiency of water resources through inclusion of modified rice cultivation in the <b>farming</b> <b>plan).</b> The required degree of water pricing {{has to be kept}} low since higher prices lead to decrease in farm profit. Impact differed across farm types and affected poor resource endowed farmers most. Providing water quota can be an option to protect the livelihoods of poor resource endowed farmers. Apart from government water pricing and quota, policy instruments such as training and education in modified rice cultivation practices, development of irrigation infrastructure and organised cooperative management of commonly available water resources could have impact on the adoption of modified rice cultivation but this remains to be clarified. ...|$|E

40|$|Approximately half of Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s {{farms are}} {{operated}} under {{some form of}} leasing arrangement. The terms of these leasing arrangements {{play a vital role}} in determining how resources are allocated on these farms. Imperfections in leasing systems may reduce returns to landlords and tenants and restrict the total amount of product available to society. Under many leases in use, the <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> which maximizes returns to the landlord 2 ̆ 7 s resources may not be the optimum <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> from the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s standpoint, and vice versa. While the conditions of resource efficiency are not attained on many owner-operated farms, the leasing arrangement, ideally, should not contribute further to inefficiences in resource use. Within an owner-operated farm, then, an optimum allocation of the owner 2 ̆ 7 s resources is reached when these resources are organized in a manner to maximize his profits. The problem is more difficult on rented farms, however, because specialized resources are separately furnished by the landlord and tenant. Resource efficiency on rented farms is achieved only when the combined resources of the landlord and tenant are organized into a <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> which maximizes profits to their combined resources. An efficient lease should permit and encourage the adoption of this single <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> by the landlord and tenant. In other words, an efficient lease is one which allows the same <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> to be most profitable for both the landlord and the tenant; this plan should also be the one which is optimum for the farm as a whole, without regard to resource ownership.

40|$|A risk {{farmers have}} to cope with is annual changes in the {{availability}} of irrigation water. In this paper the relationship between irrigation water allocated to farmers and the incomes they derive in the Coleambally Irrigation Areas (CIA) in Australia is quantified. It is shown empirically that farmers reduce the area cropped when faced with reduced water availability. Increasing the availability of water does not necessarily lead to more stable (less volatile) income streams, as it offers the opportunity to include more water intensive, yet also more risky, crops in the cropping pattern (e. g. rice). However, it does lead to an overall increase in incomes. It was found that rice is the dominant crop for all levels of risk aversion, as shown by a stochastic dominance approach and by the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. The optimal <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> portfolio besides rice also includes a substantial amount of wheat if irrigators are somewhat risk averse, while more risk-averse farmers prefer more maize in their <b>farm</b> crop <b>plans.</b> The relative reduction in expected income from the optimal <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> chosen, given a rather risk averse farmer, compared to the expected income of the optimal <b>farm</b> <b>plan</b> chosen by a risk neutral farmer, is approximately 9 %...|$|R
