25|$|Ice cream {{was made}} by hand <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle {{attached}} to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, {{the temperature of the}} ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.|$|E

25|$|At Nalanda, a Buddhist university, {{four hours}} a day and {{four hours a}}t night were {{measured}} by a water clock, which consisted of a copper <b>bowl</b> holding two <b>large</b> floats <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> filled with water. The bowl was filled with water from a small hole at its bottom; it sank when completely filled and was marked by the beating of a drum at daytime. The amount of water added varied with the seasons and this clock was operated by the students of the university.|$|R
50|$|In the West, {{this food}} may be served <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small portion as <b>a</b> soup. <b>In</b> China, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> {{of it is}} often {{taken as a whole}} meal with or without any side dish.|$|R
50|$|The molten sugar solidifies {{in the air}} and {{is caught}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> which totally {{surrounds}} the spinning head. Left to operate for a period, the cotton-like product builds up on the inside walls of the <b>larger</b> <b>bowl,</b> at which point machine operators twirl a stick or cone, around the rim of the <b>large</b> catching <b>bowl,</b> gathering the sugar strands into portions which are served on stick or cone, or <b>in</b> plastic bags. <b>As</b> the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.|$|R

50|$|Cotton candy, {{also known}} as Candy Floss, {{is a form of}} spun sugar. Typical {{machines}} used to make cotton candy include a spinning head enclosing a small bowl into which granulated sugar is poured. Colored sugar or separate sugar and food coloring are used to provide color. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by centrifugal force, and the molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> which totally surrounds the spinning head. After the product builds up on the inside walls of the <b>larger</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>a</b> stick, cone, or hands are inserted, upon which the sugar strands are gathered.|$|R

50|$|Brânză de coșuleț is a salty type of cheese, with sheep's-milk cheese from Romania, {{specific}} of Transylvania. Brânză de coșuleț has {{a strong}} flavour and slightly soft in texture. To obtain it, sweet caș is cut into small pieces, salted and then hand-mixed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> wooden <b>bowl.</b> The mixture is then stuffed into bellows of fir tree bark, very lightly smoked. The cheese gets a specific pine resin flavour.|$|R

50|$|Until the 1840s, punsch {{was served}} as a warm punch, created just before consumption: a sugarloaf was placed upright <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl,</b> hot water was poured over it to make the sugar dissolve, and arrack, unflavoured spirits and German Rhine wine was added. Still warm, the drink was then served in cups. However, in 1845 wine {{importing}} company J. Cederlunds Söner started selling premixed punsch in bottles, quickly followed by several other manufacturers, and the habit of drinking punsch cold as a liqueur began to take hold. However, on Thursdays, punsch is still traditionally served warm with Swedish pea & pork soup and pancakes.|$|E

50|$|Buildings were {{constructed}} on allegedly waterproof waxed card bases. The bricks etc. were stuck {{together with a}} mortar made from a mixture of flour and chalk powder. It required {{a great amount of}} skill to erect buildings accurately, very time-consuming and beyond the patience of most of the children it was aimed at (8 to 14 years). Especially so in cold houses (as most British homes then were) it would take several days for the building to 'set'. Reusing the components involved a process of dunking the entire model <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of warm water. After the model fell apart the bricks and plaster pieces required lengthy rinsing to remove all organic traces to prevent mould growing on them.|$|E

Philip was in something very like a Geneva gown; Eustacie wore her prim white cap and frill, and coarse black serge kirtle; and there was but one chair besides that one which Philip was desired to retain, only two three-legged stools and a bench.|$|R
50|$|Brânză de burduf is a salty type of cheese, {{made with}} sheep (or {{occasionally}} buffalo) milk. It {{has a strong}} flavour and slightly soft in texture.
