500|$|On March 6, 2011, Daniels was {{the winner}} of an Oregon (Republican Party) straw poll. Daniels drew 29.33% of the vote, besting second place {{finisher}} Mitt Romney (22.66%) and third place finisher Sarah Palin (18.22%), and {{was the winner}} of a similar straw poll {{in the state of}} Washington. On May 5, 2011, Daniels told an interviewer that he would announce [...] "within weeks" [...] his decision of whether or not to run for the Republican presidential nomination. He said he felt he was not prepared to debate on all the national issues, like foreign policy, and needed time to better understand the issues and put together formal positions. Later in May, as the Republican field began to resolve with announcements and withdrawals of other candidates, Time said, [...] "Even setting aside his somewhat unusual <b>family</b> <b>situation,</b> Daniels would need to hurry to put together an organization" [...] and raise enough money if he intended to run.|$|E
500|$|Thome {{missed a}} {{significant}} portion of the first half of the Phillies' 2005 season due to injury; he compiled only a [...]207 batting average with 7 home runs and 30 RBIs going into the All-Star break. He was only sporadically effective; one result was that Phillies fans booed him and cheered for replacement Ryan Howard instead. He had season-ending surgery on his right elbow in August, while Howard won the NL Rookie of the Year Award. The Phillies traded Thome and cash considerations to the Chicago White Sox on November 25, 2005, for outfielder Aaron Rowand and minor league pitching prospects Gio González and Daniel Haigwood. Though the emergence of Howard made Thome more expendable to the squad, another factor in his trade to the White Sox was his <b>family</b> <b>situation</b> – Thome's mother, the [...] "go-to lady" [...] in his family and his biggest fan, had died a year earlier, and he worried about his father. Since Philadelphia was willing to trade him, Thome waived the no-trade clause in his contract for the good of the team and requested that if possible, they trade him to Chicago so he could be with his father.|$|E

At age 75, Joan Rivers of season8 was the oldest candidate to both appear {{on the show and}} win the competition. There have been six instances in which a candidate left The Apprentice for reasons other than being eliminated by Trump.

500|$|As an Irishwoman, Streep acted {{opposite}} Michael Gambon and Catherine McCormack in Pat O'Connor's Dancing at Lughnasa (1998), {{which was}} {{entered into the}} Venice Film Festival in its year of release. [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked that [...] "Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply peers out a window in Dancing at Lughnasa ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze". Later that year, Streep played a cancer sufferer caught in a difficult <b>family</b> <b>situation,</b> playing the mother of Renée Zellweger and wife of William Hurt in One True Thing. The film gained positive reviews. Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle declared: [...] "After 'One True Thing', critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural – so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration – that she's able {{to give us a}} woman who's at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable." [...] Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan noted that Streep's role [...] "is one of the least self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career" [...] but that she [...] "adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [...] one of her most moving".|$|E

2500|$|Stress may be {{increased}} {{when a person is}} living in a <b>family</b> <b>situation,</b> with increased pressures.

Violence is not always caused by stress, but may be one way that some people respond to stress. Families and couples in poverty {{may be more likely to}} experience domestic violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other aspects. Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man's ability to live up to his idea of [...] "successful manhood", thus he fears losing honor and respect. Theory suggests that when he is unable to economically support his wife, and maintain control, he may turn to misogyny, substance abuse, and crime as ways to express masculinity.|$|E

2500|$|Defense {{attorney}} Jose Baez told jurors {{his biggest}} {{fear was that}} they would base their verdict on emotions, not evidence. [...] "The strategy behind that is, if you hate her, if you think she's a lying, no-good slut, then you'll start {{to look at this}} evidence in a different light", he said. [...] "Itold you {{at the very beginning of}} this case that this was an accident that snowballed out of control... What made it unique is not what happened, but who it happened to." [...] He explained Casey Anthony's behavior as being the result of her dysfunctional <b>family</b> <b>situation.</b> At one point as Baez spoke, Ashton could be seen smiling or chuckling behind his hand. This prompted Baez to refer to him as [...] "this laughing guy right here". The judge called a sidebar conference, then a recess. When court resumed, he chastised both sides, saying both Ashton and Baez had violated his order that neither side should make disparaging remarks about opposing counsel. After both attorneys apologized, the judge accepted the apologies but warned that a recurrence would have the offending attorney excluded from the courtroom.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} choice is {{probably}} an individual right only, {{as opposed to}} also being a family right or a union right, however the rights are {{between you and the}} government and not between you and a member of your family. [...] In the 1995 Supreme Court case B. (R.) v. Children’s Aid Society, in which two parents attempted to block a certain treatment for their child on religious grounds, it was argued that the personal choice aspect of liberty guaranteed family privacy. [...] This argument drew from United States case law, but the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out section 7 of the Charter contains individual rights, and hence there cannot be family rights. [...] Still, mindful that there was still choices involved in the <b>family</b> <b>situation,</b> the Supreme Court split on whether liberty rights were infringed. [...] Likewise, in I.L.W.U. v. The Queen (1992), the Supreme Court stressed the individual nature of section 7 to deny unions had a right to strike as part of the members' liberty. [...] The Court also stressed that strikes were socioeconomic matters that did not involve the justice system, and section 7 was concentrated on the justice system.|$|E

40|$|As the {{population}} censuses show, the average household size in France has decreased steadily {{over the past}} 50 years. There are fewer complex households (comprising members other than parents and their children) and more oneand two-person households (Daguet, 2007; Breuil-Genier, 2012). This trend is driven by changes in aspects of family behaviour such as the age of departure from the parental home, union formation, births, separations, departure of adult children, widowhood, etc. The change in population structure, notably the increasing share of older adults, has also contributed {{in recent years to}} the decrease in household size. The main aim of the census is to count the number of inhabitants (to estimate de jure populations) and to describe the size and structure of local populations on the basis of simple characteristics (sex, age, employment status, place of work or study) that provide useful information for local management of their needs. But the census is also the primary data source used by the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), to describe <b>family</b> <b>situations</b> at local and national levels. After describing the <b>family</b> <b>situations</b> of the French population as observed in the 2009 census, this article presents developments over the past 40 years by systematically comparing <b>family</b> <b>situations</b> by sex and age recorded in three censuses spaced around 20 years apart: 1968, 1990 and 2009. This comparison is based on harmonized data drawn from these censuses, constructed for metropolitan France (mainland France and Corsica). Some <b>family</b> <b>situations</b> are poorly identified by the census, whose main purpose is to count the number of occupants in each dwelling. We show how these situations can be described more accurately, either in the census itself or in more detailed surveys. Finally, the advantages of the census based on rolling annual surveys are discussed...|$|R
