40|$|Abstract Earthquake {{disasters}} affect many {{structures and}} infrastructure simultaneously and collectively, and cause tremendous tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>loss.</b> In particular, catastrophic earthquakes impose tremendous financial stress on insurers who underwrite earthquake insur-ance policies in a seismic region, resulting in possible insolvency. This study develops a stochastic net worth model of an insurer undertaking both ordinary risk and catastrophic earthquake risk, and evaluates its solvency and operability under catastrophic seismic risk. The ordinary risk {{is represented by}} a geometric Brownian motion process, whereas the catastrophic earthquake risk is characterized by an earthquake-engineering-based seismic loss model. The developed model is applied to hypothetical 4000 wood-frame houses in south-western British Columbia, Canada, to investigate the impact of key insurance port-folio parameters to insurer’s ruin probability and business operability. The analysis results indicate: (i) the physical effects of spatially correlated ground motions and local soil condi-tions at insured properties are significant; (ii) the insurer’s earthquake risk exposure depends greatly on insurance arrangement (e. g. deductible and cap); and (iii) the maintenance of suffi-cient initial surplus is critical in keeping insurer’s insolvency potential reasonably low, whil...|$|E

40|$|Techniques for {{awarding}} {{personal injury}} damages assume an increasing interest {{in times of}} frequent mobility of individuals. Assessing non-economic damages might require more harmonized answers to provide justice and equal treatment across the world. Indeed, in most countries a lasting debate surrounds noneconomic damages for personal injury. Specifically, an alleged constant increase in awards and the difficulties linked to the subjectivity of their assessment, and {{the selection of the}} institution that is best suited to award these damages and how it should do so are but a few problems that are addressed by contemporary scholarship. However, this extensive debate has not sufficiently explored the techniques for awarding <b>intangible</b> <b>loss</b> damages in personal injury by using a comparative law methodology. Filling this gap, this article explores the latest developments in awarding non-economic damages. It proposes an analysis of the American and European experiences that aims to bridge the two legal cultures for mutual benefit. By way of comparative and historical analysis, Part I highlights the significant trend in American and European jurisdictions, which consists of distinguishing non-economic damages based on objective criteria stemming from an ascertainable medical condition. Building on these results, Parts II and III develop a more efficient conceptual framework and further propose better assessment tools in awarding these damages. This method demonstrates the benefits the United States could gain by introducing innovative judicial scheduling, without triggering either constitutional concerns or statutory intervention while building upon the existing strengths of the European experience and the American judicial system. For instance, Normalized Value Scheduling would endow actual judges and jurors with the necessary expertise, increasing horizontal and vertical equality without necessarily impeding an inevitable variability of awards among different jurisdictions...|$|E

Where a party proves that he or she has sustained loss flowing from any breach (potentially including non-pecuniary or <b>intangible</b> <b>losses,</b> e.g. for disappointment, damage to reputation, etc.), the purpose of damages is, so far as money can do it, to place the claimant in the same situation as if the contract had been performed. Thus, the most relevant basis upon which to calculate any loss is to examine the economic potential of the contract as worded. This will provide a measure of what the claimant expected to gain, and so quantify what has been lost by the breach.|$|R

Executive summary This report seeks to estimate how much crime costs the Australian economy by calculating the number of crimes that come {{to the attention of}} the authorities and, using crime victimisation survey data, the number of crimes that are not recorded officially. A dollar figure is then calculated for each estimated crime event and an indication given of the total cost of each specific crime type in terms of actual <b>loss,</b> <b>intangible</b> <b>losses,</b> loss of output caused through the criminal conduct and other related costs such as medical expenses, where relevant. Added to these costs are the costs of preventing and responding to crime in the community including the costs of maintaining the criminal justice system agencies of police, prosecution, courts and correctional agencies, as well as a proportion of the costs of Australian and state and territory government agencies that have crime-related functions. Finally, a deduction is made for the value of property recovered in the case of property crime, as well as the amount of funds recovered from criminals under federal, state and territory proceeds of crime legislation. More detailed information about how each of these estimates was derived is provided in the main body of the report. Official attention paid to specific crime types, particularly drug-related crime and organised crime, affects both the reporting rate and also the cost of policing and correctional responses. In this sense, individual crime type costs and prevention and response costs are not mutually exclusive.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{leadership}} change on military disputes Military disputes have always brought painful consequences including tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>losses.</b> Two world wars {{remind us of}} the horrific penalties that war imposes on mankind. Knowing these negative repercussions, why do nations fight wars? James D. Fearon argues that there always exist ex ante bargaining (negotiation) opportunities. However, nations gamble in war, according to Fearon’s rational explanation for war, due to incomplete information—disagreement about relative power, miscalculation of an opponent’s willingness to fight—and commitment problem. Fearon’s rationalist explanation of war can also be interpreted by taking the role of national leaders into account as they have direct roles in making strategic calculations and commitment before, during and after a war. If national leaders have a noticeable impact especially in formulating war policies, then we can expect variations in policies from one leader to another. One way to observe this variation is through national leadership change during a dispute. In democracies, leadership change is frequent through elections. In non-democracies, leaders tend to have long tenure but leadership change (through coups or other means) is not uncommon. Does regime type explain the policies adopted by new leaders? According to the theoretical approach I am taking in this paper, the answer is yes and I will discuss this later in detail. The question that I intend t...|$|R
40|$|A {{natural hazard}} is a geophysical, {{atmospheric}} or hydrological event (e. g., earthquake, landslide, tsunami, windstorm, flood or drought) {{that has the}} potential to cause harm or loss, while a natural disaster is the occurrence of an extreme hazard event that impacts on communities causing damage, disruption and casualties, and leaving the affected communities unable to function normally without outside assistance (Twig, 2007). The definition of natural disaster impact (NDI) can change according to both the aim of the study and the scientist assessing it. It can be defined as constituting the direct, indirect and <b>intangible</b> <b>losses</b> caused on environment and society by a natural disaster (Swiss Re, 1998). Direct losses include physical effects such as destruction and changes that reduce the functionality of an individual or structure. Damages to people (death/injury), buildings, their contents, and vehicles are included, as are clean-up and disposal costs. Indirect losses affect society by disrupting or damaging utility services and local businesses. Loss of revenue; increase in cost; expenses connected to the provision of assistance, lodging, and drinking water; and costs associated with the need to drive longer distances because of blocked roads are included. <b>Intangible</b> <b>losses</b> include psychological impairments caused by both direct and <b>intangible</b> <b>losses</b> that individuals personally suffer during the disaster. The Natural Disaster Impact Assessment (NDIA) is crucial in helping individuals to estimate replacement costs and to conduct cost-benefit analyses in allotting resources to prevent and mitigate the consequences of damage (UNEP-ECLAC, 2000). A general NDIA procedure has not yet been developed; several approaches are available in literature and their applicability depends on the accessibility of damage data. Possible end users of NDIA include the following (Lindell & Prater, 2003) : 1. 	Governments, with an interest in estimating direct losses to report to taxpayers and to identify segments of the community that have been (or might be) disproportionately affected 2. 	Community leaders, who may need to use loss data after a disaster strikes to determine if external assistance is necessary and, if so, how much. 3. 	Planners, who can develop damage predictions to assess the effects of alternative hazard adjustments. Knowing both the expected losses {{and the extent to which}} those losses could be reduced makes it possible to implement cost-effective mitigation strategies. 4. 	Insurers, who need data on the maximum losses in their portfolios to guarantee their solvency or even to undertake additional measures to alleviate the risk that they would face in case of a disaster (i. e., the use of catastrophe bonds which are risk-linked securities that transfer a specified set of risks from a sponsor to investors) (Noy & Nualsri, 2011). Data availability and reliability, especially for old events, represent constraints in the NDIA context because of several issues of very different type: 1. 	Data availability, for current events, depends on the time at which data gathering started. It is impossible to decide a priori when data have to be gathered: it primarily depends on the type of phenomenon causing the disaster and its magnitude, and secondly on the scope of the assessment (for example, the assessment should not be unnecessarily delayed as there is an urgent need to elicit support from the international community) (ECLAC, 2003). 2. 	Long-term losses must sometimes be determined over a period of years. Slow landslides, for example, can cause damage over long periods. Intangible damage like disaster-related stress also requires years to be detected (Bland et al., 1996). 3. 	In most countries, there are no agencies responsible for gathering damage data. Damage caused by severest events can be mined from international databases, while data on less severe events can be obtained by means of specific historical studies. 4. 	Data on property damage can depreciate the value of property, thus they would not be available or not completely reliable (Highland, 2003). 5. 	For some type of disasters, as landslides or floods, the costs of damages to structures such as roads are often merged with maintenance costs and are therefore not labelled as damage. In addition, when heavy rains trigger both landslides and floods (Petrucci and Polemio, 2009), it is difficult to separate landslide damage from flood damage. 6. 	Developing countries have an incentive to exaggerate damage to receive higher amounts of international assistance; thus, in these cases, data may not be entirely reliable (Toya & Skidmore, 2007). This chapter starts with a panoramic of the different approaches reported in the literature to assess the impact of natural disasters, and then presents some simplified approaches to perform a relative and comparative assessment of the impact caused by phenomena as landslides and floods triggered by heavy rainfall during events defined as Damaging Hydrogeological Events. Finally, some indices to assess the relative impact of landslides are presented...|$|R

In economic optimizations of risk control measures, valuing the loss of life and other financial losses in terms of money on the other hand, could influence the optimal investments in safety. The purpose is to contribute to the implementation of HSE in the transportation system. In this research, a fire risk assessment along with its economic loss estimation in the Direct Current (DC) trains and rectifier substation (RS) of Tehran subway is implemented. The number of fatalities, the extent of damage on the train equipment, etc., is then calculated in monetary unit. By using Event Tree Analysis (herein ETA), after identification of initiating events through observation, interviews, and evaluation of documents, event tree was constructed for each of them and the probability of multiple scenarios were computed. The scenario with the highest probability of fire in RS, including increased heats in the RTU panels generate a loss of at least 730 Million Rials. Accordingly, the minimum and maximum economic loss caused by fire on DC trains is minimum 510 and 1230 Million Rials, respectively.

40|$|For most of {{recorded}} history, {{the majority of}} legal systems have regarded domesticated animals as a species of property. Part I of this article reviews the traditional method of valuing animals in tort cases and notes that some modern courts have expanded beyond the classic fair market value standard and have allowed pet owners to recover {{for the value of}} the pet to them or even for loss of affection and companionship. Most courts, however, still value animals according to their fair market value, and Part I asserts that this method of valuation produces severe undercompensation of pet owners in many instances. Part II of this article explores generally the development of tort recoveries for “ethereal” injuries—injuries to the psychic and the emotions. Specifically, it discusses the evolution of derivative claims for loss of consortium and society, the abolition of certain claims for emotional distress such as alienation of affections and similar actions, and the increased recognition of claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Part II asserts that the same reasoning that led to an expansion of claims for ethereal injuries dictates that the courts afford some compensation for the emotional loss experienced because of the tortious injury to a companion animal. It also notes that pet destruction cases can be analogized to nuisance claims, for which many states allow recovery of damages for mental anguish. Part III explores the social science literature that documents the emotional importance of companion animals to their human owners. It asserts that a proper system of tort compensation should afford something more than a minimal recovery for the wrongful death of a companion animal. Part IV proposes a new rule of compensation for the tortious destruction of companion animals that will afford a significant recovery to pet owners. Initially, section IV. A addresses the general policy implications of compensating <b>intangible</b> <b>losses</b> in pet death cases and asserts that the fundamental policies of the tort compensation system are well served by recognizing such claims. It explores the tort theories of compensation, deterrence, and reflection of societal values as well as the related remedial policies of corrective justice and economic efficiency. Section IV.

Regardless of the approach, tangible and intangible costs are always identified, with the first referring to those directly observable and the latter to the unobservable costs that refer to the physical and emotional impact on crime victims. Despite the importance of both, the available estimates of the intangible costs of violence are very limited, especially in the UK context. This research set out to investigate this gap and provide a new insight into violence costs with a special focus to the <b>intangible</b> <b>losses</b> incurred by pain and suffering. Stated preferences techniques were developed and applied for this purpose, aiming to determine the monetary values of risk reduction of assault-related injuries as assigned by a UK sample to victimisation risks, contingent on the injury severity and psychological outcome. Novel epidemiological research carried out with British Crime Survey and Accident and Emergency data assisted this application, as the drawn evidence formed the basis for constructing plausible scenarios with a representative description of violent victimisation outcomes. The analyses identified that socio-demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity), quality of life indicators (self-rated health, income, marital status, educational qualifications) and offence-specific characteristics (use of force/violence, sustained injuries, injury severity, severity of the emotional effect, alcohol consumption prior to the incident) were not only linked to victimisation risks but also predicted severe emotional responding. Altogether, results suggested a two-dimensional structure underlying victims’ emotional reaction and a similar two-dimensional severity-based structure underpinning the physical aftermath of a violent assault. This research concluded with an array of comparable values that denote public's perception of victimisation risks in monetary terms while it highlighted the issues emerging from such an application. The estimation exercise showed that WTP varied extensively across respondents: women were willing to pay more to reduce victimisation related risks and WTP increased with education, age, income and fear of crime. Previous victimisation and difficulty in answering the valuation questions were negative influences on WTP. The numerical findings reflect the importance of victims' costs and provide metrics useful in assessing the cost-effectiveness of crime interventions. Although the contingent valuation method was effective for analysing intangible victim costs providing support for continuing this line of research, further work is required to substantiate its application and strengthen its methodology within the crime context...|$|R
30|$|The core concept {{within the}} {{definition}} of “disaster risk” does not really change over time or across different references, referring to overlapping notions of either: (1) possible losses from a hazard; or (2) potential adverse consequences in a disaster. The power of this definition is that various calculative forms are possible along with qualitative interpretations that are precluded by UNISDR’s (2017) definition. <b>Intangible,</b> non-quantitative, non-calculative <b>losses</b> and consequences have long been known to arise from disasters (Butler and Doessel 1980). Damage to natural and cultural heritage exemplify these losses with examples being irreplaceable photos or documents, cemeteries, and species extinctions. Similarly, while casualties are easily quantifiable by counting, the numbers cannot capture the true experience of losing a loved one or dealing with life-changing injuries, so these consequences are sometimes considered to be intangible (Butler and Doessel 1980).|$|R
40|$|The Waikato {{region is}} home to {{approximately}} 16 % of New Zealand’s total population, and is the country’s fourth largest regional economy. The region contributes 9. 1 % of the nation’s GDP and 10 % of New Zealand exports. The industries which are most important to the Waikato region are dairy farming, electricity generation and distribution, mining and quarrying, forestry and logging, and education and research services. The University of Waikato has been contributing to the Waikato regional economy since 1964. It employs 2000 staff and has 13, 000 enrolled students. Of the University’s domestic students, 74 % come from the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions. Thus the University creates employment for residents and attracts students from {{both within and outside}} the Waikato region. The expenditure of students in the region creates wealth for local businesses and other flow on effects, resulting in higher regional GDP. It is because of this influx of students into the region that the University provides the local economy with additional wealth. Thus there is motivation to further investigate the economic contribution of the University to the Waikato region’s economy. The main objectives of this study were to quantify the economic contribution of the University of Waikato to the Waikato region. By building a single region input-output model it can be seen how great an impact the University has on the Waikato region. Details of local student spending were ascertained to allow multiplier effects to be determined. The larger these multiplier effects, the more valuable the University is to the local economy. This study adds to the current academic literature on this subject, and also gives a more detailed understanding of a University’s role within its local economy. This is because it includes not only the direct impacts of the University’s and its students’ activities, but also the indirect flow-on effects. The methods this paper used to construct an input-output table for the Waikato region were to create a national input-output table from the 2007 supply and use tables for New Zealand using the industry technology method. This table was then downsized to portray the Waikato region using an augmented GRIT method, which allowed for the inclusion of superior data into the table. The resulting input-output table was then used to conduct an impact analysis of the University of Waikato on its local economy. This paper has used input-output analysis to show that the University of Waikato is important to the Waikato Region both in its contribution to regional GDP and in the benefits it provides to the community {{such as the use of}} the University grounds and higher-skilled labour force it brings. The University contributes 3. 4 % of the Waikato Region’s GDP and provides employment both directly through its delivery of services and indirectly through its operations and spending of staff and students. If the University were to close it would have a significant negative impact both on regional GDP and more <b>intangible</b> <b>losses</b> to its local community...|$|R
40|$|Generally, risk is an {{uncertainty}} {{associated with}} future outcomes or events. In economic terms, risk is an expected {{deviation from the}} planned return of real, financial and <b>intangible</b> assets, of <b>loss</b> or cash flows associated with the uncertain event. The most famous way of reducing the overall risk is diversification of assets. Thus, diversification {{is a process of}} investment in a number of unrelated or partially related assets or activities in order to achieve stable business operation, and it shows that portfolios are poor {{to the extent that they}} should be avoided in order to increase yields and reduce risk. The portfolio diversification works because prices of different shares do not move in the entirely same direction. Statisticians generally mean the same thing when they say that share price changes are nothing less than perfectly correlated. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the impact of the global financial crisis on the movement tendency of the stock exchange index in the Western Balkans, developed countries and individual EU member states, and determine the feasibility of implementing regional diversification in order to further reduce risk and establish the portfolio of share with the lowest coefficients of correlation...|$|R
