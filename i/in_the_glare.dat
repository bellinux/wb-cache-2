5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E
25|$|Proteus is {{the second}} largest moon of Neptune. It is about 420 {{kilometres}} in diameter, larger than Nereid, the second to be discovered. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes {{because it is so}} close to Neptune that it is lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> of reflected sunlight. The surface of Proteus is dark—its geometrical albedo is about 10%. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared around 2μm Proteus's surface becomes less reflective, pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides. These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. Although Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface.|$|E
25|$|Planets are {{extremely}} faint light sources compared to stars, and what little light comes from them {{tends to be}} lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> from their parent star. So in general, {{it is very difficult}} to detect and resolve them directly from their host star. Planets orbiting far enough from stars to be resolved reflect very little starlight, so planets are detected through their thermal emission instead. It is easier to obtain images when the star system is relatively near to the Sun, and when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than Jupiter), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation; images have then been made in the infrared, where the planet is brighter than it is at visible wavelengths. Coronagraphs are used to block light from the star, while leaving the planet visible. Direct imaging of an Earth-like exoplanet requires extreme optothermal stability. During the accretion phase of planetary formation, the star-planet contrast may be even better in H alpha than it is in infrared – an H alpha survey is currently underway.|$|E

40|$|Discomfort glare from bright luminaires or windows is not {{a simple}} matter but {{consists}} of a complex relation-ship between a number of factors. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the background luminance on discomfort <b>glare</b> <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> source. An experiment was conducted with observers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> experiment, <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discomfort <b>glare,</b> depending on <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background luminance, was measured using different sizes of glare sources. Seven sizes of steradian of <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> source were selected and five levels of back-ground luminance were chosen for the experiment. The results showed that the higher the background lumi-nance, the smaller the observer’s degree of discomfort <b>glare.</b> <b>The</b> exponent of background luminance changed clearly into different patterns <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> sizes of <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> source. A new mathematical formula has been developed by this study to determine the exponent of the background luminance for use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range from 0. 0003 to 5 sr of <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> source. <b>The</b> use of this formula would extend the application limit of <b>the</b> current unified <b>glare</b> rating formula from the current limit of 0. 1 to 5 sr.

Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille's physical state. Marseille, according to his own post-battle accounts, had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level. Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other. Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker. Finally, with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining, he climbed into the sun. The RAF fighter followed and was caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glare.</b> Marseille executed a tight turn and roll, fired from 100 metres range. The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing. It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside. Marseille wrote, [...] "That was the toughest adversary I have ever had. His turns were fabulous... I thought it would be my last fight". Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified.|$|E

[...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity.
