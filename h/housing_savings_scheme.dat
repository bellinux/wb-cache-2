40|$|The article {{begins by}} citing {{selected}} examples of state {{intervention in the}} area of housing in the Czech Republic, which dates back to the founding of the First Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, & a brief description is provided of the most important milestones in the evolution of housing policy since 1989. The second part of the article is devoted to empirically testing the effectiveness of selected housing subsidies applied in the Czech Republic {{at the end of the}} 1990 s. Housing affordability declined after 1989 & required the introduction of new social & housing policy tools. However, the goals of the new housing assistance programmes have often been laid out in very general terms, which, combined with the lack of data on the recipients, has complicated the execution of any kind of effective analysis. For this reason the selection of programmes submitted to the empirical analysis of effectiveness was limited to the following: housing allowance, rent regulation, & the tax deduction of interest from mortgages & <b>housing</b> <b>saving</b> <b>scheme</b> loans. The analyses showed that only the housing allowance met the selected effectiveness criteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} of the planned housing provision as an in-kind welfare benefit to a market-oriented housing allocation system is {{the ultimate goal of}} the urban housing reform in China. The main concern of the housing reform is to regulate the relationship between the state, market, work units, and individuals. Housing has always been a major problem in Shanghai. The rate of new housing construction has lagged far behind the rate of population growth. In the market reform process, the state has been reducing its role in housing provision which has resulted in significant increases in house prices as well as demand for housing at an affordable level. There is a gap between housing price and affordability. This paper examines the different measures of urban housing reform toward housing affordability in relation to the different stages of economic development in Shanghai during the periods from the 1980 s to now. It emphasizes the rent policy and the "provident fund for housing" - A <b>housing</b> <b>saving</b> <b>scheme.</b> The prime intent {{of this paper is to}} investigate Shanghai's housing policy under the urban housing reform toward affordability, at various stages of economic development.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} <b>housing</b> <b>savings</b> (the contractual <b>saving</b> <b>scheme)</b> in Croatia by applying Vector Autoregression (VAR) methodology on monthly data for the period 2000 – 2013. The {{results show that the}} selected macroeconomic indicators (wages, interest rate, stock exchange index-CROBEX, availability of loans and unemployment rate) do not influence the <b>housing</b> <b>savings</b> market dynamics. Moreover, the <b>housing</b> <b>savings</b> system proves to be resilient to economic downturn. On the other hand, the findings are that the system primarily depends on government incentives (GI) (premiums), as confirmed by the intervention analysis. Each of the three interventions in the structure of incentives (reductions in 2005 and 2013 and the decision to freeze the payment of premiums for 2014) resulted in a significant {{decline in the number of}} new <b>housing</b> <b>savings</b> contracts.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} three energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes</b> based {{on the concept of}} macro-assisted UE small cell connection establishment, made possible by the PCC architecture, allowing small cells to be put to a sleep state when not needed. Two of these schemes, namely the DL signalling based energy <b>savings</b> <b>scheme</b> and the UL signalling based energy <b>savings</b> <b>scheme,</b> are an adaptation of state-of-the-art schemes to the PCC architecture, while the third scheme, the database-aided scheme, is natively enabled by the PCC architecture. The implementation of these schemes at low overhead for the network is made possible by a novel heuristic algorithm which connects a UE to a suitable small cell offering the highest SINR when a data connection is needed. Additionally, we have derived a power consumption model for a representative PCC small cell which allows to quantify the percentage of energy consumed by a small cell in the sleep state with respect to a small cell in the on state for the various energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes.</b> Furthermore, we have determined the time required to perform a macro-assisted UE-small cell connection for each energy <b>savings</b> <b>scheme,</b> representing the delay before a UE can receive user data from a small cell.|$|R
30|$|We adapt two energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes</b> {{based on}} sleep mode techniques, namely a {{downlink}} (DL) signalling-based scheme and an uplink (UL) signalling-based scheme [6], originally proposed for traditional heterogeneous networks (HetNets), to the PCC architecture, {{to demonstrate how}} macro-assisted UE-small cell connection establishment procedures {{can be used to}} realize energy savings without impacting user QoS. A third energy <b>savings</b> <b>scheme</b> natively enabled by the PCC architecture, the database-aided scheme, is also presented. This scheme has been proposed by the authors in [4, 5] and aims at combining the advantages of the two schemes above to realize more energy savings. We apply the heuristic algorithm introduced in this paper to quantify the achieved energy savings and user QoS realizable with these three energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes.</b>|$|R

By the close of 1974 these balances will no doubt exceed Sh 60 million, belonging to 150, 000 co-operators. Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme</b> balances have a considerable impact on cooperative finance and at the close of 1973 exceeded by Sh 22 million the amount of loans outstanding on the books of participating societies under the Cooperative Production Credit Scheme, a companion programme. The Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme</b> operates in rural areas only and most depositors are members of primary coffee marketing societies. The Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme</b> exhibits several operational and management problems and cannot yet be considered mature. However, its performance during a period of generally favourable conditions in the smallholder coffee sector suggests that considerable rural savings capacity exists among small cash crop farmers and that this capacity is not tapped by financial institutions other than cooperatives. Savings is defined simply as deferred consumption, and the financier's view of savings as a funds flow phenomenon is more relevant to rural development than are considerations of savings as an institutional phenomenon motivated by long run considerations...|$|R
