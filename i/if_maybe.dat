500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder <b>if</b> <b>maybe</b> I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} {{before he was}} executed, Bundy granted an interview to James Dobson, a psychologist {{and founder of the}} Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family. He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder <b>if</b> <b>maybe</b> actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Slezak of TVLine complimented [...] "Max Adler's {{surprisingly}} nuanced performance" [...] as Karofsky in [...] "Born This Way": [...] "The complex play {{of emotions}} in Karofsky's eyes when Santana simultaneously {{came out to}} him, threatened to out him, predicted his sad future as a closeted state senator or deacon, and offered him a quick-fix solution by pretending to be his beard, was tremendous." [...] He added, [...] "Adler is bringing a terrific amount of depth to Karofsky." [...] VanDerWerff referred to Karofsky's parallel journey with Santana, who is also closeted, in his comments about the episode {{and the next one}} where the character appears, [...] "Prom Queen". He said in his review of the latter, [...] "the characters I'm most interested in at this point are Karofsky and Santana. They're both people {{trying to do the right}} thing, but they're also both people who are defeated by their own weakest impulses. ... They're both hemmed in by the decisions they've made and their inability to be true to themselves". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic praised Karofsky's [...] "tearful apology to Kurt" [...] in that episode as being [...] "painful and poignant", and Slezak went further: Whatever awards Chris Colfer and Max Adler get nominated for in the next six months, they earned 'em during this conversation, where Kurt wondered <b>if</b> <b>maybe,</b> just maybe, he wasn't getting bullied because kids were indifferent to him being gay, not because Karofsky was serving as his security detail. ... ou could see in Kurt's eyes the decision to start treating Karofsky not as a former tormentor, but as a terrified kid struggling with his sexual orientation. And Karofsky's break—his first true apology for bullying Kurt, and his first tentative step toward admitting the root cause of his anger—had me reaching for the Kleenex. Tell me I'm not the only one hoping Glee will keep journeying down Karofsky's difficult road toward self-acceptance.|$|E

I am unable to interact with any of the large Vietnamese population in Los Angeles for fear that they might find out who I am; and, because I cannot stand the pain of remembering or wondering <b>if</b> <b>maybe</b> they had relatives or loved ones who were victims at My Lai... some of us will walk in the jungles and hear the cries of anguish for all eternity".|$|E
2500|$|On May 28, Minogue's 45th birthday, she {{announced}} the buzz single [...] "Skirt", {{and it was}} made available on Beatport on June 24. Whilst the track attracted positive commentary from critics, mainly for Minogue's newly experimented sound of electronic dance music, she revealed {{that it would not}} feature on the then-upcoming studio album. In February 2014, Minogue confirmed Furler as the album's executive co-producer's. Minogue stated in an interview with American website Idolator that [...] "I got on with her so well... I asked her if she would executive-produce. I was hoping she would say yes. I didn’t know if it was something she had done or was interested in, or <b>if</b> <b>maybe</b> she just preferred writing and doing her own music." [...] That same month, she commented to American Billboard magazine; [...] "I felt like I needed a new landscape, and once you've got your feet on the ground you're raring to go. [...] So far the support has been great, and it's just another part of this amalgamation of 'new' that I had wished for and was struck by." ...|$|E
2500|$|All's {{previous}} albums {{had been}} released through Cruz Records, an independent record label that was an imprint of SST Records. With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. [...] "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. [...] "We maybe were just looking to sort of {{go to the next}} place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see <b>if</b> <b>maybe</b> we could get the records out to more people." [...] "In {{the past year or so}} we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|E

60|$|Of course, I {{meant to}} take the train for Camelot. Train! Why, the station was as vacant as a cavern. I moved on. The journey to Camelot was a {{repetition}} of what I had already seen. The Monday and the Tuesday differed in no way from the Sunday. I arrived far in the night. From being the best electric-lighted town in the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever saw, it was become simply a blot--a blot upon darkness--that is to say, it was darker and solider {{than the rest of}} the darkness, and so you could see it a little better; it made me feel as <b>if</b> <b>maybe</b> it was symbolical--a sort of sign that the Church was going to keep the upper hand now, and snuff out all my beautiful civilization just like that. I found no life stirring in the somber streets. I groped my way with a heavy heart. The vast castle loomed black upon the hilltop, not a spark visible about it. The drawbridge was down, the great gate stood wide, I entered without challenge, my own heels making the only sound I heard--and it was sepulchral enough, in those huge vacant courts.|$|E
