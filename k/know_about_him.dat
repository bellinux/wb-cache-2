5|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} problem Biden faced {{was the fact that}} voters did not <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> and his candidacy.

In contrast, 0% of the public had never heard of Hillary Clinton and only 3% had no opinion according to a June 1–3 poll by Gallup.|$|E

25|$|Because of Lin's fragile health, Ye Qun {{controlled}} {{many aspects}} of Lin's public life during the 1960s, including who would see Lin and what others would <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Mao encouraged Ye to act on Lin's behalf, giving her an unusual amount of power and responsibility. In 1965 Mao asked Ye to publicly criticize Lin's chief of staff, Luo Ruiqing, on Lin's behalf, even though Ye did not yet hold any high political position. When Lin discovered that Ye had done so (after Luo was purged), he was angry at Ye, but powerless to alter Luo's disgrace.|$|E

After scoring both of his team's goals in a 2–1 away win at Sunderland on his debut on 9 September, Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder commented: [...] "Not bad for 50 grand that, is it?

The official music video for the track, directed by Josh Thomas, was released in February 2014 by Vice Media's electronic music channel Thump.

The song was also very well received from music critics.|$|E
500|$|Williams' {{portrayal}} of the role was intended {{to act as a}} counterpoint to Jerry Hardin's {{portrayal of}} X's predecessor, Deep Throat. Whereas Deep Throat had been a selfless character, X was written and performed as a scared, selfish character. Prior to the episode [...] "One Breath", Glen Morgan had felt that the character of X was not [...] "going over too well" [...] with fans of the series, as he seemed to simply be a copy of Deep Throat. Believing Williams to be an actor worth having as a series regular, he included in the episode a scene in which X murders witnesses who have seen him speaking to Fox Mulder. Morgan felt that such a scene reflected X's paranoia and the difference between him and his predecessor, noting that [...] "Deep Throat was a guy willing to lose his life for letting out the secret, whereas X is a guy who's still scared". [...] Williams has stated that he has never attempted to rationalize the character's motives or imagine a backstory for him, preferring to play the role with as little background as possible; he once stated [...] "the less I <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> the more interesting he becomes." ...|$|E

500|$|The intro, [...] "The Genesis", is {{composed}} as an aural montage {{that begins with}} the sound of an elevated train and an almost-inaudible voice rhyming beneath it. Over these sounds, a snatch of dialogue, two men arguing. It samples Grand Wizard Theodore's [...] "Subway Theme" [...] from the 1983 film Wild Style, the first major hip hop motion picture. Nas made another ode to Wild Style, while shooting the music video for his single, [...] "It Ain't Hard to Tell", on the same stage as the finale scene for the film. His verse on [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] is played in the background of [...] "The Genesis". According to music writer Mickey Hess, in the intro, [...] "Nas tells us everything he wants us to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> The train is shorthand for New York; the barely discernible rap is, in fact, his [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] verse; and the dialogue comes from Wild Style, one of the earliest movies to focus on hip hop culture. Each of these is a point of genesis. New York for Nas as a person, 'Live at the Barbeque' for Nas the rapper, and Wild Style, symbolically at least, for hip hop itself. These are my roots, Nas was saying, and he proceeded to demonstrate exactly what those roots had yielded." ...|$|E
