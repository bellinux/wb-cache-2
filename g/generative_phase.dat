During 2012, there were 25 species recorded in an herbal layer and for a phenological research in 2013, I was able to document 24 taxa. In 2012, the highest number of present species in a phenological spectrum occurred. Especially, it was during March and October. In 2013, the highest number of species in a phenological spectrum was found on March and April and also later from September to October which is a period when forest species start to grow because of a temperature increase and it also occurred in the autumn period when a repeated growth of forest species took place. In 2012, species in <b>generative</b> <b>phases</b> occurred from 11 th March until 1 st September and after that, taxa in vegetative phases were found only. In 2013, because of low March temperatures, it was possible to observe <b>generative</b> <b>phases</b> only since 22 nd March until the last date of a phenological observation – 11 th December. A change in the onset, interphase duration and ending of the monitored phenophases between the years 2012 and 2013 was observed.

Twelve soybean lines and two check varieties (Wilis and Tidar) were evaluated at eight locations during dry season of 2009 and 2010, planted two times in each location. The treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with four replications. These sites were Mojokerto, Banyuwangi, Pasuruan, and Jombang (East Java), Bantul and Sleman (Yogyakarta), Mataram and Lombok Barat (NTB). No irrigation was added during reproductive phase of the crop. Soil moisture content at 0 - 20 cm soil layer during the <b>generative</b> <b>phase</b> was equivalent to pF value of 3. 0 - 4. 2.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore how {{designers}} mentally categorize design information during early sketching performed in the <b>generative</b> <b>phase.</b> In conjunction with cognitive aspects of design, we proposed that cognitive and affective processes, involved in this specific phase, should be modeled through understanding designer's mental process and its relationship with early representations (sketches) together. A combination of action research approach and laboratory-based experiments was particularly appropriate for our study. Thus, first, a descriptive model of information processing involving memory theories drawn from cognitive psychology was developed. This model was refined and enriched via empirical studies with experts and novices in the product design domain. In order to formalize cognitive and affective processes of designers, we combined cognitive (concurrent verbalization protocol and questionnaires) and physiological (galvanic skin conductance and eye tracking system) methods.

Scions grafted onto winter rape stock produced more siliques than those on spring rape. Grafting of scions after cutting off their apical meristems allowed formation of side shoots and consequently resulted in higher yields of siliques; the formation of siliques, however, was delayed by about 10 days as compared to grafts with apical meristems...|$|E
30|$|The most {{important}} pineapple cultivar in Benin is the sweet cultivar locally known as Sugarloaf –but possibly equal to cv. Pérola– grown by 97 % of the pineapple growers (Fassinou Hotegni et al. 2014 a). In this cultivar type {{and several other}} types like cv. Singapore Spanish grown in, e.g., South Asia, three development phases exist: the vegetative phase (from planting to flowering induction); the <b>generative</b> <b>phase</b> (from flower initiation to fruit maturity), and the propagative phase in which new shoots are produced (begins at the <b>generative</b> <b>phase</b> and continues after the fruit has been harvested) and which partly overlaps with the <b>generative</b> <b>phase.</b> Cultural practices to control heterogeneity are carried out mainly before flowering induction. Heterogeneity in pineapple fruit quality (fruit weight and length attributes) at harvest is clearly associated with heterogeneity in plant vigor at flowering induction time (Fassinou Hotegni et al. 2014 b), and consequently cultural practices achieving uniform plant development before flower induction (like planting material grading by size at planting time) have received considerable attention (Bartholomew et al. 2003, Py et al. 1987). Yet smallholder systems still show a high heterogeneity in quality (Fassinou Hotegni et al. 2015). The present research focused on the potential of practices applied after flowering induction to reduce the heterogeneity in pineapple fruit quality, i.e., in total fruit (infructescence[*]+[*]crown) weight and length, infructescence weight and length, crown weight and length, the ratio crown length: infructescence length, the total soluble solids (TSS) in the pineapple juice, the juice pH, and the flesh translucency.|$|E

40|$|Phalaenopsis is a crassulacean acid {{metabolism}} (CAM) plant which absorbs and binds CO 2 as malate {{during the}} night. During daytime the stomata close and the CO 2 stored in the vacuole is released and used for photosynthesis. Because the CO 2 taken up by CAM plants {{was assumed to be}} unaffected by the CO 2 concentration in the air, additional CO 2 for increased growth was generally not supplied in Phalaenopsis. However, a literature study indicated that elevated CO 2 might have a positive effect in Phalaenopsis. To assess the effects of elevated CO 2 concentrations in Phalaenopsis, two experiments were performed with elevated CO 2. In the first experiment, 8 Phalaenopsis clones were induced to flower at 400 and 1000 ppm CO 2 in the greenhouse at day/night temperatures of 19. 2 / 18 °C. Two or more spikes were produced by 82 % of the plants grown at 1000 ppm CO 2, and in 70 % of the plants grown at 400 ppm CO 2. The mean number of spikes per plant was 9 % higher and their dry weight was 12 % higher. A second experiment was then designed to see if the effect of elevated CO 2 was limited to the flowering phase, or was effective during the vegetative phase as well. In this experiment, four Phalaenopsis clones were grown in climate controlled growth chambers at CO 2 concentrations of 400 or 1000 ppm. During the vegetative growth phase (30 weeks), the leaf area and root dry weight of plants grown at elevated CO 2 appeared to be higher than at low CO 2. At the end of the vegetative growth phase, plants from both CO 2 treatments were split into two groups: one group at low CO 2 and the other at elevated CO 2 for the <b>generative</b> growth <b>phase,</b> resulting in 4 treatment groups. Day/night temperatures were lowered to 19 / 18 °C for 6 weeks to induce spiking followed by 12 weeks with day/night temperatures of 21 / 19 °C during the growth and development of the spikes. Plants grown at elevated CO 2 during the <b>generative</b> growth <b>phase</b> yielded 15 and 10 % more plants with multiple spikes and an improved flower stem quality, when grown at low and high CO 2 in the vegetative phase respectively.

40|$|Cytidinediphosphate {{diacylglycerol}} synthase (CDS) catalyzes {{the transfer}} of a cytidylyl group from CTP to phosphatidic acid so that CDP-diacylglycerol, an important intermediate in glycerolipid biosynthesis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, is formed. It serves as precursor of anionic phosphoglycerolipids such as phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. In plant cells CDS isozymes {{are located in the}} envelope membranes of plastids, in the inner mitochondrial membranes and microsomes, especially the ER. These CDS isozymes are encoded by a small gene family that comprises five members in Arabidopsis thaliana, two of which have previously been shown to code for the plastidial isoforms and be essential for the biosynthesis of plastidial phosphatidylglycerol. In this work the focus have been on the extraplastidial CDS, encoded by CDS 1, CDS 2 and CDS 3. These enzymes were demonstrated to be the integral membrane proteins of the ER and possess similar enzymatic properties. Unlike the CDS 3 gene, the expression of which was only detectable during the <b>generative</b> growth <b>phase,</b> CDS 1 and CDS 2 genes are constitutively expressed. Single Arabidopsis mutants lacking either CDS 1 or CDS 2 showed a wild type phenotype whereas disruption of both genes led to a seedling lethal phenotype, which can be complemented by functional expression of either CDS 1 or CDS 2 cDNA in the mutants. Hence these genes have redundant but indispensible functions. Analyses of cds 1 cds 2 showed that the cell division and expansion were arrested in the mutant. Based on data from phospholipid labeling and steady state lipid composition, the dramatic accumulation of phosphatidic acid and the decrease of phosphatidylinositol are probably the reasons for the severe consequence of Arabidopsis losing the microsomal CDS functions...|$|R

In this study, apical development and growth of 20 oat cultivars and lines released since 1920 s were monitored in two years. Pre-anthesis developmental phases were split into seven sub-phases: vegetative, pre-fertile, pre-abortion, generative, fertile pre-abortion, fertile, and abortion. Coincidence of apical development with leaf and tiller appearance and growth was studied and association of duration of main developmental phases with yield components analysed. Cultivar differences in duration of pre-anthesis sub-phases were not attributable to year of release though some tendencies appeared when four oldest cultivars were compared with four latest ones. The most marked change was prolonged duration of <b>generative</b> <b>phase</b> at the expense of duration of grainfilling period in modern cultivars. This was not, however, due to marked differences in cumulated degree days for <b>generative</b> <b>phase,</b> but shorter postanthesis period. Even though <b>generative</b> <b>phase</b> was not much changed by plant breeding, relative durations of sub-phases were somewhat: e. g. preabortion and fertile pre-abortion phases tended to be slightly shorter in modern cultivars in both years. Regarding measured growth parameters, modern cultivars had slightly lower number of leaves and higher Cdd °C demand for maximum leaf number, but lower demand for maximum tiller number. No constant effect of year of cultivar release were found on phyllochron, maximum green leaf number and maximum tiller number. Tillers tended to reach their peak value earlier compared to maximum leaf number in modern cultivars when compared to old ones. Relative elongation rate of the apex, uppermost node and uppermost stipule correlated negatively with duration of many of the pre-anthesis sub-phases. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelut.

The relative growth rate (RGR) during the vegetative stage was 300 mg g 1 d 1 and dropped at the initiation of flowering buds to 60 mg g 1 d 1, a fivefold reduction, while remaining exponential. Investment in reproductive structures had prevalence over vegetative structures during the <b>generative</b> <b>phase</b> of the life cycle. The RGR of reproductive structures was 105 mg g 1 d 1. The initiation of flowering was stage-dependent. After the formation of about 14 leaves, plants started to form flowering buds, independent of weight or leaf size. The shoot : root ratio stayed the same during both the vegetative and generative stages. The change from a two-compartment system (shoot and root) to a three-compartment system (shoot, root and reproductive structures) did not change the balance or functional equilibrium between root and shoot. Seed size effects lasted {{until the end of}} the experiment and were reflected in all morphological measurements.

40|$|Phases of the phenological of Wistaria floribunda (Willd.) DC {{are shown}} to {{disclose}} the perspective dates of the vegetation embracing the phases of flowering (March-April), of ripening of the fruits (October) and of having complete foliage (April-October). The first course of development or ontogeny, the germination, covers a period of 10 – 12 days; the growing phase embraces a period 2 – 3 years and development to maturity from 3 to 5 or 6 years, before the <b>generative</b> <b>phase</b> begins. A huge quantity of seeds is required in the fields {{in comparison to the}} cultivation in botanical gardens, where only 50 – 70 % of this demand is needed...|$|E
40|$|In fresh moist meadows, double-cut, {{located in}} the Bydgoszcz Canal Valley, you can find Ostericum palustre, a species of {{priority}} importance, which requires protection {{in the form of}} designation of Natura 2000 sites. The aim of the present research was to define the effect of the cutting date on blooming and fruit-bearing of O. palustre in meadows covered by the PO 1 b agro-environmental programme. Phenological observations included three populations of O. palustre. The first one occurs in a traditionally used meadow, not covered by the agro-environmental programme (2) where the date of the first cut falls in mid June. The second one is located in a meadow covered by the agro-environmental programme (1) where the first cutting date is possible from July 1, and the third population located in a natural meadow is not agriculturally used (0). The present research showed that individuals of O. palustre in the traditionally used meadows (2), prior to the first cut, reach the leaf rosette phase, while individuals which occur in the meadow covered by the agro-environmental programme (1), prior to the first cut, reach the <b>generative</b> tiller <b>phase.</b> Full bloom of O. palustre in the traditionally used meadows occurs after July 20, while individuals of O. palustre in the agro-environmental programme reach that phase only at the beginning of August. At the same time, about August 6, the first inflorescence in 70 % of individuals in the agriculturally unused meadow (0) has ripe fruit, and in mid August all fruits are ripe. In mid August 70 % of individuals in the meadow used for traditional cutting have ripe fruits of the first inflorescence, and right before the second cut, on August 27, almost 90 % of fruits were ripe. Most O. palustre individuals in the meadows covered by the agro-environmental programme do not finish blooming of the first inflorescence before mid August. By the end of August, about 60 % of individuals reach the phase of young fruits. The first ripe fruits occur as late as September 12. About September 20 most fruits are ripe. To sum up, delayed PO 1 b agro-environmental programme meadow cutting, after July 1, does not facilitate the production of ripe fruit in O. palustre individuals...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of {{nitrogen}} supply on growth as well as relation on adaptation to light interception of leek (Allium porrum L.,) hybrid Alita, genotype of known genetic background. During the vegetative and <b>generative</b> plant growth <b>phases,</b> besides genetic potential many factors affect their productivity. The aim was to investigate genome expression dependent on nitrogen nutrition and light interception. Nitrogen in correlation with light availability has important effect on the growth of plants {{and the formation of}} leaf area, what it is necessary for yield of dry matter. Investigation has been done in open field grown leek commercial hybrid Alita (Allium porrum L.,) to consider the way of its genotype response to correlation of light interception and nitrogen nutrition. Investigated traits are leek crop productivity, light interception and chemical analyses of plants. Leek crop productivity was determined through the dry matter production, leaf area development and light interception. Analyses of leek plants comprehended chemical determination and calculation of total nitrogen concentration, nitrogen critical concentration in dry matter, nitrogen demand and, nitrogen uptake in leek crop. Correlation among investigated parameters was assigned to comprehensive hypothetical model of growth and productivity of leek crop grown at open field. It was shown that for nitrogen uptake (Nu), nitrogen demand (ND) and total nitrogen concentration (Nt) parameters variants of mineral nutrition plays significant role (pNu= 0. 002; pND= 0. 045; pNt= 0. 011). Obtained results indicated that correlation of nitrogen and light interception could be used as criteria in plant breeding...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} {{has studied the}} effects of NaCl of different concentrations on some characteristics of canola. Two cultivars of canola, Okapi (tolerant cv.) and Symbol (sensitive cv.) have been studied under five salinity treatments, including 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 ds m - 1, in both the laboratory and green house conditions. In the laboratory, seed germination rate and percentage and seedling growth were assayed. In the green house condition, the growth parameters were measured in vegetative, <b>generative</b> and harvesting <b>phases.</b> Results showed that the percentage and rate of seed germination, seedling growth and distance between the root hairs and root tips were all decreased by salt solutions, especially by 12 ds m - 1 treatment. However, these parameters were increased by 3 ds m - 1 treatment. Also, being treated with salt solutions, {{within the range of}} 12 - 20 ds m - 1, the threshold concentration for germination was determined as 14 ds m - 1 for Okapi and 13 ds m - 1 for Symbol. Results showed that the effects of salinity stress on the phase of germination is less than the other phases. Under greenhouse condition, the vegetative growth and yield of both cultivars were unaffected by soil salinity of a rate of up to 3 ds m - 1. By increasing the salinity levels above the threshold, the ratio of fresh to dry biomass, thickness of leaves, plastochronic period, thickness of pollen exine and 1000 -siliqua weight increase. On the other hand, number of leaves, branches, flowers, flower primordia, siliquas and their length, number of seeds per siliqua and 1000 -seed weight all decreased. The most inhibitory effect was observed in 12 ds m - 1 treatment with more effect on Symbol than on Okapi. The length of siliquas, plastochronic period and number of flowers were more affected by salinity stress than the other parameters...|$|R
