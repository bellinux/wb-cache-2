25|$|The C6 {{generation}} did {{not match}} the previous generation's relatively good fuel economy, despite its relatively low 0.28 drag coefficient and low curb weight, achieving 16/26 mpg (city/highway) equipped with automatic or manual transmissions; like all manual transmission Corvettes since 1989, it is fitted with Computer Aided Gear Selection (CAGS) to improve fuel economy by requiring drivers to shift from 1st gear directly to 4th in low-speed/low-throttle conditions. This feature helps the C6 avoid the <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax by achieving better fuel economy.|$|E
40|$|Cars {{manufactured}} in the United States have become increasingly fuel efficient {{in the past two}} decades, and many people attribute that to rising gasoline prices. From 1975 to 1985, following the 1973 oil embargo, the fuel efficiency of new cars increased by more than 60 percent. What's surprising, however, is that fuel efficiency continued to remain high even when gasoline prices declined, even falling below prices in 1970. Why didn't we see a return of the <b>gas</b> <b>guzzlers?...</b>|$|R
50|$|For decades, in the U.S., {{small cars}} like the Focus {{were seen as}} a tool to draw in younger buyers looking for a cheap basic {{transportation}} and to increase auto makers' fleet average fuel economies to meet U.S. federal standards. Ford was said not to concern about losing money on the Focus so the company could sell <b>gas</b> <b>guzzlers</b> for big profits. Many industry insiders also view cars like the Focus as 'compliance cars' because of their role in helping to bring down the corporate fleet average fuel economy to meet current fuel-economy standards.|$|R
25|$|The American {{automobile}} industry became notorious for {{the manufacture of}} <b>gas</b> <b>guzzlers</b> during the 1960s and 1970s when fuel prices and consumer awareness concerning fuel economy were at an all-time low. In the 1960s and 1970s, American-made cars took on enormous proportions as consumers placed their emphasis on comfort, power and style. Large sedans from this era {{came to be known}} as land yachts, often rivaling today's largest pick-up trucks in terms of length and width. In 1977, the Lincoln Continental Mark V was reviewed by the German automobile magazine, auto motor und sport and still holds the record for the worst fuel economy of any vehicle ever tested by the magazine with an average of 7 MPG.|$|R
25|$|In the US, {{transportation}} by car {{is guided}} {{more by the}} government than by an invisible hand. Roads and the interstate highway system were built by local, {{state and federal governments}} and paid for by income taxes, property taxes, fuel taxes, and tolls. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is designed to offset market imbalances. Municipal parking is frequently subsidized. Emission standards regulate pollution by cars. US fuel economy standards exist but are not high enough to have effect. There is also a <b>gas</b> <b>guzzler</b> tax of limited scope. The United States offers tax credits for certain vehicles and these frequently are hybrids or compressed natural gas cars (see Energy Policy Act of 2005).|$|E
25|$|For 2011, the Shelby GT500 {{received}} significant performance enhancements {{and other}} upgrades. Arguably {{the most important}} of the GT500's upgrades is a new aluminum engine block for the car's supercharged 5.4L DOHC V8, replacing the cast-iron block used previously. The block's cylinder bores are coated with an iron and iron oxide composite that is applied with Plasma Transferred Wire Arc (PTWA) technology, which was developed jointly by Ford and Flamespray Industries (www.flame-spray.com). The developers of PTWA received the IPO 2009 National Inventor of the Year award. The coating allows for the replacement of traditional cast-iron cylinder liners and marks Ford's first use of this process. Between this and the use of lighter-weight aluminum for the engine block, the new block is 102lbs lighter than the previous cast-iron version, contributing to a reduction in the overall weight of the GT500 compared to the 2010 model. Thanks to the new liner coating, which has friction-reducing characteristics, and a revised exhaust, horsepower production from the 5.4L V8 has increased slightly for a total of @6200rpm. The combination of the lighter engine, EPAS, and aerodynamic enhancements result in an improvement in fuel efficiency for the 2011 GT500 relative to the 2010 model that eliminates the car's <b>gas</b> <b>guzzler</b> tax.|$|E
500|$|In January 1989, the LS 400 {{made its}} debut as a 1990 model at the North American International Auto Show, in Detroit, Michigan. U.S. sales began in September 1989, {{followed}} by limited exports to Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The LS 400's new 4.0-liter 1UZ-FE 32-valve V8 engine, capable of [...] and [...] of torque, was linked to a new four-speed automatic transmission with ECT-i electronically controlled shifts, super-flow torque converter and rear differential. The chassis used an independent, double-wishbone suspension setup, and a passive air suspension system was optional. The LS 400's 0– time was 8.5seconds, and its top speed was [...] Compared to the rival target BMW 735i (E32) and Mercedes-Benz 420 SE (W126), the LS 400 had a quieter cabin, with 58 dB at a higher top speed; a lower drag coefficient and curb weight; and it avoided the U.S. <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax. At its introduction in 1989, it won the Car of the Year Japan award.|$|E
50|$|Grand Ville enjoyed {{moderate}} success from 1971 to 1973. However, the {{oil crisis}} of late 1973 and early 1974 led to gasoline shortages, long lines at filling stations, and skyrocketing pump prices. These factors would sharply cut into full-sized car sales in 1974 as Americans were shunning big <b>gas</b> <b>guzzlers</b> {{in favor of}} smaller more fuel-efficient cars. For 1975, the Grand Ville became the Grand Ville Brougham and included more standard equipment than in previous years, such as power windows and a carpeted trunk. This would be the final year for the Grand Ville series, which also included Pontiac's last convertible until 1983. For 1976, the Grand Ville nameplate was dropped and the lineup was renamed Bonneville Brougham, returning that nameplate back to its former flagship status.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{accepted}} {{theory is}} that La Mancha Negra {{was the result of}} countless leaky, old cars spraying their fluids over the roadway. Professor Giannetto, a commissioner of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, believed that La Mancha Negra was an accumulation of dust on the roads and oil released from cars that formed a paste on the roads. In 1996, The Wall Street Journal reported that due to the cheap gasoline prices in the country, Venezuelans would drive dated <b>gas</b> <b>guzzlers,</b> stating [...] "Locals call the highway 'la mancha negra,' or the black stain, because it literally shines with the oil drippings of thousands of big cars that labor up an incline into the city each day. Water-tank trucks periodically spray down the road in vain attempts to wash away some of the oil slick that causes hundreds of accidents a year".|$|R
500|$|In the {{following}} episode of The Chaser's War on Everything, the team emphasised that their only realistic attempt {{to disguise the}} vehicles {{was the use of}} a Canadian flag. Taylor later said that there was [...] "no particular reason we chose Canada, we just thought they'd be a country who the cops wouldn't scrutinise too closely, and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade—as opposed to the 20 or so <b>gas</b> <b>guzzlers</b> that Bush has brought with him". There were many deliberate indications that the motorcade was not genuine, particularly on the fake credentials used by the team; members' security passes were printed with JOKE, Insecurity, and It's pretty obvious this isn't a real pass all clearly visible, while the APEC 2007 Official Vehicle stickers included both the name of the series and the text This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him. In addition, some of the runners were holding camcorders and one of the motorcyclists was wearing jeans, both highly unusual for an official motorcade.|$|R
2500|$|Much {{like the}} 2011 V6 and GT Mustangs, the 2011 Shelby GT500 got an engine update with an all-new 5.4L {{aluminum}} engine which was 102 pounds {{lighter than the}} previous cast-iron engine and uses Ford-patented plasma-coating technology (Plasma transferred wire arc). The inventors of PTWA received the 2009 IPO National Inventor of the Year award. This technology was initially patented and developed by inventors from Flame-Spray. The technology was subsequently improved upon by Ford and Flamespray. With the engine updates, not only has performance improved to [...] and [...] of torque, but the GT500's gas mileage has improved to [...] city and [...] highway, which was enough to eliminate the U.S. <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax. The final production number of the 2011 Shelby GT500 {{by the end of}} the year was 5100 units.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there are}} {{different}} types of fuel that may power cars, most rely on gasoline or diesel. The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the average vehicle emits 8,887 grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline. The average vehicle running on diesel fuel will emit 10,180 grams of carbon dioxide. Many governments are using fiscal policies (such as road tax or the US <b>gas</b> <b>guzzler</b> tax) to influence vehicle purchase decisions, with a low [...] figure often resulting in reduced taxation. Fuel taxes may act as an incentive {{for the production of}} more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g. hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels. High fuel taxes may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, or to not drive. On average, today's cars are about 75 percent recyclable, and using recycled steel helps reduce energy use and pollution. In the United States Congress, federally mandated fuel efficiency standards have been debated regularly, passenger car standards have not risen above the [...] standard set in 1985. Light truck standards have changed more frequently, and were set at [...] in 2007.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{originally}} {{came into}} {{use in the}} US when congress established <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax provisions in the Energy Tax Act of 1978 to discourage the production and purchase of fuel-inefficient vehicles. The <b>gas</b> <b>guzzler</b> tax had applied only to cars (not trucks) and was collected by the IRS.

50|$|Critics of the <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax {{contend that}} the {{increased}} fuel economy of the US passenger car fleet observed since 1978 {{must be considered in}} the context of the increased market share of mid-size and full-size SUVs. Many consumers' stated reasons for SUV purchase (comfort, interior room, and a perception of safety based on the vehicle's size) also apply to the now-obsolete American full-size car as produced from the 1920s through the 70s; critics {{contend that the}} dominance of the modern SUV is a direct result of the <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax.|$|E
50|$|The U.S {{government}} {{introduced the}} <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax {{as a part}} of the Energy Tax Act. The tax was introduced to tax the purchase of inefficient vehicles at the same time that Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were introduced. The <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax applies only to vehicles classified as cars, as opposed to light trucks. Since 1991, cars with a combined fuel economy rating under 22.5 mpg have been subject to the tax. Light trucks, which includes virtually all sport-utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans, are not subject to the tax.|$|E

5000|$|The S430, {{the only}} United States market S-Class {{available}} {{with both a}} short wheelbase ('03-'06) {{as well as a}} long wheelbase, was that region's most popular model and powered by a 4.3L [...] V8 that avoided the federal government's <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax of $1000. The S500 was powered by a 5.0L [...] V8.|$|E
50|$|The Act {{also created}} the <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax which {{applies to the}} sales of {{vehicles}} with official EPA-estimated gas mileage below certain specified levels. In 1980, the tax was $200 for a fuel efficiency of 14 to 15 miles per gallon, and was increased to $1800 in 1985. In 1980, the tax was $550 for fuel efficiencies of 13 mpg and below, and was changed in 1986 to $3,850 for ratings below 12.5 mpg. The <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax only applies to passenger cars. Trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUV), and minivans are not covered because these vehicle types were not widely available in 1978 and were rarely used for non-commercial purposes. The tax is collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and normally paid by the manufacturer or importer. The following chart shows the tax for various levels of MPG as of 2006.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most of the}} V8-engined contemporaries, {{all models}} of the Panamera avoid the US <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax. The V6-powered Panamera was also praised, as its smaller engine still {{retained}} respectable acceleration, and as it had even better handling than its V8 siblings, due to the engine being lighter by 100 lb which gave the car better weight distribution.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common policy}} {{instrument}} used by governments to influence market behavior is taxation. In {{the case of}} mobile source air pollution, the United States government has established many different taxes to limit emissions from various mobile sources. Perhaps {{one of the most}} well known is the <b>gas</b> <b>guzzler</b> tax, established by the Energy Tax Act of 1978. The act set minimum fuel economy standards for all new cars sold in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>guzzler</b> tax creates {{incentive}} {{to meet the}} minimum MPG requirement by manufacturer. Due to elimination of vehicles that are below minimum MPG which is 22.5 MPG, vehicle sales have decreased approximately 0.5 percent. However, sales revenues increase by a greater amount due to the added value in vehicles making greater use of fuel economy technology. Currently, the additional cost of efficient hybrid systems can range from $2,000-$10,000 on the vehicle sticker price.|$|E

50|$|GM {{initiated}} the Northstar's design ca. 1984 at Oldsmobile R&D {{in anticipation of}} the advanced dual overhead cam V8 engines to be introduced by European and Japanese competitors later in the decade. At that time, Cadillac was using the aluminum HT Overhead Valve (OHV) V8 which GM pushed hastily into production because the CAFE standards for 1982 would not allow {{for the use of the}} V8-6-4 of 1981. At the time it was GM's corporate policy not to pass the <b>gas</b> <b>guzzler</b> tax on to the consumer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gas</b> <b>Guzzler</b> Tax {{led to the}} {{successive}} downsizing of most major American passenger autos, and {{the combination of the}} tax and late-70's/early-80's economic woes effectively killed the American full-size car as it had been known up to that point. Coincidentally, it only took one product cycle before the first modern SUVs were introduced, the Cherokee XJ and the S-10 Blazer (in 1984). By the time Ford introduced the Explorer, the SUV had become the common man's luxury vehicle and Ford capitalized on this using extensive cross-marketing, most notably with Northwest clothier Eddie Bauer.|$|E
5000|$|The 2004 Cobra was a {{carryover}} of the 2003 Cobra {{but with}} a few minor updates, including a slightly updated exhaust system and rumors of a 20+ horsepower increase over the 2003 model. The addition of a newly integrated shift light negated the $1,000 <b>gas</b> <b>guzzler</b> tax that was charged on the 2003 models. One notable new option across the entire Ford lineup was the available Sirius satellite radio; the distinguishing feature between the 2003 and 2004 factory sound systems was the [...] "SAT" [...] button on the 2004 system.|$|E

50|$|The {{combined}} fleet {{fuel economy}} for an auto manufacturer {{of cars and}} trucks with a GVWR of 10,000 lbs or less will have to average 35.5 mpg. The average for its cars {{will have to be}} 42 mpg, and for its trucks will be 26 mpg by 2016, all based upon CAFE Standards. If the average fuel economy of a manufacturer's annual fleet of vehicle production falls below the defined standard, the manufacturer must pay a penalty, currently $5.50 USD per 0.1 mpg under the standard, multiplied by the manufacturer's total production for the U.S. domestic market.
