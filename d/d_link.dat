40|$|One of the much-debated novel {{features}} of theories with extra dimensions {{is the presence}} of power-like loop corrections to gauge coupling unification, which have the potential of allowing a significant reduction of the unification scale. A recognized problem of such scenarios is the UV sensitivity of the above power corrections. We consider situations where the grand unified group is broken by the vacuum expectation value of a bulk field and find that, because of the softness of this extra-dimensional symmetry breaking mechanism, power-like threshold corrections are calculable and generic in many of the most relevant settings. While the precision is limited by the presence of higher-dimension bulk operators, the most dangerous of these operators are naturally forbidden by symmetries of the bulk theory. Particularly interesting and constrained scenarios arise in the context of higher-dimensional supersymmetry.

30|$|Although lots of {{advantages}} can {{be taken}} by D 2 D communication, it also faces a rigorous challenge—the inter-channel interference [15]. To reduced ICI from the D 2 D links, interference management and coordination is important for physical-layer designs, e.g., power control and resource allocation. Great efforts to tackle the interference problem {{have been made in}} [16 – 18]. For traditional D 2 D communication systems, many power allocation strategies have presented to improve the performance of cellular link or D 2 <b>D</b> <b>link.</b> For example, in [12], a joint power allocation scheme was proposed which maximizes the sum-rate of D 2 <b>D</b> <b>link</b> and cellular link. The authors in [13] have also given an interference-aware channel allocation scheme based on Hungarian algorithm to maximize the number of permitted D 2 D communication pairs. In order to effectively guarantee the cellular service, Yu et al.

We prove that for T= 1, the gDoF is zero for MIMO channels with arbitrary link strength distributions, extending the result for MIMO with i. i. <b>d</b> <b>links.</b> We then show that selecting the statistically best antenna is gDoF-optimal for both Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) and Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) channels. We also derive the gDoF for the 2 × 2 MIMO channel with different exponents in the direct and cross links. In this setting, we show that it is always necessary to use both antennas to achieve the optimal gDoF, {{in contrast to the}} results for 2 × 2 MIMO with identical link distributions...|$|R

This report studies measurements of a mobile broadband module energy usage due to data transfer. It is found that switch- ing between technologies is still beneficial and savings are very feasible when using technologies with different traits if done correctly. Further the possibility of energy savings within a single high-bandwidth technology (3 G) are assessed considering variations on response time and throughput. This is relevant as the need to handle highly dynamic loads {{becomes more and more}} important in the modern connectivity landscape.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of pollution on seabed bacterial diversity, structure and activity in the Port of Livorno. Samples of seabed sediments taken from ﬁve selected sites within the port were subjected to chemical analyses, enzymatic activity detection, bacterial count and biomolecular analysis. Five different statistics were used to correlate the level of contamination with the detected biological indica- tors. The results showed that the port is mainly contaminated by variable levels of petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals, which affect the structure and activity of the bacterial population. Irrespective of pollution levels, the bacterial diversity did not diverge signiﬁcantly among the assessed sites and samples, and no dom- inance was observed. The type of impact of hydrocarbons and heavy metals was controversial, thus enforcing the supposition that the structure of the bacterial community is mainly driven by the levels of nutrients.

The objective of our SIR-aware opportunistic access scheme is to provide sufficient coverage probability and to increase the aggregate rate of D 2 D links by harnessing interference caused by dense underlaid D 2 D users using an adaptive decision activation threshold. We determine the optimum D 2 D activation probability and threshold, building on analytical expressions for the coverage probabilities and area spectral efficiency of D 2 D links derived using stochastic geometry. Specifically, we provide two expressions for the optimal SIR threshold, which can be applied in a decentralized way on each D 2 <b>D</b> <b>link,</b> so as to maximize the D 2 D area spectral efficiency derived using the unconditional and conditional D 2 D success probability respectively. Simulation results in different network settings show the performance gains of both SIR-aware threshold scheduling methods in terms of D 2 <b>D</b> <b>link</b> coverage probability, area spectral efficiency, and average sum rate compared to existing channel-aware access schemes.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a novel monitoring trail (m-trail) allocation method for achieving local unam-biguous failure localization under the monitoring burst (m-burst) framework, {{in which a}} single monitoring node (MN) can localize any multi-link failure with up to <b>d</b> <b>links</b> in a <b>d</b> 1 -connected network by inspecting the optical bursts traversing through it. Specifically, the proposed m-trail allocation method ensures that any healthy link is traversed {{by at least one}} uninterrupted m-trail during a multi-link failure, which can be achieved by launching no more than d 1 link-disjoint m-trails per link originat-ing from the MN. Based on such a sufficient condition, we study the performance of the m-burst framework by solving an integer linear program (ILP) and a novel heuristic, and implement the method for up to three link failures. To avoid high computation complexity in solving the ILP, a heuristic algorithm is developed for deriving d 1 link-disjoint m-trails between the MN and each link of the network. Numerical results show that the pro-posed methods yield significantly better performance than previous methods in the reference backbone network topologies.
