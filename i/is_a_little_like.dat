500|$|Day of the Tentacle was a {{moderate}} commercial success; according to Schafer, it sold around 80,000 copies upon release. The game was critically acclaimed. Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World wrote in September 1993, [...] "Calling Day of the Tentacle {{a sequel to}} Maniac Mansion [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> calling the space shuttle a sequel to the slingshot". He enjoyed the game's humor and interface, and praised the designers for removing [...] "dead end" [...] scenarios and player character death. Ardai lauded the voice acting, writing that it [...] "would have done the late Mel Blanc proud", and compared the game's humor, animation, and camera angles to [...] "Looney Toons [...] gems from the 40's and 50's". He concluded, [...] "I expect that this game will keep entertaining people {{for quite some time}} to come". In April 1994 the magazine said of the CD version that Sanders's Bernard was among [...] "many other inspired performances", concluding that [...] "Chuck Jones would be proud". Sandy Petersen of Dragon stated that its graphics [...] "are in a stupendous cartoony style", while praising its humor and describing its sound and music as [...] "excellent". Although the reviewer considered it [...] "one of the best" [...] graphic adventure games, he noted that, like LucasArts' earlier Loom, it was extremely short; he wrote that he [...] "felt cheated somehow when I finished the game". He ended the review, [...] "Go, Lucasfilm! Do this again, but do make the next game longer!".|$|E
2500|$|Berryman's Collected Poems--1937-1971 {{edited and}} {{introduced}} by Charles Thornbury, {{was published in}} 1989. However, Robert Giroux decided to leave out The Dream Songs from the collection. In his review of the Collected Poems, Edward Hirsch commented on this decision, stating, [...] "It is obviously practical to continue to publish the 385 dream songs separately, but reading the Collected Poems without them <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> eating a seven-course meal without a main course." [...] Hirsch also notes that, [...] " [...] a thorough nine-part introduction and a chronology as well as helpful appendixes that include Berryman's published prefaces, notes and dedications; a section of editor's notes, guidelines and procedures; and {{an account of the}} poems in their final stages of composition and publication." ...|$|E

Indeed, faults in Gilbert's libretto were likely as much to blame as any failings of McIntosh. The Observer wrote, [...] "It is a strange compound of trifling and tragedy, of gossamer and gnashings of teeth ... the effect <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> that of an act of Othello pieced into The Merry Wives of Windsor." [...] Rutland Barrington, in his 1911 memoir, wrote: [...] "I am inclined to attribute much of the failure of the opera to catch on to the fact that, owing to the entire absence of men's voices to balance the mass of soprani and alti, one's ears suffered from an unavoidable weariness, and a longing for the robust report of the male choristers; the humour of the play also seemed to me to have evaporated, to a great extent, with its conversion" [...] to a comic opera.|$|E

Modern botanists have misapplied the word to the leaf-stalk, which has no resemblance to a foot at all. We must keep the word to its proper meaning, and, when we want to write Latin, call it 'petiolus;' when we want to write English, call it 'stalk,' meaning always fruit or flower stalk. {131} ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Loch Awe {{was once}} a fertile valley, and it belonged to an old dame. She was called Dame Cruachan, {{the same as the}} hill, and she lived high up on the hillside. Now there was a well on the hillside, and she was always to cover up the well with a big stone before the sun set. But one day she had been working in the valley and she was weary, and she sat down by the path on her way home and fell asleep. And the sun had gone down before she reached the well, and in the night the water broke out and filled all the plain, and what was land is now water." [...] This, then, was the origin of Loch Awe. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> the Australian account of the Deluge. That {{calamity}} was produced by a man's showing a woman the mystic turndun, a native sacred toy.

He comes after me {{everywhere}} like a shadow, and there's nothing he won't do for me, even learning his lessons. You see the poor boy has {{a good deal of}} native sense, Brownlow sense, and mind had been more stifled than wanting in him. Nobody had ever put things to him by the right end, and when he once let me do it for him, it was quite a revelation, and he has been so happy and prosperous that he hardly knows himself. Poor boy, there is something very honest and true about him, and so affectionate! He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> his uncle, and I can't help being fond of him. Then Robin is just as devoted to Jock, though I can't say the results are so very desirable, for Jock is a monkey, I must confess, and it is irresistible to a monkey to have a bear that he can lead to do anything. I hear that Robin used to be the good boy of the establishment, and I am afraid he is not that now." ...|$|E

60|$|Immediately {{above this}} little garden, overshadowing and almost {{overhanging}} it, is a gorgeous gilded building with golden domes and minarets glittering in the sun, and filling a splendid situation with almost shameless splendour; the Russian church {{built over the}} upper part of the garden, belonging to the Orthodox-Greeks. Here again many Western travellers will be troubled; and will think that golden building much too like a fairy palace in a pantomime. But here again I shall differ from them, though perhaps less strongly. It may be that the pleasure is childish rather than childlike; but I can imagine a child clapping his hands at the mere sight of those great domes like bubbles of gold against the blue sky. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> Aladdin's Palace, but it has a place in art as Aladdin has a place in literature; especially since it is oriental literature. Those wise missionaries in China who were not afraid to depict the Twelve Apostles in the costume of Chinamen might have built such a church in a land of glittering mosques. And as it is said that the Russian has in him something of the child and something of the oriental, such a style may be quite sincere, and have even a certain simplicity in its splendour. It is genuine of its kind; it was built for those who like it; and those who do not like it can look at something else. This sort of thing may be called tawdry, but it is not what I call meretricious. What I call really meretricious can be found yet higher on the hill; towering to the sky and dominating all the valleys.|$|E

6000|$|But {{whether the}} Shavian Cæsar {{is a sound}} ideal or no, {{there can be little}} doubt that he is a very fine reality. Shaw has done nothing greater as a piece of artistic creation. If the man <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>like</b> a statue, it is a statue by a great sculptor; a statue of the best period. If his nobility is a little {{negative}} in its character, it is the negative darkness of the great dome of night; not as in some [...] "new moralities" [...] the mere mystery of the coal-hole. Indeed, this somewhat austere method of work is very suitable to Shaw when he is serious. There is nothing Gothic about his real genius; he could not build a mediæval cathedral in which laughter and terror are twisted together in stone, molten by mystical passion. He can build, by way of amusement, a Chinese pagoda; but when he is in earnest, only a Roman temple. He has a keen eye for truth; but he is one of those people who like, as the saying goes, to put down the truth in black and white. He is always girding and jeering at romantics and idealists because they will not put down the truth in black and white. But black and white are not the only two colours in the world. The modern man of science who writes down a fact in black and white is not more but less accurate than the mediæval monk who wrote it down in gold and scarlet, sea-green and turquoise. Nevertheless, it is a good thing that the more austere method should exist separately, and that some men should be specially good at it. Bernard Shaw is specially good at it; he is pre-eminently a black and white artist.|$|E
