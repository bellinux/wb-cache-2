5|$|Wyatt Earp felt {{he could}} not rely on civil justice, and decided {{to take matters into}} his own hands. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the only way to deal with Morgan's assassins was to kill them all.|$|E
5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further refute the principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Sirius {{became the}} first star to have its {{velocity}} measured, {{the beginning of the}} study of celestial radial velocities. Sir William Huggins examined the spectrum of the star and observed a red shift. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40km/s. Compared to the modern value of −5.5km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus means it is approaching the Sun.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Vyacheslav Nikonov {{was charged}} by the Russian {{government}} with investigating Wallenberg's fate. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Wallenberg died in 1947, executed while a prisoner in Lubyanka. He {{may have been a}} victim of the C-2 poison (carbylamine-choline-chloride) tested at the poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Rodney Gomes {{modelled}} {{the orbits}} of 92 Kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the simplest explanation was the gravitational pull of a distant planetary companion, such as a Neptune-sized object at 1500 AU or a Mars-sized object at around 53 AU.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, 1861, Johnson wrote Confederate {{president}} Jefferson Davis {{to request}} Kentucky's {{admission to the}} Confederacy. Though Davis had some reservation about the circumvention of the elected General Assembly in forming the Confederate government, <b>he</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Johnson's request had merit. Kentucky {{was admitted to the}} Confederacy on December 10, 1861.|$|E

5|$|The Fritz Pollard Alliance, a {{non-profit}} organization closely allied with the NFL on civil rights issues, announced its support of a name change in 2015 after repeated attempts {{to discuss the issue}} with the team owner and representatives. An attorney for the Alliance, N. Jeremi Duru, an American University law professor, made a study of the controversy in which <b>he</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Native Americans are justified in finding the name offensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} in Austria only ceased when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria sent her personal physician, Gerard van Swieten, {{to investigate the}} claims of vampiric entities. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies, sounding {{the end of the}} vampire epidemics. Other European countries followed suit. Despite this condemnation, the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local superstition.|$|E

5|$|The {{sex of the}} {{different}} size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males.|$|E
5|$|Upon reading Pike's journal, Hill became {{convinced}} that the Kansas site could not be the correct one. To him, the local topography {{did not appear to}} match that described by Pike; and when he attempted to retrace Pike's route, <b>he</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the actual village site must be some distance northwest of the Kansas monument.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E

5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, <b>he</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} an {{audience}} with the Electress Palatine in December 1711. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the Electress's succession brought no quandary, but added that he must succeed her. Cosimo and herself were abhorred by his reply. Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote to Florence agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to the enemies of the House of Austria. At {{the culmination of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession. An inaction he would later grow to lament.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{accepting}} that Soult would not arrive, Ney could {{not hope to}} hold his position, much less push the Austrians back. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> he must fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, he instructed Walther and his cavalry to establish {{a position on the}} Töss, above the bridge at Stieg. From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.|$|E

5|$|He claimed similar phallic {{triplets}} {{for several}} other texts. However, {{in the majority}} of texts glyph 76 is not common, and Fischer proposed that these were a later, more developed stage of the script, where the creation chants had been abbreviated to X Y Z and omit the phallus. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> 85% of the rongorongo corpus consisted of such creation chants, and that {{it was only a matter}} of time before rongorongo would be fully deciphered.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 the Norwegian {{pathologist}} Leiv Kreyberg {{was allowed}} to examine one of Reich's bion preparations under a microscope. Kreyberg wrote that the broth Reich had used as his culture medium was indeed sterile, but that the bacteria were ordinary staphylococci. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Reich's control measures to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of basic bacteriological and anatomical facts, while Reich accused Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under magnification.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{almost half}} of the Tories' {{campaign}} funds were spent in Quebec, a province in which the party won only four of seventy-five seats. After the 1953 election, Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the Progressive Conservatives were ill-advised to continue pouring money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province; the Tories could win at least a minority government by maximizing their opportunities in English-speaking Canada, and if the party could also manage to win twenty seats in Quebec, it could attain a majority. Churchill's conclusions were ignored by most leading Tories—except Diefenbaker.|$|E
