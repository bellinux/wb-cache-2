500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1842, two LDS missionaries, {{one of whom was}} Charles Wesley Wandell, were preaching in the area. Although {{forbidden}} by her Presbyterian preacher, James recorded that she [...] "had a desire to hear them. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel." [...] James was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the following Sunday, and later acquainted many friends and family members with her new beliefs as well. A year later, James and eight other members of her family, including her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law- decided to move from their home in Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois, in order to live among other members of their new faith. The group of nine began their journey with other Latter Day Saints under the direction of Wandell, but got separated from the group at Buffalo, New York when they couldn't afford to pay the train fare from New York to Ohio. James and her family traveled the remainder of their journey (approximately 800 miles) on foot. In her Life Sketch, recorded in 1893, James recalled that [...] "We walked until our shoes were worn out, and our feet became sore and cracked open and bled until you could see the whole print of our feet with blood on the ground." [...] When James and her family arrived in Nauvoo, they were welcomed by Joseph Smith himself. Over the next year, her mother and siblings would establish their own homes. James, however, lived with the Joseph Smith family in Nauvoo until Smith's assassination in 1846.|$|E

60|$|This one rung was {{the height}} I {{climbed up the}} {{business}} ladder. One night <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> raid amongst the Chinese fishermen. Ropes and nets were worth dollars and cents. It was robbery, I grant, but it was precisely the spirit of capitalism. The capitalist takes away the possessions of his fellow-creatures {{by means of a}} rebate, or of a betrayal of trust, or by the purchase of senators and supreme-court judges. I was merely crude. That was the only difference. I used a gun.|$|E

6000|$|One day I {{walked past}} Miss Bates's little sanctum Remingtorium, and {{saw in her}} place a black-haired unit--unmistakably a person--pounding with each of her forefingers upon the keys.

The hour for closing had come; but she asked me in to sit for a few minutes in the dictation chair. Miss Bates explained her absence from and return to the Acropolis Hotel in words identical with or similar to these following: ...|$|E

Well, I kept tryin' the minin' game off and on, prospectin' here and there, and finally I got into this leasin' business, and two years ago I secured a lease on the 'Red Cent' and struck it good and plenty.

60|$|Alexander Abraham said {{something}} that I prudently did not hear.

When a man had to live in such surroundings the wonder was, not that he hated women, but that he didn't hate the whole human race.|$|R

Years ago, after you and your mother had gone to England, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> big game shooting expedition into the interior. My companion was an old fellow called Tom Jackson, a rolling stone, {{and one of the}} best elephant hunters in Africa. We did pretty well, but the end of it was that we separated north of the Transvaal, I bringing down the ivory that we had shot, and traded, and Tom stopping to put in another season, the arrangement being that he was to join me afterwards, and take his share of the money. I came here and bought this farm from a Boer who was tired of it--cheap enough, too, for I only gave him £100 for the 6,000 acres. The kitchens behind were his old house, for I built a new one.|$|E

How I will not tell you, my boy, but <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fruit boat from Havre to Southampton, and from there down to Thorpe. I saw the old man Stephen Hurd. It was on a Sunday night that I arrived, and I found him alone. He was as hard, Jean, as his letters. When I pressed him he ordered {{me out of the}} house. I would not go. I said that I would see my daughter-in-law. I would remain until I saw her, I said, even if I slept under a hedge. Again he ordered me out of the house. I was firm; I refused. Then he struck me, there was a quarrel, and he fell. I thought at first that he was unconscious, but when I {{examined}} him--he was dead." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few weeks}} later there was another eider, a big drake, in the same pond, {{behaving}} in the same queer way.

Thoroughly curious now, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> still hunt after the stranger, and after much difficulty succeeded in shooting him from the end of a bushy point. The only unusual thing about him was that a large mussel, such as grow on the rocks in salt water, had closed his shells firmly on the bird's tongue {{in such a way that}} he could neither be crushed by the bird's bill nor scratched off by the bird's foot. I pulled the mussel off, put it in my pocket, and went home more mystified than before.|$|E

60|$|In this tedious manner I {{had gone}} on for some time, before {{it struck me that}} the noise of the sea was {{altering}} completely to my sense of hearing. It seemed to be sounding very strangely on each side of me--both on my right hand and on my left. I stopped and strained my eyes to look through the mist, but it was useless. Crags only a few yards off, seemed like shadows in the thick white vapour. Again, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> little; and, ere long, I heard rolling towards me, as it were, under my own feet, and under the roaring of the sea, a howling, hollow, intermittent sound--like thunder at a distance. I stopped again, and rested against a rock. After some time, the mist began to part to seaward, but remained still as thick as ever on each side of me. I went on towards the lighter sky in front--the thunder-sound booming louder and louder, in the very heart, as it seemed, of the great cliff.|$|E
6000|$|From this {{sadness in}} Bath I {{went to a}} greater in Wells, where I had not been for ten years, and timing my visit so as to have a Sunday service at the cathedral of {{beautiful}} memories, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Saturday to Shepton Mallet. A small, squalid town, a [...] "manufacturing town" [...] the guide-book calls it. Well, yes; it manufactures Anglo-Bavarian beer in a gigantic brewery which looks bigger {{than all the other}} buildings together, the church and a dozen or twenty public-houses included. To get some food I went to the only eating-house in the place, and saw a pleasant-looking woman, plump and high-coloured, with black hair, with an expression of good humour and goodness of every description in her comely countenance. She promised to have a chop ready by the time I had finished looking at the church, and I said I would have it with a small Guinness. She could not provide that, the house, she said, was strictly temperance. [...] "My doctor has ordered me to take it," [...] said I, [...] "and if you are religious, remember that St. Paul tells us to take a little stout when we find it beneficial." ...|$|E
60|$|Monday, October 10th.--A long while, indeed, {{since my}} last date. But the weather has been {{generally}} sunny and pleasant, though often very cold; and I cannot endure to waste anything so precious as autumnal sunshine by {{staying in the}} house. So I have spent almost all the daylight hours in the open air. My chief amusement has been boating {{up and down the}} river. A week or two ago (September 27 and 28) <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pedestrian excursion with Mr. Emerson, and was gone two days and one night, it being the first and only night that I have spent away from home. We were that night at the village of Harvard, and the next morning walked three miles farther, to the Shaker village, where we breakfasted. Mr. Emerson had a theological discussion with two of the Shaker brethren; but the particulars of it have faded from my memory; and all the other adventures of the tour have now so lost their freshness that I cannot adequately recall them. Wherefore let them rest untold. I recollect nothing so well as the aspect of some fringed gentians, which we saw growing by the roadside, and which were so beautiful that I longed to turn back and pluck them. After an arduous journey, we arrived safe home in the afternoon of the second day,--the first time that I ever came home in my life; for I never had a home before. On Saturday of the same week, my friend D. R------ came to see us, and stayed till Tuesday morning. On Wednesday there was a cattleshow in the village, of which I would give a description, if it had possessed any picturesque points. The foregoing are the chief outward events of our life.|$|E
