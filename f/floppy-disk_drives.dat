5000|$|To upgrade an Eagle III, for instance, {{the user}} {{could buy a}} File 40, connect it to the [...] "Parallel B" [...] port {{on the back of}} the Eagle with the ribbon cable that came with it, turn on the File 40, and turn on the Eagle. If a File 10 or File 40 was {{attached}} and turned on when an Eagle I, II, or III was turned on, the computer booted from the hard disk in the external box, even if a bootable floppy disk was in a <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The company {{demonstrated}} a prototype at the January 1984 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago with {{an attempt to}} get investors on board. Reporters saw it perform the Boing Ball demo with stereo sound. The Sage acted as the CPU, and BYTE described [...] "big steel boxes" [...] substituting for the chipset that did not yet exist. The magazine reported in April 1984 that Amiga Corporation [...] "is developing a 68000-based home computer with a custom graphics processor. With 128K bytes of RAM and a <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drive,</b> the computer will reportedly sell for less than $1000 late this year." ...|$|R
5000|$|BYTE had {{reported}} in April 1984 that Amiga [...] "is developing a 68000-based home {{computer with a}} custom graphics processor. With 128K bytes of RAM and a <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drive,</b> the computer will reportedly sell for less than $1000 late this year". It turned out that Amiga was supposed to deliver the Amiga chipset to Atari Inc. on June 30, 1984 or forfeit {{the company and its}} technology. With the deadline fast approaching and still not having enough funds to finish development, the Amiga crew went on alert after having heard rumors that Tramiel was in closed negotiations to complete the purchase of Atari in several days. Remembering Tramiel's visit that Spring during their investor campaign, they began scrambling for another large investor. So, at around the same time that Tramiel was in negotiations with Atari, Amiga wound up entering into discussions with Commodore. The discussions ultimately led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga outright, which would (from Commodore's viewpoint) cancel any outstanding contracts â€” including the contract given to the now defunct Atari Inc. So instead of Amiga delivering the chipset to Atari, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 to Atari Corp. on Amiga's behalf (right about the time they were discovering the contract), in effect returning the funds invested into Amiga for completion of the Lorraine chipset.|$|R
5000|$|The Eagle V BIOS {{supported}} 2 double-sided <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drives</b> and 4 hard-disk partitions. It {{was used}} by the Eagle IV and V.|$|E
5000|$|When half-height <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drives</b> {{and hard}} disks became available, Eagle drives that had worn out could be {{replaced}} with ones that took up less space and drew less power. The Eagle BIOS supported up to two double-sided <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drives</b> and up to four 8 MB hard-disk partitions. Systems could be built with two half-height floppies and a 10, 20, or 32 MB hard disk. (A system with two floppies and a 10 MB hard disk was jokingly called a [...] "IV plus", while one with a 20 MB hard disk was called a [...] "4 and a half" [...] however many floppies it had.) ...|$|E
50|$|An Eagle III with a File 10 {{attached}} had {{the same}} hard-disk storage as an Eagle IV, but two <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drives</b> instead of one. Similarly, with a File 40 attached, it was functionally the same as an Eagle V with an extra floppy-disk drive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{revision}} of the A1200 manufactured by Escom was fitted with PC-based [...] "high-density" [...] <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drives</b> that had been downgraded to double-density drives. This resulted in some software incompatibility (PC-style drives do not supply a [...] "ready" [...] signal, which signals {{if there is a}} floppy in the disk drive.) Escom released a free circuit upgrade to correct this issue.|$|E

The only {{difference}} between an Eagle I and an Eagle II, for instance, {{was the number of}} <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drives.</b> By adding the right drives, and a hard disk, SASI card, and extra power supply, a I could be upgraded to a II, III, IV, or V; a III could become a IV or V; a IV could become a V.|$|E
50|$|After Adam Osborne {{sold his}} {{computer}} book-publishing company to McGraw-Hill in 1979, {{he decided to}} sell an inexpensive portable computer with bundled software and hired Lee Felsenstein to design it. The resulting Osborne 1 featured a 5 inch (127 mm) 52-column display, two <b>floppy-disk</b> <b>drives,</b> a Z80 microprocessor, 64 KB of RAM, and could fit under an airplane seat. It could survive being accidentally dropped and included a bundled software package that included the CP/M operating system, the BASIC programming language, the WordStar word processing package, and the SuperCalc spreadsheet program. Osborne obtained the software in part by offering stock in the new Osborne Computer Corporation, which he founded in January 1981. For example, MicroPro International received 75,000 shares and $4.60 for each copy of WordStar Osborne distributed with his computers.|$|E
