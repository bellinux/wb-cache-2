25|$|The {{importance}} of tool use by woodpecker finch species differs between vegetation zones. In the arid zone, where food is limited {{and hard to}} access, tool use is essential, especially during the dry season. Up to half of the finches' prey is acquired {{with the help of}} tools, making them even more routine tool users than chimpanzees. The tools allow them to extract large, nutritious insect larvae from tree holes, making tool use more profitable than other foraging techniques. In contrast, in the <b>humid</b> <b>zone,</b> woodpecker finches rarely use tools, since food availability is high and prey is more easily obtainable. Here, the time and energy costs of tool use would be too high.|$|E
