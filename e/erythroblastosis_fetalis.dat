5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. <b>Erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis</b> and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E

2500|$|Rh disease (also {{known as}} rhesus isoimmunisation, Rh (D) disease, rhesus incompatibility, rhesus disease, RhD {{hemolytic}} {{disease of the}} newborn, rhesus D hemolytic disease of the newborn or RhD HDN) {{is a type of}} hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). [...] The disease ranges from mild to severe, and typically occurs only in some second or subsequent pregnancies of Rh negative women where the fetus's father is Rh positive, leading to a Rh+ pregnancy. During birth, the mother may be exposed to the infant's blood, and this causes the development of antibodies, which may affect the health of subsequent Rh+ pregnancies. [...] In mild cases, the fetus may have mild anaemia with reticulocytosis. In moderate or severe cases the fetus may have a more marked anaemia and <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis</b> (hemolytic disease of the newborn).

5000|$|Bruce Chown, [...] (November 10, 1893 [...] - [...] July 3, 1986) was a Canadian {{scientist}} who researched the blood factor {{known as the}} Rhesus factor and helped produced a Rh immune vaccine, Rh gamma globulin, which helps to prevent <b>Erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The phenotypes Lu(a+b−) and Lu(a+b+) {{are found}} at various {{frequencies}} within populations. The Lu(a−b+) phenotype {{is the most}} common in all populations, whereas the Lu(a−b−) phenotype is extremely uncommon.

5000|$|Although {{the severe}} anemia of <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis</b> {{is usually the}} cause of death, many {{children}} who barely survive the anemia exhibit permanent mental impairment or damage to motor {{areas of the brain}} because of precipitation of bilirubin in the neuronal cells, causing destruction of many, a condition called kernicterus.|$|E
50|$|Hemolytic {{disease of}} the newborn, also known as {{hemolytic}} {{disease of the}} fetus and newborn, HDN, HDFN, or <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis,</b> is an alloimmune condition that develops in a fetus, when the IgG molecules (one of the five main types of antibodies) produced by the mother pass through the placenta. Among these antibodies are some which attack antigens on the red blood cells in the fetal circulation, breaking down and destroying the cells (hemolysis). The fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anemia. This fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure (hydrops fetalis) can occur. When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts (immature red blood cells) {{are present in the}} fetal blood, and so these forms of the disease can be called <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis</b> (or erythroblastosis foetalis).|$|E
50|$|Infant {{prematurity}} is {{the factor}} most {{commonly associated with}} pulmonary hemorrhage. Other associated factors are those that predispose to perinatal asphyxia or bleeding disorders, including toxemia of pregnancy, maternal cocaine use, <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis,</b> breech delivery, hypothermia, infection, Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), administration of exogenous surfactants (in some studies) and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).|$|E
50|$|Also, in {{conjunction}} with Philip Levine's separate work which helped identify the Rh factor as {{a major cause of}} <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis,</b> or Rh disease, he was able to help solve a major cause of infant fatality. In 1946, Dr. Wiener created the first medical procedure to combat the problem, which he called an exchange transfusion. It consisted of a complete blood transfusion for the affected baby. The method was further refined by Harry Wallerstein, a transfusionist.|$|E
50|$|Diamond set {{up one of}} {{the first}} {{pediatric}} hematology research centers in the United States at Children's. Focusing on anemias, by 1930 he had succeeded in identifying thalassemia, a hereditary anemia that affected children of Italian and Greek ancestry. In 1932, along with Blackfan, he identified <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis,</b> later called hemolytic disease of the newborn, at that time a significant disorder among newborns. He also discovered the blood diseases Gardner-Diamond syndrome, a painful bruising disorder, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects many different organs.|$|E
50|$|The {{hemolytic}} {{condition occurs}} {{when there is}} an incompatibility between the blood types of the mother and the fetus. There is also potential incompatibility if the mother is Rh negative and the father is positive. When any incompatibility is detected, the mother often receives an injection at 28 weeks gestation and at birth to avoid the development of antibodies toward the fetus. These terms do not indicate which specific antigen-antibody incompatibility is implicated. The disorder in the fetus due to Rh D incompatibility is known as <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Rh {{blood group}} system (including the Rh factor) {{is one of}} thirty-five known human blood group systems. It {{is the second most}} {{important}} blood group system, after ABO, and it consists of 50 defined blood-group antigens, among which the five antigens D, C, c, E, and e are the most important. The commonly used terms Rh factor, Rh positive and Rh negative refer to the D antigen only. Besides its role in blood transfusion, the D antigen, is used to determine the risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn (or <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis)</b> for Rh disease management.|$|E
50|$|William Pollack (February 26, 1926 - November 3, 2013) was a British-born American {{immunologist}} {{who developed}} the Rho(D) immune globulin vaccine against Rh disease, {{a leading cause of}} <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis.</b> Pollack co-developed the vaccine, also known by the RhoGAM brand name, which is given to pregnant women to prevent Rh disease, with Dr. Vincent Freda and Dr. John G. Gorman of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Pollack's vaccine, introduced in 1968, virtually eliminated cases of Rh disease in developed countries. Prior to the RhoGAM vaccine, Rh disease was responsible for approximately 10,000 infant deaths in the United States annually.|$|E
50|$|Many {{pregnant}} women carry a fetus with a blood type which {{is different from}} their own, {{which is not a}} problem. What can matter is whether the baby is RhD positive or negative. Mothers who are RhD- and carry a RhD+ baby can form antibodies against fetal RBCs. Sometimes these maternal antibodies are IgG, a small immunoglobulin, which can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis of fetal RBCs, which in turn can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn called <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis,</b> an illness of low fetal blood counts that ranges from mild to severe. Sometimes this is lethal for the fetus; in these cases it is called hydrops fetalis.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{difference}} in postoperative blood loss, future pregnancy outcomes, or major complications in intact D&E when compared to non-intact dilation and extraction. The risks of intact D&X {{are similar to the}} risks of non-intact D&E and include postoperative infection, hemorrhage, or uterine injury. In cases where the parent is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive, subsequent pregnancies have a risk of <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis</b> (hemolytic disease of the newborn) if Rho(D) immunoglobulin (RhoGam) is not administered. Overall, the complication rate is low, with rates of serious complications (those requiring blood transfusion, surgery, or hospital treatment) ranging from 0 per 1,000 cases to 2.94 per 1,000 cases. The rate of minor complications is approximately 50 in 1,000 (5%), the same as the minor complication rate for non-intact D&E; the rate of serious complications is higher in non-intact D&E.|$|E

40|$|As the {{incidence}} of <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis</b> is as high in rural as in urban areas, it behooves physicians in rural areas to anticipate the disease, to make special antepartum studies to determine the Rh status of obstetrical patients, and {{to be prepared to}} treat the affected baby if the aid of a specialist and special facilities are not obtainable...|$|E

40|$|The {{hemolytic}} {{manifestations of}} <b>erythroblastosis</b> <b>fetalis</b> {{have been shown}} by the studies of Levine (1) mad Wiener (2) {{to be due to}} transfer across the placenta of maternal isoantibodies that are specific for certain antigens, notably those of the Rh-Hr system, contained in the red blood cells of the fetus.
