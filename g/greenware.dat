During the seventeenth century, other new industries evolved: <b>greenware</b> pottery (a pottery, dating from 1873, still exists {{on the outskirts of}} the town), wool and cloth, the processing of wheat into flour, and eventually hops, a key ingredient of beer. The Anglican divine, Augustus Montague Toplady, composer of the hymn Rock of Ages (1763, at Blagston) was born in Farnham in 1740 - a plaque now marks the building on West Street where he was born.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and {{are about as}} strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, {{all the rest of the}} mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called <b>greenware.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After the {{surfaces}} are smoothed, the bowls and tanks are sprayed with glaze {{of various kinds}} to get different colors. This glaze is designed to shrink and contract {{at the same rate}} as the <b>greenware</b> while undergoing firing. After being sprayed with glaze, the toilet bowls, tanks, and lids are placed in stacks on a conveyor belt or [...] "car" [...] that slowly goes through a large kiln to be fired. The belt slowly moves the glaze-covered <b>greenware</b> into a tunnel kiln, which has different temperature zones inside it starting at about [...] at the front, increasing towards the middle to over [...] degrees and exiting around out [...] During the firing in the kiln, the <b>greenware</b> and glaze are vitrified as one solid finished unit.

2500|$|Yaozhou ware (...) {{is a type}} of celadon or <b>greenware</b> in Chinese pottery, {{which was}} at its height during the Northern Song dynasty. It is the largest and {{typically}} the best of the wares in the group of Northern Celadon wares. [...] It is especially famous for the rich effects achieved by decoration in shallow carving under a green celadon glaze which sinks into the depressions of the carving giving contrasts of light and dark shades.|$|E
2500|$|Longquan celadon (龍泉青瓷) {{is a type}} of green-glazed Chinese ceramic, {{known in}} the West as celadon or <b>greenware,</b> {{produced}} from about 950 to 1550. The kilns were mostly located in Lishui prefecture in southwestern Zhejiang Province in the south of China, and the north of Fujian Province. Overall a total of some 500 kilns have been discovered, making the Longquan celadon production area one of the largest historical ceramic producing areas in China. [...] "Longquan-type" [...] is increasingly preferred as a term, in recognition of this diversity, or simply [...] "southern celadon", as there was also a large number of kilns in north China producing Yaozhou ware or other Northern Celadon wares. These are similar in many respects, but with significant differences to Longquan-type celadon, and their production rose and declined somewhat earlier.|$|E

My eye, {{prepared}} {{to take in the}} range of a long, large, and whitewashed chamber, blinked baffled, on encountering the limited area of a small cabinet--a cabinet with seagreen walls; also, instead of five wide and naked windows, there was one high lattice, shaded with muslin festoons: instead of two dozen little stands of painted wood, each holding a basin and an ewer, there was a toilette-table dressed, like a lady for a ball, in a white robe over a pink skirt; a polished and large glass crowned, and a pretty pin-cushion frilled with lace, adorned it. This toilette, together with a small, low, green and white chintz arm-chair, a washstand topped with a marble slab, and supplied with utensils of pale <b>greenware,</b> sufficiently furnished the tiny chamber.|$|E

Korean <b>greenware</b> reached its zenith between the 12th and early 13th centuries, however, the Mongol invasions of Korea in the 13th century and persecution by the Joseon Dynasty government destroyed the craft.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Greenware</b> is {{software}} distributed {{under the}} condition that the user does something to help the environment.

50|$|Thai {{ceramics}} {{has its own}} {{tradition of}} <b>greenware</b> production. Medieval Thai wares were initially influenced by Chinese <b>greenware,</b> but went on to develop its own unique style and technique. One {{of the most famous}} kilns during the Sukhothai Kingdom were at S(r)i Satchanalai, around Si Satchanalai District and Sawankhalok District in Sukhothai Province, north-central Thailand. Production started in the 13th century CE and continued until the 16th century. The art reached its apex in the 14th century.|$|E
5000|$|Goryeo ware (고려도자기 Goryeo dojagi) {{refers to}} {{all types of}} Korean pottery and porcelains {{produced}} during the Goryeo dynasty. Goryeo most often however refers to celadon (<b>greenware).</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Greenware</b> {{refers to}} unfired objects. At {{sufficient}} moisture content, bodies {{at this stage}} are in their most plastic form (they are soft and malleable, and hence can be easily deformed by handling).|$|E
5000|$|The National Museum of Korea in Seoul houses {{important}} celadon {{works and}} national treasures. The Haegang Ceramics Museum and the Goryeo Celadon Museum are two regional museums {{that focus on}} Korean <b>greenware.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After that, the {{production}} of art pottery featured more prominently in the company's agenda, and Farnham <b>Greenware,</b> as it was known, established itself. A strong connection with Farnham School of Art was formed.|$|E
50|$|The Chinese {{fashion for}} <b>greenware,</b> or celadon, ware was also {{transmitted}} to the Islamic world, where it gave rise to productions using turquoise glazing and fish motifs identical to the ones used in China.|$|E
50|$|<b>Greenware</b> {{can also}} {{refer to a}} {{combination}} of computer hardware, software and services, which enables user to minimize the environmental impact of using the computer and lower TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) at the same time.|$|E
50|$|When slip {{is used to}} join {{two pieces}} of <b>greenware</b> together, it is {{generally}} used with a technique known as scratch and slip, whereby the contact points on both pieces are scored with multiple criss-crossing lines and slip painted on one piece over the scores.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese {{pronunciation}} of the Chinese characters for <b>greenware</b> is seiji (...) [...] It {{was introduced}} during the Song Dynasty (960-1270) from China and via Korea. Even though Japan has {{arguably the most}} diverse styles of ceramic art in the modern era, <b>greenware</b> was mostly avoided by potters {{because of the high}} loss rate of up to 80%. Kaolinite, the ceramic material usually used for the production of porcelain, also does not exist in large quantities like in China. One of the sources for kaolin in Japan is from Amakusa in Kyushu. Nevertheless a number of artists emerged whose works received critical acclaim in regards to the quality and colour of the glazes achieved, as well as later on in the innovation of modern design.|$|E
50|$|Fractures {{caused by}} thermal shock called dunting occur during the firing process and are {{witnessed}} in the bisqued ware stage. Dunting {{is a problem}} that commonly occurs during the cooling process of the firing cycle. Latent or dormant cracks which went unnoticed in <b>greenware</b> may appear in bisqued ware after firing.|$|E
5000|$|Outside of Asia {{a number}} of artists also worked with <b>greenware</b> to {{varying degrees of success}} in regards to purity and quality. One of the modern artists in Poland was Wanda Golakowska (1901-1975), whose works are part of the {{collection}} of the National Museum, Warsaw and National Museum, Kraków amongst others.|$|E
50|$|The {{clay body}} for the sprig is pushed into the mould, the back scraped flat, then {{released}} on a damp cloth pad. The <b>greenware</b> is wetted lightly with a brush, and the sprig is pressed lightly with another cloth pad to push out water and air. Slip {{may be used as}} an adhesive.|$|E
50|$|Pottery {{fracture}} {{results from}} stress within a ceramic body due to thermal expansion and contraction, shrinkage, and other forces. Poor drying or uneven compression and alignment of particles {{can result in}} low strength. Cracking may appear in <b>greenware</b> as well as each stage of the firing including bisque ware and glazed ware.|$|E
50|$|<b>Greenware</b> {{ceramics}} {{made from}} celadon {{had been made}} in the area since the 3rd-century Jin dynasty, but it returned to prominence - particularly in Longquan - during the Southern Song and Yuan. Longquan <b>greenware</b> is characterized by a thick unctuous glaze of a particular bluish-green tint over an otherwise undecorated light-grey porcellaneous body that is delicately potted. Yuan Longquan celadons feature a thinner, greener glaze on increasingly large vessels with decoration and shapes derived from Middle Eastern ceramic and metalwares. These were produced in large quantities for the Chinese export trade to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and (during the Ming) Europe. By the Ming, however, production was notably deficient in quality. It is in this period that the Longquan kilns declined, to be eventually replaced in popularity and ceramic production by the kilns of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi.|$|E
50|$|Chinese greenwares {{were very}} popular imports to Korea, and {{inspired}} local potters. Exceptional high-quality celadons were produced in Korea during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties. An inlaid <b>greenware</b> technique known as sanggam, where potters would engrave semi-dried pottery with designs and place {{black or white}} clay materials within the engraving, was invented in Korea during this time.|$|E
50|$|Celadon is a {{term for}} pottery {{denoting}} both wares glazed in the jade green celadon color, also known as <b>greenware</b> (the term specialists now tend to use) and a type of transparent glaze, often with small cracks, that was first used on <b>greenware,</b> but later used on other porcelains. Celadon originated in China, though the term is purely European, and notable kilns such as the Longquan kiln in Zhejiang province are renowned for their celadon glazes. Celadon production later spread to other regions in Asia, such as Japan, Korea and Thailand. Eventually European potteries produced some pieces, {{but it was never}} a major element there. Finer pieces are in porcelain, but both the color and the glaze can be produced in stoneware and earthenware. Most of the earlier Longquan celadon is on the border of stoneware and porcelain, meeting the Chinese but not the European definitions of porcelain.|$|E
50|$|From {{the middle}} of the 11th century to the 16th century, Japan {{imported}} much Chinese celadon <b>greenware,</b> white porcelain, and blue-and-white ware. Japan also imported Chinese pottery as well as Korean and Vietnamese ceramics. Such Chinese ceramics (Tenmoku) were regarded as sophisticated items, which the upper classes used in the tea ceremony. The Japanese also ordered custom-designed ceramics from Chinese kilns.|$|E
5000|$|After the molds are removed, workers use {{hand tools}} and sponges {{to smooth the}} edges and surface of the <b>greenware,</b> and to remove the mold joints or roughness: this process is called [...] "fettling". For large scale {{production}} pieces, these steps may be automated. The parts are then left outside or put in a warm room to dry, before going through a dryer at about , for about 20-36 hours.|$|E
