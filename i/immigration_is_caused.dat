40|$|The {{question}} of immigration of foreigners to the Czech territory is repeatedly opened topic of all {{generations of the}} 20 th and 21 st century. No matter whether the <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by economical, political or any other situation, it always has significant impact {{not only on the}} life of the immigrant himself but also on the life of the society which accepts him. In the text I further discuss the immigration of the Bulgarians. All the findings interpreted in this text are based on my own bachelor thesis in which I focused mainly on motives leading to immigration, integration of Bulgarians into the Czech society and the impact the process of migration has on the family relationships of the migrating individuals...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{immigration}} to the Czech Republic and its goal is to discover how big influence on <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by the wage gap between foreign countries and Czech Republic for the same work and if this determinant {{is the most important}} of this differential. Based on the results of the regression analysis I was able to confirm that wage is indeed an important determinant, namely to increase the gap between wages paid in the Czech Republic and foreigners in the country of origin by one percent, the number of immigrants increase by 0. 63 percent. Although salary is important, has not the greatest influence on number of immigrants, depending on the model. GDP has a greater impact, but that is correlated with wages. Result of this work is the finding that the biggest attraction for foreigners is higher living standard, which reflect both GDP and income...|$|E

50|$|However, between 1822 and {{the second}} half of the 19th century, with the {{abolition}} of slavery in the United States, many slaves (probably of different African origins) returned to Africa, settling in West Africa and founding Liberia (integrating regions populated already since before of arrived of Afro American). Thus, the Liberian migration in the United States not touched again until the 20th century. In this moment, the first Liberians that came to United States, settled in this country already in the first half of this century. However, in this moment, only several hundred of Liberians immigrated to the United States, a very small number compared with the people who emigrated from Europe, Asia and Latin America. Also in the 50's and 60 migrated hundreds of Liberian to the United States (232 and 569 respectively). It was not until the 1970s when there <b>was</b> a considerable <b>immigration</b> from Liberia, which amounted to 2.081 people. This low <b>immigration</b> <b>was</b> <b>caused,</b> probably because Liberia had one of the most stable democracies and prosperous economies in Africa up until the military coup happened in this country in 1980.|$|R
40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has {{the highest}} growth rate in net {{international}} migration in the world. The reasons for this migration are investigated in this paper. First, {{a survey of the}} literature on the profile and determinants of international migration in SSA is given. Second, panel data on 45 countries spanning the period 1965 to 2005 are used to determine that the main reasons for international migration from SSA are armed conflict and lack of job opportunities. An additional year of conflict will raise net out-migration by 1. 35 per 1, 000 inhabitants and an additional 1 per cent growth will reduce net out-migration by 1. 31 per 1, 000. Demographic and environmental pressures have a less important direct impact, but a more pronounced indirect impact on migration through conflict and job opportunities. In particular, the frequency of natural disasters has a positive and significant effect on the probability that a country will experience an outbreak of armed conflict. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence of}} a ?migration hump? or of persistence in net migration rates in SSA, and no evidence that <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> conflict in host countries. international migration, conflict, natural disasters, environmental degradation, environmentally forced migration, Africa...|$|R

40|$|A central {{question}} for theory and policy {{is whether the}} formation and expansion of informal sectors in advanced industrialized countries {{is the result of}} conditions created by advanced capitalism. Rather than assume that Third World <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> informalization, we need a critical examination of the role {{it may or may not}} play in this process. Immigrants, in so far as they tend to form communities, may be in a favorable position to seize the opportunities represented by informalization. But the opportunities are not necessarily created by immigrants. They may well be a structured outcome of current trends in the advanced industrialized economies. Similarly, what are perceived as backward sectors of the economy may or may not be remnants from an earlier phase of industrialization; they may well represent a downgrading of work involving growing sectors of the economy. This type of inquiry requires an analytical differentiation of immigration, informalization and characteristics of the current phase of advanced industrialized economies. That should allow us to establish the differential impact of (a) immigration and (b) conditions in the economy at large on the formation and expansion of informal sectors. The research on the informal sector in New York City seeks to contribute information on these various questions. The working hypothesis is that the current phase of the advanced industrialization contains conditions that induce the formation of an informal sector in large cities. There are two distinct methodological components to the study. One is concerned with identifying conditions in the major growth sectors that may induce informalization. This analysis has been completed (Sassen-Koob 1981; 1984 a). The other is concerned with identifying the characteristics of the informal sector itself.

40|$|Changes in Swedish food {{consumption}} patterns during recent decades are studied together with some possible future changes {{of importance for}} increasing resource efficiency. The increased consumption of meat and a more global food supply have contributed negatively.

Meat consumption may decline while the consumption of organic and convenience foods may increase in the future. Environmental and health reasons will <b>be</b> the main <b>causes,</b> together with an increased acceptance among younger people of food cultures with vegetarian ingredients.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} address the problem of wide variation in state-level civil rights enforcement particularly with regard to the equal protection of noncitizens. The purpose of this study is to determine if majority population prejudice (group threat) towards immigrants due to increasing <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> the main <b>cause</b> of state-level variation in civil rights policy enforcement. The tests used in this study include a case study analysis and a multiple regression analysis. The case study results were mixed: While group threat theory could be used to describe how immigrant group fears impacted civil rights spending decisions in the case example, a descriptive statistical analysis could not support the conclusion that what occurred in Nebraska was an example of a predictable pattern from 1998 - 2009. The multiple regression results also failed to support a conclusion that increasing <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> a determinant of variation in state-level civil rights spending. These findings do not negate minority or immigrant threat literature results, but they do indicate that maintaining group threat (and group boundaries) for the purposes of political gain might be more of a factor at the individual political decision-making level than at the political institutional level. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{reasons why}} the {{employment}} rate gap between immigrants and Canadian born individuals is larger in Montreal than in Toronto. A major reason is language: relative to Canadian born individuals, immigrants in Montreal are {{significantly less likely to}} know French than their Toronto counterparts to know English and their knowledge of French is less rewarded by employers than their Toronto counterparts’ knowledge of English. We also find that holding other factors constant, the performance of immigrants according to their countries of origin is remarkably similar in Montreal and Toronto: in both metropolitan areas, immigrants from Europe and India generally perform better than immigrants from China, Taiwan and Muslim countries. While we do not find any evidence that Quebec’s different <b>immigration</b> policy <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> the larger immigrant employment rate gap in Montreal, we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} immigrants would be subject to more labour market discrimination in Montreal than in Toronto. However, this discrimination would be French language related as opposed to being ethnicity related. Results are generally similar for both male and female immigrants.

However, free market economists believe that competition is the essence of a healthy economic system, and that any short-term negative impact on individual economic factors that <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by free <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> more than justified by the prospects of long-term growth for the economy as a whole.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} aimed to verify (1) whether {{seasonal}} increases in neotropical populations of Plutella xylostella are directly provoked by regular influxes of migrants, and (2) whether temporal variation in food availability is the ecological process behind such pre-dictable events. Over 3 years, plants that P. xylostella prefers were cultivated and irrigated {{in order to}} provide a continuous and abundant supply of food. Neverthe-less, seasonal oscillations in the population of the her-bivore still occurred. The hypothesis of seasonal availability of host plants could not explain the popu-lation pattern. In April, when the insect was practically extinct from the area, an artificial infestation (immi-gration) with 10, 000 pupae established a precocious population. Therefore, the start of the natural cycles of population growth, during July–August, seems to be due to external factors, rather than an improvement in local conditions for resident individuals. In the beginning of the natural cycles, the increase in the density of adults significantly preceded the increase in immatures. Plutella xylostella does not diapause, and therefore <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> the proximate <b>cause</b> of the seasonal population in-creases. Hypotheses about local factors are suggested to explain the decreasing phase of the predictable popula-tion cycles...|$|R
