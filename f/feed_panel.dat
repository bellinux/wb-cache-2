40|$|There is a {{significant}} range of bacterial inoculants for forage ensiling, {{but there is still}} a need for formulations to improve the safety of feed. The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the usefulness of three lactobacilli strains in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) The following bacterial inoculants were used: Lactocacillus plantarum K KKP 593 p (LPK), L. plantarum C KKP 788 p (LPC), L. buchneri KKP 907 p (LB), and mix of all three strains (LPK+LPC+LB). The application of bacterial inoculants in alfalfa ensiling resulted in a reduction of the total number of molds, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria sp. (up to 5, 7, and 5 times respectively for LB inoculant in comparison to untreated silage). Total inhibition of Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli growth was achieved in silages treated with all inoculants except for LPC. Aerobic stability in the control silage was the lowest (77 h) and doubled under the influence of bacterial inoculants. The most stable according to aerobic stability was silage treated with LB inoculant (175 h), where the highest concentrations of acetic acid (4. 8 g kg- 1), propionic acid (0. 7 g kg- 1) and 1, 2 -propanediol (526 mg kg- 1) were reported. The study discussed that it is important to evaluate not only the effect of bacterial inoculants on physicochemical and microbiological silage properties, as the presence and expression of antibiotic resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria have been reported. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the strains showed that almost all minimum inhibitory concentrations values for eight antibiotics were equal to or below the corresponding breakpoints proposed by the European Food Safety Authority, Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal <b>Feed</b> <b>Panel...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Development and {{implementation}} the points system diagnostics {{that would allow}} determining remotely {{the current state of}} turnout with all possible faults, gradual and sudden failures, damages, and in real time to report about their appearance. Methodology. State diagnostics on the values analysis of turnout main parameters is proposed to carry out {{with the help of a}} computer and analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Connecting measurements performance is advisable to produce to a shunt ammeter, installed in the working circuit of the point <b>feed</b> <b>panel.</b> ADC converts the analog signal of lost volts at the shunt into digital form and transmits it to a computer which stores the received data on its own recording medium for their further processing and storage. There is special software that is capable to reconnect signal and construct its temporal characteristic as well as decompose it on the spectral components. Using it one can analyze the obtained data, which allows diagnosing state of points upon change the nature, values and composition of the current curve. Findings. The computer diagnosis method was confirmed in practice for possible indications of problems that are associated with both the mechanical part of the turnout and the electrical part of it, while controlling parameters such as the amount of current normal transition, when working on frictions, the duration of the transition, properly adjusted headset and attachment points, the state of the motor. Originality. The use of computer technology in the diagnosis of the state of turnouts during their operation to monitor the current values of technical indicators, analysis and storage for all types of electric switches with different types of engines both DC and AC occurs through digitization and recording signal from measuring shunt of point feeder panel. Practical value. The proposed method enables timely, still in the early stages of defect parts, damages or failures of nodes mechanisms to detect and eliminate them. In addition, it reduces the load on the electrical engineers during schedule maintenance. The introduction of a diagnostic analysis of the turnout using computer technology will allow defining the appearance of faults in the early stages of their formation and preventing development the difficult avoidable damages or necessity for their complete replacement...|$|E

In 2007 the European Food Safety Authority was requested {{to evaluate the}} safety and efficacy of the additive when used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: gut flora stabilisers) in diets for chickens for fattening, piglets and pigs for fattening. At that time the FEEDAP Panel was able to conclude only on the safety for the environment.

The identity of the six strains was established. As no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected and as five of the strains qualify for the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach to safety assessment, their use is presumed safe for target species and consumers. The Enterococcus faecium strain is not a recognised pathogen for animals and as the additive did not adversely affect growth of chickens or piglets, Probiotic LACTINA® is considered safe for the target species up to 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections. The metabolic pathways of E. faecium are well known.

Consumption surveys include iron-containing foodstuffs of animal origin. Since the supplementation of animal feed with iron-containing compounds has not essentially changed during the last decades, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the iron levels in food of animal origin used in exposure scenarios originated from animals fed iron-supplemented diets.

40|$|Due to the {{different}} effects on the human health {{it is necessary to}} avoid excessive or insufficient consumption of iodine. Iodine deficiency weakens the synthesis of the thyroid hormones, causes hypothyroidism and can lead to various developmental and functional disturbances known as the disorders from iodine deficiency. The latest literary knowledge about the use of iodine in the broiler chickens identifies the concentration of iodine 5 mg per kg feed as safe for a given group of the animals. Working Group on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal <b>Feed</b> of   <b>Panel</b> on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed notes that the maximum authorized limit of iodine in the feed of the broiler chickens 10 mg per kg does not represent a health risk. The aim of our research was an observation and assessment of the effect of feed mixtures with iodized oil on production quality of the line hybrid chickens Cobb 500 and selected indicators of breast muscle. For comparison, a control group consists of the chickens, which were fed the feed mixtures without iodized oil. Dietary iodine in the form of potassium iodide was applied to sunflower oil. The mixture was heated at 70 °C with continuous stirring until dissolution of potassium iodide. The content of iodine in iodine suplement was 0. 04   mg per g per 1 kg of feed mixture of starter, growth and the finisher was used 5 g of iodine supplement. The oil mixture was mixed into kibbled grain of corn and carefully homogenized with other components of   the feed mixtures. To meet the aim of research, we realized an experiment, where body weight of the chickens was observed {{at the end of the}} experiment, the breast muscle weight and chemical analysis was made from selected indicators of breast muscle. A body weight of broiler chickens at the beginning and the end of the experiment and a breast muscle weight were observed by weighing on the Kern ECB 20 K 20 type scale with an accuracy of d = 0, 1 g. The breast muscles were analyzed for selected indicators according to the methodology for analytical laboratories (2009). The data were evaluated according to the basic statistical characteristics.   The differences in the values of indicators between groups were evaluated by the SAS system program by t-test. The broiler chickens that were included in the experiment were first grade with a balanced average weight of 42 g. Statistical evaluation    of body weight of the broiler chickens at the beginning of the experiment results in not significant difference between the control group and the experimental group – iodine supplement. Average body weight of the chickens was 2183. 06 g at end of experiment in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 2145. 21 g in control group with a statistically not significant difference (P > 0. 05). Average weight of the breast muscles was 426. 83 g in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 412. 11 g in control group with a statistically not significant difference (P > 0. 05). Average dry matter content      in the breast muscles was 26. 13 g per 100 g in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 26. 25 g per 100 g in control group with a statistically not significant difference (P > 0. 05). Average protein contents in breast muscles was 23. 63 g per 100 g in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 23. 31 g per 100 g   in control group with a statistically not significant difference (P> 0. 05). Average fat contents in breast muscles was 1. 05 g per 100 g in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 0. 88  g per 100 g in control group with a statistically significant difference (P The results of the experiment indicated some tendency of the positive effect of the feed mixtures with iodized oil on the quality of production of broiler chickens. Based on results, further research was recommended.   Normal 0 false false false SK X-NONE X-NONE <w:LsdExc...|$|R
