Financial institutions invest large amounts of resources employing Monte Carlo simulation to measure and price their counterparty credit risk.

Our numerical examples illustrate that our proposed efficient Monte Carlo estimators outperform the existing crude estimators of these CCR measures substantially in terms of mean square error (MSE).

40|$|Roughly {{two-thirds of}} credit {{counterparty}} losses {{were due to}} credit valuation adjustment losses and only one-third were due to actual defaults” according to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, highlighting the importance of counterparty credit risk management to the derivatives contracts. Today, managing counterparty credit risk has become an integrated part of many derivative trading desks’ day-to-day activities and the need of accurate pricing, efficient hedging strategies and practical proxies has become critical. As a result, banks have sharpened their CVA pricing and modeling infrastructure and most have a dedicated trading desk dynamically hedging their CVA. However, if pricing techniques have become standard {{over the past few}} years, the <b>expected</b> <b>positive</b> <b>exposure</b> (EPE) modeling is usually not taking into account the embedded correlation between the counterparty and underlying market movements. This correlation known as wrong way risk can substantially affect the price and the related hedging strategy and is the main focus of this article. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We study {{mathematical}} {{aspects of}} dynamic hedging of Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) in {{a portfolio of}} OTC financial derivatives. Since the sub-prime crisis, counterparty risk and wrong-way risk are a crucial issue in connection with valuation and risk management of credit derivatives. In this work we first derive a general, model free equation for {{the dynamics of the}} CVA of a portfolio of OTC derivatives. We then particularize these dynamics to the counterparty risk of a portfolio of credit derivatives including, for instance, CDSs and/or CDOs, possibly netted and collateralized, considered in the so called Markovian copula model. Wrongway risk is represented in the model by the possibility of simultaneous defaults. We establish a rigorous connection between the CVA, which represents the price of the counterparty risk, and a suitable notion of <b>Expected</b> <b>Positive</b> <b>Exposure</b> (EPE). Specifically, the EPE emerges as the key ingredient of the min-variance hedging ratio of the CVA by a CDS on the counterparty. Related notions of EPE have actually long been used in an ad-hoc way by practitioners for hedging their CVA. Our analysis thus justifies rigorously this market practice, making also precise the prope...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} static and dynamic (reduced form) {{approaches}} for modeling wrong-way {{risk in the}} context of CVA. Although all these approaches potentially suffer from arbitrage problems, they are popular (respectively) in industry and academia, mainly due to analytical tractability reasons. We complete the stochastic intensity models with another dynamic approach, consisting in the straight modeling of the survival (Azéma supermartingale) process using the Φ-martingale. Just like the other approaches, this method allows for automatic calibration to a given default probability curve. We derive analytically the positive exposures V^+_t "conditional upon default" associated to prototypical market price processes of FRA and IRS in all cases. We further discuss the link between the "default" condition and change-of-measure techniques. The expectation of V^+_t conditional upon τ=t is equal to the unconditional expectation of V^+_tζ_t. The process ζ is explicitly derived in the dynamic approaches: it is proven to be positive and to have unit expectation. Unfortunately however, it fails to be a martingale, so that Girsanov machinery cannot be used. Nevertheless, the expectation of V^+_tζ_t can be computed explicitly, leading to analytical <b>expected</b> <b>positive</b> <b>exposure</b> profiles in the considered examples.

40|$|A {{key driver}} of Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) is the {{possible}} dependency between exposure and counterparty credit risk, known as Wrong-Way Risk (WWR). At this time, addressing WWR in a both sound and tractable way remains challenging: arbitrage-free setups {{have been proposed}} by academic research through dynamic models but are computationally intensive and hard to use in practice. Tractable alternatives based on resampling techniques have been proposed by the industry, but they lack mathematical foundations. This probably explains why WWR is not explicitly handled in the Basel III regulatory framework {{in spite of its}} acknowledged importance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a new method consisting of an appealing compromise: we start from a stochastic intensity approach and end up with a pricing problem where WWR does not enter the picture explicitly. This result is achieved thanks to a set of changes of measure: the WWR effect is now embedded in the drift of the exposure, and this adjustment can be approximated by a deterministic function without affecting the level of accuracy typically required for CVA figures. The performances of our approach are illustrated through an extensive comparison of <b>Expected</b> <b>Positive</b> <b>Exposure</b> (EPE) profiles and CVA figures produced either by (i) the standard method relying on a full bivariate Monte Carlo framework and (ii) our drift-adjustment approximation. Given the uncertainty inherent to CVA, the proposed method is believed to provide a promising way to handle WWR in a sound and tractable way. Comment: 29 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

Five distal antecedents (perceived organization support for innovation, supervisor relationship quality, innovativeness as job requirement, reputation as innovative, and dissatisfaction with the status quo) had indirect effects on innovative behavior by either increasing expectedpositive performance outcomes or reducing expected image risks, or both. The effect of <b>expected</b> <b>positive</b> performance outcomes was stronger when perceived performance-reward contingency was high.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the relationships between male alcohol-related aggression (MARA) among young Australian men and heavy episodic drinking, trait aggression, masculinity, concerns about social honour and <b>expected</b> <b>positive</b> consequences of MARA. Design and Methods The total sample comprised 170 men aged 18 – 25 years who completed an online questionnaire exploring beliefs and attitudes towards MARA. Results Those who reported heavy episodic drinking were more likely to be involved in an incident of MARA. In addition, those who were involved in MARA had higher levels of trait aggression, concern for social honour and <b>expected</b> <b>positive</b> consequences of aggression in bars than did those without such involvement. The relationship between socially constructed masculinity factors (a combined variable reflecting masculinity, social honour and <b>expected</b> <b>positive</b> consequences) and MARA was mediated by heavy episodic drinking. Social honour accounted for almost all of the predictive power of masculinity factors. Heavy episodic drinking and trait aggression remained significant predictors of MARA in a multivariate model. Discussion and Conclusions The findings from the current study may assist in developing preventative techniques for young men which target masculinity concerns and the consequences of participating in MARA...|$|R
