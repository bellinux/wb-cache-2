40|$|With superlative {{growth in}} the number of small {{organizations}} over the past two decades, the <b>impact</b> <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> environment due to higher production output is also immense. Most governments are continuously taking measures to mitigate the risks associated with industrial growth. One such measure is to implement green practices throughout the supply chain. Since small organizations are important part of supply chain and a major contributor of industrial output they also need to implement green supply chain practices. This paper aims to find out important enablers for green supply chain management (GSCM) from the view point of micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process methodology has been used to rank the enablers, three important enablers were identified viz. top management commitment and finance, government support and regulations and recycling and reuse efforts. Managers of small organizations can benefit immensely by focusing on implementing these practices in their organizations...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the serious}} <b>impact</b> <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> the {{environment}} by the inappropriate {{disposal of waste}} motor oils, {{it is essential to}} find alternative mechanisms to handle and dispose these wastes in a controlled process. The reuse of waste motor oil as a resource for the synthesis of diesel-like fuels provides an alternative way for the disposal of this residue in a feasible, sustainable, and environmentally responsible way. This work addresses the kinetic study of the catalytic cracking of waste motor oil using mesoporous aluminum silicate materials impregnated with 1 and 2 % zinc. Both the waste motor oil and liquid fuel product were characterized according to ASTM standards to ensure an adequate characterization and to guarantee the proper quality of the product. The results from the overall kinetic approach show that the cracking reaction can be described using a first-order rate equation with respect to the concentration of the used motor oil. The activation energy for the thermal cracking reaction is 370 kJ/mol. It is reduced by 22 % to 287 kJ/mol when the alumina silicate catalysts are used. Also, during the reaction, the overall yield of the reaction with respect to the liquid fuel is increased from 63 % during the thermal reaction to 90 % during the catalytic reaction...|$|E

The environmental <b>Impact</b> <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> the hydro-climatic features at the lower {{portions of}} the Lerma River upper basin is studied by analyzing meteorological and hydrometric data, which are either part of the hydrological cycle or indirectly affect it. The analysis was made by comparing the trends in meteorological elements with records between 1920 and 1985 covering information since prior to approximately 30 years after the transformation, and Including hydrometric data examined for two periods: 1945 - 1950 and 1951 - 1980. The available water volume in the Lerma River upper basin was also estimated through mean annual precipitation, evaporation and Köppen´s aridity index registered in the basin, to determine whether water extraction has been conducted in excess of the amount available in the basin without altering its natural environment. The results reveal that, although not too obvious, the meteorological elements studied have been altered, namely mean, maximum and minimum temperatures; maximum, minimum and mean annual precipitations and potential evaporation. A clear change in the amount of water in lagoons that give origin to the Lerma River was also observed, as well as water extraction exceeding the available volume from the Lerma River upper basin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe <b>impact</b> <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> the {{environment}} by the electronic products disposal has been turning {{the environment}}al regulations a global trend regarding the {{proper management of}} Electrical & Electronic Equipment Waste (REEE). The Brazilian government, aware of this need, developed and promulgated in 2010 the National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS), which gives the responsability to the companies of several economic branches and other supply chain participants for the final destination of the goods when they {{reach the end of}} their life cycle or cannot be used by the organizational user anymore. Due to these new demands, a project started in 2010 resulting from the partnership between Renato Archer Information Technology Center (CTI) and the Brazilian Association of the Industry of Medical Equipments, Dental, Hospital and Laboratories (ABIMO), called CTI-ABIMO Project, to support these companies to be adjusted to the new environmental regulations. The focused branch uses technology intensively, it is an exporter one and it consists mainly of small and medium national companies. The scope {{of this study is to}} report the fundamentals, methods and results of CTI-ABIMO project to support pilot companies to be adjusted to the PNRS requirements in order to keep their competitiveness and contributing to the sustainability of the Brazilian electromedical equipment industries. The specificities of this company branch for the REEE management were also considered, including: long-life equipments compared with other electronic products, predominance of hospitals and clinics as final customers and significant portion of government purchases on the total of the branch sales...|$|E
40|$|This {{briefing}} {{is referring}} to research which has taken place {{during the last three}} years in the Building Construction Laboratory in EPSEB. For this work we relied on the help of two students of the Building Construction School of Barcelona (Spain) In our first research project, we discovered that Barcelona has two registers of war damaged buildings during the bombardments {{that took place in the}} city during the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939. These registers identify the rate of damage to the buildings in various parameters (Total ruin, partial ruin and slight damage). The first register belongs to the Passive Defence Council that registered, more or less, about 1800 buildings. The second register relates to all the calls that were made by the Barcelona’s firemen during the bombardments, and these account for approximately 1600 buildings. The difference between the two registers, about 200 buildings, is due to differences of viewpoint between both organisations. In spite of this, there is not a significant difference, so for this research we have used the Barcelona’s firemen call’s register. From all this data and the cartographic information that is currently available in Barcelona’s Administrative Archive, we began, first of all, to work on identifying and later cataloguing the actual condition of all buildings that were damaged during the bombardments in Barcelona. This research has allowed us to study the current condition of the damaged buildings, though we centred the research only on the façades. Accordingly, we have been able to conclude that, nowadays, most of the war-damaged heritage buildings are still in existence, and also we have examined the cracks and fissures that appeared in the buildings during the bombardments. This research has allowed us to explore new work and research lines which we intend to develop shortly. At the present, for example, we are analyzing the <b>impact</b> <b>caused</b> <b>to</b> those buildings which were directly affected by bombs, as well as the buildings surrounding those that received the impacts.

Afecta a 24 millones de personas a nivel mundial y en función de la discapacidad se coloca en el cuarto lugar dentro de los grupos diagnósticos más frecuentes. La familia juega un papel importante tras el diagnóstico de la misma favoreciendo o entorpeciendo el curso de la enfermedad.

With the thawing permafrost, in the northerly areas, they are expecting to see a collapse in peatlands, which will raise the water table, and form ponds.

The results demonstrated that: i. the use of crown projection area as independent variable was sufficient to produce a robust model to estimate the biomass of individual trees; ii. the number of trees extracted alone did not explained the biomass loss in the plots and iii. there was a strong relationship between the total biomass loss estimated by the subtraction of the biomass before and after logging and the biomass of the extracted trees.
