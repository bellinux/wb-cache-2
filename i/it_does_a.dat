[...] Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B', saying [...] "Despite my problems with the series, I still look forward to watching S.H.I.E.L.D. every week. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> good job capturing the thrill of the big screen on a TV budget ... the dialogue is breezy, and the cast becomes more appealing with each new episode. There’s plenty of room for this show to grow, but I’m not ready to write it off yet." [...] Alan Sepinwall at HitFix called [...] "FZZT" [...] "the first installment of S.H.I.E.L.D. to suggest the creative team was aware of what's not working, even if they couldn't solve every problem in a single installment", feeling that the episode made several positive steps forward in terms of character development. Will Salmon gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5 for SFX, praising the performances of Henstridge and Gregg, but calling the episode clichéd, and concluding that [...] "by fleshing out the characters, it does feel like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is now more than just a flashy brand extension." ...|$|E

[...] Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Cultural Transformations, felt that [...] "the pizzicato {{synthesizer}} line that opens 'Angel' was indeed classical Madonna." [...] John Leland from Spin called it a rehash of Madonna's previous single [...] "Lucky Star" [...] (1984), with [...] "an even lamer melody and punch. [...] 'Angel' is Nile Rodgers doing what he does best: turning crass product into cash product." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic called the song [...] "an excellent standard-issue dance-pop." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the song sugary. While reviewing the album in 1995, Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly felt that the song comes off as a bit repetitious and immature. Alfred Soto of Stylus Magazine commented that [...] "'Angel' is a particular stunner, certainly the apex of Rodgers' post-Chic skills. [...] <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> better job than the two big singles of delineating the boundaries of Madonna's determined shallowness, an act that confounds Philistines today and made the appreciation of her musical skills a lot harder than it took these critics to dismiss Cyndi Lauper as the real charlatan." [...] Nancy Erlich from Billboard called the song [...] "romantic, uncontroversial techno-pop. [...] reign continues as '85's premier media obsession." ...|$|E

VanDerWerff noted that the idea that Mulder had killed himself was not effective because the show's audience knew that a movie had been scheduled for release in the summer of 1998. Finally, he called the episode's ending [...] "one of the show’s weaker cliffhangers". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave {{the first part of the}} episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the story's pacing, noting that the episode [...] "is all plot, plot, plot. [...] much of the plot is unbelievable." [...] Furthermore, Vitaris criticized several plot holes in the episode, including Mulder's easy entrance into the Department of Defense and the characters antics, such as his attack of Ostelhoff. However, despite the overall negative review, Vitaris did mention that, [...] "There's only one truly galvanizing scene, as that's the confrontation between Scully and Skinner after he follows her to the lab where she is performing her DNA test." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two heavily criticized the [...] "Skinner-as-traitor" [...] plot, noting sardonically that [...] "the production team aren't going to do , and the shock 'villain in the room' reveal will be Section Chief Blevins–a character so important in the framework of the series that, barring his appearance in the Season Four finale, we haven't seen him in ninety-four episodes." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files named [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II", together, as the tenth best [...] "Episode of All Time". In his critique of [...] "Redux", he noted [...] "While many people don't care for 'Redux', I think <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> good job of preparing us for the second hour (although, it invalidates Gillian's emotional context from the S4 finale)." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E

Similarly, Australian journalists such as Mike Sheahan have argued that the relevance of the series was diminished on account of the Australian team no longer being made up primarily of All-Australian players (though the Australian team resumed being made up of exclusively All-Australian players from 2014).|$|E

Given a countably additive measure μ on X, a measurable set is one that differs from a Borel set by a null set.

2500|$|It can {{therefore}} be argued that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> disservice to the English-speaking reader to translate the title as The Antichrist at all. As has been said the German title Der Antichrist is open to two interpretations ('Antichrist'/'Anti-Christian') but the English The Antichrist is not, and thus the question becomes: does that title reflect Nietzsche's use of the German word in the text? In fact, Nietzsche employs the word Antichrist at only one point, and there its sense is clearly 'Anti-Christian.' He uses its plural Antichristen once also, and again the meaning is 'anti-Christians.' In fact, at no point in the text does Nietzsche use any form of the German word Christ other than to mean 'Christian.' On this approach, a reader would be better readied for book's content were its title rendered [...] "The Anti-Christian", which more accurately identifies the author's chosen foe. After all, even to acknowledge {{the existence of an}} Antichrist, let alone to portray oneself as one, presupposes the existence of a Christ, of a Messiah. Nietzsche recognized no such entity. His argument was entirely with those who would attempt to make a Christ, a Messiah, out of Jesus of Nazareth, which is to say, with [...] "Christians." ...|$|E
