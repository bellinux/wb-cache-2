If a family mutation has not previously been identified or if the common mutations are not present, recent molecular advances have made it possible to sequence all of the known NCL genes, increasing the chances of finding the responsible mutation(s).|$|R

40|$|Colloidal {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have {{received}} considerable attention as luminescent probes for <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> applications. The underlying photophysical and photochemical properties of these probes need consideration when designing assays for <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis.</b> These properties include intermittent fluorescence often termed 'blinking', photobleaching, photoinduced fluorescence enhancement and, {{as a result}} of recent evidence, photo-induced generation of reactive oxygen species leading to DNA damage. Even though the design of assays for <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> using QDs needs care, QDs do provide advantages over fluorophores for many emerging <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> methods where low copy numbers of DNA are present. Many of the more traditional DNA assay methods using fluorophore labeled probes either cannot be translated, or show no benefit in using QDs as the lumophor...|$|R

40|$|The promise {{associated}} with early “ancient DNA” results {{has not been}} translated into routine techniques of value to archaeologists. The reasons for this are partly technical - ancient <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> is an extremely difficult technique - and partly practical - ancient <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> is often an ‘after thought’ to an archaeological project. In this paper ancient human <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> is briefly reviewed paying particular attention to specimens originating from Greek archaeological contexts.

40|$|Criminology is {{a science}} dealing with the {{protection}} of citizens and state from infringement. Criminology uses mostly biological or genetic methods for crime detection.

Forensic genetics uses <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> for identification. The main aims of this study are description and importance of biological, anthropological and genetic methods in criminology, different ways of forensic identification, division and collection of forensic traces, characterization and course of forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> and <b>DNA</b> profiling.
