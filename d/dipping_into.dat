25|$|One {{reason for}} the drop {{in public and private}} {{investment}} in research is the economic slowdown. After peaking at 7.5% annual growth in 2010, the economy slowed before <b>dipping</b> <b>into</b> recession in 2015 (-3.7% growth). The government has been forced to adopt austerity measures and is now less able to collect revenue through the sectorial funds, since company profits are down in many quarters. Industrial output declined by 2.8% between November and December 2014 and by 3.2% over the entire year. The most recent data indicate that 2014–2015 {{may turn out to be}} the worst years in decades for industry, especially for the transformation subsector of the manufacturing industry’.|$|E
25|$|The Red Devils' {{next game}} was against Arsenal the {{following}} Sunday, in a six-pointer that would either rule Arsenal {{out of the}} title race or bring them right back into it. A United win would put them six points ahead of their nearest league rivals, Chelsea, and nine ahead of Arsenal, and with Chelsea playing the following day, a win was essential {{to put pressure on}} the Blues. Arsenal started the match well, and looked to take the game to United through sheer brute force, attacking with pace and power. Indeed, they created the best chances of the half, United's best opportunity falling to Wayne Rooney, who refused to go down under the challenge of Kolo Touré, before seeing his shot saved by the foot of Jens Lehmann in a one-on-one situation. The first half finished goalless, but it was not long into the second half before the crowd saw the first goal of the game. It was a controversial goal, however, as it seemed that Emmanuel Adebayor had played Cesc Fàbregas' cross into the net with his left arm. Nevertheless, referee Howard Webb gave the goal, seeing nothing wrong with it. Just five minutes later, though, United hit back. Michael Carrick played the ball into the Arsenal penalty area, where it was handled by William Gallas, and the referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty. As expected, Cristiano Ronaldo took responsibility for the penalty, and coolly swept it into {{the left side of the}} net. However, he was made to take the kick again as Park Ji-sung was deemed to be encroaching on the penalty area before the kick. Fortunately, Ronaldo was just as successful with his second attempt, burying the ball in the bottom left-hand corner. In an attempt to force the issue by going for the winner, Alex Ferguson brought on Carlos Tevez and Anderson in place of Park and Scholes. The Reds were cutting it fine, as Van der Sar was forced to make two reflex saves from his own defenders, Wes Brown and Rio Ferdinand. Tevez then sent a warning shot across the Arsenal bow, shooting narrowly wide from 25yards. Then, with 20 minutes to go, Patrice Evra was brought down just outside the Arsenal box. With the Arsenal defence expecting a typical Ronaldo free-kick, they were caught off guard when Owen Hargreaves played an immaculate free-kick over the wall, <b>dipping</b> <b>into</b> the bottom left corner of the goal, leaving Lehmann rooted to his goal line. United continued to press, not giving Arsenal an inch, and though Van der Sar was called on to save a header from Nicklas Bendtner, the Red Devils managed to hold onto their lead and extend their lead at the top of the table. Chelsea, now the only team with a realistic chance of stopping United winning the title failed to reduce the lead to three points the following day, only managing a 1–1 draw at home to Wigan Athletic. They followed this up with a 1–0 win over Everton the following Thursday, reducing the lead to two points with just three games remaining, although United now had a game in hand.|$|E

500|$|Throughout this period, Harrison's {{devotion to}} Hindu spirituality – {{particularly}} to Krishna consciousness via {{his friendship with}} A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada – reached new heights. As Harrison admitted, his adherence to his spiritual path was not necessarily consistent. His wife, Pattie Boyd, and their friend Chris O'Dell would joke {{that it was hard}} to tell whether he was <b>dipping</b> <b>into</b> his ever-present Japa Yoga prayer bag or [...] "the coke bag". This duality has been noted by Harrison biographers Simon Leng and Alan Clayson: on one hand, Harrison earned himself the nickname [...] "His Lectureship" [...] during his prolonged periods of fervid devotion; on the other, he participated in bawdy London sessions for the likes of Bobby Keys' eponymous solo album and what Leng terms Harry Nilsson's [...] "thoroughly nasty" [...] "You're Breakin' My Heart", both recorded in the first half of 1972. Similarly, Harrison's passion for high-performance cars saw him lose his driver's licence for the second time in a year after crashing his Mercedes into a roundabout at 90 miles an hour, on 28 February, with Boyd in the passenger seat.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "I love <b>dipping</b> <b>into</b> ... some of that material of Howard Hughes, which I'm sure he's kind of been likened to", and described his biggest challenge in playing the character as [...] "keeping it very realistic, but at the same time, tongue-in-cheek as well", and not making Stark [...] "too broad". On Carter and Stark's relationship moving into the second season, Atwell said, [...] "there’s a new comfort level between Stark and Peggy ... they’re on a bit more of an even level. She respects him hugely, but is also not afraid to comment on his lifestyle choices and how disgustingly misogynistic she finds him ... he does use women as a form of escapism for him and his Dionysian ways, but when it comes to Peggy, he doesn’t see her as big boobs and red lips. He sees her as someone he can actually have a proper conversation with. Which probably scares the hell out of him".|$|E
500|$|Peace {{with the}} United States dated {{back to an}} {{alliance}} arranged by Lewis and Clark, but the encroachment of gold miners in the 1860s and settlers in the 1870s {{put pressure on the}} Nez Perce. Although a treaty of 1855 originally allowed them to keep most of their traditional land, another in 1863 reduced the land allotted to them by 90percent. The Nez Perce who refused to give up their land under the 1863 treaty included a band living in the Wallowa Valley of Oregon, led by Heinmot Tooyalakekt, widely known as Chief Joseph. Tensions rose, and in May 1877, General Oliver Otis Howard called a council and ordered the non-treaty bands to move to the reservation. Chief Joseph considered military resistance futile, and by June 14, 1877, had gathered about 600 people at a site near present-day Grangeville, Idaho. But on that day a small group of warriors staged an attack on nearby white settlers, which led to the Nez Perce War. After several small battles in Idaho, more than 800Nez Perce, mostly non-warriors, took 2000 head of various livestock including horses and fled into Montana, then traveled southeast, <b>dipping</b> <b>into</b> Yellowstone National Park. [...] A small number of Nez Perce fighters, probably fewer than 200, successfully held off larger forces of the U.S. Army in several skirmishes, including the two-day Battle of the Big Hole in southwestern Montana. They then moved northeast and attempted to seek refuge with the Crow Nation; rebuffed, they headed for safety in Canada.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to its sea-level elevation, coastal location and position just above the Tropic of Cancer, the area owes its warm, humid climate to the Gulf Stream, which moderates climate year-round.
