50|$|After {{releasing}} the clamp the GPV ring begins {{to rise up}} (increasing its radius, and accordingly, the diameter). Thus, the hydraulic cylinders and gaps between the segments allow the formation to increase its length. The belt rotor stretches by 2-5% due to its elasticity. Having achieved the required height the rotor transfers to the <b>generator</b> <b>mode,</b> and the electricity generated is used to boost the second rotor in the opposite direction. As a result, the GPV accelerates to achieve the First Cosmic Velocity on a low Earth orbit.

50|$|In the armature, an {{electromotive}} force {{is created by}} the relative motion of the armature and the field. When the machine acts in the motor mode, this EMF opposes the armature current, and the armature converts electrical power to mechanical power {{in the form of}} torque (unless the machine is stalled), and transfers it to the load via the shaft. When the machine acts in the <b>generator</b> <b>mode,</b> the armature EMF drives the armature current, and shaft mechanical power is converted to electrical power and transferred to the load. In an induction generator, these distinctions are blurred, since the generated power is drawn from the stator, which would normally be considered the field.|$|E

GPV is a ring located on the equator of the Earth (or {{parallel}} to the equator) consisting of individual segments connected (for example) by hydraulic cylinders. Inside the ring segments there are cells for placing the payload and necessary equipment. The heart of the GPV consists of two circular channels passing through all the segments of the ring. High vacuum is kept up in the channels and they are completely isolated from the environment. Inside these channels there are two magnetically levitated flywheel rotors assembled from small metal and flexible (e.g., polymer) segments. The flywheel rotors are held by an electromagnetic system mounted inside the GPV shell, according to the principle of magnetic levitation and act as the rotors of the giant motor (capable of operating in a <b>generator</b> <b>mode</b> as well).|$|E

We showed that two-term rotate-add functions are never invertible, but many classes of rotate-XOR functions are. In particular, when {{the length of the}} computer word is a power of 2 (8, 16, 32, 64...), any rotate-XOR function of an odd number of terms is invertible.

Simple pulse generators usually allow control of pulse repetition rate (frequency), pulse width and high and low voltage levels of the pulses.

Two types of Pulse generators by name (i) programmable and (ii) non-programmable are there. The first ones are software controlled and the other ones are hardware controlled.

40|$|This Masterâ€™s thesis {{describes}} a DSP {{implementation of the}} Statically Compensated Voltage Model (SCVM) algorithm for sensorless induction machine control. The algorithm is aimed to be implemented in a 16 -bit fixed-point processor. In general, low speed operation with voltage model based control systems is problematic, especially when in <b>generator</b> <b>mode.</b> In <b>generator</b> <b>mode</b> with the load at nominal torque, the implemented design fails already at 7. 5 Hz. With a lower load, 2 Nm or 54 % of nominal, the drive is able brake it to almost zero, but the speed accuracy is low. On the other hand, if the motor operates in motor mode, low speed is less problematic. Experiments show that this implementation can handle variations in stator resistance from - 37 % up to + 60 % with stable low speed operation and variations of at least Â± 60 % at nominal speed. Stable operation for all speeds is possible even during an increase of rotor resistance by 60 %, but the speed accuracy will be reduced by approximatly 2 %. The rotor resistance may decrease by 58 % at low speed and by 53 % at nominal speed before the drive destabilizes. The total leakage inductance can vary at least Â± 30 % without noticeably affecting the system. The thesis project is conducted in association with Aros electronics AB...|$|E
