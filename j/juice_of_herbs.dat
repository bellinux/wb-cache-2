60|$|A modern {{student is}} struck by the cool {{way in which the}} ancient poets, geographers, and {{commentators}} mention a startling circumstance, the Fire- walk. The only hint of explanation is the statement that the drug or <b>juice</b> <b>of</b> <b>herbs</b> preserved the Hirpi from harm. That theory may be kept in mind, and applied if it is found useful. Virgil's theory that the ministrants walk, pietate freti, corresponds to Mrs. Wesley's belief, when, after praying, she 'waded the flames' to rescue her children from the burning parsonage at Epworth. The hypothesis of Iamblichus, when he writes about the ecstatic or 'possessed' persons who cannot be injured by fire, is like that of modern spiritualists--the 'spirit' or 'daemon' preserves them unharmed.|$|E
6000|$|So, {{covering}} his limbs {{only with a}} sackcloth, and having a cloak of skin, which the blessed Antony had given him at starting, and a rustic cloak, between {{the sea and the}} swamp, he enjoyed the vast and terrible solitude, feeding on only fifteen figs after the setting of the sun; and because the region was, as has been said above, of ill- repute from robberies, no man had ever stayed before in that place. The devil, seeing what he was doing and whither he had gone, was tormented. And though he, who of old boasted, saying, [...] "I shall ascend into heaven, I shall sit above the stars of heaven, and shall be like unto the Most High," [...] now saw that he had been conquered by a boy, and trampled under foot by him, ere, on account of his youth, he could commit sin. He therefore began to tempt his senses; but he, enraged with himself, and beating his breast with his fist, as if he could drive out thoughts by blows, [...] "I will force thee, mine ass," [...] said he, [...] "not to kick; and feed thee with straw, not barley. I will wear thee out with hunger and thirst; I will burden thee with heavy loads; I will hunt thee through heat and cold, till thou thinkest more of food than of play." [...] He therefore sustained his fainting spirit with the <b>juice</b> <b>of</b> <b>herbs</b> and a few figs, after each three or four days, praying frequently, and singing psalms, and digging the ground with a mattock, to double the labour of fasting by that of work. At the same time, by weaving baskets of rushes, he imitated the discipline of the Egyptian monks, and the Apostle's saying--"He that will not work, neither let him eat"--till he was so attenuated, and his body so exhausted, that it scarce clung to his bones.|$|E

Athena removed her disguise and appeared in shimmering glory, clad in a sparkling white chiton. The two began weaving straight away. Athena's weaving represented four separate contests between mortals and the gods in which the gods punished mortals for setting themselves as equals of the gods. Arachne's weaving depicted ways that the gods had misled and abused mortals, particularly Zeus, tricking and seducing many women. When Athena saw that Arachne had not only insulted the gods, but done so with a work far more beautiful than Athena's own, she was enraged. She ripped Arachne's work into shreds, and hit her on the head three times. Terrified and ashamed, Arachne hanged herself. Then Athena said [...] "Live on then, and yet hang, condemned one, but, lest you are careless infuture, this same condition is declared, in punishment, against your descendants, to the last generation!" [...] After saying this she sprinkled her with the <b>juice</b> <b>of</b> Hecate's <b>herb,</b> and immediately {{at the touch of}} this dark poison, Arachne's hair fell out. With it went her nose and ears, her head shrank to the smallest size, and her whole body became tiny. Her slender fingers stuck to her sides as legs, the rest is belly, from which she still spins a thread, and, as a spider, weaves her ancient web."
