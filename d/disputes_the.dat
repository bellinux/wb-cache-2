5|$|The Olney–Pauncefote Treaty of 1897 was a {{proposed}} treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 {{that would have}} required arbitration of major <b>disputes.</b> <b>The</b> treaty {{was rejected by the}} U.S. Senate and never went into effect.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to territorial <b>disputes,</b> <b>the</b> League {{also tried to}} intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport, {{which was the first}} internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.|$|E

5|$|Locating new bodies is {{also not}} without {{political}} <b>disputes.</b> <b>The</b> European Central Bank's (ECB) seat had to symbolise its independence from political control, and was located in a city which did not already host a national government or European institution. New agencies are also being based in eastern Europe since 2004 to balance the distribution of agencies across the EU.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January 2004 four protesters {{climbed onto}} the gantry over the Tamar Bridge to {{highlight}} {{the work of the}} group Fathers 4 Justice who promote the rights of fathers in child custody <b>disputes.</b> <b>The</b> protest caused rush-hour tailbacks {{on both sides of the}} bridge. Charges against the protesters were later dropped after it was felt there would not be a realistic chance of conviction.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{expanded}} its railroad connections and industrial activity. It suffered a corresponding rise in pollution {{of the river}} and waterfront. During the early 1870s, the Eads Bridge was constructed over the Mississippi River, and the city established several large parks, including Forest Park. Due to local political and economic <b>disputes,</b> <b>the</b> city separated from St. Louis County in 1876 and became an independent city. Its limited geographic area has inhibited its success in the 20th and 21st centuries because of the small tax base. During the late 19th century, St. Louis became home to two Major League Baseball teams. Ragtime and blues music flourished in the city, with African Americans making major contributions also in jazz.|$|E

5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years. Barry's most famous rescue {{was that of a}} young boy. He found the child asleep in a cavern of ice. After warming up the boy's body sufficiently by licking him, he moved the boy about and onto his back and carried the child back to the hospice. The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum of Natural History in Bern <b>disputes</b> <b>the</b> legend, attributing it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E
5|$|Focusing on the {{cultural}} and political use of the architecture at Framlingham, historian D. Plowman has put forward a revisionist interpretation of the castle's architecture in the late medieval period. Plowman suggests that the castle {{was intended to be}} entered from {{the north end of the}} Lower Court, passing through the ornamental gardens, with travellers then entering through the gate by the Prison Tower – in this interpretation, more of a barbican than a tower – and then up into the Inner Court. This would have provided high status visitors with dramatic views of the castle, reinforcing the political prestige of the owners. Historian Magnus Alexander <b>disputes</b> <b>the</b> practicality of this arrangement, although agrees that the route would have been more practical for hunting parties proceeding to the local parklands.|$|E
5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade <b>disputes.</b> <b>The</b> European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers {{have taken advantage of}} these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E

5|$|Modern Macedonian language, a south Slavic language, is {{unrelated}} to the Ancient Macedonian language. It is currently the subject of two major <b>disputes.</b> <b>The</b> first is over the name (alternative ways of referring to this language {{can be found in}} the terminology by group section and in the article Macedonian language naming dispute). The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from Bulgarian, the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups, Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Larris, who {{has also}} {{conducted}} an academic study of The Daily Show, <b>disputes</b> <b>the</b> findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing The Daily Show and thinking or acting in a particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E
5|$|Reagan {{was first}} elected to the Board of Directors of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in 1941, serving as an {{alternate}} member. After World War II, he resumed service and became third vice-president in 1946. The adoption of conflict-of-interest bylaws in 1947 led the SAG president and six board members to resign; Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and was subsequently elected. He was chosen by the membership to serve seven additional one-year terms, from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959. Reagan led the SAG through eventful years that were marked by labor-management <b>disputes,</b> <b>the</b> Taft–Hartley Act, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings and the Hollywood blacklist era.|$|E

5|$|Since 2003, Croatian {{foreign policy}} has focused on {{achieving}} the strategic goal of becoming a member state of the European Union (EU). In December 2011, Croatia completed the EU accession negotiations and signed an EU accession treaty on 9 December 2011. Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 marking {{the end of a}} process started in 2001 by signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and Croatian application for the EU membership in 2003. A recurring obstacle to the negotiations was Croatia's ICTY co-operation record and Slovenian blocking of the negotiations because of Croatia–Slovenia border <b>disputes.</b> <b>The</b> latter was resolved through an Arbitration Agreement of 4 November 2009, approved by national parliaments and a referendum in Slovenia.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{civilian}} casualties in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed156 in 24 instances of war crimes and another 47 as victims of murderduring the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The Croatian Helsinki Committee <b>disputes</b> <b>the</b> claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period. When submitted as evidence, their report {{was rejected by the}} ICTY due to unsourced statements and double entries contained within. Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing. ICTY prosecutors set the number of civilian deaths at 324. Croatian government officials estimate that 42 Croatian civilians were killed during the operation.|$|E
5|$|George Steinbrenner {{bought the}} club in 1973 and {{regularly}} invested in new talent, using free agency to acquire top players. Yankee Stadium was renovated and reopened in 1976 {{as the home of}} a more competitive Yankees team. Despite clubhouse <b>disputes,</b> <b>the</b> team reached the World Series four times between 1976 and 1981 and claimed the championship in 1977 and 1978. New York continued to pursue their strategy of signing free agents into the 1980s, but with less success, and the team eventually sank into mediocrity after 1981. In the early 1990s, the team began to improve as their roster was rebuilt around young players from their minor league system, including Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. After earning a playoff berth in 1995, the Yankees won four of the next five World Series, and the 1998–2000 teams were the last in MLB to win three straight Series titles.|$|E

5|$|Grand Duchess Marguerite Louise and Dowager Grand Duchess Vittoria vied {{with each}} other for power. The Dowager, after a {{protracted}} battle, triumphed: The Grand Duke assigned his mother the day-to-day administration of the state. Cosimo III commenced his reign with the utmost fervour, attempting to salvage the sinking exchequer and allowing his subjects to petition him for arbitration in <b>disputes.</b> <b>The</b> novelty soon wore off, however. Vittoria, Cosimo having lost his taste for administration, was further empowered by admission to the Grand Duke's Consulta (Privy Council). Marguerite Louise, deprived of any political influence, went about arranging Prince Ferdinando's education and aruing with Vittoria over precedence, which only further encamped Cosimo on his mother's side. In the midst of this, on the first anniversary of Ferdinando II's death, Gian Gastone was born to the grand ducal couple.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{a period of}} {{financial}} and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, {{at the center of}} many of the <b>disputes.</b> <b>The</b> gravest incident was the church bwing placed in financial receivership by the Attorney General of California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took {{an active role in the}} defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council of elders, and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent administrative positions other than Armstrong himself.|$|E
5|$|The Royalists, while losing fewer soldiers, {{were now}} in a {{precarious}} position, since reinforcements from Chester were needed {{to follow up on}} the success and defeat Poyntz's force. As such, Langdale sent Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Shakerley to report to Charles, requesting reinforcements. Shakerley arrived in Chester and delivered his message after 15 minutes, but no orders were issued for a further six hours after that. Barratt speculates that one reason could have been the fatigue of the Royalist troops, and another the rivalries amongst the Royalist commanders: Gerard and Digby opposed each other, with other commanders disliking Langdale; and Charles not being strong enough to stop the <b>disputes.</b> <b>The</b> Parliamentarians, however, did send support: at approximately 2:00pm, the Chester forces dispatched 350 horse and 400 musketeers under Colonels Michael Jones and John Booth to reinforce Poyntz.|$|E
