5000|$|Cast and {{characters}} were all announced in September 11, 2012 during the series' story conference, {{with the main}} cast being, Marian Rivera, Dennis Trillo, Alessandra De Rossi and Rafael Rosell. The network personally chose Rivera and Trillo to reprise the characters of Angeline Santos and Marcel Salcedo, respectively, for the local adaptation of Temptation of Wife. The two first worked together on 2010 Filipino adaptation of another Korean series, Endless Love. As for her preparation, Rivera stated that [...] "Whenever I have a new soap, I make sure to ask some tips about the role. Then <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> director how {{he wants me to}} approach my role. I'd like to have an idea of the character that I am going to portray and how I would give life to it onscreen," [...] she said. She further stated that she wants every role she does to be different from the previous one in terms of how she going to approach it. [...] "I was challenged to alter the concept of being a [...] "damsel in distress" [...] in my role as Angeline," [...] she added. On the other hand, Trillo described his character as a [...] "not-so-typical-leading-man" [...] role.|$|E

If they believe that he knows he made a mistake, that's good enough. I didn't want the audiences to say, [...] "What an asshole!" [...] I don't know if women in the audience care about Cary Elwes from the first Saw film. I think they still {{thought he was a}} bastard even if he didn't sleep with that woman. His mistake put him in that predicament and in real, if you mess around on your wife, you're probably not to going to end up chained up in the bathroom somewhere with a saw, but you can still make a mess out of things. What I kept zeroing in on with my character and his son is when <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> son, I tell him I love him every time I hang up the phone. I say, [...] "I love you," [...] when I drop him off at school, only because I {{want to make sure that}} the last things I say to him is something wonderful. That's one of the things we added to the script. That was one of the best moments for my character, to see what was the last thing he said to his son. When Jigsaw asks him that, that was something I had to have in that scene. If you are a parent, you will probably say to yourself, [...] "That's not good." [...] That's the thing that you have to live with.|$|E

Nowadays, most of the old small streets are gone, and the new inner-belt and outer-belt highway system is up and running.

40|$|This booklet is {{designed}} to facilitate conversations with your patients about family issues. MS intrudes just {{at the time in}} life when decisions are being made about marriage, children, and careers. From the time of diagnosis, the disease can affect the life cycle of the entire family, compounding and confusing the normal transitions and stresses of everyday living. It has often been referred to as the ‘uninvited guest ’ who arrives one day, complete with baggage, and never leaves. It enters the household, taking up space in every room of the house and taking part in every family activity. Discussions about the impact of MS on family relationships may be particularly difficult to initiate if time is limited or if either you or they feel uncomfortable raising the topic. The physician and nurse have an important role to play—in initiating the discussion, providing helpful information, and referring patients and their families to counseling professionals. 1. Why should <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> patients about family issues? l Families living with MS usually find themselves in uncharted territory. Guilt, anger, sadness, and a sense of burden can become part of the family fabric, creating barriers to communication, intimacy, growth, and family unity...|$|E
