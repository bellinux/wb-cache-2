Kubrick tones down the early family tension and reveals family disharmony much more gradually than does King. In the film, Danny has a stronger <b>emotional</b> <b>bond</b> with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack's rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him.|$|E

25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an <b>emotional</b> <b>bond</b> that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E
25|$|Parnok's {{last great}} love was the Georgian physicist, Nina Vedeneyeva. The two may have met {{as early as}} 1927, through Tsuberbiller, a {{colleague}} of Vedeneyeva. Vedeneyeva's son, Yevgeny, was living in exile {{at that time and}} Tsuberbiller, who had written a textbook used for decades in the high schools of Russia, helped her obtain books for him to maintain his studies. In January, 1932, the relationship turned to romance, despite the facts that Parnok was still living with Tsuberbiller and Yevgeny disapproved of the relationship. As had happened before, her lover became her muse, inspiring her to write two cycles of poems, Ursa Major and Useless Goods. The frantic pace of her writing foretold the exhaustion she would suffer, which hastened her death, but Parnok was aware of the consequences. The references between these last two cycles and Parnok's adolescent poetry, make it clear that she had always known what she wanted to say, but until she reached her maturity, she {{did not know how to}} express her words. Their <b>emotional</b> <b>bond,</b> which accelerated after a trip to Vedeneyeva's summer cottage in Kashin in April, was destined to remain hidden from most of Vedeneyeva's family and friends. To keep up appearance of a mere friendship, they spent their summers apart.|$|E

According to Goleman (2000), “Coercive leaders demand immediate compliance. Authoritative leaders mobilize people towards a vision. Affiliative leaders create <b>emotional</b> <b>bonds</b> and harmony. Democratic leaders build consensus through participation. Pacesetting leaders expect excellence and self-direction. And coaching leaders develop people for the future. However, leaders who get the best results don’t rely on just one leadership style; they use most of the styles in any given week”. Fiedler (1966) also proposed in his research that leaders should adjust their leadership styles based on the situation.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between humans and}} the quality of the environment have been examined primarily through two conceptual constructs: landscape aesthetics and place attachment or <b>emotional</b> place <b>bonding.</b> The former focuses on the physical environment and the latter focuses on the emotional or symbolic environment. This study focused on understanding the {{relationship between}} the two constructs, and provided a framework to integrate them toward a more comprehensive visual preference for landscapes. Nasar?s (1989) symbolic model was used as a guiding concept in the study. A web-based survey was used to collect people?s responses to landscapes portrayed in photographs. Four primary measures were used in the survey: landscape aesthetic, typicality (to a national park), <b>emotional</b> place <b>bonding,</b> and landscape visual preference. To further examine the effect of place meaning on responses to landscapes, respondents were told during the survey that landscape pictures were taken from different places, which were assigned randomly as place labels (national park, commercial recreation area, local park, and scenic area). Results indicated that <b>emotional</b> place <b>bonding</b> was significantly and positively influenced by perceived landscape aesthetics through four components: complexity, mystery, coherence, and legibility. Complexity and mystery had more influence on <b>emotional</b> place <b>bonding</b> than the other two components. Results also provided empirical support for Nasar?s (1989) symbolic model. The effect of landscape aesthetics on landscape visual preference was partially mediated by typicality and <b>emotional</b> place <b>bonding.</b> The typicality of a scene to a national park was found to positively influence people?s <b>emotional</b> <b>bonding</b> to the place. The four randomly assigned place labels did not elicit significantly different preferences or emotional responses to the places. This study documented how landscape aesthetics and <b>emotional</b> <b>bonding</b> can be integrated into visual preferences for landscapes. Results also provided evidence for the potential to use <b>emotional</b> <b>bonding</b> information to manage physical landscapes. The study contributes to our understanding and can assist with environment planning and management. Both physical appearance and symbolic/emotional meaning are very important to human perceptions of landscapes, and other attempts should be made to understand how the two constructs contribute to visual preference in future research...|$|R
