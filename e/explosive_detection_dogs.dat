40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{physiological}} factors that affect the sense of olfaction in dogs. The objectives {{of this study were}} to describe the canine nasal and oral microbiota in detection dogs. We sought to determine the bacterial composition of the nasal and oral microbiota of a diverse population of detection canines. Nasal and oral swabs were collected from healthy dogs (n = 81) from four locations-Alabama, Georgia, California, and Texas. Nasal and oral swabs were also collected from a second cohort of detection canines belonging to three different detection job categories: <b>explosive</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> (SP-E; n = 22), patrol and narcotics detection dogs (P-NDD; n = 15), and vapor wake dogs (VWD-E; n = 9). To understand if the nasal and oral microbiota of detection canines were variable, sample collection was repeated after 7 weeks in a subset of dogs. DNA was extracted from the swabs and used for 454 -pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA genes. Nasal samples had a significantly lower diversity than oral samples (P< 0. 01). Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were higher in nasal samples, while Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Tenericutes were higher in oral samples. Bacterial diversity was not significantly different based on the detection job. No significant difference in beta diversity was observed in the nasal samples based on the detection job. In oral samples, however, ANOSIM suggested a significant difference in bacterial communities based on job category albeit with a small effect size (R = 0. 1079, P = 0. 02). Analysis of the composition of bacterial communities using LEfSe showed that within the nasal samples, Cardiobacterium and Riemerella were higher in VWD-E dogs, and Sphingobacterium was higher in the P-NDD group. In the oral samples Enterococcus and Capnocytophaga were higher in the P-NDD group. Gemella and Aggregatibacter were higher in S-PE, and Pigmentiphaga, Chryseobacterium, Parabacteroides amongst others were higher within the VWD-E group. Our initial data also shows that there is a temporal variation in alpha diversity in nasal samples in detection canines...|$|E

She was later flown back to the Australian base in Tarin Kowt where they confirmed it was indeed Sarbi. Her rediscovery generated world-wide news and was mentioned by Kevin Rudd, and General Stanley McChrystal.|$|R
25|$|Brigadier Dawson {{said that}} the {{military}} would probably never {{know what had happened}} to Sarbi while she was missing, but said that her good health indicated somebody had been looking after her. A Queensland based trainer of a similar black Labrador <b>explosive</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> stated that it was probably due to the breed's excellent character that Sarbi had most likely been looked after by locals while missing, ensuring her survival. Misha Schubert the political correspondent for The Age jokingly questioned the official account that Sarbi's whereabouts while she was missing would never be known, suggesting she had been undercover on a secret mission, or that she had been captured by the Taliban as a prisoner of war, or had simply preferred to remain Absent Without Leave (AWOL).|$|R
50|$|Attack dog {{training}} is {{a variation of}} sentry dog training, only instead of bringing attention to an intruder, is trained to chase, hold and injure, or possibly kill, a perceived hostile target. Attack dogs are trained to interpret a situation and react accordingly. In formal training, the dogs are exposed to gunfire, traffic and other distractions to increase their effectiveness. Attack {{training is}} condemned by some as promoting ferocity in dogs; a 1975 American study showed that 10% of dogs that have bitten a person received attack dog training at some point. Dogs trained for military use as attack dogs, most often called patrol dogs, can be trained to perform <b>explosives</b> <b>detection</b> as well. Military contractors have been supplying the Department of Defense with nearly as many patrol and <b>explosives</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> s as the government trains in the recent wars in the Middle East.|$|R

Two of the students were arrested at Bartram Trail on November 6, and the third was arrested at their home. The Youth Resource Deputy had received anonymous tips and learned that they talked about the threat, wrote about it on the bathroom wall and got rid of the marker they had used. The students were sentenced to twenty-one days at a youth detention center while evaluations took place and after they were released they had to remain under curfew and other restrictions until the case was finished. It concluded with the students having to reimburse the county and the sheriff's office for the expense of the deployment.|$|R

40|$|Despite their {{important}} role in security, {{little is known about}} the energy requirements of working dogs such as odor, <b>explosive</b> and human <b>detection</b> <b>dogs.</b> Previous researchers have evaluated the energy requirements of individual canine breeds as well as dogs in exercise roles such as sprint racing. This study is the first to evaluate the energy requirements of working dogs trained in odor, <b>explosive</b> and human <b>detection.</b> This retrospective study evaluated twenty adult dogs who maintained consistent body weights over a six month period. During this time, the average energy consumption was 136 ± 38 kcal·BW_kg^ 0. 75136 ± 38 kcal⋅BWkg 0. 75 or two times the calculated resting energy requirement (RER= 70 kcal·BW_kg^ 0. 75 RER= 70 kcal⋅BWkg 0. 75). No statistical differences were found between breeds, age or sex, but a statistically significant association (p = 0. 0033, R-square = 0. 0854) was seen between the number of searches a dog performs and their energy requirement. Based on this study’s population, it appears that working dogs have maintenance energy requirements similar to the 1974 National Research Council’s (NRC) maintenance energy requirement of 132 kcal·BW_kg^ 0. 75132 kcal⋅BWkg 0. 75 (National Research Council (NRC), 1974) and the 139 ± 42 kcal·BW_kg^ 0. 75139 ± 42 kcal⋅BWkg 0. 75 reported for young laboratory beagles (Rainbird & Kienzle, 1990). Additional research is needed to determine if these data can be applied to all odor, <b>explosive</b> and human <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> and to determine if other types of working dogs (tracking, search and rescue etc.) have similar energy requirements...|$|R

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} how human beliefs affect working dog outcomes in an applied environment. We asked whether beliefs of scent <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> handlers affect team performance and evaluated relative importance of human versus dog influences on handlers’ beliefs. Eighteen drug and/or <b>explosive</b> <b>detection</b> dog/handler teams each completed two sets of four brief search scenarios (conditions). Handlers were falsely told that two conditions contained a paper marking scent location (human influence). Two conditions contained decoy scents (food/toy) to encourage dog interest in a false location (dog influence). Conditions were (1) control; (2) paper marker; (3) decoy scent; and (4) paper marker at decoy scent. No conditions contained drug or explosive scent; any alerting response was incorrect. A repeated measures {{analysis of variance was}} used with search condition as the independent variable and number of alerts as the dependent variable. Additional nonparametric tests compared human and dog influence. There were 225 incorrect responses, with no differences in mean responses across conditions. Response patterns differed by condition. There were more correct (no alert responses) searches in conditions without markers. Within marked conditions, handlers reported that dogs alerted more at marked locations than other locations. Handlers’ beliefs that scent was present potentiated handler identification of <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> alerts. Human more than dog influences affected alert locations. This confirms that handler beliefs affect outcomes of scent <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> deployments...|$|R
