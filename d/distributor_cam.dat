5000|$|One {{problem with}} this design is that, even with a {{properly}} sized capacitor, {{there will be some}} arcing at the points. Arcing causes the points to [...] "burn." [...] This in turn introduces resistance at the point contacts that reduces primary current and resulting spark intensity. A second problem involves the mechanical cam-follower block that rides on the <b>distributor</b> <b>cam</b> and opens the points. The block wears over time, reducing how much the points open (the [...] "point gap") and causing a corresponding change in both the ignition timing and the fraction of time during which the points are closed. Tune-ups for older vehicles usually involve replacing the points and condenser and setting the gap to factory specifications. A third problem involves the distributor cap and rotor. These components can develop conductive [...] "sneak paths" [...] on their surfaces (also called 'tracking') across which the coil's secondary voltage produces a current, often {{in the form of an}} arc, that bypasses the spark plug. When sneak paths develop, the only remedy is replacement of the cap and/or rotor. A fourth problem can arise when one or more of an engine's spark plugs becomes [...] "fouled." [...] Fouling, caused by combustion-byproducts that form deposits on a spark plug's internal insulator, creates an electrically conductive path that dissipates the coil's energy before its secondary voltage can rise high enough to produce a spark. So-called capacitive discharge ignition systems create coil voltages with much shorter rise times and can produce a spark across spark plugs with some fouling.|$|E
5000|$|The overall {{reliability}} of the 1999-2002 generation Nissan Quest was worse than the previous generation of Quests, and has received a [...] "Poor" [...] rating according to IIHS. It was also ranked the 2nd [...] "Worst Performing Vehicle". [...] The factory-made distributor was notorious for its defects. The 99-02 Quests used optical <b>distributors</b> whose <b>cam</b> sensors were especially prone to failure. A Yahoo! Group for Quest and Villager owners {{has come to a}} consensus that the Rich Porter NS60 distributor, which is compatible with '99-02 Quests and Villagers as well as with '96-04 Nissan Pathfinders, is less likely to fail than its factory-made counterpart.|$|R
50|$|The Villager was {{redesigned}} {{alongside the}} Quest for 1999, and facelifted for 2001, but sales remained slow. Designer Moray Callum {{was responsible for}} the Villager's distinctive exterior cues such as the waterfall-style grille. The second-generation Villager was available in three trim levels: Base, Sport, and the luxury Estate. From 1999 to 2002, Villagers used the same 3.3 liter V6 with 170 horsepower and 200 ft-lbs of torque used in the 1999-2002 Nissan Quest. Villager Estate models were the first Mercury automobiles to offer a rear-seat entertainment system option for $1,295, which was an Autovision 6.4-inch LCD flip-down screen connected to a VCR located under the control deck by the driver's seat. In 2001, the Villager received a minor freshening which included the introduction of a new grille and instrument gauges. The 2001-2002 Villagers had a MSRP price range from $22,510 to $27,210. 2002 was the last model year, concluding the Ford and Nissan joint venture. The last Mercury Villager rolled off the assembly line on June 27, 2002. The 1999-2002 Villager shared the same generation Nissan Quest's distributor, which was notorious for its defects. The 1999-2002 Quest and Villager used optical <b>distributors</b> whose <b>cam</b> sensors were especially prone to failure. Ford and Nissan went separate ways after the Villager-Quest project, with Nissan pursuing the development of the 2004 Nissan Quest while Mercury anticipated a version of the Ford Freestar called the Monterey.|$|R
