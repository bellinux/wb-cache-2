25|$|The {{following}} decades saw {{research by}} a group of scientists and doctors in the United States, including physicians Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neal D. Barnard, John A. McDougall, Michael Greger and biochemist T. Colin Campbell, who argued that diets based on animal fat and animal protein, such as the Western pattern diet, were detrimental to health. They produced a series of books that recommend vegan or vegetarian diets, including McDougall's The McDougall Plan (1983), John Robbins's Diet for a New America (1987), which associated meat eating with environmental damage, and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Dean</b> Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease (1990). In 2003 two major North American dietitians' associations indicated that well-planned vegan diets were suitable for all life stages. This was followed by the film Earthlings (2005), Campbell's The China Study (2005), Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin's Skinny Bitch (2005), Jonathan Safran Foer's Eating Animals (2009), and the film Forks over Knives (2011).|$|E

40|$|<b>Dr.</b> <b>Deans,</b> a {{fertility}} specialist, {{is meeting}} Lily {{and her husband}} Bill for the first time. As <b>Dr.</b> <b>Deans</b> gets to know her, he learns that Lily has wanted to have children {{since she was a}} little girl, but work—she lists her occupation as a corporate CEO— always seemed to get in the way. Now, at 53, she and her husband have decided to have a child before it is too late. Lily, who has undergone menopause, realizes that she no longer is able to have a child that will be genetically related to her, but she is willing to use donor eggs and her husband’s sperm to carry the child to term herself. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Deans</b> carefully takes a complete history and does a thorough workup and physical exam. As he finishes, Lily looks up at him hopefully. “So, ” she says, “can you help me to become a mother?” Under Lily’s expectant gaze, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Deans</b> realizes he has conflicting responses to her request. Pregnancy is always riskier the older a woman is, but, if he’s being honest with himself, there’s really no medical reason why he shouldn’t help Lily get pregnant. Lily is 2 years younger than the age at which the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s guidelines say IVF should be “discouraged ” [1], and sh...|$|R

The special committee assigned to look for Reveille VIII looked for a mascot that would be medium to large size, healthy, have an upbeat personality, be at ease around crowds and like people, be able to be calm around loud noises, and be positively motivated as well as not highly reactive.

2500|$|A {{study of}} varying amounts of {{fluoride}} in water {{was led by}} Dr. H. Trendley Dean, a dental officer of the U.S. Public Health Service. In 1936 and 1937, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Dean</b> and other dentists compared statistics from Amarillo, which had 2.8 – 3.9mg/L fluoride content, and low fluoride Wichita Falls. [...] The data is alleged to show fewer cavities in Amarillo children, but the studies were never published. Dr. Dean's research on the fluoride-dental caries relationship, published in 1942, included 7,000 children from 21 cities in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. [...] The study concluded that the optimal amount of fluoride which minimized the risk of severe fluorosis but had positive benefits for tooth decay was 1mg per day, per adult. [...] Although fluoride is more abundant in the environment today, this was estimated to correlate with the concentration of 1mg/L.|$|E
