5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid <b>graininess.</b> The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
25|$|An {{everyday}} {{example is}} the <b>graininess</b> that appears as photographs are enlarged; the <b>graininess</b> is due to Poisson fluctuations {{in the number of}} reduced silver grains, not to the individual grains themselves. By correlating the <b>graininess</b> with the degree of enlargement, one can estimate the contribution of an individual grain (which is otherwise too small to be seen unaided). Many other molecular applications of Poisson noise have been developed, e.g., estimating the number density of receptor molecules in a cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|For example, film grain is {{quantified}} as <b>graininess</b> via {{a measurement}} of film density fluctuations {{as seen through}} a 0.048mm sampling aperture.|$|E
25|$|In early 1970 it {{was decided}} to change the planned name of the film and the {{associated}} album from Get Back to Let It Be, matching the group's March 1970 single release. The final version of the film was blown-up from full-frame 16mm to 35 mm film for theatrical release, which increased the film's <b>graininess.</b> To create the wider theatrical aspect ratio, {{the top and bottom of}} the frame was cropped, necessitating the repositioning of every single shot for optimal picture composition.|$|E
25|$|Images of auroras are {{significantly}} more common today {{than in the}} past due to the increase in use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities. Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties. Due to the different color spectrum present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of film can be very important. Longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with <b>graininess.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Kodak {{introduced}} the T-Grain emulsion, a technological advancement {{in the shape}} and make-up of silver halide grains in their films. T-Grain is a tabular silver halide grain that allows for greater overall surface area, resulting in greater light sensitivity with a relatively small grain and a more uniform shape that results in a less overall <b>graininess</b> to the film. This made for sharper and more sensitive films. The T-Grain technology was first employed in Kodak's EXR line of motion picture color negative stocks. This was further refined in 1996 with the Vision line of emulsions, followed by Vision2 in the early 2000s and Vision3 in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Optical effects artist Dunn {{claimed that}} [...] "up to 80 percent of some reels was {{optically}} printed." [...] These shots were traditionally attributed to Toland for years. The optical printer improved {{some of the}} deep focus shots. One problem with the optical printer was that it sometimes created excessive <b>graininess,</b> such as the optical zoom out of the snow globe. Welles decided to superimpose snow falling to mask the <b>graininess</b> in these shots. Toland said that he disliked {{the results of the}} optical printer, but acknowledged that [...] "RKO special effects expert Vernon Walker, ASC, and his staff handled their part of the production—a by no means inconsiderable assignment—with ability and fine understanding." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{taste is}} light and crisp, with some bite from the carbonation. [...] Brewing and tasting notes from a 1914 {{publication}} described Grodziskie as a [...] "rough, bitter beer ... with an intense smoke and hop flavor", {{but by the}} late 20th century, the style's flavor had likely evolved to include less hop flavor and bitterness. [...] Modern recreations of this style {{tend to focus on}} smoky flavor resulting from the oak-smoked malt, described as [...] "somewhat acrid to semi-sweet", but literature from the 1960s states that a significant proportion of the beer's unique flavors are produced by its malting and brewing process and special strains of brewer's yeast that were used in its production. [...] The flavor may also contain a mild wheat <b>graininess</b> noticeable in the background.|$|E
500|$|To {{distinguish}} each of {{the three}} product launches depicted in the movie, Danny Boyle and cinematographer Alwin Küchler implemented three different film formats: 16mm for 1984, 35mm for 1988, and digital for 1998. They also wanted {{each of the}} film's three time periods to visually reflect Jobs' own development at the time. For instance, Küchler explains that the filming at Flint Center, De Anza college for the first act combined the <b>graininess</b> of 16mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional, spontaneous look – much in the vein of how Jobs is portrayed at that time. The third act, shot with an Arri Alexa at the Davies Symphony Hall, incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs' own design philosophies of the iMac and subsequent Apple hardware. Küchler describes his experience filming Steve Jobs as [...] "brilliant and challenging at the same time", and that the goal was to [...] "make sure that the visuals kept up with the words", in reference to the production's collaboration between Boyle and Sorkin.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the quality}} of the film, second-generation copies or copies from TV and DVD {{productions}} are inferior to first-generation copies. Many early frames are blurry due to camera shake, and {{the quality of}} subsequent frames varies for the same reason. Stabilization of the film (e.g., by M.K. Davis) to counter the effect of camera shake has improved viewers' ability to analyze it. Regarding [...] "graininess," [...] Bill Munns writes, [...] "Based on transparencies taken off the camera original, [...] [...] [...] the PGF original is as fine grain as any color 16mm film can achieve." [...] He adds that <b>graininess</b> increases as images are magnified.|$|E

50|$|Otto H. Schade (April 27, 1903 - April 28, 1981) was a noted {{television}} pioneer, {{best known}} for his work on evaluating the gradation, <b>graininess</b> and sharpness in film and television images, and his aperture theory that mathematically modeled the system performance of photographic lenses, films, television tubes, and electrical circuits.|$|E
50|$|At {{least two}} {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to measure distances to NGC 404. The infrared surface brightness fluctuations distance measurement technique estimates distances to spiral galaxies based on the <b>graininess</b> of the appearance of their bulges.

5000|$|Abrams' {{original}} {{plan was to}} film all of the sequences for the film-within-a-film, [...] "The Case", in Super-8 using Pro8mm stock and cameras. However, this approach proved unsuccessful, as visual effects house Industrial Light and Magic {{found it impossible to}} integrate CGI into the footage due to the format's <b>graininess.</b> For sequences involving CGI, cinematographer Larry Fong used Super-16 instead.|$|E
50|$|In Western countries, the readily {{and widely}} {{available}} peanut butter {{is often used}} as a substitute ingredient to make peanut sauce, however the texture of peanut butter is too smooth and soft.

5000|$|Kodak {{has defined}} a [...] "Print Grain Index" [...] (PGI) to {{characterize}} film grain (color negative films only), based on perceptual just-noticeable difference of <b>graininess</b> in prints. They also define [...] "granularity", a measurement of grain using an RMS measurement of density fluctuations in uniformly exposed film, {{measured with a}} microdensitometer with 48 micrometre aperture. Granularity varies with exposure — underexposed film looks grainier than overexposed film.|$|E

50|$|Bleach bypass, {{also known}} as skip bleach or silver retention, is an optical effect which entails either the partial or {{complete}} skipping of the bleaching function during the processing of a color film. By doing this, the silver is retained in the emulsion along with the color dyes. The result is a black-and-white image over a color image. The images usually have reduced saturation and exposure latitude, along with increased contrast and <b>graininess.</b> It usually is used to maximum effect {{in conjunction with a}} one-stop underexposure.|$|E
50|$|Aliasing {{can occur}} in optical and {{chemical}} processing, {{but it is more}} common and easily understood in digital processing. It occurs whenever an optical or digital image is sampled or re-sampled at a rate which is too low for its resolution. Some digital cameras and scanners have anti-aliasing filters to reduce aliasing by intentionally blurring the image to match the sampling rate. It is common for film developing equipment used to make prints of different sizes to increase the <b>graininess</b> of the smaller size prints by aliasing.|$|E
50|$|The MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes have {{detected}} that among gamma-ray photons arriving from the blazar Markarian 501, some photons at different energy levels arrived at different times, suggesting {{that some of}} the photons had moved more slowly and thus contradicting the theory of general relativity's notion of the speed of light being constant, a discrepancy which could be explained by the irregularity of quantum foam. More recent experiments were, however, unable to confirm the supposed variation on the speed of light due to <b>graininess</b> of space.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} the image was {{expanded}} horizontally when projected meant {{that there could be}} visible <b>graininess</b> and brightness problems. To combat this, larger film formats were developed (initially a too-costly 55 mm for Carousel and The King and I) and then abandoned (both films were eventually reduction printed at 35 mm, although the aspect ratio was kept at 2.55:1). Later Fox re-released The King and I in the 65/70 mm format. The initial problems with grain and brightness were eventually reduced thanks to improvements in film stock and lenses.|$|E
5000|$|At {{least two}} {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to measure distances to NGC 185. The surface brightness fluctuations distance measurement technique estimates distances to galaxies based on the <b>graininess</b> of their appearance. The distance measured to NGC 185 using this technique is 2.08 ± 0.15 Mly (640 ± 50 kpc). However, NGC 185 is close enough that the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method may be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to NGC 185 using this technique is 2.02 ± 0.2 Mly (620 ± 60 kpc).|$|E
5000|$|Dithering {{is used in}} {{computer}} graphics {{to create the illusion}} of [...] "color depth" [...] in images with a limited color palette - a technique also known as color quantization. In a dithered image, colors that are not available in the palette are approximated by a diffusion of colored pixels from within the available palette. The human eye perceives the diffusion as a mixture of the colors within it (see color vision). Dithered images, particularly those with relatively few colors, can often be distinguished by a characteristic <b>graininess</b> or speckled appearance.|$|E
50|$|Reception for {{the game}} has been {{generally}} negative. Although, the game has received some praise for its claymation cutscenes, it has been noted to be otherwise lacking graphically. Primarily, criticism {{has been on the}} <b>graininess</b> and lack of detail of the characters and stages. In addition, although there has been praise for the thematic diversity of characters and stages, the game has been criticized in ultimately lacking replay value due to missing variety within character movesets. Furthermore, the criticism of replay value has also been fueled by lack of gameplay elements within stages, and repetitiveness in character storylines.|$|E

5000|$|Black-and-white {{film has}} a [...] "shiny" [...] {{side and a}} [...] "dull" [...] side. The dull side is the emulsion, a gelatin that suspends an array of silver halide {{crystals}}. These crystals contain silver grains that determine how sensitive the film is to light exposure, and how fine or grainy the negative the print will look. Larger grains mean faster exposure but a grainier appearance; smaller grains are finer looking but take more exposure to activate. The <b>graininess</b> of film is represented by its ISO factor; generally a multiple of 10 or 100. Lower numbers produce finer grain but slower film, and vice versa.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing the 3DO version, a Next Generation critic remarked, [...] "As we've come to expect, the {{full-motion video}} is slickly produced, but the screen res and frame rate are choppy, and ALM's overacting is still there." [...] He {{also stated that}} the slow aiming cursor makes the game unplayable without a Gamegun. Air Hendrix of GamePro concurred that the FMV suffers from <b>graininess,</b> choppy frame rates, and overacting, but contended that both the control pad and Gamegun work poorly in the game. He concluded, [...] "If you chuckle through low-budget cop flicks, {{blasting}} through these cornball scenes might plaster a goofy grin on your face. Just rent it, though." ...|$|E
