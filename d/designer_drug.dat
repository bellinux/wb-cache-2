25|$|Like MDMA, MPPP is a <b>designer</b> <b>drug,</b> but {{its effects}} are {{more akin to}} {{morphine}} or other opiates. Despite the similarity in name, MDMA and MPPP are unrelated {{and should not be}} conflated.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, <b>designer</b> <b>drug</b> users took MPTP, {{which created}} a Parkinsonian syndrome. Later that same year, {{researchers}} reproduced the effect in non-human primates. Over {{the next seven}} years, the brain areas that were over- and under-active in Parkinson's were mapped out in normal and MPTP-treated macaque monkeys using metabolic labelling and microelectrode studies. In 1990, deep brain lesions were shown to treat Parkinsonian symptoms in macaque monkeys treated with MPTP, and these were followed by pallidotomy operations in humans with similar efficacy. By 1993, it was shown that deep brain stimulation could effect the same treatment without causing a permanent lesion of the same magnitude. Deep brain stimulation has largely replaced pallidotomy for treatment of Parkinson's patients that require neurosurgical intervention. Current estimates are that 20,000 Parkinson's patients have received this treatment.|$|E

Other <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> mimic the effects of psychoactive drugs. Since the late 1990s there has been the identification {{of many of these}} synthesised drugs.

40|$|New <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> are {{constantly}} emerging onto the illicit drug market {{and it is}} often difficult to validate and maintain comprehensive analytical methods for accurate detection of these compounds. Generally, toxicology laboratories utilize a screening method, such as immunoassay, for the presumptive identification of drugs of abuse. When a positive result occurs, confirmatory methods, such as gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), are required for more sensitive and specific analyses. In recent years, the need to study the activities of these compounds in screening assays as well as to develop confirmatory techniques to detect them in biological specimens has been recognized. Severe intoxications and fatalities have been encountered with emerging <b>designer</b> <b>drugs,</b> presenting analytical challenges for detection and identification of such novel compounds. The first major task of this research was to evaluate the performance of commercially available immunoassays to determine if <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> were cross-reactive. The second major task was to develop and validate a confirmatory method, using LC-MS, to identify and quantify these <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> in biological specimens. Cross-reactivity towards the cathinone derivatives was found to be minimal. Several other phenethylamines demonstrated cross-reactivity at low concentrations, but results were consistent with those published by the assay manufacturer or as reported in the literature. Current immunoassay-based screening methods may not be ideal for presumptively identifying most <b>designer</b> <b>drugs,</b> including the “bath salts. ” For this reason, an LC-MS based confirmatory method was developed for 32 compounds, including eight cathinone derivatives, with limits of quantification in the range of 1 - 10 ng/mL. The method was fully validated for selectivity, matrix effects, stability, recovery, precision, and accuracy. In order to compare the screening and confirmatory techniques, several human specimens were analyzed to demonstrate the importance of using a specific analytical method, such as LC-MS, to detect <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> in serum as immunoassays lack cross-reactivity with the novel compounds. Overall, minimal cross-reactivity was observed, highlighting the conclusion that these presumptive screens cannot detect many of the <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> and that a confirmatory technique, such as the LC-MS, is required for the comprehensive forensic toxicological analysis of <b>designer</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how experimentation with <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> is {{mediated by the}} Internet. We selected a popular drug forum that presents reports on self-experimentation with little or even completely unexplored <b>designer</b> <b>drugs</b> to examine: (1) how participants report their “trying out” of new compounds and (2) how participants reduce the pharmacological uncertainty associated with using these substances. Our methods included passive observation online, engaging more actively with the online community using an avatar, and off-line interviews with key interlocutors to validate our online findings. This article reflects on how forum participants experiment with <b>designer</b> <b>drugs,</b> their trust in suppliers and the testimonials of others, the use of ethno-scientific techniques that involve numerical weighing, “allergy dosing,” {{and the use of}} standardized trip reports. We suggest that these techniques contribute to a sense of control {{in the face of the}} possible toxicity of unknown or little-known <b>designer</b> <b>drugs.</b> The online reporting of effects allows users to experience not only the thrill of a new kind of high but also connection with others in the self-experimenting drug community...|$|R
