50|$|Taxi <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> were {{areas where}} dancers, mainly young women {{referred}} to as taxi dancers, were paid to dance with patrons who were usually male. During the 1920s and the 1930s, <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> were incredibly popular among immigrant men. It was in these <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> that the dancing skills of Filipinos were noted as splendid and exemplary. It was common to see many of the period's most popular dances being performed here, dances such as the Lindy Hop, swing, shimmy and more. The way in which Filipino dancers presented themselves was also {{a demonstration of the}} Filipino assimilation within American society. Taxi <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> were one of the few environments in which Filipinos and Americans were given the opportunity to socialize with one another. As a result of this social interaction, it was also common to see anti-Filipino sentiment in these <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> as at the this time period was the Tydings-Mcduffie Act in 1934.|$|R

The John Millington, a Grade II listed building, was formerly Millington Hall, built for Stockport alderman John Millington. A row of cottages near to the hall served as a meeting place for local Methodists from 1814, before a purpose-built chapel was established. A Sunday school was also established in the same place. The King's Hall was built in 1937, and was originally a <b>dance</b> <b>hall</b> before its conversion into a restaurant and public house.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s when {{the lake was}} called Long Pond, it housed two <b>dance</b> <b>halls,</b> Wallace Grove and Morrills Grove. These <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> were a very popular retreat on summer nights for many locals, some coming {{from as far away}} as Boston. Soldiers would take the train up from Fort Devens with the hope of meeting a special lady. Both of these <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> have been closed for a long time, but the lake remains a retreat for many in the summer and winter months.|$|R

50|$|However Terrific Street's {{dominance}} {{was short}} lived, and would slowly come to and end by 1921 after {{the momentum of}} a reform movement and a newspaper’s crusade caused dancing and women to be forbidden from its many <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> and cafes. The final blow to Terrific Street's popularity came when Prohibition was passed in 1920 and stopped the flow of alcohol to its <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> and saloons. After prohibition that block lost much excitement and its <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> and cabarets were gradually replaced by offices, hotels, and warehouses.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} decade, {{the casino}} began exhibiting burlesque and vaudeville acts to draw crowds, and a raised stage was installed for the live performances. The building eventually became village property, and housed the town's fire house. Known as Firemen's Hall, {{the building was}} also used by the town's fire department as a basketball court. Basketball was extremely popular in Rosendale in the 1940s. On Friday nights the Firemen's Hall became a <b>dance</b> <b>hall,</b> and people would sometimes square dance in formal attire.|$|E

The Houston brothers were both born in Tonypandy, with Donald gaining better success as a film actor, with memorable roles in The Blue Lagoon (1949) and Ealing's <b>Dance</b> <b>Hall</b> (1950). Glyn Houston acted primarily in British B-Movies, and was better known as a television actor.|$|E

50|$|The closed <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> {{were the}} first version of latter-day taxi <b>dance</b> <b>halls.</b> They were called closed, because {{most of the time the}} only women {{permitted}} in the club were the taxi dancers. The final blow, which ended the entertainment scene, came in 1921 when taxi dancing and its closed <b>dance</b> <b>halls</b> were also forbidden by law. Prohibition would also cause a complete absence of alcohol in 1920. In 1917 the brothels were eventually closed down due to the Red Light Abatement Act, but by that time all the excitement of Terrific Street had long since vanished.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} World War II {{broke out in}} 1939, Boosey & Hawkes had also signed Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland. It was Ralph Hawkes who championed Britten {{when he was still}} {{relatively}} unknown, often against the rest of the board of directors, until the première on 7 June 1945 of Peter Grimes, which was a critical and popular success. Sheet music sales soared during the War, enabling Boosey & Hawkes to buy Editions Russes which held the rights to the most valuable works of Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky. The company also purchased the lease of the Royal Opera House in London in 1944, rescuing it from becoming a permanent <b>dance</b> <b>hall</b> and providing a venue for world-class ballet and opera in the capital.|$|E

5|$|The {{music hall}} and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889.

In 1911, the <b>dance</b> <b>hall</b> Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère.

5|$|A {{number of}} listed {{buildings}} {{are located in}} and around the town centre. Arguably the most significant is Crow Hall, a Grade II* listed building, is an early 18th-century sandstone and ashlar, one-room deep building at Crowhall Lane. The adjacent Crow Hall Cottage and gate piers are Grade II listed buildings. At Victoria Terrace stands Felling post office; a two-story course sandstone building with quoins and a Welsh slate roof. Close by is the Imperial Bingo Club, built as a <b>dance</b> <b>hall</b> in 1927 and converted to a bingo hall in 1930, at Victoria Square. Both are Grade II listed buildings. Also a Grade II listed building is Ardallan; the first house built at Holly-Hill field in Felling constructed of sandstone and with three sash windows. The gates, gate piers and walls are also Grade II listed. Almost immediately next door stands a house and shop at 35 Davison Street; another Grade II listed building.|$|E

5|$|The Half Day area {{experienced}} an economic boom {{with the arrival}} of new settlers during the two decades after Wright's arrival. Among these pioneers were Seth Washburn, the first postmaster of the Vernon Township, who settled at the site of what later became the Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103's Half Day Intermediate School, and Laura Sprague, the first teacher to reside in the area. By 1855, 21years after the settling of the Half Day area by Wright, the town was a thriving community with a blacksmith's shop, sawmill, country store, and a church. At this time, the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad connected Milwaukee to the county seat of Waukegan, and it expanded throughout the Lake County area over the next few decades; this also contributed to the town's prosperity. Henry Ford's invention of the automobile in the early 20thcentury made Half Day a more accessible destination to other communities within the Chicago metropolitan area, and the village became a popular recreation area. This prompted the opening of many businesses, including an amusement park, a race track, a bowling alley, a <b>dance</b> <b>hall,</b> and taverns, that catered to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five {{cents for}} {{no more than a few}} minutes of {{entertainment}} was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase a ticket to a major vaudeville theater; when America's first amusement park opened in Coney Island the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a <b>dance</b> <b>hall.</b> The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.|$|E
