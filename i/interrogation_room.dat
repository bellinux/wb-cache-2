Breyer {{disagreed}} with the majority's holding that fair-minded jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody. Breyer held that the actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were {{not as important as}} what the police did do. Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an <b>interrogation</b> <b>room,</b> kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E

25|$|Due to Reeves' neck injury, some of {{the action}} scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery.

Locations for these scenes included Martin Place's fountain in Sydney, half-way {{between it and the}} adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself.

25|$|When {{the detectives}} are certain {{they have the}} right suspect(s), the police will take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a search and/or arrest warrant (though {{sometimes}} the commanding officer will consult with the New York City District Attorney's office to see if the case is strong enough) and whether or not any backup (such as uniformed officers or an armed tactical team) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with the police sometimes having to chase the accused through the streets of New York. The scene then shifts to the <b>interrogation</b> <b>room</b> where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s) until they ask for a lawyer, their defense attorney shows up and asks the suspect not to talk anymore, or the Assistant District Attorney from the D.A.'s office decides they have enough to press charges.|$|E
25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the <b>interrogation</b> <b>room,</b> they {{explained}} that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police interview techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was free to go. She left the room and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E

40|$|In 1965, Yale Kamisar {{published}} a now-famous essay entitled, Equal Justice in the Gatehouses and Mansions of American Criminal Procedure: From Powell to Gideon, from Escobedo to [...] . {{to make his}} case that the Court needed to take action to protect citizens in <b>interrogation</b> <b>rooms,</b> Kamisar used the powerful metaphors of the gatehouse and the mansion to contrast the treatment received in <b>interrogation</b> <b>rooms</b> in the back of police stations with the way defendants were treated when they arrived at courthouses where {{the power of the state}} was restricted and they had strong constitutional protections. On its 50 th anniversary since publication, this essay revisits the gatehouses and the mansions and shows that Kamisar’s metaphor breaks down today. In the mansions, defendants will often face enormous pressures to incriminate themselves and plead guilty. Many defendants who have colorable defenses simply cannot afford the risks of trial. The essay ends by suggesting that if we are to restore the mansion to Kamisar’s image of what once did and should happen in the courthouse, we need to ask some painful questions about what has happened to our criminal justice system in the nearly fifty years since Kamisar wrote his essay...|$|R
