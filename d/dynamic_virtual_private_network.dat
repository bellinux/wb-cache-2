40|$|We extend {{traditional}} Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with fault-tolerance {{and dynamic}} membership properties, defining a <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> (DVPN). We require no new hardware {{and make no}} special assumptions about line security. An implementation exhibits low overheard, provides guarantees of authenticity and confidentiality to any IP application running over the virtual network. Our system is lightweight, allowing {{the use of multiple}} finegrained VPNs. Instead of using many point-to-point secure connections to bridge insecure communication paths we share a single symmetric encryption key throughout the VPN. This permits tight control of the VPN membership and fast dynamic membership change. Since we lower the cost of a single DVPN, we propose using multiple DVPNs to implement fine grained security. By enforcing policies over communication between DVPNs, our scheme supports multilevel security. 1 Introduction We say that a Virtual Private Network (VPN) exists bet [...] ...|$|E

The study of these network architectures in a real environment is almost impossible because it requires {{a very large number}} of equipment, however, this task is feasible in a simulation environment like OPNET Modeler, provided to master both the tool and the different architectures of the <b>Dynamic</b> Multipoint <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Network.</b> Several research studies have been conducted to automate the generation and {{simulation of}} complex networks under various simulators, according to our research no work has dealt with the <b>Dynamic</b> Multipoint <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Network.</b> In this paper we present a simulation model of the <b>Dynamic</b> and Multipoint <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>network</b> in OPNET Modeler, and a WEB-based tool for project management on the same network.

International audienceIn {{this paper}} we address the {{architecture}} of an efficient connection manager in hierarchical <b>dynamic</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> (HDVPN). HDVPNs encapsulate the delivery over a WAN of concurrent multicast sessions with security and QoS guarantees. Their main feature is {{a high degree of}} change in terms of membership, implying the necessity for fast reconfiguration and provisioning. We propose a Management Configuration Component based on already proven design patterns in order to cope with the high dynamicity encountered. The more general framework is the management of residential user TV multicast, where an heterogeneous ATM/IP based network supports the delivery of TV content to all clients having subscribed to a HDVPN...|$|R

50|$|The Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) is an {{extension}} of the ATM ARP routing mechanism that is sometimes used to improve the efficiency of routing computer network traffic over Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) Networks. It is defined in IETF RFC 2332, and further described in RFC 2333. It can be used by a sender to determine a route with the fewest number of hops to a receiver. The protocol differs from ARP-type protocols in that it allows routing optimization across multiple IP subnets. NHRP is implemented by means of next-hop servers across IP subnets. The NHRP forms a part of the Multiprotocol Encapsulation over ATM (MPOA) protocol as described in RFC 2684. It also plays a role in Cisco's <b>Dynamic</b> Multipoint <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Network.</b> A limitation of NHRP is its inability to improve multicast protocols.|$|R

By {{relying on a}} sequence of concatenated protection mechanisms (GPRS ciphering and VPN deployment), {{it is possible to}} provide secure remote access to mobile users without requiring an extra tunnel overhead on the radio link or the implementation of computationally intense encryption algorithms in the mobile station. The VPN functionality is based on IPsec. For VPN initialization and key agreement procedures an Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol proxy scheme is proposed, which enables the mobile user to initiate a VPN, while shifting complex key negotiation to the network infrastructure. The required enhancements for security service provision can be integrated in the existing network infrastructure, and therefore, the proposed security scheme can be used as an add-on feature of the GPRS...|$|R

40|$|As {{internet}} usage grows exponentially, {{network security}} issues become increasingly important. Network security measures {{are needed to}} protect data during transmission. Various security controls are used to prevent the access of hackers in networks. They are firewall, <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> and encryption algorithms. Out of these, the <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>network</b> plays {{a vital role in}} preventing hackers from accessing the <b>networks.</b> A <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> (VPN) provides end users with a way to privately access information on their network over a public network infrastructure such as the internet. Using a technique called “Tunneling”, data packets are transmitted across a public routed network, such as the internet that simulates a point-to-point connection. <b>Virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> provide customers with a secure and low-cost communication environment. The basic structure of the virtual circuit is to create a logical path from the source port to the destination port. This path may incorporate many hops between routers for the formation of the circuit. The final, logical path or virtual circuit acts {{in the same way as}} a direct connection between the two ports. Our proposed Provisioning Restorable <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> Algorithm (PRA) is used to combine the provisioning and restoration algorithms to achieve better results than the ones obtained by independent restoration and provisioning. In order to ensure service quality and availability in <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Networks,</b> seamless recovery from failures is essential. The quality of service of the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> is also improved due to the combination of provisioning and restoration. The bandwidth sharing concept is also applied in link to improve the quality of service in the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Network.</b> The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out in terms of cost, the number of nodes, the number of VPN nodes, delay, asymmetric ratio and delay with constraints with Disjoint Path Algorithm and Approximation Restoration <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> Algorithm. The Provisioning Restorable <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Networks</b> Algorithm performs better than the Disjoint Path Algorithm...|$|R
