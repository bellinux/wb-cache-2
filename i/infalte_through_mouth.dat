40|$|There {{are several}} case reports of {{complications}} of ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Extrusion of the peritoneal {{end of the}} shunt <b>through</b> <b>mouth</b> is extremely rare. There are few case reports. We are reporting one such case. A 1 -year male child was admitted with the peritoneal end of ventriculo-peritoneal shunt coming out <b>through</b> <b>mouth</b> since 6 hours after an episode of vomiting. He was conscious and had no neurological deficits. The anterior fontanelle was depressed. There was no infection. The peritoneal end of the shunt was removed <b>through</b> the <b>mouth.</b> Shunt revision was performed. The patient was discharged 10 days after the revision without any complications. At 1 -year follow-up the patient is doing well. Possible mechanisms of bowel perforation are discussed. Pulling the peritoneal end <b>through</b> <b>mouth</b> {{is probably the best}} way of management as small spontaneous gut perforation seals off spontaneously. It also decreases the possibility of infection, other morbidities, and hospital stay...|$|R
