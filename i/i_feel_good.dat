He described this in 2006: [...] "I have gotten in grooves before, {{and you try to}} stay in it {{as long as you can}} until it ends. And it does end. I've been notorious for that my whole career, where I'll hit five or six in a week, where it seems like I can't miss the pitch and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> in the batter's box." [...] The most famous of these came in 2010, when Ross's torrid hitting in the playoffs helped San Francisco win the 2010 World Series.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. In {{his review of}} The Open Door, Ed Thompson of the website IGN, stated that the fans who were [...] "looking for the full-blown piano ballad" [...] reminiscent of [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2004) {{had to wait until}} the album's final track. He added {{that at the end of}} the album they were awarded with [...] "not only the most beautiful song on the album, but also the most unique song Lee has ever released." [...] He further said, [...] "despite Lee's voice giving the tune a funereal cast, there is no hiding the fact that the lyrics are of an upbeat nature. 'Shouldn't have to torture me so sweetly, now I can't let go of this dream, I can't breathe but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> enough, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> enough for you.'" [...] Bill Lamb of the website About.com, put the song in his list of Top Tracks from The Open Door along with [...] "Sweet Sacrifice", [...] "Call Me When You're Sober", [...] "Your Star" [...] and [...] "Lacrymosa". Jon Dolan from Entertainment Weekly said that [...] " [...] the deceptively soft 'Good Enough' flirts again with the dark side, offering 'Drink up sweet decadence / I can't say no to you' and striking a final note of cathartic badness." [...] Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Lee's [...] "newfound confidence" [...] is evident in the song. In his review of The Open Door, Andree Farias of Christianity Today concluded that though the song [...] "leaves a sweet taste in your mouth", it may not mean much in [...] "a scheme." [...] He added that the song stands as a contrast to everything else in the album.|$|E
500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget." ...|$|E

In the third, a 30-second clip, set at the bar, Tom describes to Mark his strategy in picking up a girl: he {{asked her what she}} did for a living, then, [...] "I just yawned, gave her the middle finger and left. Pretty risky but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> about it." [...] In the final clip, which was 15 seconds long, an amused Tom shows a newspaper photo caption of Leslie and Ann from the banquet, with the caption, [...] "Mr. Leslie Knope and wife Ann." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee for her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler. It was {{produced}} by Dave Fortman and recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles.

While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for me because it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, for me because I had to tell the truth and the truth is, <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> <b>good</b> now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write from my heart and be genuine, because I think that's what people loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|E

2500|$|During March 2007, Blagojevich {{announced}} and {{campaigned for}} his universal healthcare plan, Illinois Covered. The plan was debated in the Illinois State Senate, but came one vote short of passing. He proposed {{to pay for}} the plan with the largest tax increase in Illinois history. He proposed a gross receipts tax on businesses, a $7.6 billion tax increase, with proceeds earmarked to provide universal healthcare in Illinois, increase education spending by $1.5 billion, fund a $25 billion capital construction plan, and reduce the State's $40 billion pension debt. Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan called for a vote on a non-binding resolution on whether the state should impose a gross receipts tax. When it became apparent that the resolution would be defeated, Blagojevich announced at the last minute that supporters should vote against it, although the vote was intended to be a test vote to gauge whether the measure had any support. The request was seen by many lawmakers from both parties as an attempt to spin the loss positively. It was defeated by a vote of 107–0, which the Associated Press termed [...] "jaw-dropping."
