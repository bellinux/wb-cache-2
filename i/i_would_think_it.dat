500|$|Over {{the course}} of several years, Grant's {{political}} opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market-based philosophies. Alan Grant commented on the philosophical pattern the character's transformation took for a 1997 interview: [...] "Although I haven’t read them in chronological order <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be quite easy to see the parallel between Anarky’s thought processes and my own thought processes." [...] By 1997 he had settled on the philosophy of Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace. At approximately the same time he was when given the opportunity to write an Anarky mini-series, and so decided to revamp the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. [...] "I felt he was the perfect character" [...] to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, [...] "because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness". This new characterization was later carried on in the 1999 Anarky ongoing series.|$|E

5000|$|On April 28, 2009, {{during a}} {{discussion}} on torture with Clifford May, Stewart expressed his opinion that former President Harry S.

The helm was lashed on the port tack, the haulyards set taut, and all hands down to the lad who was the cook's scullion proceeded to get drunk. I took the precaution to have a hanger at my side and to slip one of Cockle's pistols within the band of my breeches. I was in an exquisite' agony of indecision as to what manner to act and how to defend myself from their drunken brutality, for I well knew that if I refused to imbibe with them I should probably be murdered for my abstemiousness; and, if I drank, the stuff was so near to alcohol that I could not hope to keep my senses. While in this predicament I received a polite invitation to partake in the captain's company, which I did not see my way clear to refuse, and repaired to the cabin accordingly.|$|E

Indeed, if it hadn't been for the other matter that set me {{thinking}} and bred doubts of its own about her, I wouldn't dream of mixing her up in this. But I'm safe on Corbeck.

6000|$|Near {{the middle}} of the field was two women working together, raking as {{steadily}} as if they had been brought up to it. One of these was young, and even handsomer than Miss Dick, which was the name of the bar lady. To look at her made me think of what I had read of Queen Marie Antoinette and her court ladies playing the part of milkmaids. Her straw hat was trimmed with delicate flowers, and her white muslin dress and pale blue ribbons made her the prettiest picture I ever saw out-of-doors. I could not help asking Mrs. Locky who she was, and she told me that she was the chambermaid at the inn, and the other was the cook. When I heard this I didn't make any answer, but just walked off a little way and began raking and thinking. I have often wondered why it is that English servants are so different from those we have, or, to put it in a strictly confidential way between you and me, madam, why the chambermaid at the [...] "Bordley Arms," [...] as she is, is so different from me, as I used to be when I first lived with you. Now that young chambermaid with the pretty hat is, as far as appearances go, as good a woman as I am, and if Jone was a bachelor and intended to marry her <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was as good a match as if he married me. But the difference between us two is that when I got to be the kind of woman I am I wasn't willing to be a servant, and if I had always been the kind of young woman that chambermaid is I never would have been a servant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, father, {{she told}} me that she had done it all on purpose, and had sacrificed herself in order that I might benefit from it. This was all horrible! And then she {{actually}} proposed that I should not only keep silent about this, but offered to come forward and declare that it was her son who had the mole on his shoulder, so that I might get the whole and Rupert none. I don't want to say what I felt. I only told her <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> over. I have been thinking it over, and I am going away. My dear father and mother, for I shall always think of you so, I thank you for all your love and kindness, which I have received through a horrible fraud. If it had all been an accident, and you had found out for yourselves by the likeness that Rupert was your son, I do not think that I should have minded, at least nothing like so much. I should, of course, have been very grieved that you were not my father and mother, and that Rupert and Madge were not my brother and sister; but it would have been nobody's fault, and I am sure that you would all still have loved me. But to know that it has been a wicked fraud, that I have been an impostor palmed upon you, that there has been a plot and conspiracy to rob you, and that I have a mother who not only did this, but who could propose to me to go on deceiving you, and even to join in a fresh fraud and to swindle Rupert, is so awful that there is nothing for me to do but to go away.|$|E

5000|$|When the NFL {{decided to}} add an {{expansion}} team in 1998, Toronto {{was one of three}} finalists (along with Houston and Los Angeles) considered. [...] At the time, Tagliabue said that [...] "the CFL and NFL could fit together in Canada." [...] By this time there were questions whether SkyDome was a viable long-term NFL venue, with Godfrey developing plans for a new stadium near Downsview Park. [...] Then Toronto mayor Mel Lastman ruled out funding from the city, saying [...] "no money for professional sports". [...] It was speculated that if Toronto's bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics were successful, the stadium constructed for the games could be repurposed for a NFL club. [...] When it became clear that Toronto was not likely to get the expansion team, Godfrey suggested that [...] "I don't think they'll leave L.A. or Houston out for, say, 10 years. I will, though, grab hold of the coattails of whoever is left out this time around and hopefully go in with them." [...] It was suggested that if the league expanded to LA (which ultimate lost out to Houston) it might need to grant a second expansion team to balance the league with an even number of teams, leaving the door open for Toronto. However, in 2005 Tagliabue said that [...] "if there is expansion, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would leave us with an odd number of teams for some period of time." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "I don't see expansion in Canada as being related to what we might do in Los Angeles." ...|$|E
