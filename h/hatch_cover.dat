5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called <b>hatch</b> <b>cover.</b> In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, and the depth, it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a <b>hatch</b> <b>cover,</b> out of sight from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai-class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
5|$|To {{remedy the}} causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II {{spacecraft}} and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials. The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug-type <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> with a quick-release, outward opening door. NASA discontinued the manned Block I program, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant A7L Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.|$|E
500|$|Regulations {{regarding}} <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> {{have evolved}} since the investigation following {{the loss of}} the [...] The Load Line Conference of 1966 imposed a requirement that <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> be able to withstand load of 1.74tons/m2 due to sea water, and a minimum scantling of 6mm for the tops of the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers.</b> The International Association of Classification Societies then increased this strength standard by creating its Unified Requirement S21 in 1998. [...] This standard requires that the pressure due to sea water be calculated as a function of freeboard and speed, especially for <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> located on the forward portion of the ship.|$|R
500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1950s, <b>hatches</b> had wooden <b>covers</b> that would be broken apart and rebuilt by hand, rather than opened and closed. [...] Newer vessels have hydraulic-operated metal <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> that can often be operated by one person. [...] <b>Hatch</b> <b>covers</b> can slide forwards, backwards, or to the side, lift up or fold up. It is essential that the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> be watertight: unsealed hatches lead to accidental cargo hold flooding, which has caused many bulkers to sink.|$|R
5000|$|SD18 ships had aft {{superstructure}} and machinery, {{and four}} cargo holds with a capacity totalling [...] grain (i.e. loose material). The most forward cargo hold had a hatch with McGregor single-pull <b>hatch</b> <b>covers,</b> {{the other three}} cargo holds had double hatches, which were also sealed with McGregor single-pull <b>hatch</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxygen {{atmosphere was}} consistent with that {{that had been used}} successfully in the Mercury and Gemini programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air and replace it with pure oxygen, and also to seal the plug door <b>hatch</b> <b>cover.</b> During launch, the pressure would have been gradually reduced to the in-flight level of , providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the fire risk. The Apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the Operations and Checkout Building altitude (vacuum) chamber on October 18 and 19, 1966, and the backup crew of Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham had repeated it on December 30. The investigation board noted that, during these tests, the Command Module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times, for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes, {{two and a half hours}} longer than it had been during the plugs-out test.|$|E

25|$|Except for Brophy, all {{crew members}} of the Lancaster managed to escape the burning bomber. Five left through the front escape hatch {{on the floor of}} the cockpit. When bomb aimer Jack Friday, tried to release the escape <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> in the aircraft's nose, the rushing wind ripped it from his hands. The <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> caught him above his left eye and knocked him out. He fell into the open hatch and jammed it closed until Flight {{engineer}} Roy Vigars reached him to quickly clip on Friday's parachute and toss him out the hatch while pulling the unconscious crewman's rip cord. Only Mynarski managed to leave via the rear escape door.|$|E

25|$|The EIFV {{has three}} crewman, and can carry six soldiers, {{who enter the}} vehicle via a rear drop ramp. The driver is seated at the left front of the hull with the engine {{compartment}} to his right. The driver has a single-piece pop-up <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> which rotates over the engine cooling air intake grill when open, and is provided with four, day periscopes for observation. The commander and the gunner are both positioned in the turret itself, and a hatch is provided for the commander on the turret roof.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{dimensions}} {{and weight of}} the BMD-3 are diminutive in comparison to its counterparts. The crew consists of a driver, a vehicle commander, and a gunner and holds four passengers. There are seats for mounted infantrymen {{in the middle of}} the hull, with one stowage rack for three 9M111 or 9M113 ATGMs. There are also three racks for ammunitions boxes and a filter-ventilation unit. The commander's seat is on the right of the turret and has a cupola with a <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> that opens forward, while the gunner's seat is on the left and has a single-piece <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> that opens to the front. Of the four passengers, two are seated at the front with the other two near behind the turret. A firing port is provided on each side of the BMD-3. Additional infantry can be seated for short distances to the immediate rear of the turret with the roof hatch open. The seats of the combat crew are fastened to the roof of the combat compartments to improve protection from IEDs and mines. The engine compartment is located towards the rear of the BMD-3 consisting of a 450hp (horsepower) 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine, main clutch, gearbox, final drives and brakes. A collective NBC protection system was provided by over-pressurization of the combat compartment via a filter-ventilation unit to insure the survivability of the crew in an environment contaminated by nuclear fallout.|$|E
25|$|The long, {{box-shaped}} SIBMAS hull is of all-welded {{steel construction}} {{and provides the}} crew with protection from small arms fire and artillery fragments. Most SIBMAS variants possess a horizontal roofline, which slopes inwards at the rear. The engine compartment {{is located in the}} rear hull and to the left. Engine components are removed through the hull roof for servicing. Passengers may debark from a large door in the rear hull to the right. Entry doors and firing ports are also present in the sides of the vehicle, and there are three hull roof hatches for observation purposes. Drivers are seated {{at the front of the}} vehicle and provided with a single <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> and three large windows. The turret of the SIBMAS AFSV-90 is located near the hull front, immediately behind the driving compartment, and is provided with three large rectangular hatches.|$|E
50|$|But Coast Guard investigations, and {{independent}} examinations of the wreck, told a different story: the Marine Electric left port in an un-seaworthy condition, with gaping holes in its deck plating and <b>hatch</b> <b>covers.</b> The <b>hatch</b> <b>covers,</b> in particular, posed a problem, since without them the cargo hold could fill with {{water in the}} storm and drag the ship under. And {{it was there that}} the investigation took a second, dramatic turn.|$|R
500|$|The NTSB {{conducted}} computer studies, {{testing and}} analysis {{to determine the}} forces necessary to collapse the <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> and concluded that Fitzgerald sank suddenly from flooding of the cargo hold [...] "due {{to the collapse of}} {{one or more of the}} <b>hatch</b> <b>covers</b> under the weight of giant boarding seas" [...] instead of flooding gradually due to ineffective hatch closures. The NTSB dissenting opinion held that Fitzgerald sank suddenly and unexpectedly from shoaling.|$|R

25|$|Trout {{stood out}} of Pearl Harbor on 21 May 1942, as a unit of Task Group 7.1, the Midway Island Patrol Group {{consisting}} of 12 submarines. Her station was south of the island as nine of the submarines were positioned fan-like {{to the west of}} Midway in preparation for the Japanese attack. At 08:12 on 4 June, Trout sighted a Japanese fighter plane preparing to attack from astern. She went deep and heard a series of light explosions. On 9 June, Trout passed through a large oil slick and some debris before rescuing two Japanese from a large wooden <b>hatch</b> <b>cover.</b> She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 June without firing a torpedo and began a major refit that included installation of search radars and JP sonar in preparation for deployment to Australia. The Trout also carried two POWs from the sunken Japanese cruiser Mikuma.|$|E
25|$|On 28 February 1941, Persier was {{battered}} by a storm, with a <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> being ripped {{off and the}} steering and electrical systems failing. She was stranded east off Vik in Myrdalur, Iceland and was severely damaged. Persier was refloated in April, and towed to Reykjavík by the tug Aegir for initial repairs to be made. On 9 June, Persier {{was taken to the}} Kleppsvik Strand, but broke her back as she was insufficiently supported, and was subsequently beached. On 8 February 1942, she was refloated and re-beached, finally being refloated on 20 May. She was towed by the tugs Empire Bascobel and Empire Larch to a Tyneside shipyard for repairs, which were completed in February 1943. Persiers first voyage on return to service was from Liverpool to New York, United States as a member of Convoy ON 169. Departing on 22 February, the convoy arrived on 21 March. In September 1943, Persier was a member of Convoy SC 141, which departed Halifax, Nova Scotia on 3 September, and arrived at Liverpool on 17 September. She was carrying a cargo of steel and woodpulp and was bound for London.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Fahd is of {{all-welded}} steel armor construction giving complete {{protection against}} attack by 7.62 mm caliber AP rounds and shell splinters. The vehicle is equipped with air conditioning. The driver sits {{at the front of}} the vehicle on the left side with the commander to the right. Both have forward observation via large bulletproof windows, which can be rapidly covered by an armored shutter hinged at the top, and a side door that opens to the front, featuring a window in its upper part that can also be covered by a shutter as well. Above the commander's position is a single-piece, rear-opening <b>hatch</b> <b>cover.</b> The driver has a forward-facing, roof-mounted day periscope, which can be replaced by a passive periscope for night driving. The troop compartment is at the rear of the hull with the infantry entering via a door in the rear, the upper part of which folds upwards and the lower part downwards to form a step. Over the top of the troop compartment are two rectangular roof hatches hinged in the center that can be locked vertically. The infantry sits on individual bucket seats down the center of the vehicle facing outwards. In either side of the troop compartment are four firing ports with a vision block above so that the troops can fire their weapons from within the vehicle. Either side of the rear door has a firing port with a vision block above. Optional equipment may be fitted on the vehicle, such as an NBC protection system and passive IR among others.|$|E

500|$|The loading {{method used}} depends {{on both the}} cargo and the {{equipment}} available on the ship and on the dock. [...] In the least advanced ports, cargo can be loaded with shovels or bags poured from the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover.</b> This system is being replaced with faster, less labor-intensive methods.|$|E
500|$|Three {{minutes after}} the count was resumed, the hatch {{installation}} was started. The hatch consisted of three parts: a removable inner hatch, which stayed inside the cabin; a hinged outer hatch, {{which was part of}} the spacecraft's heat shield; and an outer <b>hatch</b> <b>cover,</b> which was part of the boost protective cover enveloping the entire Command Module to protect it from aerodynamic heating during launch, and from launch escape rocket exhaust {{in the event of a}} launch abort. The boost <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> was partially, but not fully, latched in place because the flexible boost protective cover was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide the simulated internal power. (The spacecraft's fuel cell reactants were not loaded for this test.) After the hatches were sealed, the air in the cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at , [...] higher than atmospheric pressure.|$|E

500|$|It {{is crucial}} to keep the cargo level during loading in order to {{maintain}} stability. As the hold is filled, machines such as excavators and bulldozers are often used to keep the cargo in check. Leveling is particularly important when the hold is only partly full, since cargo is more likely to shift. Extra precautions are taken, such as adding longitudinal divisions and securing wood atop the cargo. If a hold is full, a technique called tomming is used, which involves digging out a [...] hole below the <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> and filling it with bagged cargo or weights.|$|E
500|$|The bow hit {{the bottom}} {{at a speed}} of about , digging about [...] deep into the mud, up {{to the base of}} the anchors. The impact bent the hull in two places and caused it to buckle {{downwards}} by about 10° under the forward well deck cranes and by about 4° under the forward expansion joint. When the bow section hit the sea bed, the weakened decks at the rear, where the ship had broken apart, collapsed on top of each other. The forward <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> was also blown off and landed a couple of hundred feet in front of the bow, possibly due to the force of water being pushed out as the bow impacted the bottom.|$|E
500|$|The inner <b>hatch</b> <b>cover</b> used a {{plug door}} design, sealed by higher {{pressure}} inside the cabin than outside. The normal pressure level used for launch ( [...] above ambient) created sufficient force to prevent removing the cover until the excess pressure was vented. Emergency procedure called for Grissom {{to open the}} cabin vent valve first, allowing White to remove the cover, but Grissom was prevented from doing this because the valve was located to the left, behind the initial wall of flames. Also, while the system could easily vent the normal pressure, its flow capacity was utterly incapable of handling the rapid increase to [...] absolute caused by the intense heat of the fire.|$|E
