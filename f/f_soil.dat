Although <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> {{is the dominant}} C flux following stand-replacing disturbance, the effects of catastrophic windthrow on <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> are still poorly understood. We measured <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> at a montane mixed-forest site and at a subalpine spruce forest site from 2009 until 2012. Each site consisted of an undisturbed forest stand and two adjacent partially cleared (stem-fraction-harvested) windthrow areas, which differed {{with regard to the}} time since disturbance. The combination of chronosequence and direct time-series approaches enabled us to investigate <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> dynamics over 12 years post-disturbance. At both sites <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> rates did not differ significantly from those of the undisturbed stands in the initial phase after disturbance (1 – 6 years). In the later phase after disturbance (9 – 12 years), <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> rates were significantly higher than in the corresponding undisturbed stand. Soil temperature increased significantly following windthrow (by 2. 9 – 4. 8 °C), especially in the initial phase post-disturbance when vegetation cover was sparse. A significant part (15 – 31 %) of <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> from the windthrow areas was attributed to the increase in soil temperature. According to our estimates, ~ 500 – 700 g C m − 2 year − 1 are released via <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> from south-facing forest sites in the Austrian Calcareous Alps in the initial 6 years after windthrow. With a high browsing pressure suppressing tree regeneration, post-disturbance net loss of ecosystem C to the atmosphere is likely to be substantial unless forest management is proactive in regenerating such sites. An increase in the frequency of forest disturbance by windthrow could therefore decrease soil C stocks and feed back positively on rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations...|$|E
40|$|In topographically complex watersheds, {{landscape}} {{position and}} vegetation heterogeneity {{can alter the}} soil water regime through both lateral and vertical redistribution, respectively. These alterations of soil moisture may have significant impacts on the spatial heterogeneity of biogeochemical cycles throughout the watershed. To evaluate how landscape position and vegetation heterogeneity affect soil CO 2 efflux (<b>F</b> <b>SOIL),</b> we conducted observations across the Weimer Run watershed (373 ha), located near Davis, West Virginia, for three growing seasons with varying precipitation. An apparent soil temperature threshold of 11 °C for <b>F</b> <b>SOIL</b> at 12 cm depth was observed in our data, where <b>F</b> <b>SOIL</b> rates greatly increase in variance above this threshold. We therefore focus our analyses of <b>F</b> <b>SOIL</b> on instances in which soil temperature values were above this threshold. Vegetation had the greatest effect on <b>F</b> <b>SOIL</b> rates, with plots beneath shrubs at all elevations, for all years, showing the greatest mean rates of <b>F</b> <b>SOIL</b> (6. 07 μmol CO 2 m − 2 s − 1) compared to plots beneath closed-forest canopy (4. 69 μmol CO 2 m − 2 s − 1) and plots located in open, forest gap (4. 09 μmol CO 2 m − 2 s − 1) plots. During periods of high soil moisture, we find that CO 2 efflux rates are constrained, and that maximum efflux rates occur during periods of average to below-average soil water availability. While vegetation was the variable most related to <b>F</b> <b>SOIL,</b> there is also strong interannual variability in fluxes determined by the interaction of annual precipitation and topography. These findings add to the current theoretical constructs related to the interactions of moisture and vegetation in biogeochemical cycles within topographically complex watersheds...|$|E

This study determined the distribution of <b>F</b> in the <b>soil</b> profile of medium (> 8 years) and long-term permanent pastures (> 50 years) where F had been applied as an impurity in phosphatic fertiliser, and assessed the potential bioavailability of fertiliser <b>F</b> in <b>soil.</b> Long-term application of superphosphate was linked to increased concentrations of the more soluble fraction of <b>F</b> in <b>soil.</b> The more soluble F fraction in the soil surface led to increased F concentrations in herbage (from 11 to 22 mg F/kg). Fluoride concentrations in herbage were not high enough to be toxic to plants or grazing animals. Fluoride applied as an impurity in phosphatic fertiliser was generally found to accumulate in the upper soil profile (0 – 6 cm depth). Such increases could also increase F ingestion by ruminants through incidental soil ingestion while grazing. The risk of fluorosis to grazing animals is low at present, but with continued application of fertiliser to soil containing high concentrations of F, and depending on the bioavailability of fertiliser-derived <b>F</b> in <b>soil,</b> we estimate that fluorosis may become an issue in the next 25 – 50 years in highly fertilised pasture soils.

To explore the effect of drought on soil CO 2 efflux (<b>F</b> <b>Soil)</b> and on the contribution of litter to <b>F</b> <b>Soil</b> we used rain shelters to simulate a summer drought (May to July 2007) in an intensively managed grassland in Switzerland by reducing annual precipitation by around 30 % similar to the hot and dry year 2003 in Central Europe. We added 13 C-depleted as well as unlabelled grass/clover litter to quantify the litter-derived CO 2 efflux (F Litter). Soil CO 2 efflux and the 13 C/ 12 C isotope ratio (δ 13 C) of the respired CO 2 after litter addition were measured {{during the growing season}} 2007. Drought significantly decreased <b>F</b> <b>Soil</b> in our litter addition experiment by 59 % and F Litter by 81 % during the drought period itself (May to July), indicating that drought had a stronger effect on the CO 2 release from litter than on the belowground-derived CO 2 efflux (F BG, i. e. soil organic matter (SOM) and root respiration). Despite large bursts in respired CO 2 induced by the rewetting after prolonged drought, drought also reduced <b>F</b> <b>Soil</b> and F Litter during the entire 13 C measurement period (April to October) by 26 % and 37 %, respectively. Overall, our findings show that drought decreased <b>F</b> <b>Soil</b> and altered its seasonality and its sources.

The REY (REE+Y) concentrations in the HCl extracts from the two soils have also been determined. The NH 4 -acetate extracts display the highest Sr and Ca concentrations (38 – 292 mg/kg, and 2. 31 – 49. 12 g/kg respectively), while the water extracts provide the lowest ones (0. 5 – 6. 1 mg/kg and 0. 08 – 0. 33 g/kg, respectively). The REY concentrations range narrowly in the P soil (24. 3 – 31. 4 mg/kg),while they distinguish along with Sr and Ca between {{the upper and lower}} horizons in the <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> (51. 5 – 63. 3 and 19. 8 – 27. 1 mg/kg respectively). In particular, as the lower horizons display concentrations {{similar to those of the}} P soil, this suggests a common origin of those sediments. The PAAS-normalized patterns in the HCl extracts of both the soils show either a middle REE enrichment, suggestive of phosphate dissolution and/or REY complexation with organicmatter, and a small positive Gd anomaly, referred to as the contribution from marine carbonates and phosphates. The range of δ 87 Sr (12. 4 – 13) of the insoluble residue of the P soil indicates that Sr is is derived fromcrust silicates, that also provided the Sr of the insoluble residue of the <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> (δ 87 Sr= 9. 3 – 17. 1), but the larger range and the vertical decrease of values through the latter profile support the distinction in the upper and lower horizons. As these latter horizons display close δ 87 Sr to the values of the P soil, the common origin of these sediments is confirmed. The overlapping ranges of εNd of the insoluble residue from both the soils (from − 8. 4 to − 6. 85 and from − 7. 8 to − 7, respectively) suggest that Nd is also derived from crust silicates. The range of δ 87 Sr of the NH 4 -acetate extracts of the P soil (from− 0. 8 to− 0. 41) is close to the corresponding range of the lower horizons (from− 0. 31 to− 0. 27) of the <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> suggest Sr origin fromLate Cenozoic carbonates. In contrast, the higher δ 87 Sr (from 0. 09 to 0. 25) of the upper horizons of the <b>F</b> <b>soil,</b> suggest some input of radiogenic Sr from crust silicates. The ranges of δ 87 Sr of the HCl extracts of the two soils largely overlap (the P soil from − 0. 9 to 0. 3, the <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> from− 0. 72 to− 0. 34), suggesting a broadly common source, likely dolomite and phosphates of the Late Cenozoic. The narrow and overlapping ranges of εNd of the HCl extracts from the two soils (the P soil from− 8. 9 to − 7. 1, the <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> from − 8. 1 to − 7. 8) indicate that labile Nd is also provided by the same source, likely marine phosphates.

Model performance in predicting these observations was compared in order to evaluate whether individual model variables contributed positively to the overall prediction. Of the 111 model variables considered 16 were identified as potentially redundant.

The study site was located about 1 km south of Corconnes town (~ 30 km northwest of Montpellier). The land use systems compared with each other were : undisturbed scrubland (garrigue – G), 25 -yr old fallow (F) with dense grass cover (Brachypodium retusum), young vineyard for 5 -yr (YV) with inter-row spaces bare of vegetation, and vineyard for 15 -yr (AV) mulched with dry vine shoots. The vineyard soils were more compact (bulk density ~ 1. 47 g/cc) which was attributed {{to the loss of}} the organic-rich mineral horizons and the influence of the heavy machinery used in initial clearing of the land and the subsequent vineyard production for several years. Despite the textural similarity, soils under the G and F had 6 to 7 times more macroaggregates (1 - 2 mm) than soils under the vineyards. All the ecosystems differed significantly from each other in organic C and N. Undisturbed soil under G had the maximum C (41. 8 mg/g) followed by the F system (30. 5 mg/g) while the intensely cultivated soil (YV) had the minimum C contents (5. 4 mg/g).

Treatments including, control (C), foliar application of complete micronutrient in Stem elongation stage (M 1), foliar application of complete micronutrient fertilizer in Stem elongation stage + ear appearance stage (M 2), foliar application of Zn in Stem elongation stage (Z 1), foliar application of Zn in Stem elongation stage + ear appearance stage (Z 2), foliar application of Fe in Stem elongation stage (F 1), foliar application of Fe in Stem elongation stage + ear appearance stage (<b>F</b> 2), <b>soil</b> use of complete micronutrient fertilizer (Ms), soil use of Fe (<b>Fs)</b> and <b>soil</b> use of Zn (Zs). Analysis of variance showed that effects of different fertilizer treatments on seed yield, biological yield, number of rows in cob, number of grain in row and cob length traits were significant (p≤ 0. 01). Also impacts of applied treatments on harvest index, cob diameter, 1000 grain weight and cob weight in 5 % probability level were significant. Mean comparison of treatments showed that in all studied traits, foliar application of complete micronutrient fertilizer in Stem elongation stage + ear appearance stage (M 2) and control (C) treatments had a highest and lowest effects respectively...|$|R
40|$|Fluorine {{adsorption}} {{experiments were}} performed on 28 samples of the first 5 cm of topsoil collected on the flanks of Mt. Etna. The soil samples were equilibrated with F-rich rainwater (3. 25 mg/L) at a soil/water weight ratio of 1 / 25. Aliquots of the supernatant were collected after 1, 7, 72, 720 and 5640 h and analysed for <b>F</b> content. The <b>soil</b> samples could be subdivided into three groups based on their F-adsorption behaviours after 1 h {{and at the end}} of the experiment: (1) negative adsorption (F released from the soil to the solution) after 1 h and negative or moderately positive adsorption at the end, (2) from negative after 1 h to strongly positive adsorption at the end, and (3) always strong positive adsorption. The adsorption capacity of the soils was positively correlated with the soil pH, the contents of finer granulometric fractions (clay and silt) and the weathering stage (as quantified by the chemical alteration index). The most <b>F</b> adsorbing <b>soils</b> are found at the periphery of the volcano where aquifers are more vulnerable to contamination due to the shallower depth of the water table. This study further evidences the importance of the Etnean soils in protecting groundwater from an excessive magmatic F input...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of soil quality were measured in adjacent agricultural (horticultural cropping sequence, HC), native grassland (naturally grazed, NG) and forest (indigenous wood of holm-oak, F) soils. The {{objective of the}} research {{was to assess the}} influence of different land uses on soil organic matter characteristics, biochemical activity and antioxidant capacity in selected fields of the Mediterranean environment in central Italy under a specific climatic regime. Land use induced significant changes in the content and quality of soil organic matter, biochemical activity and antioxidant capacity, with more pronounced differences between soils under HC and F than soils under HC and NG. The HC soil showed the lowest amounts of total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass C (MB-C), water-soluble organic C (WSOC), water- and alkali-soluble phenols. The organic matter of HC was characterized by the lowest percentage of MB-C and of light fraction carbon (LF-C). The dehydrogenase activity (DH-ase), metabolic potential (MP), hydrolyzing coefficient (HyC), potentially mineralizable C (C 0) and C mineralized (C m) were clearly lower in HC. The specific respiration activity of biomass (qCO 2) was the highest in HC soil (1. 3 μg CO 2 -CμgbiomassC - 1) and lowest in <b>F</b> <b>soil</b> (0. 5 μgCO 2 -CμgbiomassC - 1) and was inversely related with pH, TOC and MB-C contents. The antioxidant capacity of soils (TEAC) was the highest in NG and related to the amount of alkali-soluble phenols. The rate constant of organic matter mineralization (k) appeared to depend on TEAC rather than the relative amounts of the labile C pools. These results seem to explain the role of phenols as controller of the mineralization rate of organic matter...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Douglas-fir {{seedlings}} of {{a single}} seed source were grown in a nursery under three levels of light intensity: 9, 44, and 100 percent of full light. Growth over an entire growing season was monitored in terms of proportionate distribution of dry matter to shoot and root systems. This was replicated over two years, 1971 and 1972, with the subsequent effects of prior light treatment upon growth and phenology noted as well as current effects of first-year growth upon seedling water relations. Water relations analysis {{was based on the}} model, Plant Moisture Stress = <b>f</b> (<b>Soil</b> Moisture Stress, Leaf Conductance) and data subdivided as to summer, fall, and winter according to differing physiological states of the seedlings. By means of analysis of variance applied to regression models, effects of season of the year and light preconditioning upon water relations were demonstrated. These were attributed to differing influences of soil moisture stress and leaf conductance upon plant moisture stress Water relations analysis indicated that plant moisture stress of seedlings during active shoot growth is lower than after growth bas ceased. Decreased water Loss in the winter associated with low air temperatures was due to closure of stomata partially independent of moisture stress in the plant. Plant moisture stress was lower in seedlings during the winter than it was during fall at equivalent levels of soil moisture stress. Low light-preconditioned seedlings possess limited ability to avoid internal desiccation, probably due to a poorly-developed root system relative to their shoot. They are also more subject to spring frost damage. Indications are that low light. Preconditioning of seedlings’ growth the first year may have carry-over effect upon water relations behavior a year later. Light preconditioning has practical implicatior 8 for forest nursery management through regulation of dormancy and morphology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{measured}} {{soil surface}} CO 2 efflux (Fs) in loblolly pine stands (Pinus taeda L.) {{located on the}} Virginia Piedmont (VA) and South Carolina Coastal Plain (SC) in efforts {{to assess the impact}} climate, productivity, and cultural practices have on Fs in the managed loblolly pine eco-system. The effect of stand age on Fs was examined using a replicated chronosequence approach in which stands ranging from 1 to 25 years since planting were investigated. Soil CO 2 efflux was measured on both VA and SC sites for over a year using a closed dynamic system. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate Fs correlates and examine the relationship between candidate explanatory variables and <b>Fs.</b> <b>Soil</b> temperature (top 10 cm) was the major correlate with Fs on both locations. We observed a positive age effect on Fs in VA stands and no relationship between age and Fs in SC stands. Annual soil C efflux declined with stand age in SC due to both reductions in soil temperatures as crown closure occurs and a diminishing heterotrophic C substrate pool. An-nual estimated efflux ranges from 16. 7 to 13. 2 Mg C ha 1 for 1 and 20 -year-old stands, respec-tively. In contrast, annual soil C efflux increased with age in VA stands {{as a result of the}} positive relationship between stand age and Fs, which appears to be related to an increase in the contri-bution of root respiration to total Fs over time. In VA stands, efflux estimates range from 7. 6 t...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{agricultural}} systems {{negatively affect}} soil quality principally {{because of a}} reduction in soil organic matter (OM). Sustainable practices providing organic amendments could be useful to maintain or increase OM content in agricultural soils, preserving and improving soil fertility. In this study, biomass with a large C:N ratio was applied to intensively farmed agricultural soils to maximize the increase of soil OM and hence chemical and biochemical fertility. In particular, 30 and 60 t ha− 1 of two mixtures of compost and scraps from poplar pruning, A 1 and A 2, with different C:N ratios (15 and 25, respectively), were applied to soils of two farms (F 1 and F 2) in a Mediterranean area (southern Italy) {{on an annual basis}} for two consecutive years. An effective, long-lasting increase of soil OM, on average of 60 and 55 % in F 1 and <b>F</b> 2 <b>soils,</b> respectively, was reached {{at the end of the}} experiment. As well as a progressive increase in the C:N ratio, total N and available P also increased with organic amendments, with positive effects on soil microbial activity as demonstrated by the enhancement of the seven studied enzymatic activities. Principal component analysis demonstrated different responses to various organic amendments between F 1 and <b>F</b> 2 <b>soils</b> because of their geopedological diversity. The results indicate that the C:N ratio of the mixture is an important factor, but what is the best rate of addition to use is still not obvious. The use of a smaller amount (30 t ha− 1) of the A 1 mixture (10 : 1 compost:wood) appears, in these types of soils, to be the most suitable strategy to produce significant benefits...|$|R
40|$|Aimed: The main aim of {{this study}} is to improve the {{mechanistic}} understanding of soil CO 2 efflux (Fs), especially its temporal variation at short-time scales, by investigating, through modeling, which underlying process among CO 2 production and its transport up to the atmosphere is responsible for observed intra-day variation of <b>Fs</b> and <b>soil</b> CO 2 concentration [CO 2]. Methods: In this study, a measurement campaign of <b>Fs</b> and vertical <b>soil</b> [CO 2] profiles was conducted in a Scots Pine Forest soil in Hartheim (Germany) and used to develop a model testing several hypotheses. A reference model taking into account a purely diffusive CO 2 transport and a temperature-dependent CO 2 production is compared to models with a more complex description of either CO 2 production or CO 2 transport. For transport, the introduction of advection and the dispersion is investigated. For the production, the emergent hypothesis of the phloem pressure concentration wave (PPCW) influence is tested. Results: We show that intra-day variation of Fs and [CO 2] is better represented when the more complex CO 2 production expression is taken into account compared to the more detailed description of CO 2 transport. Conclusion: We conclude that focus should be placed on the potential factors affecting the CO 2 production, rather than on the transport process description. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
