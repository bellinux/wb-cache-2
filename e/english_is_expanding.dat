40|$|The {{emergence}} of English {{as an international}} language {{in a number of}} domains has implications which are becoming a matter of widespread discussion among both linguists and the general public. In the face of the increasing number of the functions for which English is regarded as more useful or convenient than any other language, and the growth in the numbers of its speakers and learners - it is only slowly that we are beginning to sort out the practical and theoretical implications for {{the early part of the}} new millennium of this unprecedented linguistic predominance" (Honey, 1996 : 99). Despite its high status, the standard of English teaching and learning, especially in severely underfunded black South African schools has suffered rapid deterioration. At the moment, there are no indications that the downward slide can be halted. The nonnative English language debate is compounded by arguments rejecting the pedagogic notion of "Standard English" and advocating a linguistic ethos which suggests that all forms of English are equal. This has resulted in the proliferation of terms such as "black English", "Ghanaian English", "Indian English" etc. which are claimed to be on an equal footing with "British" and "American" English or standard English (Ahulu, 1992). This thesis makes the important point that both "educated" black and white people in South Africa make use of standard English. But the concept of standard English must be properly understood. Quirk at the 1995 English Academy conference, was pushing the term "general English" as an alternative name for "standard English. " A variety of English such as British or American English incorporates a standard variety that is encoded in grammars, dictionaries and guides of usage, taught in educational institutions, used to print and often found in the usage of those regarded as educated users. However, those who express "concern for the recognition and acceptance of the English language standard in the education system are sometimes accused of ignoring socio-linguistic realities" (Wright, 1996 : 154). This thesis discusses several language features which are peculiar to English as a second language (ESL). These features have been claimed to yield the characteristics of a "South African black English. " The analysis shows that these characteristic features are not consistently or reliably realised. In fact according to current research it would seem that most "features are actually teacher-influenced" (Buthelezi, 1989 : 40). Nonstandard ESL features indicate according to Wright (1995 : 8) "a symptom of the sad failure of our education system rather than a sign of the creative evolution of a vigorous new national variety of English. " Wright maintains that "to advocate the institutionalising of non-standard English-attributable in large measure to apartheid's legacy of low educational standards - would be neither radical nor progressive, but a profoundly conservative attitude, imposing and enshrining mediocrity. " The debate about "black English" in South Africa has not yet gained momentum even though it is part of the common currency. There seems to be a powerful conventional opinion in influential circles that claims that there is a black English in South Africa. The possibility exists that a local variety of English in South Africa may ultimately emerge. But the internationally viable variety will still be needed, one hopes by an ever growing portion of the population as education and opportunity increase. Standard English is the form of English that is taught in South African schools and tertiary institutions. In other words, it includes all users of the "educated" form of English all over the world and it also fulfils more and broader language functions than the nonstandard form. The pedagogic notion of standard English, however, does not imply refusal to accept the existence of non-standard varieties of English or of features in colloquial use that are non-standard and geographically or culturally specific. It is all the more important according to Ahulu (1994 : 26) for those concerned with education, especially "the curriculum designers, subject advisors and textbooks writers, to know the forms of English they should consider and emphasize as the educational target, which should subsequently guide teachers and examiners. " The evidence we have in the field of "black English" according to Ahulu's (1992) findings in Ghana largely consists of coinages and other lexical modifications, and the listing of isolated examples of grammatical divergence. What is referred to as "educated black English" is nothing more that standard English with an injection of vocabulary items of South African origin. Such phenomena as coinage, lexical borrowing are processes by which standard <b>English</b> <b>is</b> <b>expanding</b> its lexicon as an international language. The inferior conditions of years of underfunding and relentless application of the underlying philosophy of apartheid education have had a critical and profound bearing on the state of ESL teaching. For professional careers, the country's economic development and membership of the international scene, to mention but a few requirements, standard English is essential. Teacher training institutions in South Africa are at the moment going through a rationalisation and restructuring process and they need to review their ESL curriculum and programmes. These teacher training colleges should produces well equipped ESL teachers who are capable of dealing with the language dynamics in the ESL classroom situation.

40|$|This paper {{advocates a}} new {{conception}} of the properties which determine the distribution of finite clausal complements (FCCs) in English. I argue against the orthodox view that FCCs are selected by matrix predicates {{on the basis of}} their interpretive type (Grimshaw 1979; Rizzi 1997; Ginzburg & Sag 2000), and propose that distribution rather depends on the specification of the FCC in terms of the syntactically encoded properties [+/-wh, +/-factive]. This proposal is motivated by new distributional patterns which emerge when the typology of <b>English</b> FCCs <b>is</b> <b>expanded</b> to take into account complementiser-how clauses (CHCs) (Legate 2010; Nye 2012).

40|$|The {{island of}} New Guinea is {{probably}} the most linguistically diverse and complex area in the world, with over 1, 000 languages spoken over an area of 900, 000 km 2 (that is, one language every 900 km 2 : Foley 1986 : 8). Seventy-five percent of these languages belong to Non-Austronesian families often referred to as 'Papuan' (see Foley 1986 :I- 3; Dixon 1991 a: 245) ^ 1. The state of Papua New Guinea (independent since 1975) features about 830 languages (Nekitel 1998; Ford ms; Landweer 2000), with the number of Papuan languages exceeding 600 (see Foley 1986 : 1 - 3; Dixon 1991 a: 245).

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} DUCKS, Data Unified Conceptual Knowledge Sets, as a {{tool for}} aligning lexical data across any number of languages. A starting point in producing a multilingual dictionary is to merge bilingual datasets through the overlapping words in a common pivot language. An essential problem in maintaining accuracy across languages is determining the matching senses of a polysemous pivot term, e. g. a term in Language-A meaning “spicy” might well be paired to a term in Language-C meaning “sweltering” because they are both connected to English “hot”. DUCKS addresses this problem through a game-like interface that invites experts and interested members of the public to participate in the sense disambiguation of linguistic datasets. DUCKS starts with the 100, 000 concepts defined in the Princeton WordNet, for 200, 000 English lemmas, and <b>English</b> will <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> through a version of the game that matches senses from Wiktionary. In the basic case, we start with a dataset between Language-A and English. When a user selects a term in Language-A, we show all the contextual information about that item in a graphic block on the left of their screen, and all the senses of the designated English term on the right. The user slides the block to the definition that best matches the meaning in Language-A. If two or more English senses apply, duplicate bricks are available. The user may also select “no definition applies” when relevant. If <b>English</b> <b>is</b> absent from the dataset, the user must first type an equivalent term in English or another language that has already been aligned. We then fetch the possible senses, and play proceeds as above. A match is considered valid when a threshold number of players has made the same selection. DUCKS does not address semantic drift, which is resolved in other games the project has developed. In addition to integrating Language-A with all other languages in the system that share similar concepts for accurate multilingual exchange, concepts without <b>English</b> equivalents can <b>be</b> discovered that may be unique to that language. Data has been aligned among several dozen languages to date, beginning with languages with open data previously linked to WordNet. A large challenge now is that many existing datasets for less-resourced languages are closed data; it is hoped that DUCKS will inspire their proprietors toward joining the multilingual lexicon...|$|R
