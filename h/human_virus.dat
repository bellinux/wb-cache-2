The Siren {{turns out to be}} the ship's virtual doctor, caring for the injured humans; the black spots are tissue samples used as references. Amy convinces the Siren to release Rory into her care. Using Rory's nursing knowledge, Amy and the Doctor remove him from life support and are able to resuscitate him. Meanwhile, Avery decides to stay with his son and his crew, unable to go back to England himself while the ship will care for his crew. Avery takes the helm of the spaceship and, along with Toby and his crew, sets off to explore the stars.|$|E
25|$|The phylogenetic {{origin of}} the flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemics can be traced before 1918. Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species {{boundaries}} and infected humans as human H1N1. The same phenomenon took place soon after in America, where the <b>human</b> <b>virus</b> was infecting pigs; {{it led to the}} emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became the classic swine flu.|$|E
25|$|Western lowland gorillas are {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} zoonotic origins of HIV/AIDS. The SIV or Simian immunodeficiency virus that infects them is similar to a certain strain of HIV-1. The HIV-1 virus exhibits phylogeographic clustering, which is due to large rivers. This clustering allows us to pinpoint the probable geographic origins of two of the <b>human</b> <b>virus</b> clades. In the southern part of Cameroon, the populations of western lowland gorillas have had examinations of their feces. Out of 2,934 gorilla samples, 70 reacted with at least one HIV-1 antigen.

25|$|In 2013, {{yellow fever}} {{resulted}} in about 127,000 severe infections and 45,000 deaths, with nearly 90% of these occurring in Africa. Nearly {{a billion people}} live {{in an area of}} the world where the disease is common. It is common in tropical areas of South America and Africa, but not in Asia. Since the 1980s, the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing. This is believed to be due to fewer people being immune, more people living in cities, people moving frequently, and changing climate. The disease originated in Africa, from where it spread to South America through the slave trade in the 17th century. Since the 17th century, several major outbreaks of the disease have occurred in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, yellow fever was seen {{as one of the most}} dangerous infectious diseases. In 1927 yellow fever virus became the first <b>human</b> <b>virus</b> to be isolated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} serum {{housed in}} the DoDSR was collected through the Armed Forces’ HLTV-III screening program, implemented in 1985 {{in response to the}} emergence of a new <b>human</b> <b>virus,</b> subsequently known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Early laboratory testing was performed via contracted private laboratories. Screening soon expanded to all civilian applicants processed at Military Entrance Processing Stations. A condition of some early laboratory testing contracts specified that remnant serum were to remain in frozen storage. In 1989, the Army’s Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) awarded a contract to McKesson to consolidate and store accumulated residual serum specimens at a single facility, established in proximity to WRAIR in Rockville, Maryland. The HIV Research Program (established by Congressional Direction in 1986), under the WRAIR Division of Retrovirology, established the Walter Reed Army Serum Repository, which would evolve to become the Army/Navy Serum Repository in 1989. In 2001, the repository inventory was moved to its current location, a [...] facility in Silver Spring, Maryland. In recent years, the DoDSR has grown by approximately 1.9-2.3 million specimens annually. By 2007, the DoDSR inventory had grown to over 44 million specimens, and by the end of 2009, over 50,000,000 specimens.|$|E

In 91 {{pregnant women}} we compared high-risk <b>human</b> papilloma <b>virus</b> {{rates in the}} subsequent trimesters and postpartum in comparison to 262 non-pregnant women. High-risk <b>human</b> papilloma <b>virus</b> clearance was compared with 179 high-risk <b>human</b> papilloma <b>virus</b> positive non-pregnant women. Our main questions were: (1) do high-risk <b>human</b> papilloma <b>virus</b> rates change during pregnancy?; and (2) is there any difference between high-risk <b>human</b> papilloma <b>virus</b> clearance in pregnant and non-pregnant women? Women were monitored 3 – 4 monthly by cytology, colposcopy, and high-risk <b>human</b> papilloma <b>virus</b> testing. The median follow-up time was 33 months (range 3 – 74). Non-pregnant women showed prevalence rates of high-risk <b>human</b> papilloma <b>virus</b> of 64, 57, 53, and 50 %, respectively, in four subsequent 3 -months periods {{since the start of}} the study. These high-risk <b>human</b> papilloma <b>virus</b> rates were higher than in the three trimesters of pregnancy, and during the first 3 months postpartum, i. e. 50, 44, 45, and 31 %, respectively. Postpartum only, this difference was statistically significant (P= 0. 004). Paired comparisons of high-risk <b>human</b> papilloma <b>virus</b> prevalence rates of the different trimesters with the postpartum rate showed (McNemar test) decreased rates: first trimester: 18 % (P= 0. 02), second trimester: 13 % (P= 0. 02) and third trimester: 23 % (P< 0. 005).

Methods: Subjects comprised 53 adults with <b>human</b> immunodeficiency <b>virus</b> (mean age 38. 5 +/- 4. 4 years) and 38 without <b>human</b> immunodeficiency <b>virus</b> (mean age 36. 9 +/- 8. 2 years).
