40|$|The ToxicOilSyndrome (TOS) was an {{epidemic}} disease appeared in central Spain in 1981, causing over 400 deaths and affecting more than 20, 000 people, mainly women and children. The disease {{was linked to}} the consumption of rapeseed oil denatured with aniline, illegally refined at the ITH oil refinery in Seville, mixed with other oils and sold as <b>edible</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Among the anilinederivatives detected in the oil batches generated by an uncontrolled deodorisation procedure during the refining process, fatty acid anilides were first postulated as the causal agents. Nevertheless, compounds identified as 3 -(N-phenylamino) propane- 1, 2 -diol (PAP) and its mono-, di-, and triacyl derivatives (mPAP, dPAP and tPAP, respectively), were subsequently considered better biomarkers of toxicoils and the best candidates for causing the intoxication. In this account, we will discuss the results obtained in recent years by our group concerning: (a) The effect of different variables intervening in the deodorisation process that could influence the formation of PAP derivatives. To this end we decided to take the anilinederivatives linked to oleic acid as compound models since this is the fatty acid present in highest amounts in rapeseed oil. The study was focused on the influence of different parameters on the formation of the diester PAP derivative (OOPAP) the monoester derivative (OPAP) and the corresponding amide (oleanilide, OA), and the interactions between any two of these variables. Of particular interest was the interaction observed between OOPAP and OA, due to its potential relevance to the final composition of the toxicoil model. (b) Xenobiochemical aspects of PAP derivatives, specifically: the stereospecific hydrolysis of OPAP and OOPAP by human pancreatic lipase, the in vitro activation of PAP by human and rat liver microsomes as well as by recombinant 450 enzymes, and the formation and stability of GSH and N-acetylcysteine adducts of a highly reactive iminoquinone intermediate generated in the biotransformation of PAP.

40|$|Maslinic and oleanolic acids are triterpenic acids (TA) widely {{distributed}} in the vegetable kingdom that raise a great interest because of their biological properties. They have shown anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective activities and also antioxidant and antitumor properties. Located in the skin of olives they are transferred to virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and pomace <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> constituting minor oil components and being significantly more concentrated in the latter. During storage of olive pomace {{a great variety of}} compounds are released through fermentative and hydrolytic mechanisms and TA are not an exception. In order to obtain <b>edible</b> <b>olive</b> pomace <b>oils</b> concentrated in these valuable components our research group has recently patented a technological strategy based upon extraction of the oil by centrifugation followed by physical refining (US 2011 / 0189320 A 1). The solubility of TA in the oil is quite limited. They are mainly present as solid particles in the crude oil and, therefore, TA can be obtained by filtration. Also in the patent above, we describe a simple procedure to obtain the concentrates, which consists in an extraction of the filtration cake with hexane to remove the remaining oil followed by extraction with ethanol. In this study we characterize extracts obtained from oils of 2013 / 2014 season and examine their antioxidant activity by using radical scavenging measures (DPPH and ABTS) and the ferric reducing power (FRAP) test. For comparative purposes, extracts from regular pomace <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> extracted with hexane were also evaluated. The results obtained showed contents of oleanolic and maslinic acids of more than 50 wt%, presenting maslinic acid a concentration that was twice as much larger than oleanolic acid. The extracts showed slight antioxidant activities that were attributed to the presence of minor contents of phenolic compounds. In addition, the samples obtained from the oils extracted with solvent presented slightly higher antioxidant activities. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
