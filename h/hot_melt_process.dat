40|$|Sealing of Cu to {{polyimide}} in a <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>process</b> {{is difficult}} {{due to the}} very different surface properties of Cu and polyimide. Silicone-based systems are widely used due to their heat resistance, but their sealing strength is still rather low. A new hot melt system has been developed by using silane-based oligomers with polar groups (-OH and -NH 2) to provide good adhesion and aromatic epoxy units to tailor the stress dissipation ability of the system during the peel test. The system is cured by heat, shows a peel strength of 10 N/cm and is stalbe up to 180 °C. The synthesis principles and the general properties of the system {{as well as the}} sealing performance are described...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Transesterification {{has been}} {{investigated}} in poly(«-caprolactone) (PCL) – epoxy blends. In the <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>process,</b> the hydroxyl on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) monomers is too low to give a noticeable transesterification reaction. In the postcure process, model reactions reveal that the hydroxyls from a ring-opening reac-tion are able to react with the esters of PCL. In the meantime, the PCL molecular weight decrease and its distribution becomes broader. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra reveal that fraction of the tertiary hydroxyls converts to secondary hydroxyls. In the cured DGEBA– 3, 39 -dimethylmethylene-di(cyclohexylamine) –PCL blend, a ho-mogeneous morphology is achieved. PCL segments are grafted onto the epoxy network after postcuring and result in the lower Tg observed in the differential scanning calorimetry thermogram. A higher transesterification extent also results in broade...|$|E
40|$|Naproxen {{is a poor}} water soluble, non-steroidal {{analgesic}} and anti-inflammatory drug. The {{enhancement of}} oral bioavailability of poor water soluble drugs {{remains one of the}} most challenging aspects of drug development. Although salt formation, solubilization and particle size reduction have commonly been used to increase dissolution rate and thereby oral absorption and bioavailability of low water soluble drugs, there are practical limitation of these techniques. However, the most attractive option for increasing the release rate is improvement of solubility through formulation approaches. In this study, solid dispersions (SD) of naproxen were prepared by hot melt method using various ratios of drug to polymers (PEG 6000) separately and characterized for physical appearance, FTIR, DSC, X-Ray crystallography, and in-vitro dissolution studies. The influence of several amounts of Labrafil M 2130 was also studied. FTIR study revealed that drug was stable in SDs, and great state of amorphous formed particles was proofed by DSC analysis. The in vitro dissolution studies were carried using USP type II (paddle) dissolution apparatus at medium (pH 1. 5). Solubility of naproxen from SDs was increased in dissolution media. The prepared dispersion showed increase in the dissolution rate of naproxen comparing to that of physical mixtures of drug and polymers and pure drug. Percent of drug released in 60 minutes was 23. 92 % for pure naproxen witch is increased in SDs and reached to 100 % for best formulations of PEG 6000 and labrafil based SDs respectively, considering ratio of drug to polymers. It is concluded that dissolution of the naproxen could be improved by the solid dispersion. Although physical mixtures have increased the rate of dissolution, dissolution shows faster release from SDs which would therefore be due to formation of amorphous particles through the <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>process</b> which was also revealed by DSC analysis and XRD...|$|E

Solvent evaporation technique was employed to prepare films of different combinations of polymers, plasticizer, and a modal drug sulindac to narrow down on a few polymer-plasticizer-sulindac combinations. The sulindac-polymer-plasticizer combination that was stable with good film forming properties was <b>processed</b> by <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> mixing, a technique close to <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion, to predict its behavior in a <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion <b>process.</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> mixing is not a substitute to <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion but is an aid in predicting the formation of molecularly dispersed form of a given set of drug-polymer-plasticizer combination in a <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion <b>process.</b> The formulations were characterized by advanced techniques like optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, hot stage microscopy, dynamic vapor sorption, and X-ray diffraction.

Rubber samples collected at three different stages of the mastication process and were analyzed by ThFFF. It was found that in an anaer-obic process rubber degradation occurs at the resin-mixing (compounding) zone {{as well as in the}} initial break-down zone, while in an aerobic process most of degradation occurs at the initial breakdown zone.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{research}} project was to explore the possibilities of combining pressurized carbon dioxide with <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion of polyvinylpyr-rolidone-co-vinyl acetate 64, Eudragit (R) E 100 and ethylcellulose 20 cps, to evaluate {{the ability of the}} pressurized gas to act as a temporary plasticizer as well as to produce a foamed polymeric material. Pressurized carbon dioxide was injected into a Leistritz Micro 18 intermeshing co-rotating twin-screw melt extruder using an ISCO 260 D syringe pump. The physicochemical characteristics of the polymers before and after injection of carbon dioxide were evaluated using MDSC, dissolution measurements, specific surface area measurements, porosity, dynamic vapour sorption and microscopy. An extruder set up and screw configuration were configured and optimized for injection of pressurized CO 2. Carbon dioxide acted as plasticizer for all three polymers, reducing the processing temperature during the <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion <b>process.</b> The specific surface area and the porosity of the polymers was increased after treatment with carbon dioxide, resulting in enhanced dissolution. The macroscopic morphology was changed to a foam-like structure due to expansion of the carbon dioxide at the extrusion die. This resulted in improved milling efficiency. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} increasingly utilised for improving oral bioavailability of drugs. Simvastatin is biopharmaceutical class 2 drug with poor oral bioavailability of 5 %. In the present study, simvastatin solid lipid nanoparticles were successfully prepared by <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> emulsification <b>process</b> and optimised {{with respect to}} surfactant and lipid concentration, and drug loading. The nanoparticles were characterised for entrapment efficiency, particle size, morphology, crystallinity and thermal behavior. Optimised formulations prepared from solid lipids glyceryl behenate and glyceryl palmitostearate containing Tween 80 as surfactant exhibited satisfactory entrapment efficiencies above 96 % and mean particle size below 200 nm. The electron micrographs indicated that lipid nanocarriers were almost spherical in appearance. X-ray diffraction and differential calorimetric studies proved that the drug was amorphised in the lipid matrix and did not crystallise out. To improve the physical as well as chemical stability of formulations, dry adsorbed nanoparticles were prepared by evaporative drying method using a carrier. The adsorbed nanoparticles demonstrated good flow properties and satisfactory reconstitution properties.

40|$|Purpose Biodegradable {{polymers}} {{have been}} widely investigated for controlled release formulations for protein delivery. However, the processing stability of proteins remains a major challenge. The aim {{of this research is}} to assess the influence of the <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion <b>process</b> on the activity of a model protein by varying extrusion temperature, hydrophilicity of polymer and pre-stabilization of proteins with sugar glass technology. Methods The thermolabile model protein alkaline phosphatase (AP) was spray dried with inulin in a 1 : 10 protein:inulin weight ratio. The spray dried powder and the bare protein were exposed to 55 °C, 95 °C and 130 °C for 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes to assess the effect of heat stress that can be expected during <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion. The spray dried powder and the bare protein were extruded with six different biodegradable polymers: the hydrophobic polymers poly-ε-caprolactone and low and high molecular weight poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) at 55 °C, 85 °C and 130 °C, respectively. Three hydrophilic polymers, based on the same polymers but with poly (ethylene glycol) incorporated, were extruded at the same temperatures. After extraction of protein from the extrudates by dissolving the polymer in an organic solvent, the activity of AP was determined using an enzymatic activity assay. Results Exposure to heat stress showed a protective effect of inulin against activity loss for AP at 95 °C and 130 °C, whereas at 55 °C almost no activity loss was seen for both bare AP and AP spray dried with inulin. The decrease of activity was in accordance with Arrhenius behavior. After <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion at 55 °C, the remaining activity of AP was higher than 75 % for all formulations, and showed an additional stabilizing effect of inulin on AP in the hydrophilic polymer. The stabilizing effect of inulin was more pronounced with extrusion at intermediate temperature (85 °C), as in both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic polymer the remaining activity of spray dried AP was about twice as high as the remaining activity of bare AP. The activity loss of AP after extrusion at 130 °C was over 90 % for all formulations. Moreover, no stabilizing effects of inulin were seen, most probably due to the extrusion temperature being close to the Tg of the spray dried AP-inulin. Conclusions Heat stress data of proteins can not be used as a predictor for <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion formulation development, as the protein activity loss after heat stress does not correlate with the activity loss after extrusion. This discrepancy is most likely due to the shear forces that occur during extrusion. The use of inulin as a protective agent can be beneficial at low and intermediate temperatures...|$|R

Threshold bitterness concentrations of drugs and taste evaluation of <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> coated pellets were determined by panel method. The pellets of all the formulation batches were in the size range of 825 to 995 μ after <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> coating. Pellets exhibited uniformity of content in the range of 97. 6 – 101. 1 %.

40|$|Hot-melt {{adhesives}} {{have been}} commercially {{available for a}} long time and they are used in a wide range of applications. In recent years, packaging industry prefers to use <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive based on polyolefin because polyolefin provide ease of processing, low off-taste, low smell and heat seal ability. In this research, it is intended to develop the formulation for Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive with the same properties of polyolefin based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive since EVA offers low cost than polyolefin. To develop new formulation of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive (HMA), EVA copolymers with various melt index were blended together with resin, wax and antioxidant in the molten state. The performance of new formulations was compared with commercial polyolefin <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive. Three formulations of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive have been developed. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature and melt viscosity were studied by using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Brookfield Viscometer. From DSC curve, the result indicated that three new formulations and commercial polyolefin has a glass transition temperature between - 20 0 C and - 25 0 C. Implying, the EVA copolymer blend with resin is compatible. The peak observed on the heating curve corresponded to the melting point, Tm. EVA-HMA 1 and EVA-HMA 3 is comparable with commercial polyoelfin based on identical broad peak. The melt viscosity of all EVA HMA formulation and commercial polyolefin HMA decrease with increasing the temperature. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive with lower viscosity will have more flexibility to flow out, indicating that it has better wetting properties when applied to the substrate. EVA-HMA 3 have the best performance to be made the <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive for the packaging industry because of comparable thermal properties and viscosity at desired temperature with commercial polyolefin adhesive. Further research needs to be conducted on EVA-HMA 3 for other properties to confirm its viability in replacing the commercial polyolefin based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive in packaging industry...|$|R
40|$|Several {{thermoanalytical}} {{methods were}} used to assess the compatibility of EBA (copolymer of ethylene and n-butyl acrylate) <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> containing tackifiers of different nature (pentaerythritol rosin ester, polyterpene resin, aliphatic hydrocarbon resin, aromatic hydrocarbon resin, and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon resin). The influence of the compatibility of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad tackifier compatibility, even though aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion.

In this study, different polypropylene waxes (polypropylene wax – PP, – maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene wax – PPMA – copolymer of polypropylene and 10. 9 [*]wt. % polyethylene wax – PP-E) were added to EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> and they were characterized by Brookfield viscosity, softening point measurement, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, plate–plate rheology, tack, and single-lap shear adhesion. The viscosities of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> containing polypropylene waxes were relatively high, the highest viscosity corresponded to the formulation containing PP-E wax which also showed pseudoplasticity. The change in viscoelastic properties (i. e., from dominantly viscous to dominantly elastic) was produced at lower temperature in EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> containing PP-E wax, this adhesive exhibited the highest tack.
