40|$|This study {{describes}} the actual risks {{of exposure to}} contaminants, which <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> (Athene noctua vidalli) face in Dutch river floodplains. The results indicate that PCBs pose a risk: not only are levels in <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> from floodplains higher than levels found in <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> from a reference site but the PCB patterns in owls from the floodplains also indicate induction of hepatic cytochrome P 450 enzymes by dioxin like compounds, possibly PCBs.

Diamond Edge was left in the lead as they set out on their final lap and was soon joined by Night Nurse with <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> tracking them closely in third. Night Nurse increased the tempo and on jumping the final ditch six out, led ahead of <b>Little</b> <b>Owl,</b> Diamond Edge, Silver Buck and Spartan Missile while Royal Bond, who wasn't far behind, made a terrible blunder which put him out of contention. While Night Nurse jumped and travelled well throughout, he was joined at the third last by <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> and Silver Buck. The latter two began to pull away approaching the penultimate fence where Silver Buck's error gave <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> a clear advantage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{change of}} land use is often cited as a causal factor in the decline of many spe-cies of {{farmland}} birds. Populations of the <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> (Athene noctua Scop., 1769) have notably decreased throughout Europe in the last 60 years, including the Czech Republic. The aims {{of this study were}} to estimate the recent population trend of the <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> and to analyze the importance of altitude and grassland habitat within <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> territories. The population trend of the <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> in the Czech Republic has still decreasing ten-dency. The population density dropped from 0. 33 breeding pairs (bps) 10 km– 2 to 0. 12 bps 10 km– 2 in the first (1993 – 1995) and second (1998 – 1999) monitoring program, respectively. The decline is apparent also from results from last <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> monitoring program which were carried out in 2005 – 2006 on 35 study plots (4607 km 2). The average population density was estimated at 0. 1 bps 10 km– 2. A distinct feature of these recent populations is that they occur in the places with relatively high local density (core areas) in com-parison to the surroundings, which are unoccu-pied. At present, the <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> rarely breeds in natural tree cavities, but rather the majority of nesting sites are situated in human artifacts, espe-cially within agricultural objects. Areas in which the <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> occurs have a significantly larger proportion of grasslands and are situated at lower altitudes. We suggest that the changes in agricul-tural landscape associated with disappearance of traditional farming management of grassland habitats, forceful pasturage and regular mowing were the main factors in this long-term popula-tion decline. The recent decrease of <b>Little</b> <b>Owls</b> could be also the consequence of the existence of small isolated populations in which mortality is not balanced by immigration from surrounding areas...|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>owl</b> {{is partly}} diurnal and often perches boldly and {{prominently}} during the day. If {{living in an}} area with {{a large amount of}} human activity, <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> may grow used to humans and will remain on their perch, often in full view, while people are around. The <b>little</b> <b>owl</b> has a life expectancy of about sixteen years. However, many birds do not reach maturity; severe winters can take their toll and some birds are killed by road vehicles at night, so the average lifespan may be on the order of three years.|$|R
50|$|It was the Saturday before Christmas when <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> made {{a winning}} {{seasonal}} reappearance at Doncaster in a conditions event. A race over {{two and a}} half miles he was expected to win easily and did so by twenty lengths. He had been purchased by the Wilson family since his last start and it would be Jim Wilson who would ride <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> {{for the rest of his}} career. <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> stepped up in class for his next start in the Peter Marsh Handicap Chase at Haydock. Among his rivals were the veteran Tied Cottage, who finished eight lengths ahead in the previous season's Gold Cup before losing the race due to a drug test, Ballet Lord, winner of the previous season's Rowland Meyrick Handicap Chase and Straight Jocelyn, twice a winner already that season at Lingfield. Prior to the race, <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> was quoted at 14/1 for the Gold Cup alongside Tied Cottage. However, after the latter fell at the eleventh, <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> opened up a large lead in the back straight and with sound jumping and resolute galloping, he won by an easy fifteen lengths from Straight Jocelyn, moving towards the head of the Gold Cup market in the process. One week later, he contested the Tote Double Chase at Cheltenham and with Henry Kissinger, who had hitherto won all four completed starts, his only realistic opponent on paper, <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> was sent off 8/11 favourite. Due to heavy fog, not much was seen of the race itself. Nevertheless, he reportedly jumped well and in the end, won by six lengths from unfancied novice Lesley Ann (who incidentally, went on to win the Sun Alliance Chase six weeks later. <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> returned to Haydock for his final prep race to contest the inaugural running of the Timeform Chase. A valuable race established for novices and second season chasers, it attracted a small field and was effectively a match between <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> and leading northern novice Wayward Lad. In the event, Wayward Lad fell four from home leaving <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> to win by twelve lengths from Fairy King - a winner of two decent handicaps at Ascot and Cheltenham who was in receipt of 10lb.|$|R

50|$|After {{winning a}} {{qualifier}} for the Coral Golden Handicap Hurdle (currently {{known as the}} Pertemps Final at Nottingham, <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> was sent off favourite while carrying more weight than {{all but one of}} his opponents. Despite the race being only his fifth start, he ran with credit chasing home Willie Wumpkins (ironically ridden by Jim Wilson who would become <b>Little</b> <b>Owl's</b> regular jockey) who was six years his senior. <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> failed to win his next three starts but regained the winning thread at Market Rasen on his first start under leading amateur Jim Wilson. While success was seemingly assured, the jockey mistook the winning post and had to be rousted along to maintain his position at the finish. No such mistake was made on his next and final outing of the season at Wetherby where, despite conceding 33lb, <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> won by twenty lengths from Silversmith who himself had won four races that season. While he did not race outside of handicap company, <b>Little</b> <b>Owl's</b> progression was such that he wound up being rated that season's leading staying hurdler by Timeform - ahead of Stayers' Hurdle winner, Lighter.|$|R

To {{combat the}} threat of predation, prey species have developed {{a variety of ways}} to recognize and respond appropriately to novel predators. While there is evidence that predator recognition does not require learning in certain species, learning appears {{to play an important role}} for other species. In systems where learning is important, it is less clear whether predator identification requires prior experience with specific predators or, whether general experience with predators provides sufficient tools for identifying similar species of novel predators. Here we test whether wild-living adult birds recognize a dangerous predator that occurs in only part of their geographical range. We presented taxidermy mounts of <b>little</b> <b>owls,</b> Athene noctua, and sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, to blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, and great tits, Parus major. All populations of both tit species co-occur with sparrowhawks, but populations differ in their prior experience with <b>little</b> <b>owls.</b> We found that tits that overlap geographically with <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> responded to <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> using the same intensity of mobbing behaviour exhibited toward sparrowhawks. In populations with no historical contact with <b>little</b> <b>owls,</b> however, both blue and great tits treated <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> as a lower threat than sparrowhawks. These results suggest that blue tits and great tits do not generalize ‘predatory features’ to novel predators and instead need prior experience with specific predators before they assign the correct level of threat.

40|$|Interactions between top {{predators and}} mesopredators {{of the same}} guild often result in habitat {{segregation}} restricting interactions to shared habitat edges. Although negative edge effects are recognized as important spatial patterns in the ecology of fragmented landscapes, the underlying mechanisms of predator–prey interactions resulting in negative edge effects remain unknown. To disentangle top-down effects of intraguild predators and bottom-up effects of shared resources on mesopredator spatial distribution, we recorded the occurrence of tawny owls Strix aluco in forests and their prey, the <b>little</b> <b>owl</b> Athene noctua in adjacent open areas over 2 yr across 687 km 2 in Southern Germany. We developed a new, asymmetrical dynamic two-species occupancy model investigating spatial interactions while accounting for imperfect detection. <b>Little</b> <b>owl</b> occupancy was strongly reduced within 150 m of forests, {{but only in the}} presence of tawny owls. Analysis of over 30 000 telemetry locations of 275 <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> showed that <b>little</b> <b>owls</b> strongly avoided areas closer than 150 m from the forest during range use. These results suggest that the negative edge effect is due to forest edge avoidance rather than direct predation. Potential confounding mechanisms such as food depletion or habitat avoidance at forest edges can be ruled out. Thus, top-down effects caused by avoidance of intraguild top predators shape the spatial distribution of mesopredators such as the <b>little</b> <b>owl.</b> While habitat complexity mitigates multitrophic interactions within habitats, it is expected to reinforce multitrophic interactions between habitats, potentially leading to the suppression of mesopredators from suitable habitats...|$|R

40|$|Most owl species exhibit {{territorial}} behaviour {{in order to}} have sufficient resources to maintain their fitness and biological success. The <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> (Athene noctua) has been considered a territorial species, although some authors have pointed to movements and social interactions outside a particular territory. We hypothesise that the spatial behaviour and social organisation of <b>Little</b> <b>Owl</b> follows a complex pattern, which varies throughout the year. We radio-tracked nine <b>Little</b> <b>Owls</b> in an area of 10 km 2 over nine months, paying particular attention to home range variation, social interaction and vocal behaviour. Home range size and overlap varied markedly throughout the year, with maximums in winter, and minimum size and overlap during the breeding season. <b>Little</b> <b>Owls</b> showed exclusive home ranges during the breeding season, whereas home range overlap was frequent in winter. Owls which had lost clutches increased their home ranges and shared the same for-aging areas with other owls. Vocal activity was low all year round, except in the months immediately prior to courtship. Increase of vocal behaviour was therefore also associated with a reduction in home range.
