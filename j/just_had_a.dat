5|$|Commander Martin Brooke (played by Alex Ferns) {{is the son}} of a car {{mechanic}} and his naval {{background is}} based on piloting, rather than commanding a ship. He is assisted by Lt Cdr Jenny Howard (played by Emily Hamilton), who is initially his temporary XO, but eventually accepts Brooke's offer to stay on the ship. Lieutenant Commander William Lewis, the Marine Engineering Officer (played by Ian Bartholomew), is the superior of Charge Chief Marine Engineering Artificer (CCMEA) Andy Fellows (played by Steve Speirs) and Lewis's refusal to give the engines full maintenance regularly infuriates him, though not as much as LMEA Dave Finnan (played by Paul Chequer) who has <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> baby with his daughter Teresa (played by Chloe Howman).
