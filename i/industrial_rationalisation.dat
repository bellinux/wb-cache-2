The policy of government funding includes three alternatives: the two basic options of maintaining a national project or participating in international collaboration involving a number of sovereign states, and the third option of doing both in parallel. The study examines international collaboration {{in such a way as}} to assist in the selection of the appropriate policy option. Particular attention is paid to the perspective of small and large, advanced and less advanced European countries. The research problem is addressed by focusing exclusively on those results which distinguish international collaboration from a national project, summarised under the concepts of collaborative sharing and collaborative efficiency. The former identifies the sharing of funding and technology not to be found in a national project. The latter identifies the difference in efficiency between international collaboration and a national project. Efficiency, indicated by cost, quality and time, is examined under the headings of policy-making, executive management, <b>industrial</b> <b>rationalisation</b> and production volume. Furthermore, collaborative sharing and efficiency are examined in the context of parallel national projects. This focus on the differences between the policy options provides the basis for selecting the appropriate one. Previous studies fail to give convincing answers to the research problem: they concentrate on collaborative efficiency while neglecting collaborative sharing, and they disagree over whether international collaboration or a national project is more efficient. This study attempts to overcome these shortcomings by examining a major case study of international collaboration, namely the European Communication Satellite Programme. The following conclusions are established. To achieve supply security, the collaborative option is considered appropriate for the large, advanced European country, and the parallel option for the large, less advanced countries. To achieve economic growth, the national option is appropriate for the advanced European countries. The smaller, less advanced countries are seen to play only a limited role in government funding of advanced technology. </p...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{workplace}} {{structure in}} New Zealand {{is based on}} a Fordist specialist division of labour that fragments and isolated the workforce, reinforcing the individualistic nature inherent in society. Changes in the economic circumstances (primarily deregulation, internationalism and the Employers Contracts Act) have manifested into extensive organisational, cultural, social and political workplace re-engineering. Understanding the transformation of the division of labour from a Fordist separatist hierarchy to a flexible team-based cooperative system details the orchestration of social labour in the multiplication of <b>industrial</b> organisation. The <b>rationalisation</b> of unskilled mass labour has been replaced with the concept of the flexible multi-skilled labour force and the ability to transform the human element in production. By adapting new team-based methods of work composition, companies are able to internalise continuous quality improvements through individual self-empowerment. Encouraging the highest degree of satisfaction for the individual and the most effective work performance for the organisation, teamwork is able to provide the basis for productivity improvements while simultaneously delivering better work conditions to all team members. Organisational innovation and revitalisation are deeply implicated in the shape of uneven development, so rather than analysing a specific plan of workplace reform, the interpretation of key factors of work systems will be addressed to provide a framework of change; an unsettling period for internal politics between employees and employers, as they must reorganise themselves in line with new forms of interactive working. An empancipatory team environment improves communication and employee participation, re-aligns New Zealand's economy with the requirements for success in the modern global market as detailed by the sustainable advancements made by the Dairy Processing Board, BHP New Zealand Steel, Interlock Industries, MacPac Wilderness Equipment Ltd, Weddel Tomoana, Thames Toyota and Christchurch Parkroyal...|$|R
