He {{retired from the}} FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the World Trade Center (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11.

2500|$|The project faced other problems. [...] Internally, {{the views}} {{of the members of the}} joint venture were not always in alignment. [...] As many people in {{business}} in Australia know, a joint venture is a less robust form of business enterprise than a company. Certainly there were many strains within the VFT Joint Venture, and they increased as the feasibility study progressed. [...] Wild, referring in 1995 to when the project expanded under the joint venture said, [...] "We then got in some professional management and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>things</b> started to slide from then on.” His role as Chairman of the joint venture was not easy.|$|E
2500|$|On October 6, 2004, Stern {{announced}} {{the signing of}} a five-year contract, starting in 2006, with Sirius Satellite Radio, a medium not subjected to the FCC's broadcast obscenity rules. He went into an exchange with Michael Powell, then-chairman of the FCC, {{when he was a}} guest on the Ronn Owens program on KGO on October 26, 2004. [...] "I don't think that you personally hate me. I think what you've been doing is dangerous to free speech. I don't think it's just against me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>things</b> have gotten way out of control," [...] said Stern when he called in. The Howard Stern Show aired for the final time on AM and FM airwaves on December 16, 2005. The fines issued by the FCC since 1990 had totaled $2.5 million.|$|E

The Billy character's final {{monologue}} in the film echoes remarks Dylan made in a 1997 interview with David Gates of Newsweek: [...] "I don't think I'm tangible to myself. <b>I</b> mean, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> one <b>thing</b> today and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> another <b>thing</b> tomorrow. <b>I</b> change {{during the course of a}} day.

During the last two days we have taken twice as much as we were doing before, so that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>things</b> will be about even.

[...] "People say vast universe... infinity and astronomy; not sure... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>things</b> are too close together... packed up; for travelling... stars too close, really... why, the sun's a star, too close to be seen properly; the earth's a star, too close to be seen at all... too many pebbles on the beach; ought all {{to be put in}} rings; too many blades of grass to study... feathers on a bird make the brain reel; wait till the big bag is unpacked... may all be put in our right places then." ...|$|E

I had an uncle who knitted his own socks to {{the day of his}} death--and he did it better than any of his daughters, dear old gentleman. Now I wonder that you, Miss Allan, who use your eyes so much, don't take up knitting in the evenings. You'd find it such a relief, I should say--such a rest to the eyes--and the bazaars are so glad of things." [...] Her voice dropped into the smooth half-conscious tone of the expert knitter; the words came gently one after another. [...] "As much as I do I can always dispose of, which is a comfort, for then I feel that I am not wasting my time--" ...|$|E

I have met several people we know well this morning. Some of them just gave me a nod, as much as to say, we see you, but don't want to speak to you. Others nodded, as if they {{would have liked to have}} stopped and chatted with me, but were rather afraid to do so; while Tom Fernlea and two other fellows came up and shook hands just as heartily as usual, and asked when I came back from uncle's, what I had been doing, and so on, as if nothing had happened. At any rate, mother, a thing like this gives one an opportunity of finding out which of your friends are worth having and which are not." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must have}} been resentful and bitter in the {{beginning}} of that talk. I do not remember that I had any command of the situation or did anything but protest throughout that day. I was too full of the egotism of the young lover to mark Mary's moods and feelings. It was only afterwards that I came to understand that she was not wilfully and deliberately following the course that was to separate us, that she was taking it with hesitations and regrets. Yet she spoke plainly enough, she spoke with a manifest sincerity of feeling. And while I had neither the grasp nor the subtlety to get behind her mind I perceive now as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>things</b> out that Lady Ladislaw had both watched and acted, had determined her daughter's ideas, sown her mind with suggestions, imposed upon her a conception of her situation that now dominated all her thoughts.|$|E

But there's nothing reckless about him; he don't drink, and he don't gamble, and it says {{a lot for a}} young fellow in New Orleans that he don't do one or the other. And he can fight, he can; there ain't no doubt about that. Why, I saw him give the biggest kind of a thrashing to the bully of a lumber camp, where we moored up alongside one night, as ever you seed. The chap was big enough to eat him, but he didn't have no kind of show. The young un just hit him where he liked, and in five minutes that chap's face was a thing to see, and the lad never got so much as a scratch. I wouldn't have thought as a man could have used his hands like that if I hadn't been thar. I shall be right-down sorry to lose him." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Robert K. Elder for the book The Best Film You've Never Seen, Durkin said, “When I make a film, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>things</b> that scare me. My exploration of those things {{is to try and}} wrap my head around them and confront them.” ...|$|R

Still, {{it may be that}} this will be the best in the end, for we could hardly have counted upon sinking the whole of them, and once past us they would have been off like the wind; and though we might have followed some of them, the others would have made off, some one way and some another, whereas, by laying the vessel across the mouth of the creek, we {{have a good chance of}} catching them all as they come down. There is no doubt a lot more fellows have arrived to help the rajah; we can see that there are a great many more about on the shore than there have been before. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>things</b> will come to a crisis before many hours have passed. We have made out that men keep coming and going behind that row of six huts facing the river, and I should not be surprised if they are not hard at work establishing a battery there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 29. This is leap year, {{and this}} is leap day. Prince George was born on this day. People are mistaken; and some here think it is St. David's Day; {{but they do not}} {{understand}} the virtue of leap year. I have nothing to do now, boys, and have been reading all this day like Gumdragon; and yet I was dictating some trifles this morning to a printer. I dined with a friend hard by, and the weather was so discouraging I could not walk. I came home early, and have read two hundred pages of Arran. Alexander the Great is just dead: I do not think he was poisoned; betwixt you and me, all those are but idle stories: it is certain that neither Ptolemy nor Aristobulus thought so, and they were both with him when he(12) died. It is a pity we have not their histories. The Bill for limiting Members of Parliament to have but so many places passed the House of Commons, and will pass the House of Lords, in spite of the Ministry, which you know is a great lessening of the Queen's power. Four of the new lords voted against the Court in this point. It is certainly a good Bill in the reign of an ill prince, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>things</b> are not settled enough for it at present. And the Court may want a majority upon a pinch.

[...] "It may be that I have judged him too harshly, seeing that he set himself against what was best for his welfare. Still, one cannot expect men's heads on boys' shoulders, and he writes dutifully and properly. I believe it is the fault of Andrew Carson, who was forever edging me on by reports of the boy's laziness and carelessness. He {{certainly}} has a grudge against him, and he assuredly exceeded his place and authority when he lifted his hand against my wife's cousin. It seems to me truly that I have acted somewhat hastily and wrong headedly in the matter. I shall give Master Carson notice {{that at the end of}} a month I shall require his services no longer--the fellow puts himself too forward. That will please Mary; she never liked him, and women in these matters of likes and dislikes are shrewder than we are. Perhaps when she hears that he is going, and reads this letter, which I will forward to her by the carrier, she may come back to me. I certainly miss her sorely, and the household matters go all wrong now that she is away. She ought not to have said things to me; but no wise man thinks anything of what a woman says when she's angry; and now that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>things</b> over, it certainly seems to me that she had some sort of warrant for her words. Yes, I certainly don't know what can have come over me, unless it was that fellow, Andrew Carson. Richard Anthony has not been considered a bad fellow else he would never have become the Mayor of Southampton; and for fifteen years Mary and I have got on very well together, save for the little disputes which have arisen from her over masterful disposition. But she is a good wife--none could wish for better--though she is given to flame out at what she considers unrighteous dealings; but every woman has her faults, and every man too as far as that goes, and upon the whole few of them have less than Mary. I will write to her at once." ...|$|E
