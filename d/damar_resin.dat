Damar gardens are cultivated forests of trees of the genera Shorea, Balanocarpus, or Hopea used as a source of <b>Damar</b> <b>resin.</b> P. tenangau is the only known tessaratomid which feeds on Dipterocarpaceae.|$|E
50|$|Encaustic painting, {{also known}} as hot wax painting, {{involves}} using heated beeswax to which colored pigments are added. The liquid or paste is then applied to a surface - usually prepared wood, though canvas and other materials are often used. The simplest encaustic mixture {{can be made from}} adding pigments to beeswax, but there are several other recipes that can be used - some containing other types of waxes, <b>damar</b> <b>resin,</b> linseed oil, or other ingredients. Pure, powdered pigments can be used, though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of pigment.|$|E

Other materials can be encased or collaged into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic medium to adhere it to the surface.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{explores the}} {{diversity}} in sensitivity to drought of moist tropical forest tree species. Yearly tree growth records collected over a ten-year period in two one-hectare 70 -year-old damar agroforest plots in Sumatra are analysed. These agroforests are mixed tree plantations, dominated by Shorea javanica K. & V., a dipterocarp tree cultivated and tapped for its commercially valuable <b>resin</b> (<b>damar).</b> Many indigenous fruit tree species grow in these agroforests, {{as well as}} timber tree species originating from the nearby natural forest. During the census period the multi-species stands were subjected to three El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) -related droughts (1994, 1997 and 2002). At the tree community level, these droughts were associated with a marked decrease in radial stem growth. Multilevel modelling was used to explore the relative contribution of species, tree size and individual tree characteristics to the observed response to drought. All tree species appeared {{to be sensitive to}} drought but the amplitude of the response varied significantly across species. Predicted species mean decrease in stem radial growth rate on drought years (i. e. years with 6 months with less than 50 mm/month rainfall) ranged from less than 5 % to more than 80 %. Shared species were ranked consistently between plots indicating that the results were robust. Stem diameter significantly affected tree sensitivity to drought in two species only, but in opposite ways: in S. javanica, larger trees appeared to be less sensitive while the opposite was true for Lansium domesticum, an abundant fruit tree. Individual tree sensitivity to drought contributed significantly albeit to a small extent to the overall response to drought. This individual tree effect did not show any pattern of spatial correlation and hence could not be related to topographic features. It is likely to reflect the individual's unique history and genotype...|$|R
40|$|Wood resin {{of mixed}} {{tropical}} hardwoods (MTH) Kraft pulp was removed and characterized. Characterization of wood resin from different pulping stages was achieved accurately using Pyrolytic Gas Chromatographic-Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). Two types of resin were recognized: (1) {{small fraction of}} unreactive and inaccessible <b>damar</b> <b>resin</b> which was only found to be concentrated in centri-cleaner reject, (2) large fractions of fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and sterols. These can be removed chemically, e. g. by surfactant addition. Results of experiments showed that addition of surfactant enhances removal of extractives and decreases the chemical consumption during bleaching stage...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} proposition that trade in non-timber forest products such as medicinal plants, fruit and rattan would simultaneously lead to forest conservation and rural development. In doing so, it touches {{on a range of}} related topics such as tenure security, agroforestry and the non-agricultural sector. The book contains both a meta-analysis of 55 cases in Asia, Africa and Latin America and an in-depth study of the <b>damar</b> <b>resin</b> agroforests in Sumatra, Indonesia. The findings indicate that the relationship between forest conservation and rural development is characterized by trade-offs. Policymakers and practitioners working in conservation need to acknowledge that win-win approaches are often unrealistic and sometimes even naive. Supporting agroforestry is, however, a promising strategy to achieve a balanced trade-off between conservation and development...|$|E
40|$|Collection of non-timber forest {{products}} (NTFPs) has been promoted in India as a strategy to aid wildlife conservation whilst simultaneously alleviating poverty, and recent legislation now gives communities living within protected areas {{the legal right to}} collect NTFPs. However, research on the financial rewards from NTFP collection and its contribution to sustainable development is equivocal. In a case study in the Periyar Tiger Reserve, India, we examined whether NTFP collection can solve livelihood problems by analysing revenues obtained from various NTFP species, estimating the economic returns to collectors from various social backgrounds, and exploring the attitudes of collectors towards their profession. We found that black <b>damar</b> <b>resin</b> from the tree Canarium strictum (61. 3 %) and mace from Myristica spp. (35. 5 %) were the most commonly collected NTFPs, and the most valuable NTFPs were honey from Apis cerana indica (USD 4. 12 kg(- 1)), cardamom Elettaria cardamomum (USD 3. 67 kg(- 1)) and Myristica spp. (USD 2. 77 kg(- 1)). Mean daily revenue from NTFP collection was USD 3. 15 +/- SD 4. 19 day(- 1), and the lowest daily revenues were earned by part-time collectors with low socio-economic status such as migrants, forest-dwellers or those without access to agricultural land. Most collectors (82 %) did not wish to continue harvesting NTFPs if alternative livelihoods from agriculture could be provided, and none wanted their children to be NTFP collectors. Our findings suggest that, with respect to social justice, poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability, the role of NTFP collection in sustainable development is questionable...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a model of poverty eleviation in the buffer zone of National Park through the {{optimization}} of the impact of the fuel subsidiary reallocation (BLT), statrted from April to October 2013 in three villages which representent ethnic culture in Lampung, Java, and the mixture of both, selecting 50 poor households (RTM) who received BLT (direct cash assistance) in 2005. In-depth interview was conducted to capture the economy performance of each household. Qualitative probability model was applied to the response variable (Yi) that were scored 1 for those have been exited from the poverty and scored 0 if not yet. The predictor variables used (Xij) including: fuel prices (Rp/liter), total of BLT (Rp), demographics (age, sex, family head education, as well as the number of dependents), the value of productive assets (Rp million/household), revenue from <b>damar</b> <b>resin,</b> and other sources (Rp million/household), access to public services, the distance to the border of BBSNP, the availlability of PNPM (national project of community empowermnent that scored 1 if any and 0 if not), the performance of social capital and the extention program conveyed. The Minitab Version 16 was employed for exzamining the goodness to the model and the significancy of the parameters pursued at the level of 5 % and 10 %. The conclusions were the exit capability against poverty were significantly affected by: fuel prices, the ammount of the BLT, the exisistency of PNPM, gender & education of household, number of dependents, the distance to central districts, the presence of electricity, the power of social capital, land ownership of both damar agroforest and paddy field acreages, the owner of productive assets such as ruminants. Accordingly, there were no culturetribe significantly affected by the existing from of poverty, which means that the poverty in this region was more structural cause than that of the cultural one...|$|E
