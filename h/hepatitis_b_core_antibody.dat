We evaluated the immunization status of such children in Palermo, Italy. We searched {{for the presence of}} a BCG scar in 88 children, 49 boys and 39 girls (mean age 76 +/- 32 months), most of whom (98 %) came from Eastern Europe. Presence of BCG scar was observed in 59 (67. 1 %) of them, included five children without any pre-adoptive medical records. Twenty-three out of 29 children without any evidence of BCG scar were tested by Mantoux. Seven (30. 4 %) of 23 were tuberculin positive and diagnosed as having latent tuberculosis infection. We also examined immunization status against poliovirus 1 - 3, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> of 70 internationally adopted children and we compared it with the pre-adoptive immunization records of their birth country. Protective titers (> 1 : 8) against poliovirus 1 - 3, were found respectively in 67. 1 %, 91. 4 %, 42. 8 % of 70 immunized children, and only 38. 5 % of them had at the same time full protection against all three types of poliovirus. Protective titers against tetanus and diphtheria were found in 91. 4 % and 95. 7 % of 70 vaccinated children. Presence of antibodies against pertussis, measles, mumps and rubella was observed respectively in 16 (32. 6 %) of 49, 40 (62. 5 %) of 64, 28 (56 %) of 50 and 24 (85. 7 %) of 28 children who had received the vaccine. As regards <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B,</b> only 20 of 29 vaccinated children had detectable <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> surface antibodies, while four of 29 vaccinated and two of 41 not vaccinated children were positive for both <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> surface <b>antibodies</b> and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Finally three of 41 not vaccinated children were both <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> surface antigen and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibodies</b> positive.

40|$|The {{frequency}} for virology {{testing for}} couples undergoing assisted reproductive treatment (ART) in Europe is currently under debate, with little scientific data available {{to support the}} time-frame imposed by EU legislation. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the incidence of blood-borne viruses (BBV) in this population and to assess the likelihood of seroconversion after an initial negative screen and the possible cost saving to couples. We identified all cases where a BBV screen was performed on patients attending our tertiary referral unit for ART. We calculated the incidence of Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody and HIV infection in this population and the incidence of seroconversion in follow-up screening (which included <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibody)</b> following the implementation of the EU legislation. In all cases identified, we sought to assess the risk of seroconversion after an initial negative screen. Between 1998 and 2009, we identified a total of 79 291 tests performed in over 12 500 patients. The incidence in this population of Hepatitis B surface antigen was 0. 28 % (37 / 12, 797), <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibody</b> 3. 32 % (96 / 2891), Hepatitis C antibody 0. 33 % (43 / 12, 762) and HIV 0. 007 % (1 / 12, 819). We were able to show that for over 6500 individuals who were tested and re-tested for all three viruses, no seroconversions were reported. Based on the above measured negligible risk of seroconversion after an initial negative screen in co-habitating couples participating in an ART programme, current legislation requiring screening of couples at each procurement of cells in the assisted reproductive setting is not clinically justified...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> and C serological markers in a population of refugees living in Athens. METHODS: One hundred and thirty refugees (81 males and 49 females, mean age ±SD: 31. 7 ± 8 years) {{were included in the}} study. The <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus surface antigen (HBsAg), the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>core</b> <b>antibody</b> (anti-HBc) and the hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) were detected using a third-generation immunoassay. RESULTS: Twenty individuals (15. 4 %) were HBsAg positive and 69 (53. 1 %) were anti-HBc positive. The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBc was higher among refugees from Albania and Asia (statistical significant difference, P< 0. 008 and P< 0. 001 respectively). Th...|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{investigated}} {{the prevalence of}} positive viral hepatitis titres in sickle cell disease (SCD) {{and the relationship of}} abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) to transfusions and ferritin levels. Charts from 141 patients with SCD were reviewed and recent laboratory data on serum ferritin, hepatitis serology, units of packed red blood cells transfused and LFTs were collected. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibodies</b> were positive in 14 % of patients (12 / 86) and Hepatitis C viral antibody titres were positive in 16. 5 % (15 / 91). There was a relationship of positive serologies to transfusion for hepatitis C virus (HCV), but not for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus (HBV). <b>Hepatitis</b> C antibody negative (HCVAb)) patients had fewer packed red blood cells (pRBC) transfused than Hepatitis C antibody positive (HCVAb+) (6. 4 vs. 20. 3, P 0. 08). Patients with ferritins 1000 ng/ml also showed a difference in units transfused (P < 0. 003). Steady state LFTs, with the exception of alkaline phosphatase, had no relationship to serum ferritin or hepatitis serologies. Males were twice as likely to have positive serology as females but more females had elevated ferritin levels. Paired analysis of LFTs in steady state and crisis failed to demonstrate deterioration during crisis. We conclude that: (1) there is a relationship of positive Hepatitis C serology, but not <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> serology, to transfusion; (2) ferritin levels correlate with transfusion number but not with LFTs; (3) in our population, LFTs in SCD are usually normal and do not increase in vaso-occlusive crises...|$|R
40|$|From December 1988 to April 1989, 154 female {{prostitutes in}} and around Ghent, Belgium, were interviewed about their knowledge, attitudes and {{practices}} {{in relation to the}} risks for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in their profession. Thirty four women worked as window prostitutes, 120 picked up their clients in bars, clubs, and saunas. Blood samples were taken from 123 women. One (0. 8 %) was seropositive for HIV 1, 19 (15. 4 %) had <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibodies</b> (anti-HBc), eight (6. 4 %) showed markers of syphilis. None of them were <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV) were present in the serum of three women (2. 4 %). Overall STD seroprevalence was higher in the group of window prostitutes than in the group of club prostitutes. One woman admitted intravenous drug use. Former testing for anti-HIV antibodies had been performed in 102 (66. 5 %) respondents, of whom 84 (82. 3 %) were tested in the year preceding the interview. In 74. 5 % of the cases, these tests were requested by the women themselves. These results suggest that HIV infection is not yet prevalent in non-intravenous drug using prostitutes in Ghent, but that this situation may change considering their higher rates of past STD. Window prostitutes are at higher risk than club prostitutes. Testing for HIV seems to be common practice, mostly {{at the request of the}} women themselves. Health education should discourage the notion of testing as an alternative to using condoms...|$|R
40|$|In occult {{hepatitis}} B infection (OBI), hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) can {{be detected}} in serum samples; however, oral fluid collection for detection of HBV DNA {{has not yet been}} explored, despite the availability of collection devices. Serum and oral fluid samples from 45 <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibody</b> (anti-HBc) -positive patients were collected for the amplification of the HBV polymerase gene. HBV DNA was detected in five serum and four oral fluid samples (the detection limit for oral fluid was 1. 656 log IU/mL in paired serum). In conclusion, simple methodologies of sample collection and in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allowed detection of HBV DNA, and these could be used to improve the diagnosis of OBI, especially in locations with limited resources...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{goals of}} this study were to {{estimate}} seroprevalence of prior hepatitis B infection among high-risk adolescents and to determine the cost-effectiveness of prevaccination immunity screening. METHODS: The authors computed a "break-even" seroprevalence level calculated from current vaccine and administration costs. They then conducted a seroprevalence study of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibody</b> using sera previously submitted for syphilis serology from four-hundred adolescent and adult clients of sexually transmitted disease clinics. Finally, the authors compared age group-specific seroprevalence rates to the computed break-even seroprevalence. RESULTS: Levels of prior hepatitis B infection for all age groups were lower than the break-even seroprevalence standard from which cost-effectiveness was calculated. CONCLUSIONS: From the findings {{of this study}}, the authors concluded that routine preimmunization screening for prior hepatitis B infection would not be cost-effective for this population...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{is a major}} health problem. Approximately one-third of people worldwide have positive serological markers of current or previous infection. It is estimated that 350 million persons worldwide are Hepatitis B sur-face antigen (HBsAg) –positive, reflecting chronic HBV infection (1). HBV {{infection is}} known to cause acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (2), and population-based studies have shown increased rates of liver disease–related mor-tality among HBV-infected persons (3 – 5). However, the burden of HBV-related disease has never been measured by hospitalizations in a population-based setting. Cross-sectional studies of HBV prevalence in Greenland have estimated that approximately 40 %– 45 % of people there are <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibody</b> (anti-HBc) –positive and 5 %– 10 % are HBsAg-positive (6 – 8).

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} infection with HIV- 1, HIV 2, HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 in female attenders at a central London sexually transmitted disease clinic in an 8 week period in 1989 - 1990, and compare it with similar samples studied between 1985 and 1987. DESIGN [...] Anonymous testing of serum samples from consecutive female patients having routine serological investigation for syphilis. Testing was for clinically important retroviruses, <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antibodies</b> (anti-HBc), and p 24 and reverse transcriptase (RT) antigens. Age (in 5 year bands), nationality (in broad geographical zones), diagnosis {{on the day of}} presentation, and history of intravenous drug usage were recorded for each patient. Annual gonorrhoea rates were analysed from 1981 to 1990. SETTING [...] Outpatients of the department of genitourinary medicine. PATIENTS [...] A total of 850 females attending consecutively and having routine syphilis serology. MAIN RESULTS [...] The prevalence of anti-HIV- 1 in female attenders in 1989 - 1990 was 0. 35 % (3 / 850). Prevalence in the same clinic has remained statistically unchanged since the first female cases were identified in 1986. No cases of HIV- 2, HTLV- 1 or HTLV- 2 were identified, and no early HIV- 1 infection evidenced by the presence of p 24 or RT antigenaemia was found. Female gonorrhoea rates continued to decline but other STD monthly/annual rates have remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS [...] Over the last 5 years prevalence of HIV- 1 infection in females in our clinic has remained unchanged and other retroviral infections have remained absent. However, the unaltered rates of other genital infections, their potential role in the heterosexual spread of HIV- 1 infection, and the lack of evidence for any major changes in female sexual behaviour suggests {{there is a need to}} remain vigilant. This work complements the MRC multicentre, unlinked, genitourinary medicine clinic, anonymous testing programme, and our group will continue to apply this simple methodology to specimens from female attenders to contribute to the surveillance of the evolving HIV- 1 epidemic...|$|R
