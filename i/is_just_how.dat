They say that it puts excess stress on them because they start being {{recruited}} in their junior year of high school. If they have a bad season it could ruin their chances to get into college and therefore into the NBA. It can also be stressful picking a college to play at, which can be unneeded stress if a player decides to leave after only one year.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole and was produced by Lifehouse and Jude Cole at Ironworks Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with The San Bernardino Sun, Wade talked about making songs on the album and said, [...] "This time around it was not about having any preconceived notions. It was about letting the tape machine roll and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I think the main message of this song, at least for me personally when I was writing the lyrics, <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> difficult it can be to be in a relationship. Sometimes, you do things to disappoint the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit."

But she puts so much feeling into it that it winds up being the album's most moving song." [...] Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive, praising the song's [...] "simple backing music, and Beyoncé's flawless and beautiful voice." [...] She concluded that [...] "I Was Here" [...] ends up being a [...] "standout song on the album [...] we won't be forgetting Queen B in a hurry." [...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive, writing, [...] "Payoff comes on 11th song, the epically loping 'I Was Here.' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that [...] "I Was Here" [...] comes to [...] "a show-stopping moment in a Beyonce concert near you". James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder, introduces [...] "a new strain of her balladry: an ethereal marriage of R sensuality and stuttering indie-rock guitars." [...] Condar Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his {{appreciation for}} the song, writing, [...] " [...] perhaps even more notable is the record's penultimate track, the Ryan Tedder-produced 'I Was Here'. Tedder is arguably {{one of the most}} irritating people working in pop today, and considering his track record, it's not a surprise that 'I Was Here' is the most contemporary-sounding song off of 4. What is surprising <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> good it is. The production is predictably icky, making that increasingly common mistake of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of 'epicness'." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line [...] "I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time" [...] in the song defined the whole album. Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs on 4, describing it as a [...] "breast-clutching tour de fource".|$|E

Macdonald also will interview those who knew her best, including Clive Davis, founder and president of Arista Records. Macdonald stated; [...] "The story that is never told about Whitney <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> brilliant she was as an artist; by many measures she had the greatest voice of the last 50 years. She changed the way pop music was sung - bringing it back full circle to its blues and gospel roots. She was also completely unique in being a black pop star who transcended her race globally with her work sold in countries where black artists don’t sell."

[...] Stylus Magazine's Jessica Popper wrote that the album [...] "manages to combine several of the currently popular music genres whilst still making a perfect pop album [...] It's {{one of the few}} Europop albums that not only deserves worldwide domination, but also has a really good chance of achieving it." [...] In a review for the Manchester Evening News, Paul Taylor described the album as [...] "undeniably sexy" [...] and dubbed Robyn [...] "a mini-Madonna in the making". Billboards Jill Menze commended the album for its [...] "sassy and sweet dance pop gems". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau commented that he was [...] " [...] disoriented by the hype for 'With Every Heartbeat' [...] But without that add-on, which does grow on you the way pop breakthroughs will sometimes, this 2005 EU release might never have materialized here to prepare the way for Robyn 2010". James Hunter of The Village Voice complimented its [...] "fast electro arrangements tending toward the geometric" [...] and found that [...] " [...] appeal is questionable when she tries to sound like an American rapper, but on tracks where she just sings [...] she gives Europop a swift Swedish energy and presence". Pitchfork reviewer Jess Harvell felt that Robyn's [...] "pop fun is a bit knowing—she's 26 after all. But trust the Swedes. They know what they're doing with this sort of thing." ...|$|E
