40|$|We have {{observed}} {{the acceleration of}} electrons by a beat-wave generated in a deuterium plasma by two Nd-YAG and Nd-YLF laser wavelengths. Electrons injected at an energy of 3. 3 MeV are observed to be accelerated up to 4. 7 MeV after the plasma. The energy gain is compatible with a peak electric field {{of the order of}} 1. 2 GV/m. The experiment has been performed with different injection energies, from 2. 5 to 3. 3 MeV, with different plasma dimensions, and with different laser intensities. I. Introduction Among new methods to accelerate particles with a large electric field, the beat-wave technique [1] has been investigated by several groups for the last decade. In this scheme two highintensity laser pulses are focused in a vessel containing hydrogen gas and create a <b>fully</b> <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma.</b> The beating of the two waves provides a longitudinal electric field which oscillates with the frequency difference of the two lasers.

40|$|This thesis covers {{essentially}} {{two problems}} in the kinetic theory of plasmas. The first concerns the investigation of plasma oscillations in a constant electric field - a topic investigated by Akheizer and Sitenko as early as 1956 [1] More recently Stenflo [2] has considered the problem in which he replaces the collision integral of Boltzmann's equation by a Fokker-Planck term and a B. G. K. term. The dispersion relations derived by Stenflo contained a number of parameters {{the relative importance of}} which he did not clearly define. We have undertaken here a stability study of longitudinal oscillations of a weakly ionised gas permeated by a uniform electric field. A dispersion relation is formulated in terms of error-type functions and some computational studies are carried out for various plasma parameters of interest. The results are exhibited graphically in the form of Nyquist plots. The conclusions made by Stenflo and others regarding possible instabilities of the plasma needs modification, certainly {{in the context of a}} weakly ionised electron-ion gas. The second topic covered here concerns the transport theory of relativistic gases. This has received increasing attention in recent years [3, 4]. Much attention has been devoted to calculating the first order relativistic effects on the transport coefficients. Up to now only the 'Maxwellian' model, investigated by Israel [3], has been considered. The method of attack is via the Chapman-Enskog approach. In this second topic we develop a more general approach to the problem by generalising the classical spherical harmonic solution of the Boltzmann equation to the relativistic case. The theory is applied to transport problems of <b>fully</b> <b>ionised</b> <b>plasmas</b> in the Coulomb field...|$|R
40|$|Cluster plasmas are {{magnetised}} {{already at}} very low magnetic field strength. Low collisionality implies that conservation of the first adiabatic invariant results in an anisotropic viscous stress (Braginskii viscosity) or, equivalently, anisotropic plasma pressure. This triggers firehose and mirror instabilities, which have growth rates proportional to the wavenumber down to scales {{of the order of}} ion Larmor radius. This means that MHD equations with Braginskii viscosity are not well posed and fully kinetic description is necessary. In this paper, we review the basic picture of small-scale dynamo in the cluster plasma and attempt to reconcile it with the existence of plasma instabilities at collisionless scales. The intracluster medium (ICM) is a unique environment for studying astrophysical turbulence: it is made of amorphous diffuse <b>fully</b> <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> with almost no net rotation or shear. The ICM is, therefore, in a certain sense, a case of “pure ” turbulence. The presence of magnetic fields in the ICM with B ∼ 1 [...] . 10 µG and field scale ∼ 1 kpc is well documented (e. g., Carilli & Taylor 2002).

40|$|Observations {{of active}} regions and limb {{prominences}} often show cold, dense blobs descending with an acceleration {{smaller than that}} of free fall. The dynamics of these condensations falling in the solar corona is investigated in this paper using a simple <b>fully</b> <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> model. We find {{that the presence of}} a heavy condensation gives rise to a dynamical rearrangement of the coronal pressure that results in the formation of a large pressure gradient that opposes gravity. Eventually this pressure gradient becomes so large that the blob acceleration vanishes or even points upwards. Then, the blob descent is characterised by an initial acceleration phase followed by an essentially constant velocity phase. These two stages can be identified in published time-distance diagrams of coronal rain events. Both the duration of the first stage and the velocity attained by the blob increase for larger values of the ratio of blob to coronal density, for larger blob mass, and for smaller coronal temperature. Dense blobs are characterised by a detectable density growth (up to 60 % in our calculations) and by a steepening of the density in their lower part, that could lead to the formation of a shock. They also emit sound waves that could be detected as small intensity changes with periods of the order of 100 s and lasting between a few and about ten periods. Finally, the curvature of the falling path is only relevant when a very dense blob falls along inclined magnetic field lines...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of a high-current ion beam in background plasma is of considerable interest for many experiments. It has been shown, that the stopping power for heavy ions of <b>fully</b> <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> {{is up to}} forty times higher than of cold gases. For this reason {{a new kind of}} gas discharge plasma target is now under investigation at Frankfurt University. The main advantage of this new plasma target is a electrode less configuration. Due to new experimental and theoretical insights [1], the energy deposition into the plasma was performed by capacitive coupling. Confinement of the plasma was achieved using a static quadrupole field. According to [2] the confinement of the RF plasma may be achieved by the stronger focusing than defocusing forces on the alternating electrons during the discharge. A RF power meter enabled us to compare the efficiency of the capacitive coupling to the inductive coupling. Clearly the capacitive coupling has the best performance. The capacitive coupling achieved a maximum efficiency of 92 % at 40 MHz with 200 W of RF-power deposited inside the plasma, where the inductive coupling mechanism struggled to achieve 20 % at 20 MHz with 35 W of RF power inside the plasma load.

We have found a general relation for the Hall voltage as function of the mass and viscosity ratios, which converges to the usual expression in the limit of solid matter, i. e. when ions are much more massive than electrons. All the simulations have been performed using a three-dimensional Lattice-Boltzmann model, which has been also validated for some relevant applications.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{techniques}} are {{developed for the}} simulation of partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasmas</b> in the fluid approximation. These techniques are used to model the evolution of magnetic fields in the partially ionised regions of the solar atmosphere. Single fluid equations for a partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> are derived based on the individual equations for each species. A Lagrangian Remap MHD code is then adapted to simulate a plasma of arbitrary degree of ionisation. The effects {{of the presence of}} neutrals on the propagation and damping of Alfv´en waves in the solar atmosphere are investigated. Ion-neutral collisions are shown to be an efficient damping mechanism for outwardly propagating Alfv´en waves of frequencies greater than 0. 1 Hz, showing that high frequency waves in the outer solar atmosphere cannot originate at the surface of the Sun. Next simulations to show the effects of neutrals on the emergence of magnetic flux from beneath the solar surface into the outer atmosphere are performed. Results from 2 D and 3 D numerical experiments show that the presence of neutrals increases the amount of magnetic flux that can emerge into the corona. Furthermore, ion-neutral collisions are strong enough to dissipate currents perpendicular to the magnetic field as it emerges. This shows that ion-neutral collisions are a viable mechanism for the formation of force-free (j ∧B = 0) coronal magnetic field from sub-surface field, which is not the case when the plasma is assumed to be <b>fully</b> <b>ionised.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|This {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{dissipative}} instability that appears in a compressible partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> slab embedded in a uniform magnetic field, modelling {{the state of the}} plasma in solar prominences. In the partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma,</b> the dominant dissipative effect is the Cowling resistivity. The regions outside the slab (modelling the solar corona) are <b>fully</b> <b>ionised,</b> and the dominant mechanism of dissipation is viscosity. Analytical solutions to the extended magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are found inside and outside of the slab and solutions are matched at the boundaries of the slab. The dispersion relation is derived and solutions are found analytically in the slender slab limit, while the conditions necessary for the appearance of the instability is investigated numerically for the entire parameter space. Our study is focussed on the effect of the compressibility on the generation and evolution of instabilities. We find that compressibility reduces the threshold of the equilibrium flow, where waves can be unstable, to a level that is comparable to the internal cusp speed, which is of the same order of flow speeds that are currently observed in solar prominences. Our study addresses only the slow waves, as these are the most likely perturbations to become unstable, however the time-scales of the instability are found to be rather large ranging from $ 10 ^ 5 $-$ 10 ^ 7 $ seconds. It is determined that the instability threshold is further influenced by the concentration of neutrals and the strength of the viscosity of the corona. Interestingly, these two latter aspects have opposite effects.

The problem {{of the formation of}} molecules (principally H 2) at the surfaces of interstellar dust grains is considered in Chapter I. It is shown that the amounts of formed are sufficient to maintain the interstellar gas at 100 °K. The results obtained for CH, CH show that the mechanism considered does not lead to absurd results under the conditions assumed. The importance of at high densities is also discussed. Chapter II deals with a theory of star formation in a medium composed of randomly moving cloudlets or floccules. An outline is given of a recent paper by McCrea who shows that this idea leads to a satisfactory account of the formation of the solar system and removes the angular momentum difficulty of other star formation theories. The collisions of floccules are considered in detail and a theory of the gravitational capture of the fragments of collision is outlined.

40|$|Aims. We aim to {{investigate}} the nature of dissipative instability appearing in a prominence planar thread filled with partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> in the incompressible limit. The importance of partial ionisation is investigated {{in terms of the}} ionisation factor and the wavelength of sausage and kink waves propagating in the slab. Methods. In order to highlight the role of partial ionisation, we have constructed models describing various situations we can meet in solar prominence fine structure. Matching the solutions for the transversal component of the velocity and total pressure at the interfaces between the prominence slab and surrounding plasmas, we derived a dispersion relation whose imaginary part describes the evolution of the instability. Results were obtained in the limit of weak dissipation. We have investigated the appearance of instabilities in prominence dark plumes using single and two-fluid approximations. Results. Using simple analytical methods, we show that dissipative instabilities appear for flow speeds that are less than the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability threshold. The onset of instability is determined by the equilibrium flow strength, the ionisation factor of the plasma, the wavelength of waves and the ion-neutral collisional rate. For a given wavelength and for ionisation degrees closer to a neutral gas, the propagating waves become unstable for a narrow band of flow speeds, meaning that neutrals have a stabilising effect. Our results show that the partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> describing prominence dark plumes becomes unstable only in a two-fluid (charged particles-neutrals) model, that is for periods that are smaller than the ion-neutral collision time. Conclusions. The present study improves our understanding of the complexity of dynamical processes and stability of solar prominences and the role partial ionisation in destabilising the plasma.
