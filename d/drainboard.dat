50|$|Sinks, {{especially}} those made of stainless steel, can be fitted with an integrated <b>drainboard,</b> {{allowing for the}} draining of washed dishes.|$|E
50|$|It can {{be reached}} from the Sala Alessandrina. The monumental {{staircase}} gives access to the upper floor. On both sides are busts of famous physicians, among which Hippocrates and Giuseppe Maria Lancisi. On the right {{there is also an}} anatomical table with <b>drainboard</b> and grooves on its sides, on which the corpse of Goffredo Mameli was laid down; formerly it was housed in the death cell of Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini. On the landing there is a wooden 17th-century chest, decorated with lion heads and used to store healing herbs; formerly it was housed in the spicery of the hospital. On both sides of the entrance door to the Sala Flajani there are medallions portraying Pope Pius VI and Francesco Saverio de Zelada together with plaques commemorating the founders of the museum and the first president of the Academy.|$|E
50|$|The {{first time}} that a sink {{appeared}} in a drawing was in the Bokie (慕帰絵) written in the early Muromachi period. The kitchen of the Nanrou temple (南瀧院) had a large sunokoyuka (すのこ床) lit. <b>drainboard</b> floor, next to a stove with a water filled oke and hisyaku (syaku) for washing. This sunokoyuka was made with split bamboo and water would drain through gaps between the canes. Even though in many places a sunokoyuka was made over a river and washing was done, to make a part of the kitchen floor into sunokoyuka to use as a drain was an innovation. This did not pose a health problem as kitchen scraps were meticulously collected and used to make a compost. Few Japanese ate meat due to the Emperor's decree in the 8th century and animals and birds were slaughtered away from a house. Until late Edo period, this type of kitchen was widely used.|$|E
5000|$|Many predesigned, {{prefabricated}} units (including sinks, <b>drainboards,</b> and other accessories) {{are available in}} stainless steel. These may be used [...] "stand-alone" [...] or integrated into larger custom assemblies. Some stainless steel systems stand on integrated legs and do not require the support of cabinetry.|$|R
50|$|Concrete, {{especially}} precast, {{lends itself}} to {{a high degree of}} customization due to the phase-change nature of its creation, filling a specific form with a fluid material which hardens (through mineral hydration) to a durable cast stone. Color choices, edge styles, three-dimensional sculpting, and integral features such as sinks, <b>drainboards,</b> and decorative embedments are design options which may be incorporated. Due to its site-specific and generally handmade nature, concrete countertops are often produced by small shops and individual artisans although there are several large-scale manufacturers of gauged slabs.|$|R
40|$|Pollution {{prevention}} {{has emerged}} as an effective tool for companies to attain compliance with environmental requirements. As stated in the previous chapter, using pollution prevention as the primary technique for attaining compliance also can reduce operating costs and increase profits. Metal finishing firms have achieved widespread success in reducing pollution using everything from improved housekeeping to advanced technologies. The primary goal of this manual is to describe the major pollution prevention techniques used in the metal finishing industry. Some of the technologies involve simple installations, for example, retrofitting pipes or <b>drainboards.</b> These methods are cost effective and can be implemented in house without outside consultation. Other methods such as metal removal from liquids and total recycling in a closed-loop system require large capital expenditures. Although EPA and the states do not mandate recycling or zero discharge, urging companies to plan new equipment purchases with these goals in mind should prove cost effective {{in the long run}} and help companies sustain environmental compliance and profitability. This manual does not attempt to make blanket judgments as to the economic feasibility of the pollution prevention options that are presented. The conditions in each facility vary, and the characteristics and quantities of the platables are diverse. However, loss of raw materials in metal finishing can affect at least five distinct cost categories. Facilities should consider the following in any financial evaluation of pollution prevention options: • Replacement of raw materials • Removal of the materials from the waste water before discharge (i. e., pretreatment...|$|R
