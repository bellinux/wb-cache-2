Michael Straczynski was {{a writer for the}} 1985 cartoon series She-Ra Princess of Power. After a Babylon 5 fan recalled a possible spoo reference from that show, Straczynski replied, [...] "Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> some spoo in there once. A couple of real cute (as in wanna drop a truck on them cute) elf-types offer Skeletor a bowl of Spoo." [...] In a 1995 interview, Straczynski referred to that scene as his favorite of the show.|$|E

By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. I thought I had been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E

40|$|The slip systems {{along the}} h 111 i {{direction}} in bcc iron are {{investigated by the}} energy of the generalized stacking fault, or of the stacking fault between two adjacent crystallographic planes of perfect crystals, in order to obtain the knowledge of the slip phenomena in bcc single crystals. For systematic study, the 15 kinds of slip systems along the h 111 i direction from f 110 gh 111 i up to f 954 gh 111 i, f 972 gh 111 i and f 981 gh 111 <b>i</b> <b>slip</b> systems are taken into account. The energy of the stacking fault is evaluated by the molecular mechanics method with the embedded atom potential of Finnis-Sinclair type as a function of relative displacement of one side of the two half-crystals across the fault plane in the h 111 i direction. The maximum values of the fault energies for the slip systems whose slip planes have angles of less than approximately 15 degrees to the { 110 } plane are nearly same as that for the most preferable f 110 gh 111 <b>i</b> <b>slip</b> system. The maximum value for the f 321 gh 111 <b>i</b> <b>slip</b> system is the greatest among the currently analyzed 15 slip systems. The maximum value for the f 211 gh 111 <b>i</b> <b>slip</b> system {{is in the middle of}} those for the f 110 gh 111 i and f 321 gh 111 <b>i</b> <b>slip</b> systems, and those for the slip systems whose slip planes have angles between approximately 20 degrees and 30 degrees to the { 110 } plane are close to that for the f 211 gh 111 <b>i</b> <b>slip</b> system. In general, there is not inverse correlation between the maximum value of the fault energies for the slip system and the interplanar spacing of the considered slip system, although there is inverse correlation between them within the three slip systems which have three lowest index planes, namely, the f 110 gh 111 i, f 211 gh 111 i and f 321 gh 111 <b>i</b> <b>slip</b> systems.

2500|$|With {{five minutes}} {{left in the}} Test, a {{defensive}} lapse from Campese led to an Irish try which gave them an 18-15 lead. In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese writes that, [...] "...Ireland suddenly set the whole of Dublin roaring as Gordon Hamilton, their flanker, stormed away for a try. I was partly my fault; <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> and failed to kill the loose ball one of their players had kicked through.

2500|$|Hampshire won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. There were 1,200 at the Rose Bowl to watch Simon Katich {{flawless}} 72 not out, {{as he was}} the only one able to cope with the conditions as Hampshire were all out for 197 before tea. Katich's innings was one of defence coupled with the odd drive, hook and pull. Hampshire's meagre total suggests they miss Kevin Pietersen, who performed so well for England in the one-dayers against Zimbabwe and South Africa over the winter. Pietersen said of his foot injury, [...] "If I got a ball on my foot or <b>I</b> <b>slipped</b> I could be out for six to eight weeks. It's a bit tender and it's just a case of biding my time", he said. However, they did have to face good, fast-medium-pace bowling from Gloucestershire. Gloucestershire fared well in reply, and Shane Warne brought himself into the attack after only 18 overs. He took Craig Spearman's wicket when Spearman tried to sweep him, but Gloucestershire were sitting pretty at close on 118 for 2, 79 behind with 8 first innings wickets remaining.|$|E
