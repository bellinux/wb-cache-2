40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} pilot study {{evaluating}} the effec-tiveness of a tactile metronome for music performance and training. Four guitar players were asked to synchronize to a metronome click-track delivered either aurally or via a vibrotactile stimulus. We recorded their performance at different tempi (60 and 120 BPM) and compared the re-sults across modalities. Our results indicate that a tactile metronome can reliably cue participants to follow the tar-get tempo. Such a device could hence be used in musical practice and performances as a reliable alternative to tradi-tional auditory click-tracks, generally considered annoying and <b>distracting</b> <b>by</b> performers. 1...|$|R

5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were <b>distracted</b> <b>by</b> a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E

5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily <b>distracted</b> <b>by</b> smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
