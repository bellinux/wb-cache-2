40|$|The EU is {{considering}} offering Pakistan a <b>Generalised</b> <b>Scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>Preferences</b> (GSP+) in trade {{which could have}} huge implications for the economic well-being of Pakistan. However this deal is tied to a package of human rights, labour rights, good governance and environment commitments. In the past Pakistan has signed up to such commitments but has failed to implement them (most starkly perhaps in relation to women’s rights and minority rights). This paper argues that the EU should seek to use the leverage of the GSP+ deal to ensure Pakistani compliance with, and implementation of, its obligations and {{should be willing to}} withdraw the deal if it does not. It cautions that the EU should not countenance a "carte blanche" in which Pakistan’s ruling elite reaps the rewards of EU trade liberalisation without any corresponding commitment – beyond lip service - to improve rights, governance, and environmental protection...|$|E

Twenty years on, the present paper considers the extent to which autonomous sanctions are designed to affect those individuals and elites responsible for the behaviour the EU aims to condemn. How faithful has the EU remained to this concept in its sanctions policy? The enquiry scrutinizes diverse practices in three established sanctions strands of the EU, development aid suspensions, Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) sanctions and <b>Generalised</b> <b>Scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>Preferences</b> (GSP) withdrawals. It shows that it has been more faithfully implemented in some strands of EU sanctions than in others.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the present strategy for international development as presented in various international documents such as the Pearson Commission Report and the UN Report on the Second Development Decade, from the perspective of African countries. The basic thesis of the paper is that the existing strategy on international development, with its targets and policies in the fields of trade and aid, is biased in favour of the relatively advanced developing countries and unless special measures are taken, would have the effect of deepening inequalities among the countries of the Third World. The paper proceeds by considering the rationale for special measures in favour of the least developed countries, most of which are to b found in Africa. It then analyzes the economic stratification developing within the Third World. The main elements of the international strategy for development are outlined; international commodities <b>schemes,</b> <b>generalised</b> system <b>of</b> <b>preferences,</b> and export credits in the field of trade; and development assistance targets, role of multilateral institutions, criteria for aid-givin, and growing emphasis on programme aid in the field of aid. It is then shown that unless special provisions are made, the effect of the implementation of these recommendations will be to favour the more advanced of the developing countries, often at the expense of the least developed countries. The reasons for the failure to devise and implement special measures in favour of the least developed countries are analyzed. The paper concludes by making a number of recommendations designed to ensure that the interests of the most disadvantaged part of the Third World are effectively incorporated in the measures taken for global development...|$|R

40|$|Since {{at least}} the 1960 s, the European Union (EU) has offered various kinds of non-reciprocal trade {{preferences}} for developing countries. Originally, these trade preferences had at least two policy goals: (i) to increase export volumes for developing countries and thereby boost their export earnings, and (ii) to facilitate export diversification. While extensive research has confirmed that {{the first of these}} goals is typically met, the second goal seems to have been largely forgotten by researchers as well as in policy circles. The aim of this paper is therefore to analyse the impact of the EU’s non-reciprocal trade preferences for developing countries on export diversification.

These concepts will be further elaborated in a forthcoming study of incubators in West Sweden. When incubators are described and conceptualised as a model to promote new initiatives of business production, the outcome is usually a linear process with focus on how to coordinate actions in time.

40|$|Raglan Harbour is a drowned {{river valley}} system {{lying in a}} {{structurally}} depressed fault block. Much of {{the upper reaches of}} the harbour consist of tidal flats formed by sediment veneered shore platforms, and dissected by relatively deep channels. Estuarine conditions occur in the tidal reaches of major streams entering the harbour. Sediment textures reflect a gradual decrease in energy conditions passing, up the harbour from clean, well-sorted sands near the harbour entrance to mainly muddy sands and sandy muds that characterise the tidal flats. Tidal currents result in highly variable energy conditions. Modes of sediment transport and deposition and a <b>generalised</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> current patterns and relative current strengths throughout the harbour are interpreted from textural analyses. The coastal iron-sands are the principle source heavy minerals in sediments throughout Raglan Harbour. Bulk sediment mineralogies and clay mineralogies indicate detrital inheritance from hinterland rocks as the main source of terrigenous sediment supplied to the harbour as fluvial sediment load and by shoreline erosion. Benthonic organisms supply most of the carbonate and organic matter in the sediments, as well as causing considerable sediment reworking. Phosphatic concretions found in certain areas of the harbour appear to be of Recent to Sub-recent diagenetic origin. Much of the present aerial extent of Raglan Harbour is probably the result of shore platform development within the harbour during the last 8 - 10, 000 years.

Three separate essays are written. All are ex post analyses. The first describes {{the effects of}} the U. S. GSP according to (a variant of) the shift-share approach. An attempt is made to measure the growth in U. S. imports from the beneficiaries between two points in time. Quantifiable causes of this growth are subtracted from the overall growth. The residual then is attributed to the GSP effect. ^ The second essay explains changes in market shares of individual beneficiaries of the U. S. preference scheme. A cross-section statistical analysis is used to explain changes in market shares. The effect of a change (increase) in tariff caused by U. S. competitive need exclusion (CNE) on beneficiaries 2 ̆ 7 market shares is especially considered. Other factors which influence the beneficiaries 2 ̆ 7 market shares are also considered. The latter variables may provide a basis for the 2 ̆ 2 graduation 2 ̆ 2 of LDCs from the scheme. Finally, the third essay makes a gravity model estimate of {{the effects of the}} U.

Here we show that substrate specificity of the HPV E 6 PDZ binding is modulated both by the amino acid residues upstream of the binding domain and by the non-canonical residues within it.

The auroral forms comprise rays near noon, homogeneous arcs during the evening, and rayed arcs and bands during the night and in the morning. This fixed auroral pattern is unsettled during disturbances, which occur sometimes even during very quiet intervals. The azimuths of extended auroral forms vary with local time. Such variations in the orientation of extended forms above stations in the auroral zone have been used by various investigators to determine the position of the auroral oval (Fig. 9). Auroral luminosity of the daytime and nighttime sectors differ owing to different luminosity forms, directions of motion of the discrete forms, the height of the luminescent layers, and the spectral composition (predominant red emissions during daytime and green emissions during the night). Schemes that summarise principal peculiarities of daytime luminosity, its structure in MLT (magnetic local time) and MLat (magnetic latitude) coordinates, and the spectral composition of the luminosity {{are presented in}} Figs. 15 and 19. We discuss in detail the daytime sector dynamics of individual discrete forms for both quiet conditions and auroral substorms. The most important auroral changes during substorms occur in the nighttime sector. We present the evolution of conceptions about the succession of discrete auroral forms and their dynamics during disturbance intervals. This ranges from Birkeland's polar elementary storms, over the prospect of a fixed auroral pattern up to the auroral substorm model. The classic <b>schemes</b> <b>of</b> the spatial distribution and motion of discrete auroral forms during single substorms are shown in Fig. 20 (expansive and recovery phases) and Fig. 21 (creation, expansive and recovery phases). In this review we discuss various models of bulge formation, in particular as a result of new formation of arcs about 50 – 100 km poleward of previously existing auroral structures (Fig. 24). Discrete steps in the development of an expanding bulge are separated by 1 – 3 min from each other. The model of successive activations confines only to a ~ 40 ° longitudinal portion of the magnetotail (Fig. 28). We consider differences in the development of single substorms and substorms during magnetic storms. The structure and dynamics of auroras during steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) periods are dealt with in Sect. 8. A <b>generalised</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> the auroral distribution during SMC periods is shown in Fig. 34. Separate sections describe discrete auroras in the polar cap (Sect. 5), and the diffuse luminosity equatorward of the auroral oval (Sect. 9). Visual observations of diffuse auroral forms at midlatitudes suggest that the whole latitudinal interval between the auroral oval and the stable auroral red (SAR) arc is filled up with diffuse luminosity. SAR arcs with intensities of several tens of Rayleigh enclose systematically the region of diffuse luminosity; they are positioned at the border of the plasmasphere...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} explore a <b>generalised</b> <b>scheme</b> for the {{synchronous}} code {{division multiple access}} (CDMA). In this scheme, unlike the standard CDMA systems, each user has different codewords for communicating different messages. Two main problems are investigated. The first problem concerns whether uniquely detectable overloaded matrices (an injective matrix, i. e. the inputs and outputs are in one-to-one correspondence depending on the input alphabets) exist in the absence of additive noise, and if so, whether there are any practical optimum detectors for such input codewords. The second problem is about finding tight bounds for the sum channel capacity. In response to the first problem, the authors have constructed uniquely detectable matrices for the <b>generalised</b> <b>scheme</b> and the authors have developed practical maximum likelihood detection algorithms for such codes. In response to the second problem, lower bounds and conjectured upper bounds are derived. The results of this study are superior to other standard overloaded CDMA codes since the generalisation can support more users than the previous schemes...|$|R
