The weapon jammed and security overpowered Tri before {{he was able to}} fire another shot. Diệm was unmoved by the incident. The assassination was the response of the desperation of the communists to Diệm's relentless anti-communist policies.|$|E
25|$|This {{implies that}} the number of {{singular}} points is finite as long as p(x,y) or P(x,y,z) is square free. Bézout's theorem implies thus {{that the number of}} singular points is at most (d−1)2, but this bound is not sharp because the system of equations is overdetermined. If reducible polynomials are allowed, the sharp bound is d(d−1)/2, this value being reached when the polynomial factors in linear factors, that is if the curve is the union of d lines. For irreducible curves and polynomials, the number of singular points is at most (d−1)(d−2)/2, because of the formula expressing the genus <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> the singularities (see below). The maximum is reached by the curves of genus zero whose all singularities have multiplicity two and distinct tangents (see below).|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} fact of early and mid-Qing social history was population growth. The population doubled during the 18th century. People {{in this period}} were also remarkably on the move. There is evidence suggesting that the empire's rapidly expanding population was geographically mobile on a scale, which, <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> its volume and its protracted and routinized nature, was unprecedented in Chinese history. Indeed, the Qing government did far more to encourage mobility than to discourage it. Migration took several different forms, though might be divided in two varieties: permanent migration for resettlement, and relocation conceived by the party (in theory at least) as a temporary sojourn. Parties to the latter would include the empire's increasingly large and mobile manual workforce, {{as well as its}} densely overlapping internal diaspora of local-origin-based merchant groups. It would also included the patterned movement of Qing subjects overseas, largely to Southeastern Asia, in search of trade and other economic opportunities.|$|E
25|$|The average {{precipitation}} in Bulgaria is about 670mm. It is uneven {{in terms of}} seasons and territory. In northern Bulgaria the highest precipitation is in May–June, while in southern Bulgaria it is in winter. The average amount of precipitation also varies <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> altitude— from 450–850mm in the plains to 850–1200mm. The lowest mean precipitation is {{in the eastern part}} of Dobrudzha and the Burgas Plain (450mm) and in the area between Plovdiv and Pazardzhik (500mm); the highest rainfall falls in the mountains— the Petrohan Pass in the western Balkan Mountains and Zlatograd in the Rhodope Mountains. The highest annual rainfall was measured in 1957 in the upper valley of the river Ogosta in the western Balkan Mountains (2293mm); the highest daily rainfall was recorded at Saints Constantine and Helena resort (342mm) near Varna in 1951. The total annual amount of the rainfall is 74 billion km3; of them 70% evaporate, 20% flow into the rivers and 10% soak into the soil. Most of the country is affected by droughts in June and August. The snow cover lasts from 20–30 days in the lowlands to 9 months in the highest mountains.|$|E
