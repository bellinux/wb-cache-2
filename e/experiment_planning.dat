A full analysis of the <b>experiment</b> <b>plan</b> was compiled {{on the basis of the}} obtained results.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} an {{agent-based}} decision-supporting system for Taguchi <b>experiment</b> <b>planning.</b> Among {{the four major}} parts of Taguchi experiment, the planning phase includes the most important decision-making issues such as determination of experi-ment objectives, quality characteristics, and control factors. The planning phase, however, has not been paid proper attention by experi-ment designers. We have developed ADTEP (Agent-based Decision-supporting system for Taguchi <b>Experiment</b> <b>Planning)</b> to facilitate the planning tasks of experiment designer. ADTEP is composed of two agent-based mechanisms. The first employs an Internet agent that collects the domain knowledge from knowledge providers who may be distributed in remote places. Another agent then visualizes the collected knowledge and reports it to the experiment designer. Engineers who would normally have difficulties in collaborating because of limitations on their time or {{because they are in}} different places can easily work together in the same experiment team and brainstorm to make good decisions. The second agent-based mechanism offers context-sensitive advice generated by another intelligent agent dur-ing the <b>experiment</b> <b>planning</b> process. It prevents the experiment designer from making mistakes, which will increase the feasibility of the experiment and minimize the unnecessary expense of time and resources. Key Words: Taguchi method; intelligent agent; decision-supporting system; context-sensitive help system. _ 1...|$|E
