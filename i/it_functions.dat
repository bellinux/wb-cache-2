5|$|Virginia Beach was {{chartered}} as {{a municipal}} corporation by the General Assembly of Virginia on January 1, 1963. The city currently operates under the council–manager form of government. The city does not {{fall under the}} jurisdiction of a county government, due to state law. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>functions</b> as an independent city and operates as a political subdivision of the state.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} sense and respond {{effectively}} to fluctuations {{in an environment}} is the fundamental problem addressed by cybernetics. When applied to {{the context of the}} organizational <b>IT</b> <b>function,</b> agility denotes the capacity of the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> to perceive "signals" from its internal and external environments, to interpret these, and respond appropriately. The processing of such signals requires the selection and filtering of information to drive decision-making for response in a timely way. The challenge for the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> is processing an overwhelming collection of signals, in un-standardized formats, and from overlapping sources, that tends to overload decision-makers. Informed by a cybernetic model, we studied how the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> enables agility. We found evidence (1) that the more mature the policy processes of the <b>IT</b> <b>function,</b> the more the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> will create agility in information systems; (2) The more mature the intelligence processes of the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> to look outside the organization, the more the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> will create agility in information systems and; (3) The more mature the control processes of the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> that focus on the current use of information systems, the more the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> will create agility in information systems. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{transformation}} is challenging the traditional {{expectations of the}} <b>IT</b> <b>function,</b> as organizations demand a more agile <b>IT</b> <b>function,</b> capable of exploring innovative uses of IT in a digital business context. Using qualitative executive interview data, this paper explores the bimodal approach organizations can use to create an <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> that effectively supports and drives the organization’s digital agenda. The study finds that for many organizations, a bimodal IT design, of which we found three distinct archetypes to exist, serves as a transitional stage {{in the pursuit of}} embedding a higher level of agility and a stronger exploration focus in the <b>IT</b> <b>function,</b> which ultimately operates unimodal. This study’s investigation into bimodal IT has significant implications for how the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> transforms in the digital business era and is of relevance to practitioners as digital transformation affects organizational structure, culture, and methods of working...|$|R

5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. <b>It</b> <b>functions</b> as a Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis {{and is not}} basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an imagined reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist in the mind allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden image has other uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and <b>it</b> <b>functions</b> {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E
5|$|Seed {{release in}} B.prionotes is {{promoted}} by repeated wetting of the cones. The seed separator {{that holds the}} seeds in place is hygroscopic; its two wings pull together then wet, then spread and curl inwards as it dries out again. In doing so, <b>it</b> <b>functions</b> as a lever, gradually prying seeds out of a follicle {{over the course of}} a wet-dry cycle. This adaptation ensures that seed release following fire is delayed until the onset of rain, when germination and seedling survival rates are higher.|$|E
40|$|Due to ICT’s {{ubiquitous}} nature, the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> holds a strategically {{important role}} in many organizations today. The <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> not only supports day - to - day operations and business continuity, but due to technology’s evolution from role s of automate to informate to transformate, the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> also plays {{an important part in}} how ICT can enable and facilitate radical organizational change. Therefore, the people assets of the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> are a key resource that needs to be effectively managed. The principles of Talent Management, which recognizes the differential impact of employees in delivering value to the organization, are examined in thi s white paper. Key talent sources for the <b>IT</b> <b>function</b> need to be identified and recruited; rewarded in line with their performance contributions; developed through appropriate training programmes/schemes, and retained. One approach to determining the effec tiveness of organizations in managing the IT function’s ‘A performers’ is to determine the current maturity of their P eople A sset M anagement (PAM) capabilities. The PAM Critical Capability of IT - CMF is proposed as a useful maturity assessment tool to enabl e organizations to establish roadmaps or action plans to improve the current maturity of strategic workforce management and employment life cycle activities of the <b>IT</b> <b>function.</b> Such increased maturity would improve practices surrounding the identification and management of key talent sources...|$|R

The city hosts a biannual international theatre festival, International Living Theatre (ILT), the next event being scheduled for 2017. The former goods station of Aarhus Godsbanegård has recently been thoroughly renovated, redeveloped and expanded with a new building. Now known as Godsbanen, <b>it</b> <b>functions</b> as a cultural centre, and offers numerous workshops for the artist community and local citizens.|$|E
5|$|Perennial and {{seasonal}} streams often {{are lined with}} live oak and sycamore, which transition into the riparian zones of the main stem Santa Ana River. The inland riparian marshes upstream of the Riverside/Orange County line, although degraded by pollution, have otherwise been mostly left in their natural state. Although much of the riparian system along the river has been degraded, {{one of the largest}} places where it occurs is the enormous marsh behind Prado Dam, an area closed to development because <b>it</b> <b>functions</b> as a flood control basin, similar to the Sepulveda Dam. The Santa Ana sucker, a small bottom-dwelling fish, once was found throughout riparian zones, but now is rarely seen in the Santa Ana River drainage. Near the mouth, the river was once abundant in salt marshes, which stretched for miles {{on either side of the}} river, even near Upper Newport Bay, which has also served as an alternate mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where <b>it</b> <b>functions</b> as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E

5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where <b>it</b> <b>functions</b> to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo Tower's {{two main}} revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism. <b>It</b> <b>functions</b> as a radio and {{television}} broadcasting antenna support structure and is a tourist destination that houses several different attractions. Over 150million people have visited the tower in total since its opening in late 1958. Tower attendance had been steadily declining until it bottomed out at 2.3million in 2000. Since then, attendance has been rising, and it has recently been attracting approximately 3million visitors per year. The first area tourists must visit upon reaching the tower is FootTown, a four-story building stationed directly under the tower. Here, visitors can eat, shop and visit several museums and galleries. Elevators that depart from {{the first floor of}} FootTown can be used to reach the first of two observation decks, the two-story Main Observatory. For the price of another ticket, visitors can board another set of elevators from {{the second floor of the}} Main Observatory to reach the final observation deckthe Special Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, <b>it</b> <b>functions</b> as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
