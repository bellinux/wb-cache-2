500|$|The fifth chorale, {{movement}} 15, opens Part II and {{the third}} scene. [...] "" [...] (Christ, who <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> blessed), stanza 1 of Michael Weiße's 1531 hymn, summarizes what Jesus has to endure, {{even though he is}} innocent ("made captive,... falsely indicted, and mocked and scorned and bespat").|$|E
500|$|As a first link to {{the first}} movements, [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>us,</b> and not we ourselves, his people" [...] is {{repeated}} with the music used for [...] "", connecting both the musical form {{and the content of}} being created God's people and serving him with gladness. The movement closes by a reprise of the first topic, this time ending pp. Kirshnit described the movement as [...] "mysteriously, almost spectrally" [...] music.|$|E

500|$|The second {{movement}} {{begins with}} a soft instrumental introduction of thirteen measures. Horns and trombones play the same note three times in unison, which is later sung with the word [...] "" [...] ("Realize" [...] or Recognize")“. The rhythm dominates the introduction. The choir picks up, singing it first on a unison C, marked ppp. After several repetitions, the phrase is continued in measure 26: [...] "" [...] (that the Lord is God) with a rapid crescendo from Lord to God. The Swiss musicologist Michael Eidenbenz, writing for the , describes the section as mystical and reflective (""). In a middle section the divided voices express, mostly in homophony, gradually more intense: [...] "" [...] (He <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>us,</b> and not we ourselves, his people). The continuation [...] "" [...] (and the sheep of his pasture) is presented expessively by the lower voices, then repeated by pure triads in A major and B major, first by three soprano parts, then three alto parts, finally three male voices, with a solo violin.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{advances}} in modern {{technology and the}} demands of industry, woodwork as a field has changed. The development of Computer Numeric Controlled (CNC) Machines, for example, <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> able to mass-produce and reproduce products faster, with less waste, and often more complex in design than ever before. CNC Routers can carve complicated and highly detailed shapes into flat stock, to create signs or art. [...] Rechargeable power tools speed up creation of many projects and require much less body strength than in the past, for example when boring multiple holes. Skilled fine woodworking, however, remains a craft pursued by many. There remains demand for hand crafted work such as furniture and arts, however with rate and cost of production, the cost for consumers is much higher.|$|E

2500|$|The {{night before}} the balloting Stevenson began working {{actively}} for the nomination, calling the leaders of several state delegations to ask for their support. The key call went to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, {{the leader of the}} Illinois delegation. The delegation had already voted to give Kennedy 59.5 votes to Stevenson's 2, but Stevenson told Daley that he now wanted the Democratic nomination, and asked him if the [...] "delegates' vote might merely indicate they thought he was not a candidate." [...] Daley told Stevenson that he had no support in the delegation. Stevenson then [...] "asked if this meant no support in fact or no support because the delegates thought he was not a candidate. Daley replied that Stevenson had no support." [...] According to Stevenson biographer John Bartlow Martin, the phone conversation with Daley [...] "was the real end of the [...] Stevenson candidacy...if he could not get the support of his home state his candidacy was doomed." [...] However, Stevenson continued to work for the nomination the next day, fulfilling what he felt were obligations to old friends and supporters such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Agnes Meyer. Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota delivered an impassioned nominating speech for Stevenson, urging the convention to not [...] "reject the man who <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> proud to be Democrats. Do not leave this prophet without honor in his own party." [...] However, Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot with 806 delegate votes; Stevenson finished in fourth place with 79.5 votes.|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking. He's always been famous for his version of the 4–3–3 with the wide wingers, all technically highly gifted and fast. This is his mark." ...|$|E
