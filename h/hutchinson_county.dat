25|$|The Battle of Adobe Walls {{occurred}} on November 25, 1864, {{in the vicinity}} of Adobe Walls, the ruins of William Bent's abandoned adobe trading post and saloon, located on the northern side of the Canadian River 17 miles (27nbsp&km) northeast of present-day Stinnett in <b>Hutchinson</b> <b>County.</b> The battle came about when Gen. James H. Carleton, commander of the military district of New Mexico, decided to punish severely the plains tribes of the Kiowa and Comanche, whom he deemed responsible for attacks on wagon trains on the Santa Fe Trail. The Indians saw the wagon trains as trespassers who killed buffalo and other game the Indians needed to survive. As the American Civil War drained available troops, attacks on the Great Plains worsened, leading in the later part of 1863 to cries from settlers for protection.|$|E

40|$|We ran {{groundwater}} availability {{models for}} {{the northern and southern}} segments of the Ogallala Aquifer in order to produce a baseline volume of groundwater in each grid cell in the models. We extracted average annual recharge for each grid cell from the models. First we calculated the total volume of groundwater in each grid cell using an assumed porosity value. We then calculated the pumping rate for each cell that would result in the retention of 50 percent of the initial volume of groundwater after fifty years with average annual recharge. We used these results to generate a new well file for both models in Groundwater Management Area 1. Pumping rates varied according to aquifer thickness. After the model runs, we generated saturated thickness maps for each decade from 2000 through 2050. By 2050, some areas of northern Dallam, a small area in western Sherman, south central Moore, south central Hansford, and north central <b>Hutchinson</b> <b>counties</b> became inactive. Based on this model run, it is possible to achieve a fifty percent reduction of the saturated thickness in fifty years without widespread areas of the aquifer becoming inactive. REQUESTOR...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater Management Area 1 {{requested}} a groundwater availability model run {{to determine if}} retaining three different volumes of groundwater after 50 fifty years of pumping in the Ogallala Aquifer in three predetermined geographical subdivisions in Groundwater Management Area 1 (Figure 1) was feasible. They requested 40 percent retention of the starting point volume after fifty years in subdivision 1, 80 percent retention in subdivision 2, and 50 percent retention in subdivision 3. We ran the northern segment of the Ogallala Aquifer groundwater availability model in order to evaluate the three different proposed desired future conditions for the Ogallala Aquifer within Groundwater Management Area 1. The southern segment of the Ogallala Aquifer was run for Potter, Randall, and Armstrong counties and reported in the supplement to GAM run 08 - 16 (Smith, 2008 b). These numbers have not changed. We applied annual pumping based on individual cell volumes for each grid cell. After calculating the total volume in each grid cell and adding the recharge, we calculated the pumping rate for each cell {{that would result in}} the retention of the desired percent of the volume at the end of fifty years as specified in the request. The results were used to generate a new well file for the model of the northern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer in Groundwater Management Area 1. Pumping rates varied according to aquifer thickness. By 2060, large parts of Dallam, Hartley, and Moore counties and smaller part Sherman County become “dry”. Carson, Gray, and <b>Hutchinson</b> <b>counties</b> also include dry cells by this time.

In January 1943 the station became known at the Naval Air Station Hutchinson. Training continued until October 1946. The station, used for civilian activities not related to aviation, fell into disrepair. From 1952 to 1958 the Naval Air Station was reactivated. From 1951 to 1968 a radar squadron was on the site, designated as the Hutchinson Air Force Station. After that the radar facilities were taken over by the Federal Aviation Administration. Other parts of the old Naval air station were put to other uses and a part is the privately owned Sunflower Aerodrome Gliderport.|$|R
