The diameter of these <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> ranges from 1. 0 m to 1. 8 m and from 28 m to 60 m in depth. They typically penetrate through and found in weathered rocks and soils. Generally, the design for side shear of large diameter <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> in weathered rocks and soils involve considerable uncertainty and design parameters must usually be verified by field tests. In this paper, 27 full-scale load tests on large diameter <b>drilled</b> <b>shaft</b> including 14 <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> founded in soils and 13 <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> socketed in weathered rocks are reviewed and studied in detail.

To achieve {{part of this}} goal, a database for <b>Drilled</b> <b>Shaft</b> Foundation Testing (DSHAFT) was developed and reported on by Garder, Ng, Sritharan, and Roling in 2012. DSHAFT is aimed at assimilating high-quality <b>drilled</b> <b>shaft</b> test data from Iowa and the surrounding regions. DSHAFT is currently housed on a project website ([URL] and contains data for 41 <b>drilled</b> <b>shaft</b> tests. The objective {{of this research was}} to utilize the DSHAFT database and develop a regional LRFD procedure for <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> in Iowa with preliminary resistance factors using a probability-based reliability theory. This was done by examining current design and construction practices used by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) as well as recommendations given in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and the FHWA <b>drilled</b> <b>shaft</b> guidelines.

This research aims to mediate the bump {{at the end of}} the bridge and to validate the use of post grouting to increase <b>drilled</b> <b>shaft</b> capacity. Performance monitoring and full scale test programs were used to evaluate these technical issues. The bump {{at the end of the}} bridge is typically due to settlement of the approach soils and cracking of the approach pavements. The settlement and cracking in integral abutment bridges are typically dealt with by connecting the approach slab to the integral abutment bridge. Two integral abutment bridges with integrally connected precast approach slabs were evaluated using long-term monitoring systems to study their structural performance and determine the range of forces that should be considered when designing such approach slabs. This study has identified design and construction considerations for integrally connected precast approach slabs. The approach slab study revealed the source and magnitude of forces to be considered in the design and construction of approach slabs integrally connected to integral abutment bridges. Consideration of these forces in the design and construction of such approach slabs could potentially lead to reduced maintenance costs associated with the bump at the end of the bridge. The required deep embedment length of <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> is due to the inability to fully mobilize the end bearing resistance of the shaft before reaching service displacement criteria. Post grouting of <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> can be used to effectively increase the end bearing capacity within service displacement limits, often times allowing the <b>drilled</b> <b>shaft</b> to be shortened without sacrificing capacity. Through a load test program and long-term performance monitoring of production shafts, the increase in capacity and performance of post grouted <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> were investigated. This study has identified design and construction considerations for post grouted <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts.</b> The post grouted <b>drilled</b> <b>shaft</b> study verified the use of post grouting as a technique for increasing the end bearing resistance of <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> and also identified design and construction considerations for post grouted <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts.</b> Increasing the end bearing resistance of <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> through the use of post grouting can effectively allow the shafts to be shortened without losing capacity or exceeding service displacement criteria; potentially leading to reduced costs for bridge projects...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Kastamonu İli, Küre bakır işletmesinde, üretimi tamamlanmış olan Bakibaba açık ocağında cevher arama sondajları yapılmıştır. Yeraltında 700 m kotundan başlayıp 270 m kotuna kadar ekonomik olarak işletilebilir yeni bir cevher varlığı tespit edilmiştir. Bu cevherin işletilebilmesi için uygun bir alana derin nakliye kuyusu açılması ön görülmüştür. Açılan kuyuda işletme katları olan 700 - 600 - 500 - 470 - 400 - 300 ve 270 metrelerine şafttan açılacak galeriler ile maden işletilecektir. Bu amaçlar doğrultusunda şaft açılması için üç farklı bölge belirlenmiştir. Bu bölgelerde Şaft ve civarının jeolojik, jeomekanik özelliklerinin belirlenmesi için sondajlar yapılmış ve cevhere yakınlık, yerleşim alanına olan mesafe, topoğrafik uygunluk gibi çeşitli parametrelere göre şaft yeri belirlenmiştir. Çalışma alanında Küre formasyonu, bazaltik kayaçlar ve siyah şeyl yeralmaktadır. Şaftın açılacağı alandaki bazaltik kayaçlar liyas yaşlıdır. Bu çalışmada açılacak şaftın ve dolayısının yerleşim modelini oluşturmak için yapılan sondajlardan mühendislik jeolojisi parametreleri elde edilmiştir. Uygulamalara sondajlardan alınan karot örnekleri üzerinde fiziksel ve mekanik özellik deneyleri yapılarak başlanmıştır. Deneylerin sonuçlarına göre İTÜ-MJKM Vardar sınıflaması, Hoek-Brown sınıflaması, RMR sınıflaması, ve Q sınıflaması yapılmıştır. Elde edilen verilerden yararlanılarak seçilen şaft alanında, şaft merkezinde yapılan 953 metrelik sondajın logu hazırlanmış, şaftın doğusunda ve batısında kalan şevlerin Rocscience Slide programı ile stabilite analizleri yapılarak güvenlik katsayısı (GS) hesaplanmış ve sonlu elemanlar yöntemi kullanan Phase 2 kullanılarak şaft açılması sırasında oluşabilecek düşey, yatay ve toplam deplasmanların analizleri yapılmıştır. Buna göre şaft açılırken oluşacak toplam deplasmanlar 20 ile 70 cm arasında değişmektetir. 164 - 213, 256 - 764 ve 614 - 764 metreleri arasında ezik zonlar bulunmaktadır. A copper ore {{has found}} between depths of 270 and 700 m. As {{a result of}} {{presence}} in Bakibaba open mine by Etibakır Inc. This mass of ore have found economic for exploitation and studies have started to reach this ore. Trough this effort, at west of Bakibaba open pit have been foreseen to <b>drill</b> <b>shaft</b> and reach ore mine by this shaft. Küre copper mine area have been an important place since ancient times for mining operations. In particular around the Bakibaba mine area the presence of over 2 million tons slag, and old gallery of old supports proofs old mine operations. Mine area was purchased in 2004 by Cengiz Holding. Between 2005 - 2009, 2, 527, 173 tons of ore produced open pit mine production activity in the Bakibaba open pit and production has been completed. A new ore have been identified with the drillings in Kastamonu, Küre, Bakibaba mine area. Some parts of mineral reserve loceted under Bakibaba open pit region and copper reserves {{is located in the}} region between of 270 m to 700 m level. Geological units in the study area are Liassic Küre Formation basalts and black shale. Copper mineralization in Küre mine area takes place in Küre formation of basaltic rocks. As the ore are massive and disseminated in basalts. Mineralization in the region as a result of intense hydrothermally altered basalts. For remove the new copper mine decided to build deep shaft on east of the Bakibaba open pit. In addition to this lowest elevation in the study area is 1000 m and the highest elevation of 1260 m. 700 m, 600 m, 500 m, 470 m, 300 m and 270 m elevations were determined as a layer of underground mining By Etibakır Inc. Construction elements that make up the operation of the underground mining of ore rock to put the relationship under appropriate conditions, the ore position, shape, size, hydrogeological data, mineralogical properties of rocks, faults, discontinuities, underground cavities, such as the many geological data utilized to determine the regions where it crushed zones. For these purposes, geological and geomechanical parameters of shaft area have to defined. 23 drilings which have 30 m. depth and a bore hole wihch is 953 m depth are made to get information about the area litholoy and geomechanical parameters. Stıdy area contains Küre formation, basaltic rock and black shales. A model of undergorund has made to see which differences are usual to see there while shaft opening. Firstly RQD data was used to determine the geomechanical proporties of study area. For each production layers was created for RQD distrubition maps. RQD values are generally between 25 % - 60 %. Some parts of area are fractured however in some parts are highly fractured. Weak and strong zones are shown us for the specified depths on three-dimensional geomechanical model. In this study, Müller rock mass classification, Q rock classification and RMR rock mass classification were made: For the classification of Müller, discontinuity measurements were made the surface. The most important feature of the Müller rock classification is to taking into account the size of system. According to Müller classification rock setting is weathered rock. According to the Q classification of rock setting is weak and very weak. RMR value of the side is generally between 40 - 60 on levels. Particularly middle and poor quality rocks are seen in the area. There are very poor rocks especially in west part of area. In order to find the parameters of rock mass, İTÜ, MJKM Vardar classification and Heok-Brown failure criterion was used. According to Heok-Brown failure criteria, obtained very high values. Therefore, cohesion values were calculated with the Leon hypothesis. Leon hypothesis and the İTÜ, MJKM Vardar classification results are close to each other. By using the all parameters a drill log of Mz- 304 have made. Geo drills log also made and compared each other. The safety factor of slopes behavour the shaft is determined by using Rocscience Slide application. The deplasmants of shaft are determined by using Rocsience Phase 2 application which use finite element method to solve. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

40|$|Methods were {{evaluated}} for assessing axial compressive capacities of augered, cast-in-place (ACIP) piles in the Pleistocene terrace deposits of the Texas Gulf Coast and Recent to Modern alluvial soils. The study involved {{a combination of}} data base analyses {{and the performance of}} new loading tests on instrumented piles. The results in sand deposits mirrored earlier studies that indicated that common methods used for designing <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts</b> are also appropriate for ACIP piles, although the patterns of load transfer in the tested piles suggested zones of both lower load transfer (running sands below the water table) and higher load transfer (compacted surface soils) than would be expected in <b>drilled</b> <b>shafts.</b> The action of drilling and grouting resulted in net increases in lateral effective stresses in the soil around the tested piles, near the ground surface, where such measurements were made. In overconsolidated clays, slightly higher unit side resistances were inferred for ACIP piles than are predicted by common <b>drilled</b> <b>shaft</b> design methods.
