His succession as king may have been contested; Adomnán states that Columba had favoured the candidacy of Áedán's brother Eoganán. Adomnán claims that Áedán was ordained as king by Columba, the first example of an ordination known in Britain and Ireland.|$|E

Polling statistics showed a general negative opinion of the law; with those in favor at approximately 40% and those against at 51%, as of October 2013. About 29% of whites approve of the law, compared with 61% of Hispanics and 91% of African Americans. Opinions were divided by age of the person at the law's inception, with a solid majority of seniors opposing the bill and a solid majority of those younger than <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> in favor.|$|E

25|$|His {{reforms in}} favor of the people greatly angered the nobility of the Umayyads, and they would {{eventually}} bribe a servant into poisoning his food. Umar learned of this on his death bed and pardoned the culprit, collecting the punitive payments he was entitled to under Islamic law but depositing them in the public treasury. He died in February 720, probably the 10th and probably <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> (v. 24, pp.91–92) in Aleppo.|$|E
25|$|Crowned (1989) tackles {{a similar}} theme, {{but from the}} {{perspective}} of the founding fathers. The film, based on a play by author Yaakov Shabtai (adapted by Ephraim Sidon and Ram Loevy), is an intense comedy based on the final days of the biblical King David. As his life approaches its end, he faces the most difficult task of his forty-year reign—giving up his crown to the next generation. Or perhaps he might even find a way to keep the crown for himself. The fact that this film was aired when Israel was itself <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> was not lost on its audience.|$|E

25|$|Acting Dean Greenough was to {{head the}} Court. Another senior member was Professor of Hygiene Robert I. Lee, the doctor {{responsible}} for the students' annual physical examinations, who had experience posing intimate questions about sexual activity. A third was Regent Matthew Luce, whose responsibilities included student discipline and conduct, especially housing and dormitory proctors. They were all roughly <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> or more. Two young Assistant Deans, Edward R.

He took his last first-class wicket (John Barclay) against Sussex in July 1981, although he did play two further Championship games without reward. His final List A game was for Minor Counties against Leicestershire in the 1982 Benson and Hedges Cup; he picked up the wickets of ex-Test cricketers Chris Balderstone and Roger Tolchard.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the chaos}} caused in the Jewish world, the Rabbinic {{prohibition}} against studying Kabbalah established itself firmly within the Jewish religion. One {{of the conditions}} allowing a man to study and engage himself in the Kabbalah was {{to be at least}} <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> This age requirement came about during this period and is not Talmudic in origin but Rabbinic. Many Jews are familiar with this ruling, but are not aware of its origins. Moreover, the prohibition is not halakhic in nature. According to Moses Cordovero, halakhically, one must be of age twenty to engage in the Kabbalah. Many famous kabbalists, including the ARI, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, Yehuda Ashlag, were younger than twenty when they began.|$|E

25|$|The 1920 Tour de France {{had been}} {{dominated}} by Belgian cyclists, who won twelve of the fifteen stages, and the top seven of the overall classification. The French cyclists Henri and Francis Pélissier had left the 1920 Tour de France after Henri received a penalty from the Tour organisation for throwing away a tire, and they were still fighting. Therefore, the Pélissier brothers did not join the 1921 Tour de France. Two veteran cyclists who did join the race were Ernest Paul and Lucien Pothier, both <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Paul rode his first Tour de France in 1908, while Pothier had started in the first Tour de France in 1903, and finished second.|$|E
25|$|Liu Wu died {{at home in}} 144BC after a trip to Chang'an. His {{memorial}} to his brother asking to extend his stay at the capital was rejected and he took ill soon after returning home. He was around <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> His estate at his death was estimated to include 400,000 catties of gold and an equivalent amount of wealth in land. His third son was the serial killer Liu Pengli. The other four were (in order) Liu Mai, Liu Ming, Liu Ding, and Liu Bushi. His mother the empress dowager was at first inconsolable, but Emperor Jing placated her by dividing the realm of Liang into five pieces and bestowing them upon Liu Wu's sons.|$|E
25|$|The early-to-middle {{years of}} Pindar's career {{coincided with the}} Persian {{invasion}}s of Greece in the reigns of Darius and Xerxes. During the invasion in 480/79 BC, when Pindar was almost <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> Thebes was occupied by Xerxes' general, Mardonius, who with many Theban aristocrats subsequently perished at the Battle of Plataea. It is possible that Pindar spent much of this time at Aegina. His choice of residence during the earlier invasion in 490 BC is not known, but {{he was able to}} attend the Pythian Games for that year, where he first met the Sicilian prince, Thrasybulus, nephew of Theron of Acragas. Thrasybulus had driven the winning chariot and he and Pindar were to form a lasting friendship, paving the way for his subsequent visit to Sicily.|$|E

25|$|The President is {{directly}} {{elected by the}} people for a term of five years and a maximum of two consecutive terms. The president is not, strictly speaking, the sole chief {{of the executive branch}} or the chief administrator. The Lithuanians borrowed the French model of the presidency, then adapted it to their needs. Candidates must be at least <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> To be elected in the first round, 50 per cent of the voters must participate and a candidate must receive {{more than half of the}} total votes cast. If 50 per cent of the voters do not participate, a plurality wins the presidency unless it constitutes less than one-third of the total vote. If the first round does not produce a president, a second round is held within two weeks between the two top candidates. A plurality vote is sufficient to win.|$|E
25|$|Despite the preeminence of Tikunei haZohar {{and despite}} the topmost {{priority}} of Torah study in Judaism, much of the Zohar has been relatively obscure and unread in the Jewish world in recent times, particularly outside of Israel and outside of Chasidic groups. Although some rabbis since the Shabbetai Tzvi debacle still maintain that one should be married and <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> in order to study Kabbalah, {{since the time of}} Baal Shem Tov there has been relaxation of such stringency, and many maintain that it is sufficient to be married and knowledgeable in halakhah and hence permitted to study Kabbalah and by inclusion, Tikunei haZohar; and some rabbis will advise learning Kabbalah without restrictions of marriage or age. In any case the aim of such caution is to not become caught up in Kabbalah to the extent of departing from reality or halakhah.|$|E
25|$|Letts had {{intended}} to cast an older actor as the Fourth Doctor, to hark back to Hartnell's portrayal in the 1960s, but after a long search he eventually selected Tom Baker, who was suggested {{to him by the}} incoming Head of Serials, Bill Slater. Baker was only <b>forty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> almost fifteen years Pertwee's junior, but despite not being the type of actor Letts had originally been looking for, he went on to become arguably the most popular and best-remembered to play the role. He starred in the series for seven years, longer than any of his predecessors or successors, and during his time on the programme Doctor Who enjoyed a consistent run of popular success and high viewing figures. Baker's Doctor was a more eccentric personality, at times passionate and caring, but at other times aloof and alien. This ambivalence was a deliberate choice by Baker, in an attempt to remind the viewers that the Doctor was not human, and therefore had non-human characteristics.|$|E
