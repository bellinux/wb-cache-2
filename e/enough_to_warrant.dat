5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as severe <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the Gothic Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design.|$|E
5|$|Smolarek, Terlecki and {{two other}} Polish players—Zbigniew Boniek and Władysław Żmuda, both of Widzew Łódź—angrily objected and nearly came to blows with Blaut.

5|$|A {{revised version}} of the game was resubmitted to the ACB and {{reclassified}} as MA 15+ on August 7, 2008, or not suitable for people {{under the age of}} 15 unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian; this new rating ensured that the game could retail legally in Australia. According to the ACB board report, the drug content was not removed entirely from the {{revised version of}} the game, but the animation showing the actual usage of the drugs was removed; the minority view on the decision stated that the drug content was still <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> a refused classification rating.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its effects}} in the United States, the name Frances was retired {{in the spring of}} 2005 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane.

Due to a request by France in the 2003 WMO Meeting, the name Frances was to be removed from the rotating cyclone lists after the 2004 hurricane season, even if Frances wasn't as destructive, but the destruction caused by Frances in the United States was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> retirement on its own merit.|$|E

Raking light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E
5|$|Harry Bloomfield, statistically, is Cumberland's best player. Bloomfield, {{along with}} A. Halling, S. Jarvis, Thomas Lalor and F. O'Grady played all eight matches for Cumberland. Bloomfield played fullback and scored {{nineteen}} points for Cumberland which encompassed one try and eight goals {{throughout the season}} which was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> representation for New South Wales in an interstate match against Queensland. This included eleven points in one match, against Wests in their only win for the Season. E.

5|$|In 2007, the Times Union of Albany {{received}} {{letters from}} readers requesting {{that all of}} NY149 be widened from two to four lanes. The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state {{would also have to}} take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E

5|$|It is {{so similar}} in {{morphology}} and habits to the carrion crow (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} they were considered by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the hooded crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the hooded crow species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> species status itself.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} was originally described by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in the 1832 third volume of Iconografia della fauna italica per le quattro classi degli animali vertebrati. He named it Trygon violacea, from the Latin viola ("purple"), and designated two specimens collected off Italy as the species syntypes. The genus Trygon {{has since been}} synonymized with Dasyatis. In 1910, American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler placed the {{pelagic stingray}} in the newly created subgenus Pteroplatytrygon, from the Greek pteron ("fin"), platus ("broad"), and trygon ("stingray"). Later authors elevated Pteroplatytrygon {{to the rank of}} full genus, though some taxonomists dispute whether this species is distinct <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> separation from Dasyatis.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} boobook (Ninox boobook) is {{a species}} of owl native to mainland Australia, southern New Guinea, Timor and the Sunda Islands. Described by John Latham in 1801, it was for many years {{considered to be the}} same species (conspecific) as the morepork of New Zealand until 1999. Its name is derived from its two-tone boo-book call. Eleven subspecies of the southern boobook are recognized, although there is evidence that four have calls and genetics distinctive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> separate species status.|$|E

5|$|These {{findings}} were contested {{a few years}} later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed Triceratops material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, although the distinctive skull of T. ("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> a separate genus. She found that T. horridus and several other species belonged together, and T. prorsus and T. brevicornus stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species. It is still possible to interpret the differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|William Murrill in 1909 {{placed the}} {{species in the}} genus Suillellus, while Sanshi Imai {{transferred}} it to Tubiporus in 1968. Tubiporus has since been synonymized with Boletus. In 1945, Rolf Singer described a bolete he found in Florida; although he originally {{described it as a}} subspecies of B.frostii, he later considered the differences between the taxa significant <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> publishing Boletus floridanus as a unique species. Following recent molecular studies that outlined a new phylogenetic framework for the Boletaceae, the bolete was transferred to the newly circumscribed genus Exsudoporus in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Berryman {{was later}} {{nominated}} for a bar to his Distinguished Service Order for the September 1918 fighting, but this was subsequently downgraded to a second Mention in Despatches.

Although his wound was serious <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>warrant</b> hospitalisation, there was no permanent damage to his vision. However, {{it was the end of}} his career as a battery commander, as the Army took the opportunity to transfer him to a staff post. From 28 October 1918 to 1 July 1919, he was Brigade Major of the 7th Infantry Brigade. With the war over, he returned to Australia in October 1919.|$|E
