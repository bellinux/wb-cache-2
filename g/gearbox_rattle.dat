40|$|We {{consider}} the automotive <b>gearbox</b> <b>rattle</b> noise resulting from vibro-impacts {{that can occur}} between the idle gears under excessive velocity fluctuations of the shaft-driving gears imposed by engine torque fluctuation. Even if the rattling phenomenon has no consequence on reliability, it may be particularly annoying for vehicle interior sound quality and acoustic comfort. The main parameters governing such kind of vibrations are the excitation source associated with engine torque fluctuation which can be modeled by an imposed displacement of the driveline, the inertia of the idle gear, the drag torque acting during the free flight motion, and the impact laws. In the case of rattle, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that duration of impacts between teeth is very short compared to the excitation period. Then, these impacts are modeled by a coefficient of restitution law. The excitation source is not composed only with fundamental component but also with other harmonic components. This study presents some effects of these additional components on the dynamic response of the idle gear...|$|E
40|$|LTDS and VIBRATEC {{founded the}} Labcom LADAGE (gears {{dynamics}} joint laboratory). One of its {{goals is to}} develop numerical methods and simulation tools for predicting gears dynamics, {{in order to take}} account of multiphysics couplings between internal and external excitations and to follow the evolution of industrial demand towards more and more complex systems. The operation of a combustion engine is such that it generates a cyclic disturbance of the circular motion of the gearbox primary shaft. Coupled with internal excitations, this disturbance can generate losses of contact at the loaded gear pair. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox hammering noise. The irregular rotation of the motor is also sufficient for generating loss of contact of unloaded gears, such as idler gears of an automotive gearbox. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the <b>gearbox</b> <b>rattle</b> noise. Two different approaches can be retained to describe the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of mechanisms with contact and backlash nonlinearities, depending on the intensity of the vibroimpact pulses and contact duration. Hammering noise For high level pulses, the contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is long. A nonlinear dynamic model is introduced, taking into account both the gear backlash and the contact stiffness nonlinearities. Solving the equations of motion requires the implementation of specific methods dedicated to nonlinear problems. For example, the finite difference method is used in order to obtain the periodic solutions. They are followed up according to a parameter control, thanks to a pseudoarc length continuation method. Indeed, this approach has proven very efficient for studying multifrequency excitations. A direct integration time method is also used in order to compare obtained results. Eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix inform us about their loss of local stability and {{about the nature of the}} bifurcations that occur. This first approach is well suited to characterize the hammering noise of a truck timing multistage gear. A large variety of dynamic behaviours have been identified. In addition to periodic responses, pseudoperiodic and chaotic ones are highlighted. Multiple impacts per period of excitation are observed. These nonlinear responses occur at resonances and instability regions. Then, the adding effect of the engine torque fluctuation is considered. The dynamic behaviour of the two-stage gear train becomes more complex. Vibroimpact regimes are observed over a wide range of operating conditions. Rattle noise A second approach is retained for low level pulses. The contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is very short. They are described in a more simple way, using a coefficient of restitution. The dynamic response of the system is built piecewisely by solving the equations of motion for the free flight periods. New initial conditions are introduced after each impact, derived from the dynamic response just before impact. This second approach is particularly well suited to characterize the rattle noise due to nonlinear dynamic behaviour of idle gears of an automotive gearbox. In addition to the gearbox design parameters and the engine operating conditions, the dynamic response of idle gears depends on the drag torque applied to the idle gear and the coefficient of restitution. They are identified experimentally through implementation of optical encoders in an actual automotive gearbox and the operation of a specific test bench which replicates the automotive power train. Models of the different drag torque sources are validated from analysis of the free damped response of the drivelines. The coefficient of restitution and its probability density function are measured from further experiments under stationary operating conditions. A nonlinear model of the dynamic response of idle gears is built. The key parameters are the dimensionless backlash, the coefficient of restitution and a dimensionless parameter proposed to describe the rattle excitation level. Periodic, pseudoperiodic and chaotic responses including impacts between active flanks and reverse flanks are observed. Experiments under controlled excitation are performed to validate the assumptions, to confirm the ability of the proposed parameter to describe the rattle noise threshold, and to characterize the dynamic behaviour of the idle gear. Predictions are fitted with the drag torque and coefficient of restitution previously identified. Comparisons with measurements demonstrate the ability of the model to predict gear rattle for any idle gear, any gearbox and any operating condition...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work proposes an {{original}} approach to detect rattle noise in car <b>gearboxes.</b> <b>Rattle</b> noise {{is produced by}} vibro impacts between teeth of unloaded gears. These impacts are principally caused by the engine acyclism transmitted to the primary shaft of the gearbox after being partially filtered by the clutch. The appearance {{and the level of}} rattle noise depend, among others, on the operating conditions and more particularly on the rotation speed. The interest is then here focused on tests in run up conditions in order to scan a large panel of operating conditions. The objective of this work is to develop an efficient method to detect rattle noise in signals based on an angle-time cyclostationary approach. The results are compared to a more intrusive detection methodology exploiting signals issued from optical encoders...|$|R
40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} {{properties of}} products have become important {{functions in the}} competition between different manufacturers and are seen today as indicators {{for the quality of}} the product. In this work, a new approach is presented for the localisation of impulse sources in complex structures, e. g. engines, driving units or complete vehicles. The approach is based on a correlation technique similar to methods used in radar techniques. The method is developed for an engineering application aiming on the detection of gear <b>rattle</b> in <b>gearboxes.</b> Gear <b>rattle</b> occurs in <b>gearboxes</b> and is caused by relative motion between acting gearwheels. Gear rattle depends on the play between the gearwheels, the loading and the overall dynamics of the system. Gear rattle can, under certain speed and loading conditions, dominate the total emitted noise from a truck. The proposed analysis method is based on the idea to measure impulse response functions (so called characteristic signals) from possible source locations to a receiving point {{on the surface of the}} structure, e. g. the casing of a gearbox. These characteristic signals are compared with vibration measurements when the analysis object is running and impulse sources are active (e. g. rattle impacts between cogwheels). The comparison is done by calculating the correlation coefficient between the characteristic signals and the measured vibrations in the receiving point. It is shown that this correlation coefficient corresponds to the maximum likelihood function and can, from defined perspectives, be seen as the best estimator to decide which of all possible sources is responsible for the vibrations in the receiving point. A substantial part of the work is devoted to the discussion of the quality of the decision based on the correlation coefficient. The problem is extended to the case of unknown arrival time and the presence of noise in the measured signals. From the theoretical background of the suggested methods, engineering solutions are suggested to handle the complex task to detect <b>rattle</b> source in <b>gearbox</b> under different driving conditions. The function of the method is demonstrated for both a modified gearbox under well-controlled conditions in a test rig and for a gearbox in a complete truck. It is shown that the method is a good tool for locating rattle sources in complex structures. It provides information concerning the location as well as the intensity of the impulse sources...|$|R
