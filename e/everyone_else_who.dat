Stauffenberg had his opportunity on 20 July 1944 at a military briefing at Hitler's East Prussian headquarters known as the Wolf's Lair (Wolfsschanze). He managed to get through security and plant a briefcase bomb under the conference table. The bomb exploded, fatally wounding three officers and a stenographer who died shortly thereafter.

[...] Daria states in the first episode {{that she does not}} have low self esteem: she has low esteem for everybody else.

Esposito said {{he did not want to}} [...] "take any of [...] home with me" [...] and had [...] "some deep concern about being able to do it and coming out of it unscathed, without really hurting my spirit and my soul". He worked through these {{concerns}} by justifying Gus' actions in that, by killing Victor, he was protecting <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>who</b> works for him. Nevertheless, he said it was [...] "a difficult moment for me" [...] to slit Victor's throat, and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly. That scene took two days to film, and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to the others on set. The boots he was originally given were too large and he was concerned that he would slip, which would be out of character for Gus, who was otherwise completely calm and in control. A costume designer quickly procured the right-sized boots for him.|$|E

McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>who's</b> working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10.
