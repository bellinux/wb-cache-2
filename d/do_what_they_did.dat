2500|$|Altman favored stories {{expressing the}} interrelationships among several characters, being more {{interested}} in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a [...] "blueprint" [...] for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an [...] "actor's director," [...] a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work {{as part of his}} large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because [...] "he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration," [...] notes Derry. Richard Baskin says that [...] "Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> He trusted you to do what you did and therefore you would kill for him." ...|$|E

6000|$|THIRD. And now to {{the next}} thing, {{what it is to}} pray with the Spirit, and to pray with the {{understanding}} also. For the apostle puts a clear distinction between praying with the Spirit, and praying with the Spirit and understanding: therefore when he saith, [...] "he will pray with the Spirit," [...] he adds, [...] "and I will pray with the understanding ALSO." [...] This distinction was occasioned through the Corinthians not observing that it was their duty to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> to the edification of themselves and others too: whereas they did it for their own commendations. So I judge: for many of them having extraordinary gifts, as to speak with divers tongues, &c., therefore they were more for those mighty gifts than they were for the edifying of their brethren; which was the cause that Paul wrote this chapter to them, to let them understand, that though extraordinary gifts were excellent, yet to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> to the edification of the church was more excellent. For, saith the apostle, [...] "if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding," [...] and also the understanding of others, [...] "is unfruitful" [...] (I Cor 14:3, 4, 12, 19, 24, 25. Read the scope of the whole chapter). Therefore, [...] "I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also." ...|$|E

Johnson, however, with respect to Goldsmith, and indeed with respect to everybody else, blew hot as well as cold, according to the humor he was in. Boswell, who was astonished and piqued at the continually increasing celebrity of the poet, observed some time after to Johnson, {{in a tone of}} surprise, that Goldsmith had acquired more fame than all the officers of the last war who were not generals. [...] "Why, sir," [...] answered Johnson, his old feeling of good-will working uppermost, [...] "you will find ten thousand fit to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> before you find one to do what Goldsmith has done.

6000|$|Again; {{giving of}} alms is a Gospel command; yet if I do give alms {{from a legal}} principle, the command to me is not Gospel, but legal, and it binds me over, as aforesaid, to do the whole law--"For {{he is not a}} Jew," [...] nor a Christian, [...] "which is one outwardly"--that is, one only by an outward {{subjection}} to the ordinances of prayer, hearing, reading, baptism, breaking of bread, etc.--"But he is a Jew," [...] a Christian, [...] "which is one inwardly," [...] who is rightly principled, and practiseth the ordinances of the Lord from the leadings forth of the Spirit of the Lord, from a true and saving faith in the Lord (Rom 2:28,29). Those men spoken of in the 7th of Matthew, for certain, for all their great declaration, did not <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> from a right Gospel spirit; for had they, no question but the Lord would have said, [...] "Well done, good and faithful servant." [...] But in that the Lord Jesus doth turn them away into Hell, notwithstanding their great profession of the Lord, and of their doing in His name, it is evident that notwithstanding all that they did do, they were still under the law, and not under that covenant as true believers are--to wit, the Covenant of Grace; and if so, then all their duties that they did, of which they boasted before the Lord, was not in and by a right evangelical principle or spirit.|$|E

60|$|Jesus Christ put a {{difference}} betwixt {{the form and}} spirit that is in prayer, and intimates the soul of prayer is in the desires of a man; 'Therefore,' saith he, 'I say unto you, What things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them' (Mark 11:24). If a man prays never so long, and has never so many brave expressions in prayer, yet God counts it prayer no further than there are warm and fervent desires in it, after those things the mouth maketh mention of. David saith, 'Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee' (Psa 38:9). Can you say you desire, when you pray? or that your prayers come from the braying, panting, and longing of your hearts? If not, they shall not be granted: for God looks, when men are at prayer, to see if their heart and spirit is in their prayers; for he counts all other but vain speaking. Ye shall seek me, and find me, says he, when you shall search for me with all your heart (Rom 8:26,27; Matt 6:7; Jer 29:12). The people that you read of in 2 Chronicles 15 are there said to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> 'with all their heart, and with all their soul.' 'For they sought God with their whole desire' (2 Chron 15:11-15). When a man's desires put him upon prayer, run along {{with him in his}} prayer, break out of his heart and ascend up to heaven with his prayers, it is a good sign that he is a righteous man, and that his desire shall be granted.|$|E
