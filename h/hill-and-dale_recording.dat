IRENE will retrieve the information from a laterally modulated monaural grooved sound source without touching the medium itself, but cannot read vertically modulated information. This excludes grooved recordings such as cylinders and some radio transcriptions that feature a <b>hill-and-dale</b> format of <b>recording,</b> and stereophonic or quadraphonic grooved recordings, which utilize {{a combination of the two}} as well as supersonic encoding for quadraphonic.|$|R
