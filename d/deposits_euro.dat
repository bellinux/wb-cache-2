30|$|What type of {{alternative}} funding would be available? The basic {{idea behind the}} initiative is that, once sight deposits are outside of banks’ balance sheets, the financing of banks should come from more “responsible” investment decisions. This {{is likely to be}} true for equity or long-term debt. But some alternative sources of financing may not be more “responsible” and some other may make banks more prone to crises. First, there might be an increase in savings deposits: since the opportunity cost of holding sight deposits increases, there would be a shift towards savings deposits. Second, there might be a shift towards sight <b>deposits</b> in <b>euros.</b> These <b>deposits</b> would not be part of sovereign money and would keep yielding a positive interest rate (once we exit the current liquidity trap). These accounts are already available in many Swiss banks, so that the switch would be easy. It may lead to an increase in euro transactions in Switzerland. 38 Third, banks may innovate to make alternative investments more liquid (e.g., the citation of Cochrane in the “Background” section). Basically, they can reduce switching costs between invested funds and money needed for transactions. This could drastically reduce the demand for sight deposits without changing the behavior of depositors.|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, {{at the end}} of June 2017, the largest {{fraction}} of loans and deposits granted by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem were loans to Households, followed by bank-to-bank loans and deposits and loans to Non-Financial Corporations, amounting to around 5.49, 4.48, and 4.32 trillion euros, respectively. More specifically, from the macro-network analysis of the financial exposures via loans and deposits, we can notice that, despite the fact that a large fraction of loans and deposits granted by Monetary and Financial Institutions is intra-financial (7.53 trillion euros), the most relevant portion is granted by the private banking sector to the real sector (9.81 trillion euros), followed by loans and deposits to the Rest of the World and public sector (amounting to 2.65 and 1.05 trillion euros, respectively). Unfortunately, available data on the institutional sector Rest of the World do not allow us to discriminate between real sector and financial sector of non-euro area countries receiving the aforementioned amount of loans and <b>deposits</b> by the <b>euro</b> area private banking system. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that, the disaggregation of Monetary Financial Institutions in Eurosystem and Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, not only {{from the point of view}} of the sector granting the loans and deposits, such as in Perillo and Battiston (2017), but also from the perspective of the institutional sector receiving them, allows us to discriminate among bank-to-bank loans and <b>deposits</b> (4.48 trillion <b>euros),</b> loans and <b>deposits</b> granted by the private banking system to the Eurosystem (1.72 trillion euros), and loans and deposits granted and received within the Eurosystem (2.27 trillion euros). The latter category belongs to the so-called TARGET balances, i.e., intra-Eurosystem assets and liabilities of central banks’ balance sheet resulting from net cross-border payments in the form of central bank reserves, via the Eurosystem real-time payment system, which settles continuously euro-denominated payments on an individual transaction-by-transaction basis without netting (called TARGET 2)(Eisenschmidt et al. 2017).|$|R

It was factually established that CDS-PP fabricated the donor receipts (including some using comical names such as [...] "Jacinto Leite Capelo Rego," [...] which in Portuguese is an erotic pun on words) but the real source of the money was never identified. In investigating, the police suspected the Espírito Santo Group (on whose bank the money was deposited) to have donated that money in connection with a tourism development named 'Portucale' in Benavente that entailed the cutting down of thousands of protected cork trees, which Paulo Portas, through his (until then) best friend and party colleague Luís Nobre Guedes, allegedly facilitated {{in the final days of}} the government to which they belonged. Paulo Portas denied any illegality and was not directly implicated in the case, while Nobre Guedes took the blame (and stopped talking to Paulo Portas). However, in investigating this case, the police intercepted phone calls that motivated another investigation into the costly purchase of two submarines by the Portuguese State (see below). It turned out that in addition to the Espírito Santo Group's real estate subsidiary in charge of the Portucale project (ESAF) there was another trading subsidiary (ESCOM) that was also an intermediary in a major submarines deal, for which it had received 30 million euros in advance and which was judicially suspected to have been the source of the CDS-PP deposits as a kickback pay-off for the submarines intermediation.|$|R

The banking union project is based on three pillars: a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), a European Deposit Guarantee Scheme (EDGS). Each of these pillars raises specific problems. Some are related to the current crisis (can <b>deposits</b> in <b>euro</b> area countries facing difficulties be guaranteed?); some other issues are related to the EU complexity (should the banking union include all EU member states?

40|$|In Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe a {{substantial}} share of bank deposits are denominated in foreign currency. Deposit euroization poses key challenges for monetary policy and financial sector supervision. On the one hand, it limits {{the effectiveness of}} monetary policy interventions. On the other hand, it increases financial sector fragility by exposing banks to currency risk or currency-induced credit risk. Policymakers disagree on whether {{countries in the region}} should tackle deposit euroization with ‘dedollarization' policies or should rather strive to adopt the Euro as their legal tender. Assessing the potential effectiveness of ‘dedollarization' policies requires a clear understanding of which households hold foreign currency deposits and why they do so. On the basis of survey data covering 16, 375 households in ten countries in 2011 and 2012, we provide a comprehensive household-level analysis of deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. We examine how households' preferences for, and holding of, foreign currency deposits are related to individual expectations about monetary conditions and network effects. We also examine to what extent monetary expectations and deposit euroization are the legacy of past financial crises or the outflow of current policies and institutions in the region. Our findings suggest that deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe can be partly tackled by prudent monetary and economic decisions by today's policymakers. The preferences of households for <b>Euro</b> <b>deposits</b> are partly driven by their distrust in the stability of their domestic currency, which in turn is related to their assessment of current policies and institutions. However, our findings also suggest that a stable monetary policy may not be sufficient to deal with the hysteresis of deposit euroization across the region. First, we confirm that the holding of foreign currency deposits has become a ‘habit' in the region. Second, we find that deposit euroization is still strongly influenced by households' experiences of financial crises in the 1990 s. Our findings question the effectiveness of supply side interventions (e. g. bank regulation) or demand side interventions (e. g. local currency capital market development) in de-euroizing household savings.

40|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{publication}} in the ECB monthly bulletin of new Eurosystem projections for the euro area, this article presents {{the results for the}} Belgian economy for 2008 and 2009. Since the previous forecasts were published in December 2007, the deterioration in the external factors has become more acute, owing to the deepening financial tensions, the sharp downturn in the property cycle and, more generally, the marked slowdown in activity in the United States, as well as soaring commodity prices. In the euro area, the appreciation of the euro has partly cushioned this prices increase, but is detrimental to export opportunities. The Eurosystem projections take account of weakening trade in 2008, reflecting the slower global growth. On the basis of the forward markets, oil prices are expected to persist at a very high level, averaging 113. 3 dollars per barrel in 2008 and 117. 7 dollars in 2009. Interest rates are also assumed to move in line with market expectations. As an annual average, three-month interbank <b>deposit</b> rates in <b>euro</b> are projected to reach 4. 9 p. c. in 2008 and 4. 3 p. c. in 2009. Longer term rates are forecast at 4. 5 p. c. in 2008 and 4. 7 p. c. in 2009. Exchange rates are kept constant at their mid May level, namely 1. 54 dollars to the euro. In that context, having reached 2. 7 p. c. in 2007, GDP growth in the euro area should be between 1. 5 and 2. 1 p. c. in 2008 and between 1. 0 and 2. 0 p. c. in 2009. Under the impetus of the rising prices of energy and food, inflation looks set to increase to between 3. 2 and 3. 6 p. c. in 2008. Inflation is expected to subside to between 1. 8 and 3. 0 p. c. in 2009. As in the euro area, activity remained buoyant in Belgium in 2007. The slowdown {{during the second half of}} the year was limited, in the light of the various shocks originating from the external environment. However, the slowdown is likely to be more marked towards mid 2008. Overall, real GDP growth is projected to fall from 2. 8 p. c. in 2007 to 1. 6 p. c. in 2008 and 1. 5 p. c. in 2009. Most expenditure categories are expected to contribute to the slackening pace of growth in 2008. Following a gradual recovery in the two preceding years, a downturn in exports of goods and services is expected, in line with flagging foreign demand. The recovery forecast to begin in 2009 is likely to be curbed by the delayed effects of the recent appreciation of the euro. On the domestic spending front, the growth of business investment – which had been highly dynamic up to 2007 – is likely to falter owing to the less favourable demand outlook and the tightening of external financing conditions. However, that tightening will probably be manifested mainly in a widening of the spreads. Housing investment is likely to maintain the decelerating trend which began in 2007, in a context of cooling property prices. Private consumption is also expected to weaken significantly, mainly as a result of the meagre increase in household purchasing power. However, that weakening – due mainly to higher inflation in 2008 and diminished job creation – is expected to be partly offset by a reduction in the savings ratio. Following a year-on-year rise of 1. 7 p. c. in 2007, sustained partly by the success of the service vouchers, the rate of expansion in employment is expected to drop to 1. 3 p. c. in 2008 and 0. 7 p. c. in 2009. This decline reflects the slowdown in activity after a time lag of several months. Nevertheless, job creation is likely to outpace the growth of the labour force, so that the unemployment rate should fall from 7. 5 p. c. in 2007 to 6. 9 p. c. in 2008 and 6. 8 p. c. in 2009. Having remained almost constantly below 2 p. c. in the preceding twelve months, inflation measured by the HICP accelerated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2007. According to the projections, the unusually large contribution made by food and energy price increases is set to continue during 2008. It should unwind at the beginning of 2009, in line with the assumption of persistently high commodity prices. Overall inflation is therefore predicted to rise from 1. 8 p. c. in 2007 to 4. 1 p. c. in 2008, before subsiding to 2. 3 p. c. in 2009. However, higher inflation is expected in the case of industrial goods and in services, mainly on account of the indirect effect of the commodity price shocks and the progressive incorporation of the increase in labour costs. Reflecting a muted rise in labour productivity following the strong expansion of employment in 2007 and the cyclical downturn in activity in 2008, the rise in unit labour costs in the private sector is expected to gain momentum, accelerating from an average of 0. 6 p. c. per annum between 2002 and 2006 to 2. 9 p. c. in 2007 and 3. 4 p. c. in 2008, before easing to 2. 4 p. c. in 2009. The accelerating rise in labour costs in 2007 and 2008 takes place against the background of the pressure exerted on some segments of the labour market in the wake of the economic boom. In addition, temporary factors reinforced the increase in 2007, and indexation has a considerable impact in 2008. Thus, hourly wage costs are expected to increase by 7. 3 p. c. over the two years taken together, so that the disadvantage vis-à-vis the three main trading partners is likely to be further widened. For 2009, the 3. 2 p. c. rise in hourly labour costs assumed for this exercise essentially comprises the expected effect of indexation, as this takes time to respond to the acceleration in inflation measured by the health index. That assumption is based on moderate wage settlements, the factor determining the projected easing of inflation and the expected continuing job creation. The figures for public finances take account of the recent movement in tax revenues, the endogenous effect of the macroeconomic environment, a movement in expenditure based on historical patterns and the measures which have already been decided. In accordance with the ESCB directives, new government measures which might be passed in the coming months have not been anticipated in the projection exercise. In that context, the public deficit is expected to increase from 0. 2 p. c. of GDP in 2007 to 0. 3 p. c. in 2008 and 0. 8 p. c. in 2009. This larger deficit would be due mainly to the adverse impact of the economic situation, a structural decline in revenues and a slightly expansionary policy on expenditure. Conversely, there should be a slight fall in the interest charges incurred by general government. Despite the budget deficits projected for 2008 and 2009, the debt ratio is expected to continue falling, to reach 81. 4 p. c. of GDP in 2008 and 79. 5 p. c. in 2009.
