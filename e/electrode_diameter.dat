In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies.

30|$|Overall, {{in order}} to improve CNT yield with desired quality, the above {{parameters}} should be overhauled seriously, since AD method cannot produce pure CNTs for large-scale uses. Producing high yield of CNT also depends on cooling rate, which also depends on arc current and cathode shape, temperature, and thermal conductivity of chamber gases. In general, 20 – 50  mg of CNT can be produced per minute of reaction which can be further boost up by optimizing current and pressure values, <b>electrode</b> <b>diameters,</b> catalyst composition, and atmosphere.

5|$|The {{choice of}} a {{shielding}} gas depends on several factors, most importantly the type of material being welded and the process variation being used. Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration (argon) or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter (with helium). Pure carbon dioxide, on the other hand, allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation, which adversely affect the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost makes it an attractive choice, {{but because of the}} reactivity of the arc plasma, spatter is unavoidable and welding thin materials is difficult. As a result, argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75%/25% to 90%/10% mixture. Generally, in short circuit GMAW, higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters (volts, current, <b>electrode</b> type and <b>diameter)</b> are held the same. As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20%, spray transfer GMAW becomes increasingly problematic, especially with smaller <b>electrode</b> <b>diameters.</b>|$|R

The first FAIMS device consisted of a side-to-side configuration (sFAIMS) suitable for ion separation, whereas the second FAIMS device was appropriate for ion trapping (tFAIMS).

The use of the sFAIMS, with wider <b>electrode</b> <b>diameters,</b> and consequently better ion separation efficiency than the tFAIMS, lowered the number of background ions captured in the trapping region of tFAIMS, and thus reduced the space charge effects in the trap.
