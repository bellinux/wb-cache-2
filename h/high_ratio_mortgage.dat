40|$|We use a mean-reverting {{interest}} rate model and a lognormal house price diffusion model to evaluate British fixed rate repayment mortgage contracts with (embedded) default and prepayment options. The model also provides values for capped mortgage indemnity guarantees {{and the corresponding}} (residual) lender's coinsurance. Since the partial differential equation incorporating the general features of these mortgage contracts {{does not have a}} closed-form solution, an explicit finite difference method is used for the valuation (and sensitivity) results, with solution improvements to deal with error bounds. Then we provide graphical representations of each mortgage component as a function of house prices and {{interest rate}} levels, along with interpretations of the analysis. We calculate precisely the lender's (residual) exposure to house price risk, given the borrower's options, house and interest rate uncertainty, and customary mortgage indemnity insurance for <b>high</b> loan/collateral <b>ratio</b> <b>mortgages.</b> Copyright 2002 by the American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper solves {{a dynamic}} {{model of a}} household’s {{decision}} to default on its mortgage, taking into account labor income, house price, in‡ation, and interest rate risk. Mortgage default is triggered by negative home equity, which results from declining house prices in a low in‡ation environment with large mortgage balances outstanding. Not all households with negative home equity default, however. The level of negative home equity that triggers default depends {{on the extent to}} which households are borrowing constrained. <b>High</b> loan-to-value <b>ratios</b> at <b>mortgage</b> origination increase the probability of negative home equity. <b>High</b> loan-to-income <b>ratios</b> also increase the probability of default by tightening borrowing constraints. Comparing mortgage types, adjustable-rate mortgage defaults occur when nominal interest rates increase and are substantially a¤ected by idiosyncratic shocks to labor income. Fixed-rate mortgages default when interest rates and in‡ation are low, and create a higher probability of a default wave with a large number of defaults. Interest-only mortgages trade o ¤ an increased probability of negative home equity against a relaxation of borrowing constraints, but overall have the highest Many di¤erent factors contributed to the global …nancial crisis of 2007 - 09.

40|$|Historically, {{the housing}} finance sector {{has not been}} a major source of risk to {{financial}} institutions in Canada and, more generally, to the stability of the Canadian financial system as a whole. The Canadian housing finance market is national- ie lending conditions and mortgage products are similar across the country- and is largely dominated by domestic lenders, especially by a few well capitalised banks. The mortgage credit culture in Canada is rather conservative, with a large majority of mortgages at fixed interest rates and a preference for mortgage terms of five years. Interest bearing term instruments sold to savers remain the primary source of funding for mortgage loans, which subsequently remain largely on the balance sheet of lenders. While the government’s influence in the housing market is limited, it is more significant in the housing finance system, essentially through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). The various government initiatives in this area have aimed to increase the supply of mortgage loans from private lenders. These initiatives have impacted the Canadian housing finance system, as reflected by the current significant share of <b>high</b> <b>ratio</b> mortgages- ie, <b>mortgages</b> where the down payment is lower than 25 % {{of the value of the}} property and which must be insured- and by the recent trend towards increasing off-balance sheet funding based on mortgage-backed securities created from insure...|$|R
40|$|The Monthly Economic Review is an {{overview}} of the New Zealand economy. It includes the latest data on New Zealand’s economic growth, unemployment, inflation, merchandise trade and balance of payments figures, along with certain financial data (such as the Reserve Bank’s official cash rate). The unemployment rate, economic growth and central bank interest rates for several of our main OECD trading partners are also included. Each publication highlights a specific topic of interest. The Monthly Economic Review is produced eleven times per year. Recent data and events Economic activity increased by 0. 9 percent in the December 2013 quarter, while activity growth for the September quarter was revised down from 1. 4 percent to 1. 2 percent. This was the 12 th consecutive quarter of expansion, following two quarters of contraction {{during the second half of}} 2010. The mining, manufacturing and wholesale trade industries all made significant contributions to growth over the quarter. In terms of expenditure gross domestic product, an increase in goods export volumes, along with higher household consumption expenditure drove growth in the December quarter. Over the 2013 calendar year, the economy grew by 2. 7 percent. New Zealand’s annual current account deficit narrowed to $ 7, 547 million in the year to December 2013, equivalent to 3. 4 percent of GDP. This compared with an annual deficit of $ 8, 871 million in the year ended September 2013 (4. 1 percent of GDP). Dairy product exports surged in the December quarter, resulting in the value of merchandise goods exported rising by $ 1, 410 million in the quarter. Reserve Bank Governor, Graeme Wheeler, lifted the official cash rate by 25 basis points to 2. 75 percent in March. The Governor noted that the restrictions on <b>high</b> loan-to-value <b>ratio</b> <b>mortgage</b> lending was starting to ease pressure in the housing market, but that rising immigration inflows was an offsetting influence. Overall, the Bank believed that there had been some moderation in the housing market.

40|$|The {{subprime}} mortgage {{crisis that}} helped bring on the Great Recession resulted in the decimation of housing-related wealth among economically disenfranchised groups and communities. These losses were, in significant part, {{the direct result of}} the rampant racialized and geographic mortgage discrimination that took place in these communities {{in the run-up to the}} financial crisis and persists today. The Bankruptcy Code, however, offers little relief to these and other distressed homeowners because the Code 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 anti-modification 2 ̆ 2 provision limits a distressed homeowner from modifying the terms of a mortgage on her primary residence. The anti-modification prov 1 s 1 on is particularly troubling for economically disenfranchised groups and communities because it operates at the intersection of three social and economic factors:(]) the importance of homeownership to wealth acquisition and retention in the economically disenfranchised communities; (2) the persistence of predatory lending relationships that lead to <b>high</b> loan-to-value <b>ratios</b> on <b>mortgages</b> and, in turn, a greater risk of underwater mortgages; and (3) foreclosure externalities that are borne by segregated communities in which compromised wealth is a common attribute. For communities that are already vulnerable to mortgage discrimination, the lack of a bankruptcy modification option compounds the unique risks of cyclical and historical economic disenfranchisement related to homeownership. This Article contends that by permitting debtors to modify primary residential mortgages, consumer bankruptcy law can address persistent and intractable mortgage discrimination in historically disenfranchised communities and support wealth-building and retention in the process. Reframed in this way as a tool of economic remediation and improvement, and not just a form of temporary relief for temporary financial misfortune and crisis, bankruptcy law can address the broader structural forces that produce chronic, racialized, economic subordination, particularly related to homeownership. Accordingly, this Article reconceives consumer bankruptcy as providing not only a 2 ̆ 2 fresh start 2 ̆ 2 but also an appropriate remedy for financially distressed borrowers whose economic hardships are directly related to illegal and discriminatory mortgage lending practices that lead to or exacerbate financial distress...|$|R

Whereas {{previous}} studies have focused on the default rate as a function of this term, this study considers the additional effect on the loss rate of defaulted loans.

MethodsClinical characteristics and CRF {{were used to determine}} prevalence of a TG/HDL-C ratio ≥ 3. 5 (<b>high</b> <b>ratio)</b> in 13, 954 men of the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study. High-ratio conversion was determined in 10, 424 men with normal baseline TG/HDL-C ratio. Hazard ratio (HR) of incident high TG/HDL-C was adjusted for age and waist girth. ResultsMen with low CRF had the highest prevalence of a <b>high</b> TG/HDL-C <b>ratio.</b> In the population with normal TG/HDL-C, age-adjusted HR of incident <b>high</b> TG/HDL-C <b>ratio</b> was 2. 77 times higher in men with lowest CRF than in those with highest CRF. Incidence of conversion of normal to <b>high</b> <b>ratio</b> was 5. 5 % per year in low CRF population, compared with 1. 7 % in high CRF subjects. Incidence HR was independent of waist girth.

Their nanorod crystal structures and morphologies were examined by using XRD, SEM, and TEM. The ZnO/Si nanorods have a wurtzite structure with a <b>higher</b> <b>ratio</b> of (002) facets than the ZnO/FTO nanorods due to the rod in shape with a wide (100) facet. Hence, the ZnO- 4 /Si nanorods have a <b>higher</b> <b>ratio</b> of surface defect with (002) facets than the ZnO- 4 /FTO nanorods. Their photocatalytic activities with respect to 2 -ATP were examined with HRPES, and {{it was found that}} there are close correlations between the external oxygen defects of the ZnO nanorods, and differences between their substrate surfaces, and their photocatalytic efficiencies.
