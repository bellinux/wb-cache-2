5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 the {{celebrations}} of her 50th career anniversary {{started with a}} major concert in Lisbon's Coliseu dos Recreios {{at the age of}} 69. She was decorated by the President of the Republic on stage. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> changed: it was lower but intense.|$|E
25|$|Modern gay icons in {{entertainment}} include both film stars and musicians, {{most of whom}} have strong, distinctive personalities, and many of whom died young or under tragic circumstances. For example, Greek-American opera singer Maria Callas—who reached her peak in the 1950s—became a gay icon because the uniquely compelling qualities of her stage performances were allied to a tempestuous private life, a sequence of unhappy love affairs, and a lonely premature death in Paris after <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> deserted her.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> been {{described}} as [...] "expressive, with much variety." ...|$|R

25|$|With Charlotte in Werther in 1974, Crespin began {{performing}} opera roles {{from the}} mezzo-soprano repertoire {{to adjust to}} the change in her voice. However the timbre of <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> not altered much from her earlier singing years and she therefore brought a different sound to the roles from that of the typical mezzo-soprano. Regardless, she was well received in her new choice of repertoire. This period also led to her interest in Offenbach and her sophisticated wit found its place in recordings of Métella, the Grand Duchess of Gérolstein and Périchole, along with Dulcinée (Massenet's Don Quichotte).|$|E
25|$|<b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> a {{distinctive}} character which the Italians call a lirico spinto, marked by its quick vibrato, incisive diction, intensity of attack and unwavering emotional impact. During her career she performed {{with many of}} the contemporary greats of opera—Beniamino Gigli, Claudia Muzio, Jussi Björling, and Franco Corelli. She worked with some of the best conductors of her time, but it is her work with Toscanini that has endured. Despite her talent and numerous performances, she was not the best known of her contemporaries, overshadowed in her day by Zinka Milanov, Maria Callas, Victoria de los Ángeles and Renata Tebaldi.|$|E
25|$|Released in September 1969, the Kozmic Blues {{album was}} {{certified}} gold {{later that year}} but did not match the success of Cheap Thrills. Reviews of the new group were mixed. However, the album's recording quality and engineering, {{as well as the}} musicianship (including three performances by former Bob Dylan/Paul Butterfield/Electric Flag guitarist Mike Bloomfield), were considered superior to her previous releases, and some music critics argued that the band was working in a much more constructive way to support Joplin's sensational vocal talents. Joplin wanted a horn section similar to that featured by the Chicago Transit Authority; <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> the dynamic qualities and range not to be overpowered by the brighter horn sound.|$|E
50|$|Gerrard {{possesses}} the vocal {{range of a}} contralto. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> been described as rich, deep, dark, mournful and unique.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> {{specialty}} of wide spreading husky voice. Also, handles variety of voices, such as whistle voice {{which comes from}} low thick voice.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2013, Cher reflected on how <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> evolved {{during the course of}} her career, eventually getting stronger and suppler over the years. While she didn't really like it at the beginning, working with vocal coaches had made a significant difference; she stated in the Toronto Sun: [...] "It's so freaky because people my age are having to lose notes and I'm gaining notes, so that's pretty shocking." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Hakim {{starred in}} another Karya-directed film, Kawin Lari (Elope). The experience {{gave her a}} greater understanding of acting, causing her to [...] "see life from a different perspective in studying [...] character." [...] It was followed by a role in 1976's Sesuatu yang Indah (Something Beautiful), directed by Wim Umboh. Sesuatu yang Indah was the first film in which Hakim used her own voice; <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> been dubbed by Titi Qadarsih in previous movies; Hakim's own voice had been considered [...] "too heavy." [...] The next year, she starred in Badai Pasti Berlalu, appearing on the poster and the cover of the soundtrack album.|$|E
500|$|On August 5, 2007, Beyoncé {{performed}} the song at the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. While singing, Beyoncé {{was accompanied by}} her all-female band, and she incorporated Jill Scott's [...] "He Loves Me" [...] in [...] "Dangerously in Love 2". Shaheem Reid of MTV News praised the performance, writing: [...] "For all the dancing she did, Beyoncé got an equally big — if not more resounding — response for displaying her undeniable vocal ability on the ballads [...] 'Dangerously in Love'." [...] Another review from PopEater stated: [...] "Beyoncé Knowles transforms into an open book of emotion, sensuality, physics-defying dance moves and goosebump-inducing vocals. [...] she showed us that even her ballads could be over-the-top and <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> enough star power even when it wasn’t complemented by her gyrating hips." ...|$|E

500|$|During production, Bell and Menzel {{had to do}} a lot of {{recordings}} and re-recordings, and were required to be together in the same room when on the key emotional scenes between Anna and Elsa. [...] "We even got Kristen and Idina together for a song. That really helped elevate the song because they have a duet in the movie and it definitely helped drive that," [...] said producer Peter Del Vecho. Chris Buck later commented that getting the actresses in together as much as they could helped add the real, amazing chemistry between them and made them really interact. Bell's recording sessions were completed while she was pregnant, and later she had to re-record some of the lines after giving birth, as <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> deepened. After watching the completed film, Bell described her performance as [...] "cool and weird and surreal and jarring", saying that she was really proud that Anna [...] "came out like she did that [...] let [...] do her like this." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> deepened. Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film [...] "probably 20 times," [...] which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving. As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years old, saying, [...] "I always loved Disney animation, {{but there was something about}} the females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that." ...|$|E
500|$|Cher made cameo {{appearances}} in the Robert Altman films The Player (1992) and Prêt-à-Porter (1994). In 1994, she started a mail-order catalogue business, Sanctuary, selling Gothic-themed products, and contributed a rock version of [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] to MTV's animated series Beavis and Butt-head. Alongside Chrissie Hynde, Neneh Cherry, and Eric Clapton, she topped the UK Singles Chart in 1995 with the charity single [...] "Love Can Build a Bridge". Later that year, she signed with Warner Music UK's label WEA and released the album It's a Man's World (1995), which {{came out of her}} idea of covering men's songs from a woman's point of view. In general, critics favored the album and its R influences, some saying <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> improved. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that [...] "From an artistic standpoint, this soulful collection of grown-up pop songs... is the high point of her recording career." [...] It's a Man's World reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart and spawned the UK top-ten single [...] "One by One". Tracks were remixed for the American release of the album, abandoning its original rock sound in favor of a style more accessible to U.S. radio; it reached number 64 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. Mrs. Murrell's suspicions {{took that}} direction, and we hunted down the cashier and the friend, {{but they were}} quite exonerated. It only proves that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> an unfortunate value.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>Voices</b> <b>had</b> {{not given}} <b>her</b> {{permission}} {{to make the}} sort of submission that was required, therefore she would stand fast. She would wait, in perfect obedience, let come what might.|$|R
50|$|Gruber's biggest musical {{influences}} are Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix {{along with}} other 60s and 70s Blues/Rock artists. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> been compared to those of Janis Joplin, Nikka Costa and Anastacia.|$|R
2500|$|For several years, Reddy {{maintained}} {{that she would}} not return to the stage. In 2008, she stated, [...] "It's not going to happen. I've moved on," [...] and explained that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> deepened to a lower key and she wasn't sure if {{she would be able to}} sing some of her hits. She also said she had simply lost interest in performing. [...] "I have very wide-ranging interests," [...] she said. [...] "So, singing 'Leave Me Alone' 43 times per song lost its charm a long time ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Dandridge and Belafonte were singers, {{neither was}} capable of singing the operatic score, so Marilyn Horne and LeVern Hutcherson were hired to record their vocals, and soundtrack {{recording}} began on June 18. Horne later recalled, [...] "Even though I {{was at that time}} a very light lyric soprano, I did everything I possibly could to imitate the voice of Dorothy Dandridge. I spent many hours with her. In fact, one of the reasons I was chosen to do this dubbing was that I was able to imitate <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> she been able to sing in the proper register." ...|$|E
2500|$|There were others, however, {{who felt}} that the voice had benefitted from the weight loss. Of her {{performance}} of Norma in Chicago in 1954, Claudia Cassidy wrote that [...] "there is a slight unsteadiness {{in some of the}} sustained upper notes, but to me her voice is more beautiful in color, more even through the range, than it used to be". And at her performance of the same opera in London in 1957 (her first performance at Covent Garden after the weight loss), critics again felt <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> changed for the better, that it had now supposedly become a more precise instrument, with a new focus. Many of her most critically acclaimed appearances are from the period 1954–1958 (Norma, La traviata, Sonnambula and Lucia of 1955, Anna Bolena of 1957, Medea of 1958, to name a few).|$|E
50|$|In between albums she {{has written}} with Anthony Phillips (Genesis) and sung vocals for Universal Music Group and <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} commercials in the USA and Europe.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> been {{described}} as [...] "rich, beautifully formed, with dramatic delivery and strength and feeling for style exciting admiration" [...] ("Umfangreiche, schön gebildete Stimme, deren dramatische Ausdruckskraft und deren Stilgefühl Bewunderung erregten").|$|R
50|$|Callaghan's {{music is}} a blend of pop/rock/singer-songwriter genres, with {{influences}} from great artists including Shawn Mullins, Sarah McLachlan, Johnny Cash and James Taylor. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> been compared to artists including Sarah McLachlan and Alison Krauss.|$|R
2500|$|On January 14, 1957 Allen excited much {{attention}} for her {{portrayal of the}} title heroine in Arthur Honegger's Judith in a concert performance of the work with the American Concert Choir and Orchestra under conductor Margaret Hillis at Town Hall. Critic Edward Downes said of her performance, [...] "Allen sang {{the music of the}} first two acts without apparent effort. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> a rich, true mezzo-soprano quality with a brilliant top, and dark reedy chest tones. It was so beautifully placed and focused that it gave the impression of being larger than it was. Her piano and even pianissimo singing had the velvet quality that carries so beautifully through an auditorium. She was a figure of regal dignity, yet she showed dramatic temperament, too." [...] In December 1957 she was a soloist in the Oratorio Society of New York's performances of Handel's Messiah.|$|E
2500|$|Norwood’s initial {{sound was}} {{contemporary}} R, heavily rooted in gospel and hip hop soul. Her lyrics spoke {{of various types}} of love, from casual and friendly love to romantic and spiritual affairs. Influenced by Houston and Carey, she incorporated a ballad-heavy style and an adult contemporary feel into her urban-pop sound for her second studio album Never Say Never. Her third studio album Full Moon saw Norwood abandon her teenage appeal for a more adult and sensual edginess. Along with her image, <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> gone through a major change, trading her girlish rasp for a now deeper and warmer voice that had acquired a somewhat throatier, smoky edge. The music also reflected the change, as songs like [...] "When You Touch Me" [...] and [...] "Like This" [...] explored more adult, sexual topics, and a sound that blended her previous urban-pop sound with heavy influences of UK garage, glitch, and electro-funk.|$|E
2500|$|Callas's vocal registers, however, {{were not}} {{seamlessly}} joined; Walter Legge writes, [...] "Unfortunately, {{it was only}} in quick music, particularly descending scales, that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole, but until about 1960, she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill." [...] Rodolfo Celletti states, In certain areas of her range her voice also possessed a guttural quality. This would occur in the most delicate and troublesome areas of a soprano's voice—for instance where the lower and middle registers merge, between G and A. I would {{go so far as to}} say that here <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> such resonances as to make one think at times of a ventriloquist... or else the voice could sound as though it were resonating in a rubber tube. There was another troublesome spot... between the middle and upper registers. Here, too, around the treble F and G, there was often something in the sound itself which was not quite right, as though the voice were not functioning properly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> also {{appeared}} in move trailers, including for the rendition of Leaving on a Jet Plane for the movie 7500. She continues {{to work as a}} session singer for commercials and various other projects.|$|R
50|$|Poulenard {{was born}} in Paris, France. Her work has {{generally}} been focused on music of the French Baroque, however, she has performed and recorded George Frideric Handel and Georg Philipp Telemann. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> been {{compared to that of}} Emma Kirkby.|$|R
5000|$|Fiona is a {{dramatic}} soprano. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>has</b> {{been referred to as}} being both [...] "soulful" [...] and [...] "sassy." [...] Some have her praised her vocals for being [...] "very passionate, but clean and controlled, and not over-the-top singing." ...|$|R
