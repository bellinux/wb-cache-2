5|$|Barry Bonds {{received}} the award in 2002, becoming the third player so honored <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> single-season home run record. Bonds {{was the first}} of two players to receive the award that season, along with Rickey Henderson. The award was given in each year from 2004 until 2007: Roger Clemens was honored during the 2004 All-Star Game, and Ichiro Suzuki was presented with the award <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> single-season hits record in 2005. Rachel Robinson was honored in 2007, receiving the award for establishing the Jackie Robinson Foundation. She was the first woman and the first non-player to be thus honored.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to the Far East and took up teaching responsibilities at the Korean Pedagogical Institute in Vladivostok until all ethnic Koreans were forcibly moved to Central Asia, and the Institute along with Cho were relocated to Kzyl-Orda, Kazakh SSR in 1937. The following year Cho went to Moscow and tried to enroll at the Moscow Literature University, only to find himself arrested on the spot <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> law confining Koreans to Central Asia. He then {{returned to}} the Institute in Kzyl-Orda and worked there until 1941. In the late 1930s, Cho married Kim Hae-sŏn. The two had a son, Yurii Cho, born in 1939.|$|E

5|$|The Second Doctor {{was portrayed}} by Patrick Troughton, whose serials were more action-oriented {{than those of}} his predecessor. Additionally, after The Highlanders, stories {{moved away from the}} purely {{historical}} ones that featured during William Hartnell's tenure; instead, any historical tales also included a science fiction element. Patrick Troughton retained the role until the last episode of The War Games when members of the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, put him on trial <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> laws of time and forced him to regenerate.|$|E

5|$|After that season, coach Alex Hannum {{wanted to}} be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association. Chamberlain then asked for a trade, and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers. The {{motivation}} for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal, but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who was the Sixers general manager then, Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left, and forced the trade himself. Cherry finally adds several personal reasons: the center felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities (which were plenty in L.A.) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a black man in L.A. but hard to imagine elsewhere back then.|$|E
5|$|Chris Beveridge's {{review for}} Fandom Post was highly {{positive}} towards the anime series, {{calling it a}} dark horse contender {{as one of their}} top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> supernatural approach other works usually take and liked the potential impact it could have on future events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> same laws.|$|E

5|$|It {{was also}} in this reign in 1530, that Henry VIII conferred on the College {{one of its most}} {{important}} duties for almost a century, the heraldic visitation. The provincial Kings of Arms were commissioned under a royal warrant to enter all houses and churches and given authority to deface and destroy all arms unlawfully used by any knight, esquire, or gentleman. Around the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries this duty became even more necessary as the monasteries were previously repositories of local genealogical records. From then on, all genealogical records and the duty of recording them was subsumed by the College. These visitations were serious affairs, and many individuals were charged and heavily fined <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> law of arms. Hundreds of these visitations were carried out well into the 17th century; the last was in 1686.|$|E
5|$|Raju Hirwani, {{the owner}} of Supreme Music, ventured into {{overseas}} distribution with Magadheera. He distributed the film in the USA via Blue Sky Cinemas Inc. The distribution rights of non-US countries, including the UK, Ireland, Middle East, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, were acquired by Krishna Productions. The theatrical rights of Australia and New Zealand were sold to Tollyfilmz. The film's Singaporean rights were sold to Pragati films. Gulf and Kuwait theatrical rights were sold to K. A. Chowdary and Basheer respectively. Red Giant Movies distributed Maaveeran while Pallavi films distributed Dheera—The Warrior. The film's Karnataka distributor, Vijayakumar, was disciplined <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> rules of the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce by simultaneously releasing a non-Kannada film in more than 21 screens in the state. The proceeds of 21 screens were given to him while the rest was confiscated by the Chamber of Commerce.

5|$|Schindler {{was arrested}} twice on {{suspicion}} of black market activities and once <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> Nuremberg Laws by kissing a Jewish girl, an action forbidden by the Race and Resettlement Act. The first arrest, in late 1941, led to him being kept overnight. His secretary arranged for his release through Schindler's influential contacts in the Nazi Party. His second arrest, on 29 April 1942, {{was the result of}} his kissing a Jewish girl on the cheek at his birthday party at the factory the previous day. He remained in jail five days before his influential Nazi contacts were able to obtain his release. The third arrest, where he was accused of black marketeering and bribing Göth and others to improve the conditions of the Jewish workers, took place in October 1944. He was held for most of a week and released. Göth had been arrested on 13 September 1944 for corruption and other abuses of power, and Schindler's arrest was part of the ongoing investigation into Göth's activities. Göth was never convicted on those charges, but was hanged by the Supreme National Tribunal of Poland for war crimes on 13 September 1946.|$|E

5|$|The Gamezebo {{reviewer}} {{had special}} {{praise for the}} game's sound design {{and how it was}} used to clue the player into puzzle solutions. TouchArcade commended how the game's sparse story unfolded by watching the assassination targets go about their time at the compound. The reviewer also noted that his suspension of disbelief was broken when characters would eventually return to partying after reacting to a gunshot, but suggested that the game's Easter eggs redeemed its psychopathic qualities. Pocket Gamer wrote that the game did not reach the heights of the series' situational humor in hiding bodies stealthily. Other criticism included Gamezebo, which blamed the game's core multiplier ability <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> balance of the game. TouchArcade thought that the game played better on the tablet iPad than on the smaller iPhone, and praised the feature that synced game progress, since Apple's iCloud service was known for its struggle to successfully implement the same feature. Despite Square Enix Montreal being best known for its Go series, Hitman: Sniper was the studio's biggest revenue generator. As its most lucrative title, the game helped to fund the development of the Go series.|$|E
5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E
5|$|Impressed by Rivera's pitching, Yankees {{management}} {{chose not}} to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead to replace him as closer with Rivera. In April 1997, MLB retired the uniform number 42 league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson <b>for</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> baseball color line, although Rivera was among a dozen players allowed to continue wearing the number per a grandfather clause. Rivera's transition from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; he blew three of his first six save opportunities and indicated that he was initially uncomfortable in the role. With reassurance from manager Joe Torre, Rivera settled into the ninth-inning role, and he earned his first All-Star selection with 27saves and a 1.96ERA at the midseason break. In the 1997 All-Star Game, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an All-Star Game. That summer, he added a cut fastball to his pitching repertoire after accidentally discovering how to throw the pitch. Rivera finished the regular season with 43saves in 52opportunities with a 1.88ERA. His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the 1997 AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians; with the Yankees four outs from advancing to {{the next round of}} the postseason, Rivera allowed a game-tying home run to Sandy Alomar Jr. The Yankees eventually lost that game and the next, eliminating them from the postseason.|$|E

40|$|Structural break tests {{developed}} in the literature for regression models are sensitive to model misspecification. We show - analytically and through simulations - that the sup Wald test <b>for</b> <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> conditional mean and variance of a time series process exhibits severe size distortions when the conditional mean dynamics are misspecified. We also show that the sup Wald test <b>for</b> <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> unconditional mean and variance {{does not have the}} same size distortions, yet benefits from similar power to its conditional counterpart. Hence, we propose using it as an alternative and complementary test <b>for</b> <b>breaks.</b> While <b>the</b> conditional tests based on dynamic regression models detect <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> mean and variance of the US unemployment growth and interest rate growth series around the Great Moderation, <b>the</b> evidence <b>for</b> these <b>breaks</b> disappears when using the unconditional tests. Therefore, {{there is no evidence of}} long-run mean or volatility shifts in unemployment growth and interest rate growth...|$|R
40|$|This study {{estimates}} <b>the</b> <b>break</b> {{point in}} <b>the</b> residual variance {{and in the}} propagation mechanism of the real exchange rates at {{about the time of}} the Asian crisis that occurred in 1997, and provides some explanations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>breaks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> residual variance increased the volatility of the real exchange rates, which given the overall effects of common adverse shocks to the countries seems to be reinforced by the sudden withdrawal of Japanese commercial banks' lending to the region. And <b>the</b> subsequent <b>breaks</b> in <b>the</b> propagation mechanism reduced the volatility, which reflects the change in the government policy stance to result in smoothing the pace of appreciation.
