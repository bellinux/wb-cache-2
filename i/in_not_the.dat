5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} {{argument}} in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads <b>in,</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E

In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them <b>in</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> obvious way".|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Holmes {{published}} {{a summary of}} his thinking about the Schlieffen Plan and the debates about it <b>in</b> <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> Schlieffen Plan. He wrote that people believed that the Schlieffen Plan was for a grand offensive against France, to gain a decisive victory in six weeks. The Russians would be held back and then defeated with reinforcements rushed by rail from the west. Holmes wrote that no-one had produced a source showing that Schlieffen intended a huge right-wing flanking move into France, in a two-front war. The 1905 Memorandum was for War against France, in which Russia was unable to participate. Schlieffen had thought about such an attack on two general staff rides (Generalstabsreisen) in 1904, on the staff ride of 1905 and in the deployment plan [...] I, for 1905–06 and 1906–07, in which all of the German army fought the French. In none of these plans was a two-front war contemplated; the common view that Schlieffen thought that such an offensive would guarantee victory in a two-front war was wrong. In his last exercise critique in December 1905, Schlieffen wrote that the Germans would be so outnumbered against France and Russia, that the Germans must rely on a counter-offensive strategy against both enemies and eliminate one as quickly as possible.|$|E

60|$|It is still, perhaps, in {{possession}} of a success rather of esteem than of affection. A company of young men and maidens to whom it was not long ago submitted pronounced it (with one or two exceptions) inferior as a work of humour. The hitting of little Harry in the eye with a potato was, they admitted, humorous, but hardly anything else. As representing another generation and another point of view, the faithful Dr. John Brown did not wholly like it—Esmond’s marriage with Rachel, after his love for Beatrix, being apparently “the fly in the ointment” to him. Even the author could only plead “there’s a deal of pains in it that goes for nothing”, as he says in one of his rare published references to the subject: but he was wrong. Undoubtedly the mere taking of pains will not do; but that is when they are taken <b>in</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> right manner, by not the right person, on not the right subject. Here everything was right, and accordingly it “went for” everything. A greater novel than Esmond I do not know; and I do not know many greater books.

60|$|It {{would be}} a poor service to spread culture, if this be its result, among the {{comparatively}} innocent and cheerful ranks of men. When our little poets have {{to be sent to}} look at the ploughman and learn wisdom, we must be careful how we tamper with our ploughmen. Where a man <b>in</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> best of circumstances preserves composure of mind, and relishes ale and tobacco, and his wife and children, in the intervals of dull and unremunerative labour; where a man in this predicament can afford a lesson by the way to what are called his intellectual superiors, there is plainly something to be lost, as well as something to be gained, by teaching him to think differently. It is better to leave him as he is than to teach him whining. It is better that he should go without the cheerful lights of culture, if cheerless doubt and paralysing sentimentalism are to be the consequence. Let us, by all means, fight against that hide-bound stolidity of sensation and sluggishness of mind which blurs and decolorises for poor natures the wonderful pageant of consciousness; let us teach people, as much as we can, to enjoy, and they will learn for themselves to sympathise; but let us see to it, above all, that we give these lessons in a brave, vivacious note, and build the man up in courage while we demolish its substitute, indifference.|$|E
60|$|They {{who would}} know how {{beautiful}} the country immediately surrounding Genoa is, should climb (in clear weather) {{to the top of}} Monte Faccio, or, at least, ride round the city walls: a feat more easily performed. No prospect can be more diversified and lovely than the changing views of the harbour, and the valleys of the two rivers, the Polcevera and the Bizagno, from the heights along which the strongly fortified walls are carried, like the great wall of China in little. <b>In</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> least picturesque part of this ride, there is a fair specimen of a real Genoese tavern, where the visitor may derive good entertainment from real Genoese dishes, such as Tagliarini; Ravioli; German sausages, strong of garlic, sliced and eaten with fresh green figs; cocks' combs and sheep- kidneys, chopped up with mutton chops and liver; small pieces of some unknown part of a calf, twisted into small shreds, fried, and served up in a great dish like white-bait; and other curiosities of that kind. They often get wine at these suburban Trattorie, from France and Spain and Portugal, which is brought over by small captains in little trading-vessels. They buy it at so much a bottle, without asking what it is, or caring to remember if anybody tells them, and usually divide it into two heaps; of which they label one Champagne, and the other Madeira. The various opposite flavours, qualities, countries, ages, and vintages that are comprised under these two general heads is quite extraordinary. The most limited range is probably from cool Gruel up to old Marsala, and down again to apple Tea.|$|E

We use that framework to investigate the behaviour of net flows of persons between employment, unemployment and <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labour force in Australia between 1979 - 2003 and the relationship of these flows to changes in the unemployment rate over that period. We find that: flows from unemployment to employment exceed flows from employment to unemployment and that this is the case even in recessions; flows from employment to <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labour force exceed flows from <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labour force to employment and that this is the case even in booms, and; flows from <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labour force to unemployment exceed flows from unemployment to <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labour force even in recessions. Another important finding is that the reason why the participation rate is negatively correlated with the unemployment rate is because net flows from employment to both unemployment and to <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labour force are highly correlated. It cannot be explained by flows occurring between unemployment and <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labour force. Worker Flows Business Cycle Unemployment Participation Rate...|$|R
