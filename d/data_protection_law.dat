25|$|Sweden {{is often}} {{considered}} {{to be at the}} forefront of Internet use and Internet regulations. On 11 May 1973 Sweden enacted the Data Act − the world's first national <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>law.</b> They are constantly innovating the way that the Internet is used and how it impacts their people. In 2012, Sweden received a Web Index Score of 100, a score that measures how the Internet significantly influences political, social, and economic impact, placing them first among 61 other nations. Sweden received this score while in the process of exceeding new mandatory implementations from the European Union. Sweden placed more restrictive guidelines on the directive on intellectual property rights enforcement (IPRED) and passed the FRA-law in 2009 that allowed for the legal sanctioning of surveillance of internet traffic by state authorities. The FRA has a history of intercepting radio signals and has stood as the main intelligence agency in Sweden since 1942. Sweden is an interesting topic when discussing Laws and Regulations of Internet Privacy because of mixture of their government's strong push towards implementing policy and their citizens continued perception of a free and neutral Internet. Both of the previously mentioned additions created controversy by critics but they did not change the public perception even though the new FRA-law was brought in front of the European Court of Human Rights for human rights violations. The law was established by the National Defense Radio Establishment (Forsvarets Radio Anstalt - FRA) to eliminate outside threats. However, the law also allowed for authorities to monitor all cross-border communication without a warrant. Sweden's recent emergence into Internet dominance may be explained by their recent climb in users. Only 2% of all Swedes were connected to the Internet in 1995 but at last count in 2012, 89% had broadband access. This was due in large part once again to the active Swedish government introducing regulatory provisions to promote competition among Internet Service Providers. These regulations helped grow web-infrastructure and forced prices below the European average. To add to the intrigue around Sweden's laws and regulations, one must also mention how copyright laws evolved in Sweden. Sweden was the birthplace of the Pirate Bay, an infamous file-sharing website. File sharing has been illegal in Sweden since it was developed, however, there was never any real fear of being persecuted for the crime until 2009 when the Swedish Parliament was the first in the European Union to pass the intellectual property rights directive. This directive persuaded internet service providers to announce the identity of suspected violators. A final piece of legislation worth mentioning when discussing Sweden's regulations is the infamous centralized block list. The list is generated by authorities and was originally crafted to eliminate sites hosting child pornography. However, there is no legal way to appeal a site that ends up on the list and as a result, many non-child pornography sites have been blacklisted. It is important to consider that Sweden's government enjoys a high level of trust from their citizens. Without this trust, many of these regulations would not be possible and thus many of these regulations may only be feasible in the Swedish context.|$|E

40|$|The race is on for {{businesses}} and consumers {{to join the}} cloud. From increased efficiency to low operational costs to scalability, reasons abound as to why we are adopting cloud solutions. However, unleashing the potential of cloud ecosystems for companies and individuals has not been without difficulties. Industry research has highlighted that <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> and privacy concerns, in particular, can often {{be one of the}} main inhibitors to the widespread adoption of cloud-based systems. Lately, some US-based cloud companies have been required to comply with European <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>laws</b> through the regulatory process of investigation by European <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> authorities (“Cloud Investigations”). In this article, I analyze selected empirical findings from my recent qualitative socio-legal research project where I have examined the investigations of cloud providers by European <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> authorities (“EU DPAs”) to reflect on the roles of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>laws</b> during such investigations. I advance two arguments. Firstly, a decentralized perspective on Cloud Investigations sheds a more comprehensive light on the roles of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>laws</b> during Cloud Investigations without assuming a priority that such laws have a privileged and static role in the regulatory process. Secondly, and relatedly, I argue that by “cutting off the King’s head”, we can understand more fully the dynamic and context-dependent roles of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>laws</b> during Cloud Investigations. From time to time, law can be deployed to achieve the aims of the law-makers or enforcers. At other times, law can also be used as bargaining chips by EU DPAs and Cloud Providers to obstruct or facilitate the negotiations during Cloud Investigations. At other times still, law can often retreat from the field of action as other actors carry out the “act of government” to determine if and to what extent Cloud Providers are “accountable in reality. ...|$|R
