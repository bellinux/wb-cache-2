5000|$|On 1 April 2016, ADS {{confirmed}} {{that it was}} working to resolve manufacturing faults affecting fourteen propeller gear boxes (PGBs) produced by TP400 supplier Europrop International (EPI) {{in the first half}} of 2015. The gearboxes are made by Italian supplier Avio Aero, owned by General Electric. The issue involved a specific heat treatment process in manufacturing that adversely affected the strength of the ring gear; no other PGBs before or since were affected and the units involved either have been or are being changed. Airbus noted that [...] "pending full replacement of the batch, any aircraft can continue to fly with no more than one affected propeller gear box installed and is subject to continuing inspections." [...] Another PGB issue involves cracking of the input pinion plug, which in some cases can result in the release of small metallic particles into the oil system, where they are detected by a magnetic chip detector. Only engines 1 and 3, which have propellers that rotate to the right, are affected. The European Aviation Safety Agency has issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating immediate on-wing inspection, followed by replacement if evidence of damage is found, or else return-to-service and continuing inspections. On 27 April 2016, when delivering Q1 2016 financial results, Airbus warned there could be a significant cost in repairing the gearbox. In June 2016, two German A400Ms received in December 2014 - aircraft 54-01 and 54-02 - were temporarily grounded after inspections found heavy engine wear in the clockwise rotation PGBs after only 365 and 189 hours of operations, respectively. An interim fix for this PGB issue was certified in July 2016, which extends the inspection phase from 100 hours to 650 hours, with <b>follow-up</b> <b>inspections</b> every 150 hours, up from 20 hours.|$|E

40|$|Financial Disclosure: Dr Clayton, Mr Atkin, and Mr Wilding have US and {{international}} patents pending for methods of using heat to treat head lice. OBJECTIVES. Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) {{are a major}} irritant to {{children and their parents}} around the world. Each year millions of children are infested with head lice, a condition known as pediculosis, which is responsible for tens of millions of lost school days. Head lice have evolved resistance to many of the currently used pediculicides; therefore, an effective new treatment for head lice is needed. In this study we examined the effectiveness of several methods that use hot air to kill head lice and their eggs. METHODS. We tested 6 different treatment methods on a total of 169 infested indi-viduals. Each method delivers hot air to the scalp in a different way. We evaluated how well these methods kill lice and their eggs in situ. We also performed <b>follow-up</b> <b>inspections</b> to evaluate whether the sixth, most successful, method can cure head louse infestations. RESULTS. All 6 methods resulted in high egg mortality (88 %), but they showe...|$|E

40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) {{has been}} {{operating}} a nuclear fuel cycle since the 1950 `s to produce nuclear materials {{in support of the}} national defense effort. The Department of Energy authorized the construction of the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) to immobilize the high level radioactive waste resulting from these processes as a durable borosilicate glass. The DWPF, after having undergone extensive testing, has been approved for operations and is currently immobilizing radioactive waste. To ensure reliability of the DWPF remote canyon processing equipment, a materials evaluation program was performed prior to radioactive operations to determine to what extent erosion/corrosion would impact design life of equipment. The program consisted of performing pre-service baseline inspections on critical equipment and <b>follow-up</b> <b>inspections</b> after completion of DWPF cold chemical demonstration runs. Non-destructive examination (NDE) techniques were used to assess erosion/corrosion as well as evaluation of corrosion coupon racks.

40|$|For {{the past}} several year Kossuth County has had a {{scheduled}} maintenance program of bituminous seal coating. This program {{has been used to}} maintain the 467 miles of asphaltic concrete surfaced roads in Kossuth County. Since most of the experience that Kossuth County had in seal coating was with cutback asphalt, it was decided to include the use of emulsified asphalt in Kossuth County's 1980 seal coat program. Federal Demonstration Project Funds were requested from the Federal Highway Administration to study the use of emulsified asphalt and funding was granted under Demonstration Project No. 55,:Asphalt Emulsions for Highway Construction. " Items studied were design and construction procedure cost of alternate material, energy consumption and environmental considerations. A construction contract was awarded to Everds Brothers, Inc. of Algona, Iowa, on July 1, 1980. There were four bidders on the 54. 5 miles of seal coating that was let.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} emphasis on controlling odor from animal operations. Historically, animal operations have been exempted from odor regulations in North Carolina, and no stipulations regarding odor emissions or their abatement are contained in animal waste management system permits. However, as part of a waste utilization plan (WUP), a part of the overall certified animal waste management plan (CAWMP), an odor “checklist ” must be completed and submitted. Only three of seventeen listed odor sources in the checklist are related to land application, and two of those three relate to slurries or sludge. While not currently regulated through the permitting process of animal operations, there is a mechanism in place to allow registering of complaints due to objectionable odors from animal operations, for <b>follow-up</b> <b>inspections</b> of the complaints, and evaluation and recommendation to be made by the Division of Air Quality (DAQ). As such, air quality enforcement is complaint-driven. DAQ may require the owner or operator of an animal facility to submit information pursuant to the complaint.

If the plan fails either by lack of submission of the plan or non-implementation of the plan, the Director may require the owner or operator of the facility to submit an application for a “control technology...|$|E
30|$|Approximately 4  weeks after healing {{abutment}} connection, intraoral defect including implant abutment and extraoral paranasal defect impressions were taken. The technician managed {{two different}} casts: one cast for nasal wax up and one cast for dental wax up. Superior implant bar supported by [4] zygoma implants was designed crossing the palatal defect {{in order to}} manufacture palatal obturator at a second time. Furthermore, two metal abutments were lodged and fused on the cranial surface of the bar {{in order to receive}} epithesis attachments. The abutments acted as primary crowns and secondary crowns, press-fitted on abutments and were used to take an extraoral position impression of the abutments using the nasal wax up as an individual. In this way, the technician could connect OTK (Ball abutment) attachments on the internal surface of the epithesis and thanks to secondary crowns, the nasal prosthesis can be removed for prosthetic aftercare and <b>follow-up</b> <b>inspections.</b> OTK attachments are commonly used because of their retention in overdenture prosthetic rehabilitation. The female part of this peculiar type of ball attachment is made out of Teflon™ (politetrafluoroetilene) while the male part consisted of a titanium structure.
