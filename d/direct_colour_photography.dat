50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Yevonde began experimenting with <b>colour</b> <b>photography,</b> {{using the new}} Vivex colour process from <b>Colour</b> <b>Photography</b> Limited of Willesden. The {{introduction}} of <b>colour</b> <b>photography</b> was not universally popular; indeed photographers and public alike were so used to black-and-white pictures that early reaction to the new process tended toward the hostile. Yevonde, however, was hugely enthusiastic about it and spent countless hours in her studio experimenting with {{how to get the}} best results. Her dedication paid huge dividends. In 1932 she put on an exhibition of portrait work at the Albany Gallery, half monochrome and half colour, to enthusiastic reviews.|$|R

40|$|Fusion of multisource data is {{becoming}} a widely used procedure due to the availability of complementary yet dissimilar datasets. The combined use of high spatial resolution imagery and lidar (light detection and ranging) derived digital surface models (DSM) can reduce interclass confusion in the fusion process. However, pixel-level data fusion does not take spatial information into account. Pixels from multisource images are fused depending on their spectral values, regardless of their neighbour values. Object-level fusion overcomes this shortcoming by segmenting multisource images into meaningful objects and then performing fusion with the information imbedded into their topology. This paper compares {{the results of the}} pixel- and object-level fusion of a lidar derived DSM with <b>colour</b> aerial <b>photography</b> and multispectral imagery. The comparison is based on the assessment of the classification accuracy where reference information has been collected through field survey. Pixel-level fusion of the <b>colour</b> <b>photography</b> and the DSM exhibits better results than sole classification of <b>colour</b> <b>photography.</b> The same result is found for the multispectral imagery and the DSM. Object-level fusion achieves superior results compared to all pixel-level classification of tested categories. Object-level fusion of the <b>colour</b> <b>photography</b> and the DSM shows the highest classification accuracy (91 %) ...|$|R

50|$|Color (or <b>colour)</b> <b>{{photography}}</b> is photography {{that uses}} media capable of reproducing colors. By contrast, black-and-white (monochrome) photography records {{only a single}} channel of luminance (brightness) and uses media capable only of showing shades of gray.|$|R

50|$|A {{polarizing}} filter, {{used for}} both color and black-and-white photography, is colourless {{and does not}} affect colour balance, but filters out light with a particular direction of polarisation.
