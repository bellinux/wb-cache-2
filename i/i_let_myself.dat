2500|$|During a press release, Epic Records {{described}} the album as a deeply personal record; {{speaking about the}} concept and themes on the album, Ciara said [...] "I can sometimes be afraid of my own vulnerability, but this time <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> face it. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> feel. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> be real. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> hurt and be healed." [...] Spin and Idolator {{described the}} album as [...] {{an updated version of}} crunk, a sound that Ciara was familiar with in 2004, and contained my pop moments. Ciara explained the influence behind the album's theme saying, ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{of the men}} apologized {{before the}} sentencing. Cromitie said, [...] "I've never been a {{terrorist}} and I'll never be a terrorist. I'm very sorry <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> {{get caught up in}} a sting like this" [...] and added that he did not truly believe the anti-Semitic statements heard on the audiotapes at trial.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} to the 2006 Labour Party Conference in Manchester, Prescott apologised for the bad press he had caused the party during the {{previous}} year. He said: [...] "I know in the last year <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> down, I let you down. So Conference, I just want to say sorry", and confirmed that he would stand down as deputy leader when Blair resigned the premiership. Prescott subsequently announced in the House of Commons that he was [...] "... in a rather happy demob stage", in January 2007.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{am afraid}} of them then. Put it that way if you like. Anyhow <b>I</b> do not <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> go with them. <b>I</b> have never <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> go." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} see that <b>I</b> was <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> in for something. The {{sympathetic}} co-operation of Jeeves {{seemed to me to be}} indicated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you expect}} me to be haggard and wrinkled? <b>I</b> never <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> grow old. One only needs {{strength}} of mind to keep young indefinitely." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We started class, {{and in the}} Groundlings curriculum, one of {{the first}} {{exercises}} you do is the cliched 'trust' game. I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{then put}} my fortune to the test, to {{win or lose}} it all. It was not a moment for petty economies. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> go {{regardless}} of expense: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dickory," [...] said she, [...] "you {{said that}} exactly as you spoke {{when you told}} me that if <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> drop into the darkness, you would be there." ...|$|E
60|$|HYPATIA. I {{like talking}} to you. <b>I</b> can <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> go with you. I can say things to you I cant say to other people.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorry! I {{expect you}} don't approve, but I felt <b>I</b> must <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> go. When people {{make me think}} about that confounded lagoon I get savage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{your place}} <b>I</b> should <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> be tempted," [...] says he. [...] "It's an elegant wine, and ten minutes {{more or less}} is no great matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. I {{walked down}} the street, hoping for a miracle. Then I saw your key under the scraper. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> in and waited.--Jane, how {{wonderful}} you are!" ...|$|E
60|$|TANNER. [gloomily] No. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> in for it; so I suppose I {{must face}} it. [He turns {{away to the}} bookcase, and stands there, moodily {{studying}} the titles of the volumes].|$|E
6000|$|... "It's----But I am {{glad for}} you. Will you believe that? And perhaps you {{understand}} how I felt, now. I'm very sorry <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> go. I hope you will----Oh, please go now." ...|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT. If I {{really thought}} that, Miss Reilly, I should--well, <b>I</b> should <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> feel that charm of which I spoke just now more deeply than I--than I-- ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, I know it isn't fair to him, but I lose my head. I can't {{always be}} refined. Sometimes I can't help {{breaking}} out. I feel <b>I</b> must <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> go.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it comes}} into the market, I may bid for {{it as well as}} another," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> down to have any {{dealings}} with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know exactly}} what to say, so <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> off with a little philosophy: 'Well, you see, it didn't pay, exactly,' 'Oh no,' he said, sadly enough, and he went out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You bet. But Dad, I--I {{want to take}} Lucy {{away from}} Marco," [...] replied Pan hesitatingly. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> think, I'm worried. She's only a kid, and she might be scared or driven." ...|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. I am not damning him. I am damning {{myself for}} {{being such a}} fool. [Rising]. How could <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> be taken in so? [She begins prowling to and fro, her bloom gone, looking curiously older and harder].|$|E
6000|$|... "If He does, {{it makes}} it all the worse. I never heeded; I thought it all a bore. <b>I</b> never <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> think what it all meant. I've thrown it all away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the one," [...] said Mrs. Phillips. [...] "I {{little thought}} <b>I</b> was <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> in {{for being the}} wife of a big pot when Bob Phillips came along in 'is miner's jacket." ...|$|R
6000|$|Breckenridge smiled feebly. [...] "The fact is, I {{have never}} {{travelled}} on a locomotive before, and when I {{took on the}} contract I didn't quite know all <b>I</b> was <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> in for," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't tell. I got it {{over the}} 'phone. I ran over here. I knew where the key was. I've been here before--afternoons--dancing.... <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> in.... But when they--they came I got frightened and hid in the closet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father is}} nothing to me,--not with {{reference}} to what young man <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> be called 'Maryanne' by. And going on as he is going on, I don't suppose that he'll long be much to me in any way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And to {{this day}} I {{remember}} the very words: 'I ask you because, you see, my daughter and my son-in-law don't believe {{me to be a}} good judge of men. They think that <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> be guided too much by mere sentiment.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now you," [...] he told Miss Trevor. [...] "I {{love you}} too, but I know you'll be going away before long, so <b>I</b> don't <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> love you as much--quite--as Stephen {{and the rock}} people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From his {{saying to}} himself: 'This is Flossie's {{idea of a}} party. This {{is the sort of}} thing that, if I marry her, <b>I</b> am <b>letting</b> <b>myself</b> in for.' If he hasn't broken off the {{engagement}} already, we may be in time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I would. But <b>I</b> don't <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> {{think about}} it, Dave. This work {{has got to}} be done, and I mean to do my full share of it. I reckon {{everybody}} has to do things he don't just like in this life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> out, {{it would}} look like unbecoming {{pressing}} of myself, considering what I am; but if you think I ought, I will say more. I have become so much used to writing letters under constraint, that I know I am very dry.' ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know that}} it does. I'm {{a bit of a}} fatalist, and my theory is that when my time comes nothing can help me, but at {{the bottom of my heart}} I can't resist the {{conviction}} that I shan't die till <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know I want {{self-control}} when <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> be so {{engrossed in}} it as to neglect other things,' said Anne; 'and I hope I do manage now not to shew more favour to the girls I like best, than to the others; but in what other way do you mean, Mamma?' ...|$|E
60|$|So we lugged him in, and Jeeves {{put him to}} bed, and I lit a {{cigarette}} and sat down to think the thing over. I had a kind of foreboding. It seemed to me that <b>I</b> had <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> in for something pretty rocky.|$|R
60|$|Yet in {{a moment}} of {{insanity}} <b>I</b> have <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> in for it and here I am. There is no hope, no outlet now till the first of September when my visit is to terminate. Either that or death. I do not greatly care which.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} it is. Believe this, <b>I</b> cannot <b>let</b> <b>myself</b> lose you. <b>I</b> must have you always with me. This very evening I {{do not like}} to let you go. There is only one cure for this anxiety, dearest--you must be my wife." ...|$|R
