25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> to use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{spent his}} senior year shovelling coal for an Illinois power company. His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour {{for the rest of your}} life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> what you want to do – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E
2500|$|October – On October 25, the Mormons and Gays website was {{revised and}} moved to mormonandgay.lds.org where it states, [...] "If you {{experience}} same-sex attraction, you may choose to use a sexual orientation label to describe yourself. ... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> to... openly identify as gay, you should be supported." [...] The website says that [...] "sexual desires can be ... changeable" [...] and [...] "shifts in sexuality can and do occur for some individuals", but notes that therapy focusing on [...] "a change in sexual orientation" [...] is [...] "unethical".|$|E

2500|$|Vanguard {{journalist}} Ochereome Nnanna wrote positively of the book, [...] "The simple impression I get is {{that the}} man is a very imaginative, straightforward, practical person; the ultimate Mr. Big Shot. He will be your friend if you come to him with genuine friendship, but he will give you a fight of your life <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> to fight. That is my kind of person." [...] Fashion designer Emilia Wickstead told the Financial Times the book inspired her at a young age to become an entrepreneur. Real Estate Weekly wrote, [...] "Think Big And Kick Ass is the title of one of Trump's books and the icon of everything Trump." [...] London Review of Books wrote that the work was a way to capitalize on the aspirations of consumers. The Washington Free Beacon rated the work's cover as the second best of all of Trump's book covers, and characterized the book as exemplifying [...] "The Trumpean Ideal".|$|E
60|$|UNDERSHAFT. Well you see, my dear boy, {{when you}} are {{organizing}} civilization {{you have to make}} up your mind whether trouble and anxiety are good things or not. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> that they are, then, I take it, you simply don't organize civilization; and there you are, with trouble and anxiety enough to make us all angels! But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> the other way, you may as well go through with it. However, Stephen, our characters are safe here. A sufficient dose of anxiety is always provided by the fact that we may be blown to smithereens at any moment.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{shall be}} disappointed <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> against me; but not more violently so, {{if you do}} it next week than {{if you do it}} now. But I do hope that you will not decide against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was here}} last season, with two gentlemen from New York," [...] {{explained}} the hunter. [...] "I built that shack fer 'em. You {{can use it}} until you put up something better---that is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> to stay here." ...|$|E
