Othman also makes references to some key important political meetings which took place among the Malay community in Singapore the politicians in Singapore to express their grievances. Accounts from the meetings prove that the Malays in Singapore had no major grievances and that UMNO’s Secretary-General Syed Ja’afar was responsible for instigating them. Some of the matters brought up by the Malay community included infrastructural issues that Malay schools faced and these issues were contrary to what the UMNO and Utusan Melayu had portrayed.|$|E

25|$|Through {{his wife}} Eleanor, he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> much about Ireland and {{especially}} Northern Ireland. She {{came from the}} Protestant plantation community of Ulster, originating largely in south-western Scotland. Presumably because of this knowledge, Davis was in 1985 induced by Sir David Wills into a project in historical education, to be financed by the Wills Trust, to encourage better understanding between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and presumably between Catholics and Protestants in the North. Davis recruited teachers, school inspectors and academics to serve on a committee to frame a curriculum of Irish history which would be acceptable to schools in both North and South. The committee oversaw {{the writing of the}} Questions in Irish History series of history books. The Teaching of History Trust has continued to work long afterwards, sponsored by Longman. The first volumes of the series are dedicated to Ralph Davis' memory. He was still actively working for peace in Northern Ireland when he died.|$|E

The Academy Group focused on offender profiling, which shaped the main Millennium Group characters of Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn).

500|$|Winfield Scott Hancock (February 14, 1824 – February 9, 1886) was {{a career}} U.S. Army officer and the Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 1880.

Known to his Army colleagues as [...] "Hancock the Superb", he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. One military historian wrote, [...] "No other Union general at Gettysburg dominated men by the sheer force of their presence more completely than Hancock." [...] As another wrote, [...] "his tactical skill had won him the quick admiration of adversaries who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him as the 'Thunderbolt of the Army of the Potomac'." [...] His military service continued after the Civil War, as Hancock participated in the military Reconstruction of the South and the Army's presence at the Western frontier.|$|E

They added that the opening line [...] "Don't go for second best, baby" [...] transformed the song into a postmodernist anthem. Scholar Sheila Whiteley noted {{in her book}} Women and Popular Music: Sexuality, Identity, and Subjectivity, that Madonna's acknowledgement of the pastiche and of being capable of imitating musical style was interesting to her, but given Madonna's ability to manipulate image, the musical exuberance of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] did not appear surprising. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blond Ambition declared that [...] "the song that most reflected the Madonna everyone <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and be shocked by was 'Express Yourself'."

Together they shared their own fantasy world, Gondal, and, according to Ellen Nussey, in childhood they were [...] "like twins", [...] "inseparable companions" [...] and [...] "in the very closest sympathy which never had any interruption". In 1845 Anne took Emily to visit some of the places she <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and love in the five years she spent as governess.

On 14 December William Creech issued subscription bills for the first Edinburgh edition of Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish dialect, which was published on 17 April 1787. Within a week of this event, Burns had sold his copyright to Creech for 100 guineas. For the edition, Creech commissioned Alexander Nasmyth to paint the oval bust-length portrait now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, which was engraved to provide a frontispiece for the book. Nasmyth <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Burns and his fresh and appealing image has become the basis for almost all subsequent representations of the poet. In Edinburgh, he was received as an equal by the city's men of letters—including Dugald Stewart, Robertson, Blair and others—and was a guest at aristocratic gatherings, where he bore himself with unaffected dignity. Here he encountered, and made a lasting impression on, the 16-year-old Walter Scott, who described him later with great admiration: ...|$|E

On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacks her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, 1936, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night, [...] "I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, 'Kichi, you wore that kimono just to please one of your favorite customers.

2500|$|On 19 November, Dyer {{was called}} {{to appear before the}} Commission.

He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, [...] "I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself." [...] Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of [...] "rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies.
