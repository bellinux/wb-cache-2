500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E
2500|$|I {{started off}} with 13 bombs and I had got rid of 11 of them. Despite {{what was going on}} all around me <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> doing my job to worry about fear...Of the two bombs left, one had a broken safety fuse. So we joined them {{together}} and placed them on a small single-engined plane ...the small plane was blown to bits! ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 1953 season, Koback played amateur {{baseball}} on pitcher Spec Shea's traveling team. After {{returning to}} his home-town from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Kocack {{was asked if he}} felt any homesickness during the season, to which he replied, [...] "Homesick? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> and too excited to be homesick". While in Hartford for the off-season, Koback was the guest of honor at a Hartford Public High School sports rally. He gave a speech to local fire fighters, which was received positively according to The Hartford Courant. In mid-January 1954, the Pittsburgh Pirates held a workout for incoming rookies and younger players, in which Koback took part. The 1954 season would be the last year he would be protected by the Bonus Rule. Before the start of the season, United Press International stated that Koback and his teammate Vic Janowicz were a problem for the Pirates because [...] "neither [...] ready for full-time duty".|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw, that's all right," [...] {{he said in}} mock-lordly fashion. [...] "Roy Blanchard can come. I'll let 'm. All {{that was}} a long time ago. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>'m</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to fool with such things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not much}} of a visitor, Brother McMurdo," [...] he said at last. [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> over the folk that visit me. But I thought I'd stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. I will go at once--that is, {{as soon as}} I can. I can't to-day, nor yet to-morrow. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> here." [...] He waved a hand {{towards the}} inner room, whence {{proceeded}} the click-click of blades, the quick moving of feet, {{and the voice of}} the instructor, Le Duc.|$|R
60|$|We did {{not talk}} much in the cab. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with my {{thoughts}} to volunteer remarks, and White, apparently, had meditations of his own to occupy him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, talking will do him no harm. I {{will come}} with you, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> this morning, when I went my rounds, to have any {{conversation}} with him except as to his wound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{meet you}} again, Miss Carrington, and am sorry I missed you this afternoon. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> giving my cousin good advice--it's a {{privilege}} I have enjoyed from childhood--to recognize you at first." ...|$|E

"All right, I will gladly do what I can to {{help you}} out with that exposition, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to give {{anything}} but my good wishes.

6000|$|... "Certainly. If you {{had made}} Venice {{sufficiently}} pleasant to him, {{he would not}} wish to leave. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to see about such things, and I left it to you to entertain him. As he is {{in such a hurry}} to get away again, it is evident that you have not succeeded in doing so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} ought to have skated up to the camp and {{inspected}} things," [...] observed Snap. [...] "But <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Rudden!' exclaimed Arthurine. 'Why, I only {{sent her}} word that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> {{to go through}} her {{accounts}} to-day, {{and asked her to}} come to-morrow. That isn't against the laws of the Medes and Persians, is it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'After that I didn't {{hear any}} more [...] "Poor chap" [...] talk.... Me? I never worried about killing my man. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> figurin' how a British jury might regard the proposition. I guess Lundie {{felt that way}} too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Worried? About a Welse? Who? Me? Not on your life. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> tellin' Crater Lake what I {{thought of}} it. I don't like the water. I told you so. And it's always playin' me scurvy--not that I'm afraid of it, though." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I shall {{give her}} notice {{to go as}} soon as the New Year festivities are over,” said the Baroness; “till then <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to manage without her.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean to <b>be</b> killed if <b>I</b> {{can help}} it," [...] Lisle said; [...] "but if <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> buried {{as one of}} the sepoys. The {{officers}} will all believe that I have gone home and, though they may wonder a little that I never write to them, they will think it <b>is</b> because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy.</b> It will <b>be</b> a long time, indeed, before any of my friends write to ask about me; and then it will <b>be</b> supposed that <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> accidentally killed or drowned.|$|R
60|$|Now I got a {{great many}} letters in answer to these Post-Prandials as they {{originally}} came out--some of them, strange to say, not wholly complimentary. As a rule, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> a man to answer letters: and I take this opportunity of apologising to correspondents who write to tell me <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a knave or a fool, for not having acknowledged direct their courteous communications. But this friendly criticism seems {{to call for a}} reply, because it involves a question of principle which I have often noted in all discussions of Utopias and Millennia.|$|R
6000|$|... "You wheedling gypsy! I'll {{teach you}} {{with all my}} heart, for it is pretty work, and I often wonder ladies don't keep it up.

6000|$|... "Snug in the Thames, I reckon," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "Soon {{after the storm}} came {{on one of the}} sailors pretended he saw the lights of recall on the admiral's ship; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to look that way, I had enough to do to look after the safety of the ship.

6000|$|The girl {{laughed a}} trifle maliciously, and yet {{with a certain}} enjoyment. [...] "Oh, yes. One day, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> for anything, the people from Bonaventure drove over, and wanted to take you back. I don't know why, but the way Haldane's elder {{daughter}} looked about the place just got my back up. 'You can't have him. This is where he belongs,' I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{got some}} English tobacco at Madras," [...] Dick said, not hesitating for once at telling an untruth. [...] "We sold {{most of it}} to the Feringhee soldiers, on our way up, but I think I have got a little of it still left somewhere in the pack. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to look for it now, and we shall soon be going to show our goods to the officers' wives; but if you can come here at nine o'clock, I may have looked it out for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before young Greenhill {{was finally}} {{discharged}} {{one or two}} witnesses were again examined, chief among these being the foreman of the glassworks. He had turned up at the Rubens Studios at 9 o'clock, and been in business all day. He averred positively {{that he did not}} specially notice any suspicious-looking individual crossing the hall that day. 'But,' he remarked with a smile, 'I don't sit and watch every one who goes up and downstairs. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> for that. The street door is always left open; any one can walk in, up or down, who knows the way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> {{to call on}} {{him since}} <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> in town. Pardon me, Lady Loring, who is that {{beautiful}} creature in the pale yellow dress? Surely I have seen her somewhere before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "you don't seem cheered up much by word from your friends. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> {{looking at them}} to rightly catch {{everything}} they said, but I know {{they told me they}} were going to London in the Glanford. This I remembered, because it struck me what a jolly piece of good luck it all was for Captain Guy." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{three months}} after taking over the {{practice}} I was kept very closely at work, and saw little of my friend Sherlock Holmes, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to visit Baker Street, and he seldom went anywhere himself save upon professional business. I was surprised, therefore, when, one morning in June, as I sat reading the British Medical Journal after breakfast, I heard a ring at the bell, followed by the high, somewhat strident tones of my old companion's voice.|$|E
60|$|I {{think she}} said several things, but if {{so they are}} gone from my memory. I woke {{and did not know}} I had been dreaming. She was gone. I {{wondered}} how she could go without my knowing it, but I did not spend any thought upon that, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> thinking of how vivid and real was the dream that we had lost her and how unspeakably blessed it was to find that it was not true and that she was still ours and with us.|$|E
60|$|Georgy and Catherine {{send their}} best love, and I send mine. Pray {{write to me}} again some day, and <b>I</b> can't <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to <b>be</b> happy {{in the sight of}} your {{familiar}} hand, associated in my mind with so much that I love and honour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there you}} <b>are,</b> lad! <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> {{to think of}} you, {{and it will be}} another day or two before we settle down to regular work. However, I will {{introduce}} you to {{one or two of the}} midshipmen, and they will make you free of the ship." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to {{pay much}} {{attention}} to the narrative or to notice a rattle of wheels, and I looked up only when a wagon was drawn up beside the slough. A smooth-shaven man, with something familiar about his face, sat on the driving-seat smiling down at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "A natural question," [...] said Le Drieux, after {{a moment}} of hesitation. [...] "I know you well by reputation, Mr. Merrick, and believe I am {{justified}} in speaking frankly to you and your niece, provided you regard my statements as strictly confidential. A year ago I received notice from my friend in Austria that the young man had gone to America and he was anxious I should meet him. At the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with my own affairs to look him up, but I recently came to California for a rest, and noticed the strong resemblance between the boy, A. Jones, and the portrait sent me. So I hunted up this picture and compared the two. In my judgment they are one and the same. What do you think, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> {{in getting}} in canvas {{to note the}} {{progress}} of the ship for the next twenty minutes. It took all four of us to stow the jib, leaving Michael at the wheel the while. And a tremendous job it was, though (I say it in humility) four better men never lay out on a spar, than those who set about the task on this occasion. We got it in, however, but, I need scarcely tell the seaman, it was not [...] "stowed in the skin." [...] Marble insisted on leading the party, and never before had I seen the old fellow work as he did on that day. He had a faculty of incorporating his body and limbs with the wood and ropes, standing, as it might be, on air, working and dragging with his arms and broad shoulders, in a way that appeared to give him just as much command of his entire strength, as another man would possess on the ground.|$|E
60|$|We {{climbed the}} crater-walls, put the horses over {{impossible}} places, rolled stones, and shot wild goats. I {{did not get}} any goats. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> rolling stones. One spot in particular I remember, where we started a stone {{the size of a}} horse. It began the descent easy enough, rolling over, wobbling, and threatening to stop; but in a few minutes it was soaring through the air two hundred feet at a jump. It grew rapidly smaller until it struck a slight slope of volcanic sand, over which it darted like a startled jackrabbit, kicking up behind it a tiny trail of yellow dust. Stone and dust diminished in size, until some of the party said the stone had stopped. That was because they could not see it any longer. It had vanished into the distance beyond their ken. Others saw it rolling farther on--I know I did; and it is my firm conviction that that stone is still rolling.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] was the answer. [...] "He {{was good}} at {{handling}} beasts, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> way <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to worry about him. Must have done it long ago. I made sure he'd lit out to ask for assistance, when I saw the door had swung to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Sir William was a drone to Sir Paul, {{and knew}} nothing of regularity. So here begins the roll-call--by the by, old man, what between bee-hunting and buffaloe humps, and certain other matters, <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to ask your name; for I intend to begin with my rear-guard, well knowing that my man in front <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no idea, sir. I {{only saw}} {{them for a}} moment when I ran into the cabin and cut their bonds. I have only seen the gentlemen {{for a minute or}} two when they joined the {{boarders}} from the Thames under Mr. Turnbull, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> much <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to notice them." ...|$|R
