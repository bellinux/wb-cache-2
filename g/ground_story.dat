500|$|Built {{of stone}} and five million bricks, Oregon's new capitol {{measured}} 275 by 136 feet (84 by 41 m) with a dome of [...] The <b>ground</b> <b>story</b> was of native Oregon sandstone from the Umpqua region. The structure had a square rotunda on the interior that was [...] tall. Also inside was a Senate chamber measuring 75 by 45 feet (23 by 14 m) and a House chamber of 85 by 75 feet (26 by 23 m). On the top floor was the Oregon Supreme Court with a courtroom measuring 54 by 45 feet (16 by 14 m) and the Oregon State Law Library, 75 by 70 feet (23 by 21 m). Also {{on the top floor}} was a viewing gallery for the House. [...] On the exterior were ornamental pilasters and two-story porticos on the east and west ends. The building included a lunch counter. Additionally, the building had mullion-windowed wings. The large copper-clad dome was constructed with an iron and steel framework. This dome rose [...] above the rest of the building and was [...] tall. The building was of Renaissance style with Corinthian columns on the front entrance and was patterned after the United States Capitol. At that time, the capitol faced west toward the Willamette River. The government began using the building in August 1876, before the dome was built. Originally, plans called for towers {{on both sides of the}} dome (a tower on both ends of the building with the dome in the middle), but they were left out to save money. Oregon's second capitol building stood from 1876 to 1935.|$|E
6000|$|At times, with {{a strong}} effort, he would glance at the open door which still seemed to repel his eyes. The house was tall, the {{skylight}} small and dirty, the day blind with fog; and the light that filtered down to the <b>ground</b> <b>story</b> was exceedingly faint, and showed dimly {{on the threshold of}} the shop. And yet, in that strip of doubtful brightness, did there not hang wavering a shadow? ...|$|E
6000|$|... § VI. The proper {{forms of}} this {{superimposition}} of weight on lightness have arisen, {{for the most}} part, from the necessity or desirableness, in many situations, of elevating the inhabited portions of buildings considerably above the ground level, especially those exposed to damp or inundation, and the consequent abandonment of the <b>ground</b> <b>story</b> as unserviceable, or else the surrender of it to public purposes. Thus, in many market and town houses, the <b>ground</b> <b>story</b> is left open as a general place of sheltered resort, and the enclosed apartments raised on pillars. In almost all warm countries the luxury, almost the necessity, of arcades to protect the passengers from the sun, and the desirableness of large space in the rooms above, lead to the same construction. Throughout the Venetian islet group, the houses {{seem to have been}} thus, in the first instance, universally built, all the older palaces appearing to have had the rez de chaussée perfectly open, the upper parts of the palace being sustained on magnificent arches, and the smaller houses sustained in the same manner on wooden piers, still retained in many of the cortiles, and exhibited characteristically throughout the main street of Murano. As ground became more valuable and house-room more scarce, these ground-floors were enclosed with wall veils between the original shafts, and so remain; but the type {{of the structure of the}} entire city is given in the Ducal Palace.|$|E

60|$|A winding stair, strait and narrow, as if {{to remind}} the nuns of their duties of fast and maceration, led down to a lower suite of apartments, which {{occupied}} the <b>ground</b> <b>story</b> of the house. These rooms were even more ruinous than those which he had left; for, having encountered the first fury of the assailants by whom the nunnery had been wasted, the windows had been dashed in, the doors broken down, and even the partitions betwixt the apartments, in some places, destroyed. As he thus stalked from desolation to desolation, and {{began to think of}} returning from so uninteresting a research to the chamber which he had left, he was surprised to hear the low of a cow very close to him. The sound was so unexpected at the time and place, that Roland Graeme started {{as if it had been}} the voice of a lion, and laid his hand on his dagger, while at the same moment the light and lovely form of Catherine Seyton presented itself at the door of the apartment from which the sound had issued.|$|E
60|$|The {{far greater}} {{proportion}} of the building was occupied by the theatre, which filled almost the whole <b>ground</b> <b>story</b> and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper story {{at one end and}} looked upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street; and with this, the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll's predecessor; but even as they opened the door, they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.|$|E
60|$|It {{is taken}} for granted that no human being ever yet gained an idea of any {{building}} from the most artful description of it; but if the reader cares to fancy a wide piazza, or open square, with a church upon the left hand, immense, uninteresting edifices on the right, and an ugly bishop's palace of Renaissance taste behind him, he may figure before him as vastly and magnificently as he pleases the superb Gothic front of the Castello di Corte. This façade {{is the only one}} in Italy that reminds you of the most beautiful building in the world, the Ducal Palace at Venice; and it does this merely by right of its short pillars and deep Gothic arches in the <b>ground</b> <b>story,</b> and the great breadth of wall that rises above them, unbroken by the second line of columns which relieves and lightens this wall in the Venetian palace. It stands at an extremity of the city, upon the edge of the broad fresh-water lagoon, and is of such extent as to include within its walls a whole court-city of theatre, church, stables, playground, course for riding, and several streets. There is a far older edifice adjoining the Castello di Corte, which Guido Bonacolsi began, and which witnessed the bloody end of his line, when Louis Gonzaga surprised and slew his last successor. But the palace itself is all the work of the Gonzagas, and it remains the monument of their kingly state and splendid pride.|$|E

Grounds was also awarded honorary degrees from Wheaton College and Gordon College. He died September 12, 2010, at a nursing facility in Wichita, Kansas. Upon his death, George W.

5000|$|Scherr and Escayg {{wrote the}} game's story. While {{previous}} Uncharted games followed specific historical figures, such as Marco Polo and Henry Avery, The Lost Legacy instead {{focuses on the}} region, and the surrounding philosophy and culture, due to the shorter development team allowing less intensive research. The writers particularly focused on Hinduism and the surrounding mythology when researching for the story. With The Lost Legacy, the team aimed to include the [...] "slightly more fantastical feel" [...] from the first three Uncharted games, which was absent from Uncharted 4 due to the <b>grounded</b> <b>story.</b> Escayg found that the game's smaller scope allows a better opportunity to explore each individual character, and their stories and viewpoints. He also attempted to demonstrate characters' emotional state through gameplay. The story of The Lost Legacy allowed the team to explore gameplay elements scrapped from Uncharted 4.|$|R
