For this purpose we have developed a highly selective Ge–NaI coincidence spectrometer, operating in the underground Laboratory of Monte dei Cappuccini (INAF) in Torino.

Diverse protocols have been already proposed for 14 CO 2 extraction and trapping.

In order to propose a standardized protocol and to avoid the main source of artifacts, we suggest keeping the trapping agent for 14 CO 2 directly into a 20 ml scintillation vial hanging in the degassing bottle. To validate this protocol, we plotted the radioactivity (<b>disintegration</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> due to 14 CO 2 recovered after acidification of 42 seawater samples supplemended with sodium (14 C) -bicarbonate (NaH 14 CO 3) against the actual radioactivity of the corresponding added bicarbonate solutions.

Seedlings were grown under controlled environment. Seedlings were harvested 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after treatment (HAT) and sectioned into root, shoot/stalk and leaves. ^ Absorption of root applied radioactivity was 135. 6 (120 HAT) and 230 (96 HAT) <b>disintegration</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (dpm) mg− 1 fresh weight in velvetleaf and yellow foxtail, respectively. The translocation of root absorbed 14 C-isoxaflutole to shoot was 83. 6 % (120 HAT) in velvetleaf and 93 % (72 HAT) in yellow foxtail. When applied to the yellow foxtail foliage, absorption was maximum 24 HAT and translocation of 14 C-isoxaflutole from treated leaf to other plant parts reached its peak at 48 HAT (33. 4 %). Based on Rf values, applied radioactivity was partitioned into isoxaflutole (Rf = 0. 91), diketonitrile metabolite (Rf = 0. 62), unknown metabolite ‘A’ (Rf = 0. 49) and benzoic acid (Rf = 0. 29). Yellow foxtail had more benzoic acid content (21. 08 %) than the benzoic acid content (12. 85 %) in velvetleaf. The active herbicide fraction (total of diketonitrile metabolite and unknown metabolite ‘A’) was more in velvetleaf (80. 2 %) than in yellow foxtail (69. 9 %). The presence of high level of active herbicide fraction in velvetleaf may explain its susceptibility to isoxaflutole. ^ Absorption of root applied 14 C-isoxaflutole was more in Pioneer- 3751 corn hybrid (52. 1 dpm mg− 1 fresh weight in 24 h) than in Pioneer- 3394 corn hybrid (37. 5 dpm mg− 1 fresh weight 24 h). However, absorption of 14 C-isoxaflutole and its subsequent translocation from root to shoot reached its peak 96 HAT in two corn hybrids. Both corn hybrids were equally tolerant to isoxaflutole. Benzoic acid contents in the P- 3394 and P- 3751 (24. 57 and 25. 57 %, respectively) were similar, while the active herbicide fraction was also similar (63. 7 % and 67. 8 %) in P- 3394 and P- 3751. ...|$|R

40|$|Frequently as {{a result}} of {{experiments}} in which two isotopes are used one is left with a sequence of samples, the ratio of labeling in each sample, and the problem of analyzing the ratios. Suppose that the experiments are designed so that one expects uniform labeling except for one or two special groups of samples. The problem, then, is to find these groups. Because of the variability in the count rate from sample to sample, the variance of the ratios differs from sample to sample making statistical analysis difficult. Furthermore, there is significant serial correlation in the sample <b>disintegrations</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> for each of the isotopes. We have found that the serial correlation in the labeling ratio is small and of questionable significance in controls but becomes significant when there is a subsequence of samples in which the labeling ratio differs from that in the remainder of the gel.

Alterations in DNA methylation can lead to genomic instability and altered gene transcription. Genomic DNAmethylation levels have been inversely associated with age, suggesting that factors throughout life {{may be associated with}} declines in DNAmethylation. Using information from a multiethnic New York City birth cohort (born between 1959 and 1963), we examined whether genomic DNA methylation, measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, was associated with smoking exposure and other epidemiologic risk factors across the life course. Information on prenatal and childhood exposures was collected prospectively through 1971, and information on adult exposures and blood specimens were collected in adulthood from 2001 to 2007. Methylation levels of leukocyte DNA were determined using a [3 H]-methyl acceptance assay where higher values of <b>disintegrations</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> per micro-gram DNA indicate less DNA methylation. Genomic methylation of leukocyte DNA differed by ethnicity (66 % of Blacks, 48 % of Whites, and 29 % of Hispanics were above the median level of <b>disintegrations</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> per microgram DNA; P = 0. 03).

The individual PBPs from a known number of bacteria radiolabeled with [3 H]benzylpenicillin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
