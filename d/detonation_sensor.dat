40|$|Deflagration to {{detonation}} transition (DDT) is a {{very important}} research project for both national defense and energy industry. It is the process where a subsonic deflagration transits into a supersonic detonation, which generates shock waves. In the past years, the simulations of DDT were limited in a small domain, usually sev- eral cubic centimeters. If we want to simulate it in a larger space without improving the numerical method, we need to use the more powerful computer. When the computing resources are limited, we must improve the numerical method to achieve the big-domain simulating. There are two technical paths, one is the adaptive mesh refinement and the other is the large eddy simulation. Both of them are difficult to realize. In this project, we focus on the usage of the LES method for simulating DDT. The main challenge in this work is to develop a reliable model. In this research, a new approach for LES modelling was developed. It is a fully compressible variant of the artificial thickened flame model, which adopts the opt- ing functions on the reference flame thickness. This method ensures that the flame is not over-thickened in deflagration or detonation. To control the options on the flame thickness, a <b>detonation</b> <b>sensor</b> is utilized during the computing. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detonation}} (knocking) {{in the internal}} combuction engines, especially in the Otto (petrol) engine, that makes some damages, low fuel economy and performance. Until now, the detonation problem has not been solved completely. In this paper, the problem had been studied to discover the new method, how to reject detonation without any changes of engine structure, easy to install and can be activate immediately. The detonation phenomenon have been explained by three theory, that are auto ignition theory, detonation theory and flame vibration, that make noise, detonation (knocking) and damages of some equipments. The detonation can be cause by many things, such as high compression ratio, low grade of fuel, bad combustion camber, low turbulence, large spark advance (timing). For the conventional ignition system, a governor and a vacuum advancer control the ignition timing. It is reliable mechanism, but can not work properly at all conditions. Most of them make detonation occur at low speed and low endurance of the contact breaker. The last technology, electronically device with <b>detonation</b> <b>sensor</b> replace the conventional system. Combination ignition system, the new system, integration of conventional and electronically system, can control the detonation, by making correction of the spark advance (ignition timing) automatically in all condition of speed and load (throttle), using fuzzy logic reasoning (calculation) in the microcontroller. This research also tries to detect detonation by using the vibration pattern {{with the hope of}} detonation detection by this method will be more stable and reliable. Detonation detection with machine vibration recordings was be done by measuring its intensity, but this often happens is unstable. The result of using the new (combination) ignition system in the engine is the rejected detonation, improving performance and efficiency. Another result, the motor vibration pattern can be recorded and the vibration pattern of detonation occurs at high frequency. It has a certain pattern in synch with his ignition. For the further the research will use the Neuro-Fuzzy Adaptive Control for more applicable in the engine...|$|E
40|$|Demands to meet {{legislative}} {{exhaust emission}} levels, provide fuel economy, and improve engine quality {{have been the}} major driving forces for engine control advancement [1]. Benefits of engine control advancement include improved energy efficiency, reduced greenhouse effects and noxious gas emissions, oil change frequencies, and machinery maintenance. Unfortunately these benefits push the limits of engine detonation (often referred to as engine 2 ̆ 2 knock 2 ̆ 2). The electronic gas engine control system can take measures to avoid the damaging effects of detonation while retaining the benefits of remaining close to detonation boundaries [2]. Leading edge software is being designed and researched to monitor and prevent the occurrence of unwanted engine detonation. The purpose {{of this research is}} to design an engine detonation simulator {{that can be used to}} detect undesirable detonation that might occur in gas engines. In this thesis, a large Gas Engine Detonation Simulator hardware and software is designed, implemented, and tested. A program was developed to generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal whose duty cycle can be changed rapidly via a look-up table. A low-pass filter to act as a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) that converts the PWM signal to a sinusoidal signal was also designed. The generated sinusoid signal emulates the large gas engine <b>detonation</b> <b>sensor</b> feedback signals. The sinusoidal signal was designed to have characteristics that are determined by user input and specific large gas engine needs. The simulator can be easily adjusted to generate different frequencies with adjustable amplitude, and adjustable time lengths or 2 ̆ 2 windows. 2 ̆ 2 Experiments were performed with the Detonation Simulator and a Large Gas Engine Electronic Control Module (ECM). The goal of the experiments was to verify that the simulator correctly interpreted signals from the ECM interface and generated the simulated detonation signals accordingly. Research revealed that the Simulator successfully generated detonation signals that were synchronized with the four-stroke cycle of the internal combustion large gas engine. The simulator was also able to interpret user input to vary the generated signals intensity (amplitude) and 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 window 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 length times at different engine test speeds...|$|E
50|$|Block II {{spacecraft}} were 3-axis stabilized, {{with ground}} pointing using reaction wheels. Two solar arrays supplied 710 watts of power, while S band communications {{were used for}} control and telemetry. A UHF channel was use for cross-links between spacecraft. A hydrazine propulsion system was used for orbital correction. The payload included two L band navigation signals at 1575.42 MHz (L1) and 1227.60 MHz (L2). Each spacecraft carried 2 rubidium and 2 cesium clocks, as well as nuclear <b>detonation</b> detection <b>sensors,</b> leading to a mass of 1660 kg.|$|R

Typically, some form of pendulum arrangement, spring-loaded [...] "trembler" [...] or mercury switch is used to detect this.|$|R
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen <b>sensor,</b> <b>detonation</b> via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this thesis is to generate compact, lightweight, low-energy, reversible, and dynamic burrowing systems for use in subsea applications such as anchoring, oil recovery, underwater cable installation, mine <b>detonation,</b> and <b>sensor</b> placement. As many organisms have evolved to embed themselves within undersea substrates, unsurprisingly, nature has provided a viable basis for a novel, efficient burrowing technology. This work centers around understanding the burrowing mechanisms of Ensis directus, the Atlantic razor clam, which was discovered to burrow by using motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding substrate. Moving through fluidized, rather than static, soil reduces drag forces to a level within the animal's strength capabilities and results in burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth, rather than depth squared. As Ensis contracts its valves, the resulting stress imbalance within the soil creates a failure surface around the clam, within which particles can freely move and fluidize, and outside of which the soil remains static. Theoretical derivations and experimental results demonstrate that the location of the failure surface can be predicted using only two parameters commonly measured in geotechnical surveys: coefficient of lateral earth pressure and friction angle. To explore the feasibility of transferring localized fluidization burrowing into engineering applications, RoboClam, a robot that burrows using the same mechanisms as Ensis, was designed, constructed, and tested. Experimental data show the machine is able to match the animal's linear burrowing energy versus depth relationship and achieve localized fluidization in both granular and cohesive substrates. by Amos Greene Winter, V.

40|$|The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty {{requires}} {{the ability to}} detect low-yield (less than 150 kton) nuclear events. This kind of monitoring can only be done seismically on a regional scale (within 2000 km). At this level, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between low-yield nuclear events and non-nuclear events of similar magnitude. In order to confidently identify a nuclear event, a more detailed understanding of nuclear seismic sources is needed. In particular, {{it is important to know}} the effects of local geology on the seismic signal. This study focuses on P-wave velocity in heterogeneous granitoid. The Source Physics Experiment (SPE) is currently performing low-yield tests with chemical explosives at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). The exact test site was chosen to be in the Climax Stock, a cretaceous granodiorite and quartz-monzonite pluton located in Area 15 of the NNSS. It has been used in the past for the Hard Hat and Pile Driver nuclear tests, which provided legacy data that can be used to simulate wave propagation. The Climax Stock was originally chosen as the site of the SPE partly because of its assumed homogeneity. It has since been discovered that the area of the stock where the SPE tests are being performed contains a perched water table. In addition, the stock is known to contain an extensive network of faults, joints, and fractures, but the exact effect of these structural features on seismic wave velocity is not fully understood. The SPE tests are designed to seismically capture the explosion phenomena from the near- to the far-field transition of the seismic waveform. In the first SPE experiment, 100 kg of chemical explosives were set off at a depth of 55 m. The blast was recorded with an array of sensors and diagnostics, including accelerometers, geophones, rotational sensors, short-period and broadband seismic sensors, Continuous Reflectometry for Radius vs. Time Experiment, Time of Arrival, Velocity of <b>Detonation,</b> and infrasound <b>sensors.</b> The focus of this study is two-fold: (1) the geophone array that was focused over the SPE shot and (2) a high-resolution seismic profile that was recently acquired at the field site. The geophone array was placed radially around the SPE shot in five directions with 100 m spacing and out to a distance of 2 km. The high-resolution profile was about 475 m in length with station and shot spacing of 5 m using a 7000 lb mini-vibe as a source. In both data sets, the first arrivals will be used to develop velocity models. For the geophone array, 1 -D P-wave velocity models will be developed to determine an average apparent velocity of the Climax Stock. The high-resolution data will be used to develop a 2 -D P-wave velocity model along the seismic profile. This is in an effort to elucidate the water table in more detail and provide additional information on the near-surface structure. These results will be used in the overall modeling effort to fully characterize the test bed and develop a physics-based model to simulate seismic energy from the SPE events...|$|R
