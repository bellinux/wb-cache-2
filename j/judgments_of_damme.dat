40|$|In the Critique of the Power <b>of</b> <b>Judgment,</b> Kant {{develops}} a rigorous formulation <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgments,</b> {{in which he}} makes a sharp distinction between <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> taste and <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the agreeable (both of which are, I claim, types <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgments)</b> if only to dismiss <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the agreeable as worthy objects of study. Kant is primarily concerned with <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> taste, the main example of which is judging something to be beautiful (whether it be {{a work of art}} or a natural object). He asserts that such judgments are subjective, universal, necessary, disinterested, and do not presuppose a purpose. The other type <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgment</b> are <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the agreeable, “which are the kind <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> expressed by saying simply that one likes something or finds it pleasing. ” These are <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> what, in Kant’s words, please “the senses in sensation” as opposed to pleasing ourcognition in reflection...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHumans use the {{direction}} of eye gaze and facial identity to make important social judgments. We carried out the first measurements of spatial frequency (SF) tuning for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> eye gaze, and compared SF tuning for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> facial identity and eye gaze. In Experiment 1, participants discriminated between leftward and rightward shifts of gaze, or between two male faces or two female faces. Faces were masked with visual noise that blocked one of 10 SF bands. For each task and masking SF, we measured contrast thresholds for human observers, and used an ideal observer to measure the amount of visual information available to perform the task. As in previous research, low to mid SFs were most important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> facial identity. Mid to high SFs were most important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> eye gaze, and the highest SF important for these judgments was higher than that for identity. In Experiment 2, participants discriminated horizontal and vertical shifts of gaze. The highest SF important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> gaze did not differ between the horizontal and vertical axes. However, SFs above and below this value were more important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> vertical shifts of gaze than for horizontal shifts of gaze. These {{results suggest that the}} visual system relies on higher SFs for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> eye gaze than for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> facial identity, and that SF tuning is broader for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> vertical shifts of gaze than for horizontal shifts of gaze...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{overlooked}} dimension <b>of</b> time <b>judgments,</b> namely subjective <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> {{the speed of}} time passage: how fast time is judged as passing. It has examined how people make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage and what factors influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. Chapter 2 first unravels the cognitive processes that underlie <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage: the more {{attention is paid to}} non-temporal information, the faster time is judged as passing; it also disentangles <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage from duration judgments (i. e., judgments about how long time lasted), demonstrating that it is not reliable to infer <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage from duration judgments. Chapter 3 builds upon the previous chapter and examines two factors: presentation speed of stimuli and comparison, which might interfere with the role of attentional processes in judging the speed of time passage. It shows that both presentation speed of stimuli and comparison could influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage, but they could not replace the role of attentional processes: when either presentation speed of stimuli or comparison is missing, people can always rely on attentional processes to make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. Chapter 4 examines the influence of unpredictability on people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. It shows that time is judged as passing faster when people are in both temporal unpredictable situations where they cannot predict when the events would happen, and in content unpredictable situations where they cannot predict what events would happen next. Chapter 5 examines the influence of spatial directions <b>of</b> movements on <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. It shows the effect that people judge time as passing faster for the left-to-right movements than the right-to-left movements. This effect was also replicated with Farsi speakers. Overall, the work in this thesis shows original empirical evidence about how people make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage; specifically, it discloses the underlying mechanism <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage (i. e., attentional processes) as well as the factors that influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage such as presentation speed of stimuli, comparison, unpredictability and spatial directions of movements...|$|R
