40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and tolerance}} of repeated oral doses of <b>furafylline</b> were investigated in normal volunteers. In accord with predictions from single dose studies, steady state was achieved {{on the first}} day following the administration of 90 mg and maintained by subsequent daily doses of 30 mg. When corrected for body weight {{there were no significant differences}} in minimum and maximum plateau levels of <b>furafylline</b> between males (1. 2 - 2. 0 micrograms ml- 1; mean body weight 67. 2 kg) and females (1. 6 - 2. 6 micrograms ml- 1; mean body weight 54. 9 kg). The half-life of elimination was less when the plasma concentration was lower than 600 ng ml- 1 than during the stationary phase of treatment. Despite constant plasma levels the repeated administration of <b>furafylline</b> appeared to be associated with the onset of adverse xanthine-like side effects, a finding which was subsequently traced to the presence of, and possible synergism with, accumulating serum levels of caffeine in those volunteers drinking caffeine containing beverages. Subsequent studies showed that a single dose (90 mg) of <b>furafylline</b> results in a rapid accumulation of caffeine given orally (100 mg twice daily) and that this is accompanied by an elimination half-life of some 50 h and an abrupt decrease in metabolite levels. The furafylline-induced accumulation of caffeine was not influenced by the smoking habits of the subjects, implying that the metabolite pathway blocked by <b>furafylline</b> is the demethylation of caffeine in position 3, an implication confirmed by the reduced formation of paraxanthine. This demonstration of an unacceptable level of adverse side effects resulting from a potent inhibiting effect of <b>furafylline</b> on the metabolism of a normal dietary constituent has obvious implications in the interpretation of drug-induced toxicity...|$|E

Validation parameters of an HPLC-based method to analyse EROD and MROD activities are also described. Eadie-Hofstee plot analysis demonstrated a biphasic kinetic of EROD, indicating {{that at least}} two forms of cytochrome P 450 are involved in this reaction. MROD followed monophasic kinetic, suggesting that a single enzyme, or enzymes with similar affinities, is responsible for the reaction. Inhibitory effects of α-naphthoflavone (ANF), ellipticine and <b>furafylline</b> were studied using microsomes from entire and castrated male pigs. ANF is a known inhibitor of both cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 and 1 A 2 (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2); the presence of ANF in the incubations resulted in the inhibition of both EROD and MROD activities in porcine liver microsomes. EROD activities in porcine liver microsomes were also inhibited by selective CYP 1 A 1 inhibitor ellipticine, but not by CYP 1 A 2 inhibitor <b>furafylline.</b> MROD activities were strongly inhibited by ellipticine and to a much lesser extent by <b>furafylline.</b> Further studies are needed to evaluate substrate specificities of porcine CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 The {{mechanism}} of CYP 1 A 2 (cytochrome P 450 1 A 2) catalyzed metabolism of 8 -alkylxanthines is explored using deuterium isotope effect studies and isotope tracing experiments with an 8 -isopropyl analog (isopropylcyclohexylline, IPC) of the CYP 1 A 2 mechanism-based inactivator <b>furafylline.</b> Desaturation of <b>furafylline</b> to an iminium reactive intermediate {{has been proposed}} to account for formation of both 1 : 1 CYP 1 A 2 -protein adduct and 8 '-carbinol with the majority (80 %) of the oxygen sourced to the medium. Reactive intermediate formation with 8 -ethyl and 8 -isopropyl analogs of <b>furafylline</b> is evident due to H 2 O incorporation into their 8 '-carbinol metabolites (60 % and 43 %, respectively), though enzyme inactivation is virtually eliminated. Additionally, 35 % and 85 %, respectively, of 8 -ethyl and 8 -isopropyl analog metabolism results in side chain desaturation. Competitive intermolecular deuterium isotope effect studies with IPC {{in the presence of}} H 2 18 O suggest that both dual hydrogen atom abstraction and base-catalyzed rearrangement of the reactive intermediate are contributing to olefin metabolite formation, in contrast to the results from similar experiments with the 8 -ethyl compound in which rearrangement of the reactive intermediate appears to be the only {{mechanism of}} side-chain desaturation. Intramolecular isotope effect analysis of IPC side chain desaturation in the presence of H 2 18 O did not clearly differentiate between the two proposed desaturation pathways. Several mechanistic possibilities to explain the experimental results are discussed. Lastly, the effect of reducing equivalent transfer rate on the sequential metabolism of IPC by two different CYP 1 A 2 enzyme sources was investigated using isotope-tracing experiments...|$|E

Mutagenicity was investigated at the HPRT locus in Chinese hamster V 79 cells with (V 79 -NH) or without (V 79 -MZ) endogenous acetyltransferase activity, stably expressing human cytochrome P 450 cDNAs; in NIH/ 3 T 3 control or stably expressing human CYP 1 A 2 cells, in combination with a shuttle vector containing a reporter gene; and in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, by inhibition of cytochrome P 450 enzymes in rat liver S 9 mix. Both the HPRT assay and the Ames test did not show any involvement of CYP 3 A in the activation of 1 -nitropyrene to a mutagenic metabolite. In addition, a clear involvement of CYP 1 A 2 in the activation of the nitroPAH 1 -nitropyrene was demonstrated in both mutation assays using eukaryotic cells. However, no activation of 1 -nitropyrene {{was seen in the}} eukaryotic cell lines when expressing only CYP 1 A 2 (V 79 -MZ 1 A 2) or acetyltransferase (V 79 -NH, 3 T 3 -LNCX).

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} {{oxidative}} metabolism of (S) -mephenytoin and proguanil in vitro {{and to determine}} the involvement of various cytochrome P 450 isoforms. METHODS: The kinetics {{of the formation of}} 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin and cycloguanil in human liver microsomes from 10 liver samples were determined, and inhibition of formation was studied using specific chemical inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies directed towards specific CYP 450 isoforms. Expressed CYP 450 enzymes were used to characterize further CYP isoform contribution in vitro. Livers were genotyped for CYP 2 C 19 using PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by restriction endonuclease digestion. RESULTS: All livers were wildtype with respect to CYP 2 C 19, except HLS# 5 whose genotype was CYP 2 C 19 * 1 /CYP 2 C 19 * 2. The Km, Vmax and CLint values for the formation of 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin from (S) -mephenytoin and the formation of cycloguanil from proguanil ranged from 50. 8 to 51. 6 and 43 - 380 microm, 1. 0 - 13. 9 and 0. 5 - 2. 5 nmol mg- 1 h- 1, and 20. 2 - 273. 8 and 2. 7 - 38. 9 microl h- 1 mg- 1, respectively. There was a significant association between the Vmax values of cycloguanil and 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin formation (rs= 0. 95, P= 0. 0004). Cycloguanil formation was inhibited significantly by omeprazole (CYP 2 C 19 / 3 A), troleandomycin (CYP 3 A), diethyldithiocarbamate (CYP 2 E 1 / 3 A), <b>furafylline</b> (CYP 1 A 2), and (S) -mephenytoin. 4 '-Hydroxymephenytoin formation was inhibited significantly by omeprazole, diethyldithiocarbamate, proguanil, <b>furafylline,</b> diazepam, troleandomycin, and sulphaphenazole (CYP 2 C 9). Human CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 3 A 4 monoclonal antibodies did not inhibit the formation of cycloguanil or 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin, and cycloguanil was formed by expressed CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 19 supersomes. However, only expressed CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 2 C 19 supersomes formed 4 '-hydroxymephenytoin. CONCLUSIONS: The oxidative metabolism of (S) -mephenytoin and proguanil in vitro is catalysed by CYPs 2 C 19 and 1 A 2, with the significant association between Vmax values suggesting that the predominant enzymes involved in both reactions are similar. However the degree of selectively of both drugs for CYP isoforms needs further investigation, particularly the involvement of CYP 3 A 4 in the metabolism of proguanil.

Amitriptyline was shown to be demethylated to nortriptyline by both rat and human microsomes. Inhibition studies using ketoconazole, <b>furafylline,</b> sulfaphenazole, omeprazole and quinidine suggested that CYP 3 A 4 is the isoform responsible for this reaction whereas CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 C 19 and CYP 2 D 6 {{do not seem to}} be involved.

The amounts of the metabolites formed in hepatocytes were assayed in the extracellular medium using the HPLC method. TCDD and rifampicin induced the formation of 4 -hydroxyacetanilide and cyclosporine A metabolites (monohydroxycyclosporine A, dihydroxycyclosporine A, N-desmethylcyclosporine A), respectively. The formation of 4 -hydroxyacetanilide was strongly inhibited by three different concentrations of perazine (10, 25 and 50 �M) reaching 8, 3 and 2 % of the control value, respectively.

However, compared with those from humans, liver microsomes from Bama miniature pigs showed decreased phenacetin O-deethylation, coumarin 7 -hydroxylation, and chlorzoxazone 6 -hydroxylation activities, whereas dextromethorphan O-demethylation activity was increased. Ketoconazole selectively inhibited NOD and 6 beta-OHT activities in microsomes from Bama pigs, and 8 -methoxypsoralen and tranylcypromine inhibited coumarin 7 -hydroxylation in pig microsomes. However, <b>furafylline</b> and quinidine failed to selectively inhibit phenacetin O-deethylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation in microsomes from Bama pigs, whereas chlormethiazole more efficiently inhibited coumarin 7 -hydroxylation activity than chlorzoxazone 6 -hydroxylation in pig microsomes.

Neither ketoconazole (3 A 4 inhibitor) nor <b>furafylline</b> (selective 1 A 2 inhibitor) altered the antimitogenic effects of estradiol on CF growth. In contrast, ellipticine (selective 1 A 1 inhibitor), pyrene (selective 1 B 1 inhibitor), and alpha-naphthoflavone (1 A 1 > 1 A 2 inhibitor) abrogated the antimitogenic effects of estradiol on CF growth. OR 486 (COMT inhibitor) also blocked the antimitogenic effects of estradiol in both the presence and absence of the CYP 450 inducers. ICI 182780 (estrogen receptor antagonist) attenuated the growth inhibitory effects of estradiol, but only at concentrations that inhibit the metabolism of estradiol to hydroxyestradiols (precursors of methoxyestradiols). CFs expressed CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1, isozymes that convert estradiol to hydroxyestradiols. Moreover, CFs metabolized estradiol to hydroxyestradiol, and 2 -hydroxyestradiol to 2 -methoxyestradiol. OR 486 and quercetin (COMT inhibitor) blocked the conversion of 2 -hydroxyestradiol to 2 -methoxyestradiol in CFs.

In human liver microsomes, the formation of promazine 5 -sulphoxide and N-desmethylpromazine was significantly correlated with the level of CYP 1 A 2 and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and acetanilide 4 -hydroxylase activities, as well as with the level of CYP 3 A 4 and cyclosporin A oxidase activity. Moreover, the formation of N-desmethylpromazine was correlated well with S-mephenytoin 4 ′-hydroxylation. <b>Furafylline</b> (a CYP 1 A 2 inhibitor) and ketoconazole (a CYP 3 A 4 inhibitor) significantly decreased the rate of promazine 5 -sulphoxidation, while <b>furafylline</b> and ticlopidine (a CYP 2 C 19 inhibitor) significantly decreased the rate of promazine N-demethylation in human liver microsomes. The cDNA-expressed human CYPs generated different amounts of promazine metabolites, but the rates of CYP isoforms to catalyse promazine metabolism at therapeutic concentration (10 μM) was as follows: 1 A 1 > 2 B 6 > 1 A 2 > 2 C 9 > 3 A 4 > 2 E 1 > 2 A 6 > 2 D 6 > 2 C 19 for 5 -sulphoxidation and 2 C 19 > 2 B 6 > 1 A 1 > 1 A 2 > 2 D 6 > 3 A 4 > 2 C 9 > 2 E 1 > 2 A 6 for N-demethylation. The highest intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) was found for CYP 1 A subfamily, CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 B 6 in the case of 5 – sulphoxidation, and for CYP 2 C 19, CYP 1 A subfamily and CYP 2 B 6 in the case of N-demethylation. In a primary culture of human hepatocytes, TCDD (a CYP 1 A subfamily inducer), as well as rifampicin (mainly a CYP 3 A 4 inducer) induced the formation of promazine 5 -sulphoxide and N-desmethylpromazine. Regarding the relative expression of various CYPs in human liver, the obtained results indicate that CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 3 A 4 are the main isoforms responsible for 5 -sulphoxidation, while CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 C 19 are the basic isoforms that catalyse N-demethylation of promazine in human liver. Of the other isoforms studied, CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 3 A 4 contribute to a lesser degree to promazine 5 -sulphoxidation and N-demethylation, respectively. The role of CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 B 6, CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 2 E 1 in the investigated metabolic pathways of promazine seems negligible...|$|E
40|$|Metabolism of the {{heterocyclic amine}} {{carcinogen}} 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoline (IQ) was evaluated in mice {{with and without}} 40 mg/kg β-naphthoflavone (BNF). Following an oral dose of 40 mg/kg 14 C-IQ, a 24 -h urine sample was collected. Metabolism was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography, and metabolites were identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Three new metabolites were identified as 1, 2 -dihydro- 2 -amino- 5 -hydroxy- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoline (m/z 217, [M + H]+), 1, 2 -dihydro- 2 -amino- 5 -O-glucuronide- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoline (m/z 393, [M + H]+), and 1, 2 -dihydro- 2 -amino- 5, 7 -dihydroxy- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoline (m/z 233, [M + H]+). These metabolites represented 21 % of the total urinary radioactivity recovered. For BNF-treated mice, the abundance of metabolites observed was 5 -O-glucuronide > m/z 217 > m/z 393 > 5 -sulfate > m/z 233 > N-glucuronide > demethyl-IQ > sulfamate. In control mice, metabolite urinary abundance was 5 -O-glucuronide > demethyl-IQ > sulfamate > N-glucuronide > m/z 217 > 5 -sulfate. In liver slices from BNF-treated mice, synthesis of m/z 217 and 5 -O-glucuronide was significantly reduced by ellipticine, a cytochrome P 450 (P 450) inhibitor, whereas sulfamate synthesis was significantly increased and demethyl-IQ was unchanged. Liver microsomes from BNF-treated mice produced m/z 217 and demethyl-IQ, with the former inhibited by ellipticine and <b>furafylline,</b> a selective 1 A 2 inhibitor, and the latter by ellipticine only. Injection (intraperitoneal) of demethyl-IQ into BNF-treated mice resulted in only a 30 % conversion to three metabolites that were not observed in urine from animals receiving IQ. Results from BNF-treated mice showed significant IQ metabolism by hepatic P 450 s. Therefore, differences in metabolism between mice treated with and without BNF may affect IQ tumorigenicity...|$|E
40|$|Differences in {{expression}} of CYP 1 A isoforms (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2) in liver and small intestine of male Wistar rats and their inducibility by 3 -methylcholanthrene {{as well as}} the effect of different CYP 1 A 1 / 1 A 2 expression on caffeine metabolism were investigated. In rat liver, CYP 1 A 2 is the predominant isoform and CYP 1 A 1 protein expression in liver is significantly increased after treatment by 3 -methylcholanthrene. In contrast, only CYP 1 A 1 was detected in control and 3 -methylcholanthrene induced small intestine microsomes. Treatment with 3 -methylcholanthrene (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally daily during 1, 2, 3 or 4 days) demonstrated that liver CYP 1 A 1 is more sensitive for the induction effects than CYP 1 A 2 and also that significant induction of CYP 1 A 1 in rat small intestine only occurred after 3 to 4 days pretreatment. Caffeine metabolism and inhibition studies by <b>furafylline,</b> CYP 1 A 1 antiserum and ketoconazole revealed that the differences in the {{expression of}} CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2 in the two tissues led to significant changes in the contribution of the various isoenzymes involved in the biotransformation of caffeine. Whereas in liver paraxanthine formation was almost exclusively catalyzed by CYP 1 A 2, in rat proximal intestine it was formed by CYP 1 A 1. In addition, other CYP enzymes (most probably CYP 3 A) {{play a significant role in}} theobromine and theophylline formation from caffeine in rat intestine. Overall, this study shows different expression and inducibility of CYP 1 A 1 / 1 A 2 by 3 -methylcholanthrene in rat liver and small intestine. Furthermore in rat intestine cytochrome P 450 isozymes such as CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 3 A replace CYP 1 A 2 in the caffeine metabolism...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the biotransformation of cat liver microsomes in comparison to dogs and humans using a high throughput method with fluorescent substrates and classical inhibitors specific for certain isozymes of the human cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzyme family. The metabolic activities associated with CYP 1 A, CYP 2 B, CYP 2 C, CYP 2 D, CYP 2 E and CYP 3 A were measured. Cat liver microsomes metabolized all substrates selected {{for the assessment of}} cytochrome P 450 activity. The activities associated with CYP 3 A and CYP 2 B were higher than the activities of the other measured CYPs. Substrate selectivity could be demonstrated by inhibition studies with α-naphthoflavone (CYP 1 A), tranylcypromine/quercetine (CYP 2 C), quinidine (CYP 2 D), diethyldithiocarbamic acid (CYP 2 E) and ketoconazole (CYP 3 A) respectively. Other prototypical inhibitors used for characterization of human CYP activities such as <b>furafylline</b> (CYP 1 A), tranylcypromine (CYP 2 B) and sulfaphenazole (CYP 2 C) did not show significant effects in cat and dog liver microsomes. Moreover, IC 50 -values of cat CYPs differed from dog and human CYPs underlining the interspecies differences. Gender differences were observed in the oxidation of 7 -ethoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin (CYP 2 B) and 3 -[2 -(N, N-diethyl-N-methylamino) ethyl]- 7 -methoxy- 4 -methylcoumarin (CYP 2 D), which were significantly higher in male cats than in females. Conversely, oxidation of the substrates dibenzylfluorescein (CYP 2 C) and 7 -methoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin (CYP 2 E) showed significant higher activities in females than in male cats. Overall CYP-activities in cat liver microsomes were lower than in those from dogs or humans, except for CYP 2 B. The presented difference between feline and canine CYP-activities are useful to establish dose corrections for feline patients of intensively metabolized drugs licensed for dogs or humans...|$|E

The metabolite 6 -hydroxymethyl- 5 -methylxanthenone- 4 -acetic acid (6 -OH-MXAA) was determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The metabolite formed in human liver microsomes and by cDNA-expressed CYP isoform was identified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry as 6 -OH-MXAA. In human liver microsomes (n = 14), 6 -methylhydroxylation of DMXAA followed monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a mean apparent K(m) of 21 +/- 5 microM and V(max) of 0. 043 +/- 0. 019 nmol/min/mg. An approximate 10 -fold interindividual variation in the intrinsic clearance (V(max) /K(m)) of DMXAA 6 -methylhydroxylation in human liver microsomes was observed. The involvement of CYP 1 A 2 in DMXAA metabolism by human livers was demonstrated by the following: 1) the potent inhibition of DMXAA metabolism by <b>furafylline</b> (k(inact) = 0. 23 +/- 0. 04 min(- 1), K 2 ̆ 7 (app) = 15. 6 +/- 6. 7 microM) and alpha-naphthoflavone (K(i) = 0. 036 microM), but not by cimetidine, ketoconazole, tolbutamide, quinidine, chlorzoxazone, diethyldithiocarbamate, troleandomycin, and sulfaphenazole; 2) when incubated with human lymphoblastoid cell microsomes containing cDNA-expressed CYP isoenzymes, DMXAA was metabolized only by CYP 1 A 2, with an apparent K(m) of 6. 2 +/- 1. 5 microM and V(max) of 0. 014 +/- 0. 001 nmol/min/mg, but not by CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 B 6, CYP 2 C 9 (Arg(144)), CYP 2 C 19, CYP 2 D 6 (Val(374)), CYP 2 E 1, and CYP 3 A 4; 3) a significant correlation (r = 0. 90; P 3 ̆c. 001) between 6 -methylhydroxylation of DMXAA and 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation; and 4) a significant correlation (r = 0. 75; P 3 ̆c. 01) between the CYP 1 A protein level determined by Western blots and DMXAA 6 -methylhydroxylation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAromatic amines and {{structurally}} related heterocyclic {{aromatic amines}} (HAAs) are produced during the combustion of tobacco {{or during the}} high-temperature cooking of meat. Exposure {{to some of these}} chemicals may contribute to the etiology of several common types of human cancers. 2 -Amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indole (AαC) is the most abundant HAA formed in mainstream tobacco smoke: it arises in amounts that are 25 - 100 times greater than the levels of the arylamine, 4 -aminobiphenyl (4 -ABP), a human carcinogen. 2 -Amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) is a prevalent HAA formed in cooked meats. AαC and MeIQx are rodent carcinogens; however, their carcinogenic potency in humans is unknown. A preliminary assessment of the carcinogenic potential of these HAAs in humans was conducted by examining the capacity of primary human hepatocytes to form DNA adducts of AαC and MeIQx, in comparison to 4 -ABP, followed by the kinetics of DNA adduct removal by cellular enzyme repair systems. The principal DNA adducts formed were N-(deoxyguanosin- 8 -yl) (dG-C 8) adducts. Comparable levels of DNA adducts were formed with AαC and 4 -ABP, whereas adduct formation was ∼ 5 -fold lower for MeIQx. dG-C 8 -AαC and dG-C 8 - 4 -ABP were formed at comparable levels in a concentration-dependent manner in human hepatocytes treated with procarcinogens over a 10, 000 -fold concentration range (1 nM- 10 μM). Pretreatment of hepatocytes with <b>furafylline,</b> a selective inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 1 A 2, resulted in a strong diminution of DNA adducts signifying that P 450 1 A 2 is a major P 450 isoform involved in bioactivation of these procarcinogens. The kinetics of adduct removal varied for each hepatocyte donor. Approximately half of the DNA adducts were removed within 24 h of treatment; however, the remaining lesions persisted over 5 days. The high levels of AαC present in tobacco smoke and its propensity to form persistent DNA adducts in human hepatocytes suggest that AαC can contribute to DNA damage and the risk of hepatocellular cancer in smokers...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{metabolism}} of flavone- 8 -acetic acid (FAA) {{has been}} hypothesized to be {{partly responsible for}} its potent anticancer activity in mice. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the mouse enzymes involved in FAA Phase I metabolism and evaluate their possible induction in vivo by FAA. Mouse microsomes metabolized FAA into 6 metabolites: 3 ', 4 '-dihydrodiol-FAA, 5, 6 -epoxy-FAA, 4 '-OH-FAA, 3 '-OH-FAA, 3 ', 4 '-epoxy-FAA and 6 -OH-FAA. Using Cyp-specific inhibitors (<b>furafylline,</b> Cyp 1 a 2; α-naphthoflavone, Cyp 1 b 1; tranylcypromine, Cyp 2 b 9; quercetin, Cyp 2 c 29; quinidine, 2 d 9; diethyldithiocarbamate, Cyp 2 e 1; ketoconazole, Cyp 3 a 11), the formation of 5, 6 -epoxy-FAA was mainly attributed to Cyps 1 a 2, 1 b 1, 2 b 9, 2 c 29 and 2 e 1, whereas the 3 ', 4 '-epoxy-FAA was formed by Cyps 2 b 9 and 3 a 11. The 4 '-OH-FAA was generated by Cyps 1 a 2, 1 b 1, 2 b 9 and 2 e 1, and the 6 -OH-FAA was formed by Cyps 1 b 1 and 2 c 9. Using the epoxide scavenger N-acetyl cysteine, 4 '-OH-FAA, 3 '-OH-FAA and 6 -OH-FAA were shown to derive partly from non enzymatic isomerisation of their corresponding epoxides. The specific epoxide hydrolase inhibitor elaidamide allowed the confirmation that 3 ', 4 '-dihydrodiol-FAA was formed via the epoxide hydrolase. FAA treatment in vivo in mice led to a significant increase in the hepatic expression of Cyp 1 a 2 (1. 9 -fold), 2 e 1 (2. 1 -fold), 2 b 10 (3. 2 -fold), 2 d 9 (2. 3 -fold) and 3 a 11 (2. 2 -fold), as evaluated by qRT-PCR. In conclusion, several Cyps were shown to be involved in FAA metabolism, particularly Cyps 3 a 11 and 2 b 9 which were responsible for the formation of the principal metabolites (5, 6 -epoxy-FAA, 3 ', 4 '-epoxy-FAA), and that FAA could induce the expression of several Cyps after in vivo administration. The possible implication of these enzymes in the in vivo anticancer activity of FAA in mice is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 2 -Amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indole (AalphaC) is {{the most}} abundant carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA) formed in mainstream tobacco smoke. AalphaC is a liver carcinogen in rodents, but its carcinogenic potential in humans is not known. To obtain {{a better understanding of}} the genotoxicity of AalphaC in humans, we have investigated its metabolism and its ability to form DNA adducts in human hepatocytes. Primary human hepatocytes were treated with AalphaC at doses ranging from 0. 1 - 50 muM, and the metabolites were characterized by ultra-performance LC/ion trap multistage mass spectrometry (UPLC/MSn). Six major metabolites were identified: a ring-oxidized doubly conjugated metabolite, N 2 -acetyl- 2 -amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indole- 6 -yl-oxo-(beta-d-glucuronic acid) (N 2 -acetyl-AalphaC- 6 -O-Gluc); two ring-oxidized glucuronide (Gluc) conjugates: 2 -amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indol- 3 -yl-oxo-(beta-d-glucuronic acid) (AalphaC- 3 -O-Gluc) and 2 -amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indol- 6 -yl-oxo-(beta-d-glucuronic acid) (AalphaC- 6 -O-Gluc); two sulfate conjugates, 2 -amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indol- 3 -yl sulfate (AalphaC- 3 -O-SO 3 H) and 2 -amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indol- 6 -yl sulfate (AalphaC- 6 -O-SO 3 H); and the Gluc conjugate, N 2 -(beta-d-glucosidurony 1) - 2 -amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indole (AalphaC-N 2 -Gluc). In addition, four minor metabolites were identified: N 2 -acetyl- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indol- 3 -yl sulfate (N 2 -acetyl-AalphaC- 3 -O-SO 3 H), N 2 -acetyl- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indol- 6 -yl sulfate (N 2 -acetyl-AalphaC- 6 -O-SO 3 H), N 2 -acetyl- 2 -amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indol- 3 -yl-oxo-(beta-d-glucuronic acid) (N 2 -acetyl-AalphaC- 3 -O-Gluc), and O-(beta-d-glucosidurony 1) - 2 -hydroxyamino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indole (AalphaC-HN 2 -O-Gluc). The latter metabolite, AalphaC-HN 2 -O-Gluc is a reactive intermediate that binds to DNA to form the covalent adduct N-(2 '-deoxyguanosin- 8 -yl) - 2 -amino- 9 H-pyrido[2, 3 -b]indole (dG-C 8 -AalphaC). Preincubation of hepatocytes with <b>furafylline,</b> a selective mechanism-based inhibitor of P 450 1 A 2, resulted in a strong decrease in the formation of AalphaC-HN 2 -O-Gluc and a concomitant decrease in DNA adduct formation. Our findings describe the major pathways of metabolism of AalphaC in primary human hepatocytes and reveal the importance of N-acetylation and glucuronidation in metabolism of AalphaC. P 450 1 A 2 is a major isoform involved in the bioactivation of AalphaC to form the reactive AalphaC-HN 2 -O-Gluc conjugate and AalphaC-DNA adducts...|$|E
40|$|Propafenone is a class 1 C {{antiarrhythmic}} drug {{used for}} the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Propafenone is a chiral compound which is normally administered as the racemate. The use of racemate therapy can be problematic as variability in both the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the separate enantiomeric forms of the drug can exist. Propafenone enantiomers have been shown to have similar pharmacological properties, but studies are limited with regards to their disposition and interaction with drug metabolising enzymes. The aim of the study conducted here was to investigate the interaction of racaemic propafenone with the major cytochrome P 450 isoforms (CYP 2 D 6, CYP 1 A 2, CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 19) to determine any stereospecific differences which may exist. This was conducted by measuring the in vitro metabolism of propafenone (racemate and enatiomers) and by developing CYP inhibition screens which could prove to be useful in providing information of potential drug interactions. In addition, stereospecific binding to human albumin was measured to investigate whether any enantiomeric differences in unbound drug exist. For the inhibition studies propafenone (racemate and enatiomers) was incubated in 96 well plates with separate CYP isoforms {{in the presence of a}} NADPH regenerating system. CYP activity was monitored using the following fluorogenic substrates: CYP 2 C 19 / CYP 1 A 2 – CEC; CYP 2 D 6 – AMMC; CYP 3 A 4 - BFC. IC 50 values were calculated and compared to those of control inhibitors (CYP 2 C 19 – Tranycylpromine; CYP 2 D 6 – Quinidine; CYP 3 A 4 – Ketoconazole; CYP 1 A 2 - <b>Furafylline).</b> In vitro metabolism was conducted using human liver microsomes incubated with propafenone (racemate and enatiomers) and the degree of metabolism measured using hplc analysis. Protein binding was estimated for propafenone (racemate and enatiomers) by a chromatographic method utilising a chiral HSA column. Inhibition studies showed that the lowest IC 50 values were obtained when propafenone was co-incubated with CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 3 A 4 which is to be expected as these CYP isoforms have been shown previously to be the major ones responsible for phase 1 metabolism of racaemic propafenone. There was a distinct stereospecific difference with these isoforms, with the R-enantiomer showing a higher degree of inhibition. This would suggest that there may be merit in considering single enantiomer therapy (in this instance using the S-enantiomer) to minimise the risk of any drug-drug interactions in vivo. However, the in vitro metabolism study showed that both single enantiomers were metabolised at a higher rate than the racaemic mixture. This may be explained in terms of the 2 enantiomers competing for metabolism and thus inhibiting the metabolism of each other. These results suggest a possible problem with single enantiomer therapy of propafenone as this drug has a short half life and increased metabolism would decrease this even further. Investigations into the plasma protein binding of propafenone showed that there is no difference in the binding of the separate enantiomers and therefore there would be no stereospecific differences in free drug concentration, although propafenone also binds to acid glycoprotein and so binding studies with separate enantiomers need to be conducted with this protein too. Overall, this study shows how in vitro techniques can be utilised to investigate stereospecific differences in drug disposition. The work described here warrants further study on the metabolism/disposition of propafenone enantiomers in vivo to examine the clinical implications of enantiospecific therapy with this drug...|$|E
