40|$|Balancing of the <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> in {{extension}} and flexion {{is a prerequisite}} for success of a total knee arthroplasty. The <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> is influenced by patellar position. We therefore hypothesized the state of the knee extensor mechanism (including the patellar tendon) would influence the <b>joint</b> <b>gap.</b> In 20 knees undergoing posterior-stabilized type total knee arthroplasties, we measured the <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> and the patellar tendon strain from 0 ° to 135 ° flexion with the femoral component in position. When the patella was reduced, the <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> was decreased at 90 ° and 135 ° (by 1. 9  mm and 5. 5  mm, respectively) compared with the gap with the patella everted. The patellar tendon strain increased with knee flexion.

30|$|Magnetic rail {{is one of}} {{the core}} {{components}} in the HTS maglev system, which is used to provide magnetic field source to the whole levitation system. By employing the Halbach-type magnetic rail (Jing et al. 2007; Deng et al. 2009), a strong magnetic field with high gradient in distribution can be achieved for providing stable suspension (Wang et al. 2001; Sotelo et al. 2011; Deng et al. 2015). Magnetic field is particularly required to be as homogeneous as possible along the running direction, so that a friction-free movement can be achieved in theory. In fact, the longitudinal magnetic field above the magnetic rail is usually not sufficiently homogeneous as excepted for the practical applications, the main obstacle is that the long distance rails are assembled by lots of short rail segments (Okano et al. 2004). There are <b>joint</b> <b>gaps</b> between every adjacent segment. Those <b>joint</b> <b>gaps</b> are the major factor affecting the magnetic field inhomogeneity. The inhomogeneous magnetic field has been verified as a kind of external disturbance for the maglev vehicle, and is a non-ignorable factor that directly affects the riding comfort and the running safety (Lin et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2016).|$|R

Thus it is necessary to maintain a suitable size of the <b>joint</b> <b>gap.</b> In order to determine the most suitable size of the <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> between two magnetic rail segments, the thermal expansion size of a magnetic rail was calculated. The coefficient of NdFeB’s thermal expansion is 4  ×  10 − 6 /°C. The formula of linear expansion is α = △L/L × △T, where α refers to coefficient of thermal expansion, △L length change of the object, △T temperature variation, L initial length of the object. Through this formula, with 35 ° temperature change (the common temperature variation from winter to summer in Chengdu), a Halbach rail of 1 meter long will increase 0.14  mm in summer compared to that in winter. Based on the above analysis and the magnetic field change ratio, it is suitable to have a <b>joint</b> <b>gap</b> around 1  mm.|$|E

(2011) calculated the magnetic field inhomogeneity between two segments of the conventional unimodal magnetic rail and put forward some improvement countermeasures. The cost of the Halbach-type magnetic rail is just about 38  % of that of conventional unimodal magnetic rail per kilometer (Wang et al. 2002 and Del-Valle et al. 2011), while the levitation efficiency (N/cm 3) is about 2.85 times larger (Deng et al. 2008), and thus has been widely used or reformed for the maglev applications (Guo et al. 2010; Deng et al. 2013; Boughrara et al. 2013).

In this paper, the magnetic field inhomogeneity over normal rail joint which was employed in the present Maglev system was evaluated.
