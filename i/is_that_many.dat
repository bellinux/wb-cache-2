5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|Carlos P. Romulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines {{and member}} of the UN had suite 3600, below Hoover's, for some 45 years from 1935 onwards, and fellow Filipino Imelda Marcos also spent much time and money at the hotel. Another {{connection}} with the Philippines <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> meetings were held here between President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment into the country and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} this law has <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> continuances {{previously}} issued have been denied.|$|R
25|$|Part of {{the concern}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> British {{veterans}} <b>were</b> receiving pensions and had long-term disabilities.|$|R
50|$|However, a Twitter {{spokesman}} {{denied the}} claim <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> fake accounts on the service.|$|R
5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only {{for a short period}} after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{image of}} the dodo is of a very fat and clumsy bird, but this view may be exaggerated. The general opinion of scientists today <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> old European depictions were based on overfed captive birds or crudely stuffed specimens. It has also been suggested that the images might show dodos with puffed feathers, as part of display behaviour. The Dutch painter Roelant Savery was the most prolific and influential illustrator of the dodo, having made at least ten depictions, often showing it in the lower corners. A famous painting of his from 1626, now called Edwards's Dodo as it was once owned by the ornithologist George Edwards, has since become the standard image of a dodo. It is housed in the Natural History Museum, London. The image shows a particularly fat bird and is the source for many other dodo illustrations.|$|E
25|$|It {{has become}} commercially {{valuable}} again. One reason for its popularity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> commercial synthetic red dyes {{were found to}} be carcinogenic.|$|E
50|$|During World War I, Australia {{experienced}} strong anti-German sentiment. South Australia had {{a substantial}} diaspora of German-speaking people derived from migrants from Germany and Poland during the 19th century. One {{of the consequences}} of the sentiment <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> German-sounding placenames <b>were</b> changed. Another consequence <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> Lutheran church schools which taught the children in German were encouraged and eventually forced to close or be taken over by the state.|$|R
50|$|The {{result of}} Poland's discriminatory {{educational}} policies against Ukrainians <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> educated Ukrainians became politically radicalized and militantly opposed to Poland.|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> said <b>that</b> <b>many</b> sages have {{performed}} penances there for Shiva and Shiva has himself appeared there {{to many of}} his devotees. It <b>is</b> believed <b>that</b> <b>many</b> tigers visit there to drink water during summer.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, he {{attained}} significant {{attention by}} publishing The Skeptical Environmentalist, a controversial book whose main thesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the most-publicized claims and predictions {{on environmental issues}} are wrong.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be caused}} by {{increased}} neural activity in the auditory brainstem, where the brain processes sounds, causing some auditory nerve cells to become over-excited. The basis of this theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> with tinnitus also have hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|The PUU {{algorithm}} {{incorporates a}} harmonic model used to approximate inter-domain dynamics. The underlying physical concept <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> rigid interactions will occur within each domain and loose interactions will occur between domains. This algorithm {{is used to}} define domains in the FSSP domain database.|$|E

5000|$|The {{result of}} his {{controversial}} teaching <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> Pentecostals judged <b>that</b> Branham had [...] "stepped out of his anointing" [...] and had become a [...] "bad teacher of heretical doctrine." ...|$|R
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} of Zelazny's writing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of his protagonists had sufficient familiarity with other languages {{to be able}} to quote French, German, Italian or Latin aphorisms when the occasion seemed appropriate (or even inappropriate), although Zelazny himself did not speak any of those languages.|$|E
25|$|A {{critical}} {{finding of}} the study <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the 'disconnects' between the public's preferences and what actually is taking place are caused by weak or non-existent implementation tools – rather than by inadequate policies, as contained in the City/County Comprehensive Plan and other already adopted legislation.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage of}} memory cards <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> consumer devices (e.g., digital cameras, portable music players) cannot {{make use of}} USB flash drives (even if the device has a USB port), whereas the memory cards used by the devices can be read by PCs with a card reader.|$|E
25|$|A further {{implication}} of his theory <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> stars {{out in the}} universe, with characteristics similar to the Sun, {{would have to be}} expected to possess planetary systems similar to our own.|$|R
25|$|The {{result of}} these factors <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> {{thousands}} of large, old trees easily uprooted and tipped over, frequently with tons of mud captured in their roots, and crashed into homes and power lines.|$|R
50|$|A {{side effect}} of the vehicle tax system <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> {{corporations}} registered their vehicles in departments, such as Oise (60), with lower rates. Regulations aimed at preventing such schemes were passed in 1999.|$|R
25|$|Worth noting <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> {{theories}} of syntax do not acknowledge Logical Form (e.g. Lexical Functional Grammar, Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammars, Tree-Adjoining Grammar, etc.), {{at least not}} in the way it is understood in Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program. The postulation of such a level of representation remains a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, the {{government}} decided {{to develop the}} island into a holiday resort for local visitors and tourists. A little discussed fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> generations of Malays and Chinese who had lived harmoniously on the island were relocated into high-rise apartments on Singapore, the idyllic island life was lost and not by choice.|$|E
25|$|A common problem, {{called the}} {{subgraph}} isomorphism problem, {{is finding a}} fixed graph as a subgraph in a given graph. One reason {{to be interested in}} such a question <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> graph properties are hereditary for subgraphs, which means that a graph has the property if and only if all subgraphs have it too.|$|E

50|$|On December 14, 2016, Tony Millionaire {{announced}} that Maakies has ended. One {{of the reasons}} he stated for discontinuing the strip <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the weekly papers that carried the strip were no longer in business.|$|R
25|$|Add to {{this the}} lower cost of {{maintaining}} the engine and the lower amount of {{wear and tear on}} the track. Another fact to consider <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> tank locomotives were bought from former industrial railways rather than the national network. Due to the higher availability, {{it would be easier to}} secure a suitable locomotive for a reasonable price.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} problem with blocking all scripts on all websites by default is substantial reduction in functionality and responsiveness (client-side scripting {{can be much}} faster than server-side scripting {{because it does not}} need to connect to a remote server and the page or frame {{does not need to be}} reloaded). Another problem with script blocking <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> users do not understand it, and do not know how to properly secure their browsers. Yet another drawback <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> sites do not work without client-side scripting, forcing users to disable protection for that site and opening their systems to vulnerabilities. The Firefox NoScript extension enables users to allow scripts selectively from a given page while disallowing others on the same page. For example, scripts from example.com could be allowed, while scripts from advertisingagency.com that are attempting to run on the same page could be disallowed.|$|E
25|$|Street View {{garnered}} {{much controversy}} after its release because of privacy {{concerns about the}} uncensored nature of the panoramic photographs. Since then, Google has begun blurring faces and license plates through automatic and face detection. A side effect of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> unrelated objects, such as traffic signs, road information, and street advertising, have often been blurred.|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspect of the}} format at the time <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> guests {{appeared}} via satellite. Whether in the studio or {{on the other side}} of the world all the guests would appear 'remote', on monitors.|$|R
