5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called <b>fault</b> <b>tree</b> <b>analysis,</b> which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E
25|$|Reliability {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure {{it is just as}} much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with maintainability, availability (dependability or RAMS preferred by some), and logistics engineering. Reliability {{engineering is}} always a critical component of safety engineering, as in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and hazard <b>fault</b> <b>tree</b> <b>analysis,</b> and of security engineering.|$|E
