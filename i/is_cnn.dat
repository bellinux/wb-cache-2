5000|$|... 24-hour news {{channels}} {{are devoted to}} current events around the clock. They are {{often referred to as}} cable news channels. The originator of this format from which the name derives <b>is</b> <b>CNN</b> (which following its 1980 launch, spun off other national and international networks using the brand such as CNN International, CNN en Español and CNN-IBN), originally standing for Cable News Network in reference to the then-new phenomenon of cable television. As satellite and other forms of television have evolved, the term [...] "cable news" [...] has become something of an anachronism, but is still in common use; many other television channels have since been established, such as BBC World News, BBC News Channel, Sky News, Al Jazeera, Newsmax TV, ABC News 24, France 24, STAR News, Fox News Channel and MSNBC. Some news channels specialize even further, such as ESPNews (sports news; sister channel to ESPN); The Weather Channel (weather, although its status as a specialty news channel has become ambiguous due to its recent incorporation of non-news entertainment programming); CNBC, Bloomberg Television and Fox Business Network (financial news).|$|E

30|$|To {{accomplish}} {{these three}} features, {{our system of}} three NNs: (1) Embeds POIs in lifestyles accompanied by t-SNE to project categorical POIs, e.g., “home”, “work”, “gym” onto a continuous representation (needed by the next NN, which <b>is</b> <b>CNN),</b> while keeping semantically close POIs (with respect to lifestyles) also close in their embedding (Sect.  3.7); (2) Detects high-frequency sub-sequences (mobility patterns) of size n of co-occurring POIs {{that are associated with}} the lifestyles using a CNN with a filter size of n (Sect.  4.1. 3); and (3) Exploits the order of the POI sequences in the trajectories to classify a trajectory to a lifestyle using a flexible memory to the past by the LSTM (Sect.  4.1. 1) or using a flexible memory also to the future (as we have the whole trajectory) by the BLSTM (Sect.  4.1. 2), which can potentially improve prediction by considering temporal relations from the past and to the future for each POI in the sequence.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} grasp {{ordinary}} and potentially never-seen objects {{is an important}} feature in both domestic and industrial robotics. For a system to accomplish this, it must autonomously identify grasping locations by using information from various sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect 3 D camera. Despite numerous progress, significant work still {{remains to be done}} in this field. To this effect, we propose a dictionary learning and sparse representation (DLSR) framework for representing RGBD images from 3 D sensors in the context of determining such good grasping locations. In contrast to previously proposed approaches that relied on sophisticated regularization or very large datasets, the derived perception system has a fast training phase and can work with small datasets. It is also theoretically founded for dealing with masked-out entries, which are common with 3 D sensors. We contribute by presenting a comparative study of several DLSR approach combinations for recognizing and detecting grasp candidates on the standard Cornell dataset. Importantly, experimental results show a performance improvement of 1. 69 % in detection and 3. 16 % in recognition over current state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). Even though nowadays most popular vision-based approach <b>is</b> <b>CNN,</b> this suggests that DLSR is also a viable alternative with interesting advantages that CNN has not.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} construction of specific types of Neural Networks composed of structures directly linked {{to the structure of}} the molecule under consideration. Each molecule can be represented by a unique neural connectivity problem (graph) which can be programmed onto a Cellular Neural Network. The idea was to translate chemical structures like small organic molecules or peptides into a self learning environment which <b>is</b> <b>CNN</b> based. In the case of small molecules, each cell of the CNN stands for one atom of the molecule under consideration. But in contrast to the standard CNN architecture where each cell is connected to the neighboring cells, only those cells of the feature net are connected for which there also exists a chemical bond in the molecule under consideration. This implies that the feature net topology varies from molecule to molecule. In the case of peptides, the amino acids that form the building blocks of the peptide are reflected by the CNN cells wherein the amino acid sequence defines the network topology. Unlike the standard CNN used for image processing, there are no input values like the input image that are fed into the feature net. Instead, all information about the input molecule is supplied to the feature net by means of the topology. The output of several feature nets is fed into a supervisor neural network which computes the final output value. The combination of several feature nets and a supervisor networks constitutes the Molecular Graph Network (MGN). The designed networks are used for selection of molecules representing wanted properties such as activity against specific diseases, interactions with other compounds, toxicity etc. and possibly being candidates to be tested further as new drugs...|$|E
