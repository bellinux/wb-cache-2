5|$|Bond {{tries to}} trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland so that MI6 can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is {{eventually}} caught by henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after {{his attempt to}} lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his henchmen to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase. Arriving at the village of Lauterbrunnen, Bond finds Tracy and they escape Bunt and her men after a car chase. A blizzard <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a remote barn, where Bond professes his love to Tracy and proposes marriage to her, which she accepts. The next morning, as the flight resumes, Blofeld sets off an avalanche; Tracy is captured, while Bond is buried but manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|In the North, {{the armies}} of the eponymous bastards, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon), face off in a battle for control of Winterfell. The Bolton army defeats most of Jon's force, mostly {{composed}} of Wildlings. Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) arrives with Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen) and the Knights of the Vale who defeat the remaining Bolton army. Ramsay retreats to Winterfell, where Jon beats him into the mud, locks him in the kennels and Sansa feeds him to his hounds. In Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) refuses to surrender to the Masters, mounts Drogon and begins burning the Masters' fleet; this <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> surrender. Yara (Gemma Whelan) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) arrive in Meereen and offer their ships to Daenerys, swearing to help her take the Seven Kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{offense is}} given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense {{advances}} ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded {{a new set of}} four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.|$|E

5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the social {{behavior}} of H. suspectum, but they have been observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater strength and endurance are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it {{has one of the highest}} aerobic scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher aerobic scopes than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The Gila monster may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity.|$|E

He was also made to contrast previous Gundam characters who were relatable with the audience. Setsuna has been a popular character in Japan, where voice actor Mamoru Miyano received an award for the role, and within the Gundam fanbase, ranking highly in various polls. However, critical reception to Setsuna's character from English-language publications for anime, manga and other media has been mixed, criticizing his silent personality but praising his growth across the series.|$|E
25|$|The American Council on Science and Health {{said that}} denialism {{of the facts}} of climate science and of climate change, means to {{misrepresent}} verifiable data and information as political opinion. In that vein, anti-intellectualism puts scientists in the public view and so <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> align with either a liberal or a conservative political stance. One third of Americans believe that climate scientists know about climate change, while fewer than one third believe that scientists know how to end global climate change. Moreover, 53 per cent of Republican politicians in the U.S. House of Representatives and 74 percent of Republican senators deny the scientific facts and the occurrence of climate change.|$|E

25|$|Red Faction is {{the first}} game in the Red Faction {{franchise}} that was originally released in mid-2001 and later re-released for other platforms. Red Faction {{was also the first}} game to run on the Geo-Mod engine that allowed for unparalleled environmental destruction. The game takes place on Mars in the year 2075. The protagonist, Parker, is a miner who came to Mars seeking a better life away from Earth. Instead, he finds that the Ultor Corporation abuses the workers and <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> endure hazardous living conditions. A plague of an unknown origin sweeps through the colony, but Ultor does nothing to halt its propagation or to provide for the sick.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, psychologists {{confirmed}} {{the relationship between}} social media usage and body image anxieties, dieting, and the goal towards thinness. Based on a survey, 56% of women acknowledged {{the effect of the}} “social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image”; whereby it <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> look a certain way. These platforms further reiterate the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty. Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies, while another study by the University of South Australia, discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.|$|E
25|$|In Dante's fourteenth-century work La divina commedia (The Divine Comedy), Purgatory is {{depicted}} as a mountain in the Southern hemisphere. It is apparently the only land there. Souls who loved God and man half-heartedly find themselves at Mount Purgatory, where there are two levels, then Seven Levels representing the Seven Deadly Sins with ironic punishments. For example, on the first level for Pride, the penitents are weighed down by huge stones. This <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> look down in humility at the pavement, which depicts examples of sinful Pride such as Arachne. When they reach the top, souls will find themselves at Jerusalem's antipode, the Garden of Eden itself. Thus, cleansed of all sin and made perfect, they wait in this Earthly paradise before ascending to Heaven.|$|E

25|$|Although {{black bears}} have been afforded {{protection}} in Russia since 1983, illegal poaching, fuelled {{by a growing}} demand for bear parts in the Asian market, is still {{a major threat to}} the Russian population. Many workers of Chinese and Korean origin, supposedly employed in the timber industry, are actually involved in the illegal trade. Some Russian sailors reportedly purchase bear parts from local hunters to sell them to Japanese and Southeast Asian clients. Russia's rapidly growing timber industry has been a serious threat to the Asian black bear's home range for three decades. The cutting of trees containing cavities deprives black bears of their main source of dens, and <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> den on the ground or in rocks, thus making them more vulnerable to tigers, brown bears and hunters.|$|E
25|$|The Hobbits are ambushed by the Ringwraiths, one {{stabbing}} Frodo with a cursed Morgul blade. Arwen, an elf and Strider’s lover, {{comes to}} Frodo’s aid, and successfully takes him to Rivendell, {{where he is}} healed, meeting Gandalf, who escaped Saruman {{on the back of}} a giant Eagle. Arwen’s father, Lord Elrond, holds a council, deciding that the Ring must be destroyed in Mount Doom. While the members argue, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, elf Legolas, dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur’s heir and rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo gives Frodo his sword, Sting. The Fellowship of the Ring sets off, but Saruman’s magic <b>forces</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> travel through the Mines of Moria, much to Gandalf's chagrin.|$|E
