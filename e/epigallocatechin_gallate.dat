40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the antioxidant activities of Nymphaea nouchali flower (NNF) extract and the underlying mechanism using RAW 264. 7 cells. The presence of gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, <b>epigallocatechin,</b> epicatechin <b>gallate,</b> caffeic acid, quercetin, and apigenin in the NNF was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The extract had a very potent capacity to scavenge numerous free radicals. NNF extract was also able to prevent DNA damage and quench cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation induced by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) with no signs of toxicity. The NNF extract was able to augment the expression of both primary and phase II detoxifying enzyme, resulting in combat the oxidative stress. This is accomplished by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) (p 38 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) followed by enhancing the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2). This attenuates cellular ROS generation and confers protection from cell death.

In this work, we checked whether matrilysin 1 (matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 7) could {{take part in the}} epidermal detachment in RDEB. Furthermore, we investigated <b>epigallocatechin</b> 3 <b>gallate</b> (EGCG) to determine whether it could inhibit matrilysin activities on collagen type VII and fibrillin 1 known {{to be associated with the}} dermo-epidermal junction. In this work, matrilysin 1 was detected in affected and unaffected skins of the three RDEB patients; furthermore, MMP 7 was shown to degrade ex vivo on healthy normal skin collagen VII and fibrillin 1. Thus, we suspect that MMP 7 could take an active part in the epidermal detachment occurring during RDEB. We evidenced that EGCG in in vitro as well as in ex vivo experiments was a good inhibitor of MMP 7 and developed a good protection of collagen type VII and fibrillin 1 susceptible of being degraded by MMP 7. We therefore propose that EGCG could be used beneficially in patients suffering from RDEB...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{properties}} of polyflavonoid tannins from the mangrove species {{depend on their}} structure in terms of monomer units, their mean degree of polymerization and the linkage-type between flavan- 3 -ol units with a considerable range of structural variation. Polyflavonoid tannins were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), which were too difficult to be resolved by other techniques. MALDI-TOF mass spectra of polyflavonoid tannins of four mangrove species in Rhizophoraceae, Kandelia candel, Ceriops tagal, Bruguiera cylindrica and Rhizophora apiculata showed as follows: (1) procyanidin oligomers formed by catechin/epicatechin, and catechin- 3 -O-rhamnoside monomers were present in great proportions; <b>epigallocatechin</b> and epicatechin <b>gallate</b> monomers were not detected; (2) the doubly linked structure of A-type procyanidins were also evident from the mass spectra of K. candel; (3) there were major differences in polyflavonoid tannin structure among mangrove species; and (4) the distribution of tannin oligomers, and the number-average degree of polymerization obtained by MALDI-TOF MS appeared to compare well with the results obtained by 13 C nuclear magneti...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the possible effects of sevoflurane anesthesia and <b>epigallocatechin</b> 3 - <b>gallate</b> (EGCg) on kidney tissue by evaluating the oxidant and antioxidant status in rats. Materials and Methods: Tree groups of animals were studied. Sevoflurane 3 % (v/v) in air/O 2 {{were administered to}} animals in group 1 (n = 7) and sevoflurane plus EGCg was administered in group 2 (n = 7). Seven animals were allocated to control group (group 3). Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) in kidney tissue were studied. Histopathological changes were also assessed. Results: In group I, MDA, NO, SOD and GSH-Px activities were increased while decreased CAT activities occurred when sevoflurane was exposured compared with controls. Supplementation of EGCg (group 2) decreased the MDA (P< 0. 05), SOD (P< 0. 005) and GSH-Px activities whereas, the NO (P< 0. 005) and CAT (P< 0. 005) activities increase with EGCg supplementation compared with group 1.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a {{major cause}} of liver {{cirrhosis}} and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current antiviral therapy fails to clear infection in a substantial proportion of cases. Drug development is focused on nonstructural proteins required for RNA replication. Individuals undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation face rapid, universal reinfection of the graft. Therefore, antiviral strategies targeting the early stages of infection are urgently needed for the prevention of HCV infection. In this study, we identified the polyphenol, epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), as an inhibitor of HCV entry. Green tea catechins, such as EGCG and its derivatives, <b>epigallocatechin</b> (EGC), epicatechin <b>gallate</b> (ECG), and epicatechin (EC), have been previously found to exert antiviral and antioncogenic properties. EGCG had no effect on HCV RNA replication, assembly, or release of progeny virions. However, it potently inhibited Cell-culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) entry into hepatoma cell lines as well as primary human hepatocytes. The effect was independent of the HCV genotype, and both infection of cells by extracellular virions and cell-to-cell spread were blocked. Pretreatment of cells with EGCG before HCV inoculation did not reduce HCV infection, whereas the application of EGCG during inoculation strongly inhibited HCV infectivity. Moreover, treatment with EGCG directly during inoculation strongly inhibited HCV infectivity. Expression levels of all known HCV (co-) receptors were unaltered by EGCG. Finally, we showed that EGCG inhibits viral attachment to the cell, thus disrupting the initial step of HCV cell entry. Conclusion: The green tea molecule, EGCG, potently inhibits HCV entry and could be part of an antiviral strategy aimed at the prevention of HCV reinfection after liver transplantatio...|$|R
40|$|Allium sp. {{vegetables}} are widely consumed for their characteristic flavour. Additionally, their consumption may provide protection against cardiovascular disease {{due to their}} antiplatelet and antioxidant activities. Although antiplatelet and antioxidant activities in Allium sp. are generally recognised, comparative studies of antiplatelet and antioxidant potency among the main Allium vegetable species are lacking. Also, the relationship between organosulfur and phenolic compounds and these biological activities has not been well established. In this study, the in vitro antiplatelet and antioxidant activities {{of the most widely}} consumed Allium species are characterised and compared. The species total organosulfur and phenolic content, and the HPLC profiles of 11 phenolic compounds were characterised and used to investigate the relationship between these compounds and antiplatelet and antioxidant activities. Furthermore, antiplatelet activities in chives and shallot have been characterised for the first time. Our results revealed that the strongest antiplatelet agents were garlic and shallot, whereas chives had the highest antioxidant activity. Leek and bunching onion had the weakest both biological activities. Significantly positive correlations were found between the in vitro antiplatelet activity and total organosulfur (R= 0. 74) and phenolic (TP) content (R= 0. 73), as well as between the antioxidant activity and TP (R= 0. 91) and total organosulfur content (R= 0. 67). Six individual phenolic compounds were associated with the antioxidant activity, with catechin, <b>epigallocatechin</b> and epicatechin <b>gallate</b> having the strongest correlation values (R> 0. 80).

The nineteen individual polyphenols were quantified in studied grape samples using UHPLC coupled to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. The mother grapes and wines were used as the relevant standards. In the grape, studied characteristics were monitored at three stages of berry development: green berry, véraison and mature berry. The mature grape of clones presented high values of total phenolics (3. 81 - 10. 89 g gallic acid equivalent kg- 1 frozen weight), anthocyanin content (359. 00 - 1668. 18 mg malvidin- 3 -O-glucoside kg- 1 frozen weight) and the radical scavenging activity (41. 37 - 80. 48 mmol trolox equivalent kg- 1 frozen weight) depending on the clone.
