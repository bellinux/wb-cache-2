25|$|This method {{involves}} two fluorophores: a donor and an acceptor. Excitation of {{the donor}} <b>fluorophore</b> (in this case, the lanthanide ion complex) by an energy source (e.g. flash lamp or laser) produces an energy {{transfer to the}} acceptor <b>fluorophore</b> if they are within a given proximity to each other (known as the Förster’s radius). The acceptor <b>fluorophore</b> in turn emits light at its characteristic wavelength.|$|E

40|$|Multi-modal {{nanoparticles}} incorporating <b>fluorophores</b> {{are increasingly}} being used for medical applications. The number of <b>fluorophores</b> incorporated into the nanoparticles during synthesis is stochastic, leaving some nanoparticles devoid of <b>fluorophores.</b> Determining the number, the brightness and the photostability of the <b>fluorophores</b> incorporated, {{and the percentage of}} labeled nanoparticles (labeling efficiency) remains challenging. We have determined the aforementioned quantities for two synthesized multi-modal nanoparticles by exploiting the photobleaching of <b>fluorophores</b> at the single-molecule level using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope.

Time-domain images are acquired using a voltage-gated, intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) in free-space transmission geometry with 750  nm Ti:sapphire laser excitation. Lifetime components are fit from the asymptotic portion of fluorescence decay curve and reconstructed separately with a lifetime-adjusted forward model. We use this system to test the in vivo lifetime multiplexing suitability of commercially available <b>fluorophores,</b> and demonstrate lifetime multiplexing in solution mixtures and in nude mice. All of the <b>fluorophores</b> tested exhibit nearly monoexponential decays, with narrow in vivo lifetime distributions suitable for lifetime multiplexing. Quantitative separation of two <b>fluorophores</b> with lifetimes of 1. 1 and 1. 37  ns is demonstrated for relative concentrations of 1 : 5. Finally, we demonstrate tomographic imaging of two and three <b>fluorophores</b> in nude mice with <b>fluorophores</b> that localize to distinct organ systems.

40|$|AbstractResonance energy {{transfer}} provides a {{practical way to}} measure distances {{in the range of}} 10 – 100 Å between sites in biological molecules. Although the relationship between the efficiency of {{energy transfer}} and the distance between sites is well described for a single pair of <b>fluorophores,</b> the situation is more difficult when more than two <b>fluorophores</b> are present. Using a Monte Carlo calculation scheme, we demonstrate how resonance energy transfer can be used to measure distances between <b>fluorophores</b> in complex geometries. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by calculating the efficiency of energy transfer for individual <b>fluorophores</b> randomly distributed in two and three dimensions, for linked pairs of donors and acceptors and pentameric structures of five linked <b>fluorophores.</b> This approach can be used to relate the efficiency of energy transfer to the distances between <b>fluorophores,</b> R 0, molecular concentrations, laser power, and donor/acceptor ratios in ensembles of molecules or when many <b>fluorophores</b> are attached to a single molecule such as in multimeric proteins...|$|R

40|$|Photosensitive {{fluorescent}} probes {{have become}} powerful tools in chemical biology and molecular biophysics, {{which are used}} to investigate cellular processes with high temporal and spatial resolution. Accordingly, photosensitive fluorescent probes, including photoactivatable, photoconvertible, and photoswitchable <b>fluorophores,</b> have been extensively developed during the past decade. The photoswitchable <b>fluorophores</b> have received much attention because they highlight cellular events clearly. This minireview summarizes recent advances of using reversibly photoswitchable <b>fluorophores</b> and their applications in innovative bioimaging. Photoswitchable <b>fluorophores</b> include photoswitchable fluorescent proteins, photoswitchable fluorescent organic molecules (dyes), and photoswitchable fluorescent nanoparticles. Several strategies {{have been developed to}} synthesize photoswitchable <b>fluorophores,</b> including engineering combination proteins, chemical synthesis, polymerization, and self-assembly. Here we concentrate on polymer nanoparticles with optically switchable emission properties: either fluorescence on/off or dual-alternating-color fluorescence photoswitching. The essential mechanisms of fluorescence photoswitching enable different types of photoswitchable <b>fluorophores</b> to change emission intensity or wavelength (color) and thus validating the basis of the fluorescence on/off or dual-color photoswitching design. Generally the possible applications of any <b>fluorophores</b> are to label biological targets, followed by specific imaging. The newly developed photoswitchable <b>fluorophores</b> enable super-resolution fluorescence imaging because of their photosensitive emission.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years we have {{developed}} the ability to acquire images through a confocal microscope that contain, for each pixel, the simultaneous fluorescence lifetime and spectra of multiple <b>fluorophores</b> within that pixel. We have demonstrated that our system has the sensitivity to make these measurements on single molecules. The spectra and lifetimes of <b>fluorophores</b> bound to complex molecules contain a wealth of information on the conformational dynamics and local chemical environments of the molecules. However, the detailed record of spectral and temporal information our system provides from <b>fluorophores</b> in single molecules has not been previously available. Therefore, we have studied several <b>fluorophores</b> and simple fluorophore-molecule systems that are representative of the use of <b>fluorophores</b> in biological systems. Experiments include studies of a simple fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system, green fluorescent probe variants and quantum dots.

25|$|Fluorophores {{are more}} likely to be excited by photons if the {{transition}} moment of the <b>fluorophore</b> is parallel to the electric vector of the photon. The polarization of the emitted light will also depend on the transition moment. The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the <b>fluorophore</b> molecule. For fluorophores in solution this means that the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate how freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Measurements of time-resolved {{fluorescence}} anisotropy and fluorescence {{resonance energy}} transfer are finding many {{applications in the}} study of biological macromolecules as they enable structural properties of the host molecules to be determined in their natural environment. A difficulty in interpreting these experiments is that they both require knowledge of the relative orientation of the <b>fluorophores,</b> a property that is almost impossible to measure. Here we conduct simulations of AlexaFluor 488 and AlexaFluor 568 attached to two sites on the membrane channel MscL to provide an alternative mechanism for determining the likely configurations andorientational freedomof the <b>fluorophores,</b> aswell as themost likely valueof the orientation factor k 2 for energy transfer between them. The <b>fluorophores</b> are relatively mobile, and are found to bemore so when immersed in bulk water than when they interact with the lipid membrane. The <b>fluorophores</b> never insert deeply into the lipid, despite their hydrophobic linkers and aromatic headgroup structures. Properties such as the fluorescence anisotropy decay can be predicted from simulations of the <b>fluorophores</b> in bulk water that closely match experimental data. In contrast, when the <b>fluorophores</b> were attached to the large MscL protein it was difficult to sample all the possible configurations of the <b>fluorophores</b> due to the computational time required. While this approach is likely to provide useful data on solvent-accessible <b>fluorophores</b> attached to small proteins, simulations lasting. 50 ns or the useof biasing forces are required to accurately predict orientation factors for use in energy transfer experiments on larger membrane-bound proteins...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} exploits molecular fluorescence as {{a simple}} approach to enhance the visual contrast of samples. Beyond their use in fluorescence microscopy, <b>fluorophores</b> {{have proven to be}} useful in a much wider range of applications, and across length-scales. For example, fluoropores have enabled probing the direct nanoenvironment of the <b>fluorophores</b> to study chemical processes at the nanoscale. In addition, <b>fluorophores</b> were also found applicable in a diverse range from solar cells and LEDs to sensing and diagnostics to quantum computing. For optimum performance, it is important to thoroughly characterize the physico-chemical and photophysical properties of <b>fluorophores</b> prior to use. New fluorescence-based techniques like super-resolution fluorescence microscopy are rapidly developing, and are accompanied by a range of new <b>fluorophores</b> that push the limits of known characterization approaches. Standard ensemble characterization methods give only limited insights into the photophysics of these new <b>fluorophores.</b> Therefore, single molecule characterization methods are required to fully access these photophysical properties of the <b>fluorophores.</b> For this reason, single molecule studies have become very popular over the past three decades. At present, still not all photophysical properties can be accessed at the single emitter level. In this thesis, various techniques and methods are described that we developed to characterize single emitters, and to get detailed insights into the photophysics of quantum emitting systems...|$|R
50|$|Fluorescein, by its amine {{reactive}} isothiocyanate derivative FITC, {{has been}} one of the most popular <b>fluorophores.</b> From antibody labeling, the applications have spread to nucleic acids thanks to (FAM (Carboxyfluorescein), TET,...). Other historically common <b>fluorophores</b> are derivatives of rhodamine (TRITC), coumarin, and cyanine. Newer generations of <b>fluorophores,</b> many of which are proprietary, often perform better, being more photostable, brighter, and/or less pH-sensitive than traditional dyes with comparable excitation and emission.|$|R
25|$|In general, emitted {{fluorescent}} light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light. This phenomenon, known as Stokes shift, {{is due to}} energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed {{and when it is}} emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the <b>fluorophore</b> and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a <b>fluorophore</b> in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{requirement}} of molecular oxygen for <b>fluorophore</b> formation, BiFC cannot be used in obligate anaerobes, which cannot survive {{in the presence of}} oxygen. This limits the use of BiFC to aerobic organisms.|$|E

30|$|In this work, {{we present}} a method to analyze {{high-density}} super-resolution data in three dimensions, where the images of individual <b>fluorophores</b> not only overlap, but also have varying PSFs that depend on the z positions of the <b>fluorophores.</b>|$|R

25|$|Fluorescence {{resonance}} energy transfer (FRET), {{also known as}} förster {{resonance energy}} transfer, resonance energy transfer (RET) or electronic energy transfer (EET), {{is based on the}} transfer of energy from an excited (donor) chromophore or <b>fluorophore</b> (if the chromophores are fluorescent) to a nearby acceptor. In this method, fluorophores are chemically linked or genetically fused to two proteins hypothesised to interact. If the proteins interact, this will bring the fluorophores into close spatial proximity. If the fluorophores are oriented in a manner that exposes the fluorophores to one another, usually ensured when designing and constructing the fluorophore-protein linkage/fusion, then the energy transfer from the excited donor <b>fluorophore</b> will result in a change in the fluorescent intensities or lifetimes of the fluorophores.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} approach is by photo-induced electron transfer (PET), a mechanism of fluorescence-quenching {{due to the}} electron-rich tertiary amino group near the <b>fluorophore,</b> which {{is affected by the}} change in charge of the nearby boronate group when glucose is bound.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of fluorescence is largely unexplored, despite the newfound occurrence {{of this phenomenon}} {{in a variety of}} organisms. We document that spiders fluoresce under ultraviolet illumination, and find that the expression of this trait varies greatly among taxa in this species-rich group. All spiders we examined possess <b>fluorophores</b> in their haemolymph, but bright fluorescence appears to result when a spider sequesters <b>fluorophores</b> in its setae or cuticle. By sampling widely across spider taxa, we determine that fluorescent expression is labile and has evolved multiple times. Moreover, examination of the excitation and emission properties of extracted <b>fluorophores</b> reveals that spiders possess multiple <b>fluorophores</b> and that these differ among some families, indicating that novel <b>fluorophores</b> have evolved during spider diversification. Because many spiders fluoresce in wavelengths visible to their predators and prey (birds and insects), we propose that natural selection imposed by predator-prey interactions may drive the {{evolution of}} fluorescence in spiders...|$|R
40|$|Relatively simple {{modifications}} {{of an ordinary}} epifluorescence microscope have greatly reduced its background luminescence, allowing continuous and real time imaging of single <b>fluorophores</b> in an aqueous medium.

By permitting straightforward single molecule (SM) detection and imaging with organic <b>fluorophores,</b> chemical tags have the potential to advance SM imaging as a routine experimental tool for studying biological mechanism. However, there has been little characterization of the photophysical consequences of using chemical tags with organic <b>fluorophores.</b> Here, we examine the effect the covalent trimethoprim chemical tag (A-TMP-tag) has on the SM imaging performance of the <b>fluorophores,</b> Atto 655 and Alexa 647, by evaluating the photophysical properties of these <b>fluorophores</b> and their A-TMP-tag conjugates.
