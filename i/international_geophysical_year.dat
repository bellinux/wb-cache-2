5|$|The first {{official}} inquiries into establishing ionosphere research in Svalbard {{was taken by}} Leiv Harang, then head of the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), in October 1950. Two similar facilities, a completed one at Kjeller and one under construction in Tromsø, had already been initiated. The proposal, regarded by Harang as primarily a military project, was initially issued to the United States. It was considered by US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who {{saw it as a}} possible excuse to populate Spitsbergen as a counter-measure to the Soviet mining communities. However, nothing came of the plans before the <b>International</b> <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Year</b> in 1957–58, when an ionosphere research station was established as Isfjord Radio and moved to Ny-Ålesund in 1963. Although unrelated to the telemetry station, this was the initiation of technology services in Ny-Ålesund.|$|E
5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the <b>International</b> <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Year</b> in 1954, additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1949–52 was {{the first}} {{international}} scientific expedition in Antarctica. The expedition established its winter quarters at a base called Maudheim at 71°S, 11°W, and mapped much of western Queen Maud Land. During the <b>International</b> <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Year</b> (1957–1958), year-round stations were established in Queen Maud Land by Norway, the Soviet Union, Belgium and Japan. The Norwegian expedition continued with topographical mapping, while the others started geophysical and geological research. Norway's Norway Station was lent to South Africa following {{the withdrawal of the}} Norwegian expedition in 1960. South Africa later built the SANAE station, near the now-defunct Norway Station. The Soviet Union, and later Russia, has maintained continual operations, although it moved from Lazarev Station to Novolazarevskaya Station. Japan has been based at its Showa Station since 1957, except for a hiatus of a few years. Belgium closed its Roi Baudouin station in 1961, though it mounted limited operations in cooperation with the Netherlands in 1964–66. The United States established the temporary Plateau Station in 1966.|$|E

40|$|In July—September 1997 two hydrographic {{lines were}} done in the western N. Atlantic along longitudes of 52 and 66 ¡W {{as part of the}} WOCE {{one-time}} hydrographic survey of the oceans. Each of these two lines approximately repeated earlier ones done during the <b>International</b> <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Year(s)</b> (IGY) and the mid- 1980 s. Because of this repeated sampling, long-term hydrographic changes in the water masses can be examined. In this report, we focus on temperature and salinity changes within the subtropical gyre mainly between latitudes of 20 and 35 ¡N and compare our results to those presented by Bryden et al. (1996), who examined changes along a zonal line at 24 ¡N, most recently occupied in 1992. Since this most recent 24 ¡N section in 1992, substantial changes have occurred {{in the western part of}} the subtropical gyre at the depths of the Labrador Sea Water (LSW). In particular, we see clear evidence for colder, fresher Labrador Sea Water throughout the gyre on our two recent sections that was not yet present in 1992 at similar longitudes along 24 ¡N. At shallower depths inhabited by waters that are an admixture of Mediterranean (MW) and Antarctic Intermediate Waters (AAIW), our recent survey shows an increase in salinity, which can only be attributed to changes in wate...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{interpret}} the negative isostatic anomaly of the Western Caribbean Sea {{on the basis of the}} new criterion used by professor M. Ewing et al. in their interpretation of the island arc in Pto. Rico area. The proposed interpretation is a departure from the previous one generally accepted, which was based on the tectogene theory of professor H. H. Hess. In other words, the negative anomaly is attributed here to the sediments' thickenning and possible geosynclinal structure, rather than to deeper tectogenic deformation involving sial and sima. A geomorphologic interpretation of the Caribbean continental shelf is offered on this basis.   The interpretation is locally based on correlation of the isostatic anomaly values (pendulum) with surface gravimetric values (gravity meter) in the Colombian coastal area (near Barranquilla), as compiled by the <b>International</b> <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Year's</b> Colombian Gravity Committee, and general stratigraphic and structural data of the Atlantic coast.   A brief account and analysis of gravimetric principles and previous gravity works and their interpretations is given, especially in connection with isostasy and the general island arc problem. The paper aims mainly at encouraging interest toward cooperative research and further geophysical detail work in the Western (Colombian) Caribbean. Sea area. </p...|$|R

40|$|The First International Polar Year {{was born}} from {{an idea of}} the Austro-Hungarian Naval lieutenant, Carl Weyprecht. Coming back to Trieste, Italy, from his {{expedition}} in the Arctics, Weyprecht developed his plan for setting up a new collaborative, circumpolar research, which would significantly replace the way to organize polar expeditions. In his essay “Fundamental Principles of Arctic Research” Weyprecht promoted the systematic exploration of polar regions through international cooperation and the scientific dissemination of results. Such a concept was presented in September 1875 at the 4 th Meeting of the Association of German Naturalists and Physicists at Graz. In 1879 the International Meteorological Congress met in Rome and recognized the importance of Weyprecht’s proposal. On the occasion of the 4 th International Polar Year 2007 - 2009, this book reconstructs the preliminary facts and the genesis of the IPY, through an historical analysis of the cultural and political reasons that allowed the rising of a new scientific approach. The first part of the book documents with original details the social and cultural life as it was in Trieste, {{one of the most important}} Austro-hungarian harbours, at the end of the 19 th century, in which Carl Weyprecht operated. The second part of the book illustrates the development of the Italian Antarctic Program, after the Antarctic Treaty and the involvement of the Italian scientific community into the International Polar Year. In the last section the main scientific steps achieved in the 19 th and 20 th centuries and the development of parallel initiatives to IPY, such as, the International Year of Planet Earth, the International Heliophysical <b>Year,</b> the <b>International</b> <b>Geophysical</b> Electronic <b>Year,</b> are briefly illustrated...|$|R

40|$|FOREWORD [...] [...] This {{report is}} an {{enlarged}} and {{revised version of}} an original study [...] conducted by one of us (HERMAN, 1960). Several additional emissions of [...] the auroral spectrum are studied. In order to ascertain and clarify some [...] unexpected results of the original study the spectroscopic data has been [...] re-classified into three well defined groups which are analysed separately. [...] Data of questionable quality are removed. It appears that this new study [...] resolves ambiguities present in the original results and allows revised [...] and new interpretations to be advanced. The behavior of prominent auroral emissions has been studied statistically [...] using the IGY patrol spectrograms obtained at College, Alaska during the <b>International</b> [...] <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Year.</b> Results are presented {{in the form of}} mean diurnal [...] intensity variations and in the form of correlation tables. Both presentations [...] suggest the occurrence of two types of auroras. One is relatively weak, has a [...] broad intensity maximum around magnetic midnight, and contains the hydrogen [...] Balmer emissions. The other gradually increases in intensity until magnetic [...] midnight and thereafter maintains a high intensity level until dawn. Its spectrum [...] is usually characterized by the presence of the first positive bands of N 2. [...] The mean diurnal intensity variation of the sodium emission suggests that [...] the twilight enhancement of the sodium D-lines persists to much greater solar [...] depression angles than those previously reported. Some evidence is found for [...] a small auroral contribution to the sodium emission. This contribution is however [...] erratic and does not correlate well with any specific auroral emission. [...] The (OI) 6364 A emission shows, as expected, a strong twilight enhancement [...] persisting to large solar depression angles. No enhancement is observed for [...] the (OI) 5577 A emission. [...] A weak correlation is found between the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer [...] emissions and the occurrence of red auroras...|$|R
