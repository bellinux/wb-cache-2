40|$|Abstract: Fair grading {{is modeled}} on two {{fundamental}} principles. The first principle is that grading should be impartial and consistent. The second prin-ciple <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> grade {{should be based}} on the student’s competence in the academic content of the course. I derive corollary principles of fair grading from these two basic principles and use them to evaluate common grading practices. I argue that exempting students from completing certain grade components is unfair, as is grading on attendance, class rank, deportment, tardiness, effort, institutional values, moral virtues such as cheerfulness and helpfulness, and other non-course-content criteria. What is fair grading? For example, is there a fair way to average a series of letter grades? Are such practices as “grading on the curve,” peer grading, and dropping the lowest quiz score from each student’s course average fair? Is it fair to excuse “A ” students from the final exam? Should students be graded on attendance, tardiness, or other forms of comportment? Exactly what is “extra credit ” or “make-up...|$|E
40|$|Democratic {{presidential nominee}} Sen. Barack Obama (IL) has {{proposed}} an ambitious plan to restructure America's health care sector. Rather than {{engage in a}} detailed critique of Obama's health care plan, many critics prefer to label it "socialized medicine. " <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> description of the Obama plan and similar plans? Over the past year, prominent media outlets and respectable think tanks have investigated that question and come to a unanimous answer: no. Those investigations leave much to be desired. Indeed, they {{are little more than}} attempts to convince the public that policies generally considered socialist really aren't. A reasonable definition of socialized medicine is possible. Socialized medicine exists to the extent that government controls medical resources and socializes the costs. Notice that under this definition, it is irrelevant whether we describe medical resources (e. g., hospitals, employees) as "public" or "private. " What matters-what determines real as opposed to nominal ownership-is who controls the resources. By that definition, America's health sector is already more than half socialized, and Obama's health care plan would socialize medicine even further. Reasonable people can disagree over whether Obama's health plan would be good or bad. But to suggest {{that it is not a}} step toward socialized medicine is absurd...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—Psychology {{calls itself}} {{the science of}} behavior, and the American Psychological Association’s current ‘‘Decade of Behavior’ ’ was {{intended}} to increase awareness and appreciation of {{this aspect of the}} science. Yet some psychological subdisciplines have never directly studied behavior, and studies on behavior are dwindling rapidly in other subdisciplines. We discuss the eclipse of behavior in personality and social psychology, in which direct observation of behavior has been increasingly supplanted by introspective self-reports, hypothetical scenarios, and questionnaire ratings. We advocate a renewed commitment to including direct observation of behavior whenever possible and in at least a healthy minority of research projects. For decades now, psychology students have been taught from {{the first day of class}} that psychology is the science of behavior and that its ultimate goal is to describe and explain what people do. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> description? The answer varies with the specific area of psychology. Neuroscience and cognitive psychology have never had much to say about the meaningful activities people perform in their daily lives, nor have they really intended to. These fields are more interested in understanding the internal workings of the mind and brain rather than behavioral outcomes. In contrast, animal learning and developmental psychology have consistently focused on behavior, perhaps because participants studied by these fields generally cannot fill ou...|$|E

In quick succession the Selberg integral was used to prove an outstanding conjecture in random matrix theory and cases of the Macdonald conjectures. It further initiated the study of q-analogues, which in turn enriched the Macdonald conjectures. We review these developments and proceed to exhibit the sustained prominence of the Selberg integral as evidenced by its central role in random matrix theory, Calogero–Sutherland quantum many-body systems, Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations, and multivariable orthogonal polynomia...|$|R

40|$|Fair {{allocation}} {{has been}} studied intensively in both economics and computer science. This subject has aroused renewed interest {{with the advent of}} virtualization and cloud computing. Prior work has typically focused on mechanisms for fair sharing of a single resource. We consider a variant where each user is entitled to a certain fraction of the system’s resources, and has a fixed usage profile describing how much he would want from each resource. We provide a new definition for the simultaneous fair allocation of multiple continuously-divisible resources that we call bottleneck-based fairness (BBF). Roughly speaking, an allocation of resources is considered fair if every user either gets all the resources he wishes for, or else gets at least his entitlement on some bottleneck resource, and therefore cannot complain about not receiving more. We show that BBF has several desirable properties such as providing an incentive for sharing, and also promotes high overall utilization of resources; we also compare BBF carefully to another notion of fairness proposed recently, dominant resource fairness. Our main technical result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> allocation can be found for every combination of user requests and entitlements. The allocation profile of each user is proportionate to the user’s profile of requests. The main problem is that the bottleneck resources are not known in advance, and indeed one can find instances that allow different solutions with different sets of bottlenecks. Therefore known techniques such as linear programming do not seem to work. Our proof uses tools from the theory of ordinary differential equations, showing the existence of a sequence of points that converge upon a solution. It is constructive and provides a practical method to compute the allocations numerically. ...|$|E

40|$|Questions of {{fairness}} and equity {{are central to the}} challenge of tackling global climate change. The complexity of the question arises from the global and long-term nature of the problem. At the same time, the impacts are localized and differentiated, so that states least able to respond are those that will be hardest hit. Policies and measures to abate – mitigate – greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions demand the decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and the commitment of resources beyond the time horizon of politics-as-usual. And while international environmental law has achieved notable successes, it has arguably not confronted a challenge with so many dimensions, including lifestyles, energy policies, and inequality in global community. Some analysts have argued that questions {{of fairness}} and equity are of secondary, largely rhetorical significance: willingness to pay is what matters. Such views grow from a realist perspective on the relations between states and skepticism about international law. The argument presented in this thesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> distribution of benefits and burdens {{is at the heart of}} the matter. Individual and collective responses to the climate change problem are shaped and determined by social and political factors, as much as by technical and as scientific ones. Normative analysis has a role to play in analyzing the problem of climate change and identifying solutions. Within two decades emissions from developing countries of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, will exceed the share from industrialized countries. The United States and countries argue that reduction measures therefore are only meaningful if developing countries are prepared to trim their emissions. In turn, developing countries look forward, contending that they ought not bear the burden of abatement at this critical stage in their development. They point also to the historical responsibility of the developed countries, invoking the polluter pays principle. Small islands and other particularly vulnerable developing countries seek to emphasize global solidarity and fairness when pressing claims for assistance to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. These are only some of the issues entwined in the debate on climate change, and which lead directly or indirectly to the question of fairness...|$|E
