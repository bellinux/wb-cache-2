5|$|Fish thrived for {{a limited}} time in Sulphur Creek between the {{introduction}} of perennial flows and the devastating floods {{at the end of}} the 20th century. These floods wiped out many of the remaining riparian areas lining waterways in the watershed. Despite the massive environmental degradation in the Sulphur Creek watershed, it is not biologically dead, yet and still supports some native species. Work <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> in the watershed to remove non-native species and restore native riparian vegetation.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{could be}} exploited industrially and commercially, and research {{that could lead}} to such applications <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E

While the plan <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> Homer decides to stay in the Springfield Retirement Castle with his father, posing as {{resident}} Cornelius Talmidge. Homer enjoys his stay at the home immensely, until the real Cornelius returns, at which point he flees. He returns home and gets into bed with Marge. Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilon enters to say goodbye, but is shocked to see Marge in bed with another man, and Apu on the floor. Tired of the whole charade, Marge forces Apu to tell his mother the truth, who declares that the arranged marriage will proceed as planned.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Howe Island {{stick insect}} {{disappeared}} from the main island soon after the introduction of rats in 1918. In 2001 a tiny population was discovered in a single Melaleuca howeana shrub {{on the slopes of}} Ball's Pyramid, has been successfully bred in captivity, and is nearing re-introduction to the main island. The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summer months. Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe Placostylus), has also been affected by the introduction of rats. Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive breeding program <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> to save the snail from extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{strain of}} H. pylori {{a person is}} exposed to may {{influence}} {{the risk of developing}} gastric cancer. Strains of H. pylori that produce high levels of two proteins, vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), appear to cause greater tissue damage than those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely. These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> As a result of the bacterial presence, neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault.|$|E

5|$|Branford is {{the first}} {{previously}} rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second platform. A $60 million bond in February 2011 included $16.5 million for a second platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford, $7.3 million for platform extensions at Guilford, and $11 million to add catenary wires to currently unwired sidings along the line. Construction on the new platform at Branford began in September 2013, and the Guilford work <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> as well. After delays, the enlarged Branford station opened on September 30, 2016, although the north platform was not immediately served by trains. Bidding on a second platform and three-level parking garage at Madison, planned since 2009, was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur. Per the agreement with Amtrak, a second platform is planned {{to be added to}} Clinton station. The project was originally planned to start in early 2012, but has since been indefinitely delayed.|$|E
5|$|Electricity for Canberra mainly {{comes from}} the {{national}} power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan). Power was first supplied from a thermal plant built in 1913, near the Molonglo River, but this was finally closed in 1957. A 20 megawatt photovoltaic solar plant, described as the largest photovoltaic solar farm in Australia, was officially opened at Royalla on 3 September 2014. The 2.3 megawatt Mount Majura solar farm was opened in Majura on 6 October 2016. Construction <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> on a 13 megawatt solar farm at Mugga Lane, Hume and an 11 megawatt solar farm at Williamsdale. The Williamsdale solar farm was originally planned to be built at Uriarra but faced local opposition. In addition numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels and/or solar hot water systems. Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at Belconnen and Mugga Lane. There are currently no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020. This will raise the target from 210 to 550 megawatts. It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these {{are expected to be}} operational by 2017. Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power per year from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016. The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed-in-tariff entitlements would be made available {{for the establishment of a}} facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020.|$|E
