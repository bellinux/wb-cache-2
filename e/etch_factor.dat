40|$|The {{effect of}} fluid flow, transport, and {{reaction}} on the shape evolution of two-dimensional cavities during wet chemi-cal etching was studied. Finite element methods {{were employed to}} solve for the fluid velocity profiles and for the etchant concentration distribution in cavities of arbitrary shape. A moving boundary scheme was developed to track the shape evolution of the etching cavity. In the case of pure diffusion and under mass-transfer control, a mask with finite thickness resulted in significantly better <b>etch</b> <b>factor</b> (etch anisotropy) as compared to an infinitely thin mask, albeit he etch rate was essentially unaffected. With fluid flow past the cavity, the etch rate increased fourfold and the <b>etch</b> <b>factor</b> increased by 40 % as compared to pure diffusion, under the conditions examined. In addition, the etch rate, <b>etch</b> <b>factor,</b> and cavity wall pro-files showed a strong dependence on etch time as the cavity aspect ratio (depth/width) increased with time during etching. In the modern microelectronics industry, intricate pat-terns are etched through resist masks into thin films of semiconductors, insulators, and metals. For example, etching patterns of controlled shape and with smooth sur-faces into films of GaAs are important in the fabrication of optoelectronic devices; and etching of Cu vias is commo...|$|E

40|$|A novel rotating-cell reactor {{was used}} to study natural-convection-enhanced tching of GaAs. The etch rate of unpatterned samples {{increased}} with the square root of the rotation speed. The <b>etch</b> <b>factor</b> of patterned samples was much higher than that ex-pected for pure diffusion and increased with rotation speed. Wet chemical etching is used extensively for patterning thin and thick films of semiconductors, insulators, and metals (1). For example, wet etching of GaAs {{is important in the}} fabrica-tion of optoelectronic devices (2), and etching of copper is used in printed-circuit-board fabrication (3). Mass transfer of the etchant from the solution bulk to the surface or removal of the reaction product from the vicinity of the surface is often the limiting step in achieving a high etch rate. Different methods have therefore been used to enhance mass transport, most noticeably an impinging jet or cross flow over the cavity (4). At the initial stages of the process, when th...|$|E
40|$|Photochemical {{machining}} is a non-conventional {{machining process}} which employs photoresist and chemical etching techniques. Brass which contains 60 - 80 % copper and 20 - 40 %- zinc, {{is the most}} commonly etched copper alloy in the UK. It is used to produce precision parts as well as decorative items. In this study, the most widely üsed''brass (BS CZ 108, ISO CuZn 37) is etched with cupric chloride. The effects of etchant concentration, temperature and hydrochloric acid additions on the etch rate, undercut, <b>etch</b> <b>factors</b> and surface roughness are determined. In comparison to cupric chloride, ferric chloride and alkaline etchants were examined. As an extension to this study, the regeneration of used cupric chloride and recovery of zinc were examined. This investigation was needed because the dissolved brass in the cupric chloride affected the etch rate and surface quality of the etched brass. Therefore the etchant had to be either replaced with fresh etchant and the spent etchant disposed of, or regenerated and the dissolved metal content recovered. The regeneration/recovery process provided an economical solution to environmental considerations. Electrodialysis was used to recover zinc and regenerate cupric chloride, {{and the effect of}} various parameters (i. e. current density, temperature, catholyte solutions) were examined and a comparison of costs between electrodialysis and chlorine regeneration was undertaken. It was noticed that the electrodialysis produced etchant and catholyte wastes. In order to eliminate any waste cupric chloride or catholyte, a further investigation using cementation was undertaken. It was noted that the cementation would successfully decrease disposal of excess solutions...|$|R

40|$|Molten {{metallic}} nanoparticles {{have recently}} been used to construct graphene nanostructures with crystallographic edges. The mechanism by which this happens, however, remains unclear. Here, we present a simple model that explains how a droplet can <b>etch</b> graphene. Two <b>factors</b> possibly contribute to this process: {{a difference between the}} equilibrium wettability of graphene and the substrate that supports it, or the large surface energy associated with the graphene edge. We calculate the etching velocities due to either of these factors and make testable predictions for evaluating the significance of each in graphene etching. This model is general and can be applied to other materials systems as well. As an example, we show how our model can be used to extend a current theory of droplet motion on binary semiconductor surfaces...|$|R

HF {{concentration}} {{dependence of}} the <b>etch</b> <b>factor</b> (undercut/ etch depth) for etching in 5 HC 1 : 1 H 3 PO 4, at 25 ~ for 25 s. tween the surface native oxide on InP substrate and the etchant. Water rinse and/or heat-treatment (22 ~ 176 can increase the InP surface oxide layer thickness signifi-cantly (5, 6). The reaction of the interfacial native oxide with the HF, HC 1, and HBr in the etchant will expose the (100) plane, and downward v-groove etching begins at that region. The rate of reaction of the native oxide layer with the contents in the etchant is fastest for HF, with HC 1 and HBr in descending order. Heat-treated InP substrates, which have a thick native oxide film, will react with HF much faster than with HC 1 or HBr and will give a larger photoresist film undercut. Conclusion The photoresist etch mask undercutt ing prob lem has been studied for the etching of v-grooves in InP (001) sub-strates for channel led substrate laser growth. The relation-ship between the photoresist mask undercutt ing and the heat-treatment of the InP substrate, and the impurity con-tent (HF, HBr, and H 202) in the etchant were studied.

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} develop a {{reproducible}} process for batch-fabricating microdevices required for MEMS and medical applications, such as micro actuators and stents, from heat-sensitive NiTi shape memory materials. Electrochemical micromachining was chosen {{to carry out this}} work. This is a non-traditional machining process involving photoresist processing and electrolytic etching which has received much attention recently for the processing of thin films. The electrolyte used was a non-aqueous solution of 5 % sulphuric acid in methanol. The optimum parameters for the photoresist processing were obtained by evaluation of the thickness and exposure time of the KTFR photoresist coating. A quantitative investigation of the electrolytic etching of NiTi was carried out to study the influence of applied voltage, etch time and line width of the test pattern on the etching behaviour, e. g. etch rate, undercut, depth of etch and <b>etch</b> <b>factor.</b> The anodic polarisation behaviour of NiTi in 5 % sulphuric acid in methanol was investigated under a potentiostatic control system to establish the optimum etching parameters. The materials used for the fabrication of micro actuators (required by Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany to make a prototype microvalve) were NiTi alloy thin film materials (sputtered or cold-rolled) with thicknesses ranging from 5 to 46 J [...] . lm displaying a one-way or two-way shape m:emory effect. A variety of optimised designs of micro actuator were successfully etched electrolytically at 8 V. The etch rate was found to depend directly on the anodic current density. The addition of a third alloying element such as Pd or eu reduced the anodic current density and maintained a similar etch rate. However it resulted in the breaking of the films during etching due to the reduction in the ductility of the material. The materials for the micro fabrication of stents were 100 J [...] . lm thick NiTi sheets. The problem of non-uniform metal dissolution was observed. However, by adding a sacrificial etch band as a current 'robber', periodic rotation of the anode and properly adjusting the electrochemical and geometric parameters, the stents were etched successfully with improved yield and dimensional accuracy...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} a novel method of microfabrication of titanium (Ti) biomedical devices. The aim of the work {{was to develop a}} commercial process to fabricate Ti in a more environmentally friendly manner than current chemical etching techniques. The emphasis was placed on electrolytic etching, which enables the replacement of hazardous hydrofluoric acid-based etchants that are used by necessity when using Photochemical Machining (PCM) to produce intricate features in sheet Ti on a mass scale. Titanium is inherently difficult to etch (it is designed for its corrosion-resistant attributes) and as a result, Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used in combination with a strong and durable mask to achieve selective etching. The use of HF introduces serious health and safety implications for those working with the process. The new technique introduces the use of a “sandwich structure”, comprising anode/insulator/cathode, directly in contact with each other and placed in an electrolytic etching cell. In this technique the same photolithography process is utilised to achieve selective etching on a metal substrate as in the PCM process. However, for the electrolytic etching stage, the inter- electrode gap (IEG) is reduced significantly from a few centimetres, as usually applied in electrochemical processes, to 4 μm. The intention behind this was to improve the current distribution experienced at the anode (Ti) during subsequent electrolytic etching. The sandwich structure was developed by deposition of a photoresist S 1818 and Copper (Cu) on top of Ti. Firstly, a manual sanding of the substrate was applied in order to eliminate the oxide layers which could strongly affect a final electrolytic etching. The soft- and hard-bake stages involved in the processing of the S 1818 resist were optimised to produce a stress-free Ti/S 1818 /Cu/S 1818 structure. Ultimately a pattern would be imparted onto the S 1818 /Cu/S 1818 that would ultimately be imparted through to the Ti layer during the last stage, electrolytic etching. In order to achieve this, a Cu electroless deposition was developed as a technique to obtain a conductive film which would act as a cathode during the electrolytic etching of the target, Ti layer. The results of the electrolytic etching of the Ti sandwich structure revealed flat-base profiles of half-etched (“half-etch” is the term used to signify an etch that does not penetrate completely through the thickness of the metal sheet) micro-holes in the Ti layer. The problem of delamination of the electroless Cu, in 10 % w/v HCl electrolyte used as an etchant, was solved by electroplating a 12 μm layer of Cu on top of the 60 nm Cu electroless deposited film. Using this technique, micro-features were achieved in Ti. The half-etched micro-holes were characterised to have an overall spherical shape corresponding to the imaged pattern and a preferred flat-base profiles (typically a raised land of material arises in conventional electrolytic etching). A series of parameters were tested in order to control the process of electrolytic etching through the Ti sandwich structure by measuring etch rate, surface roughness of the etched pattern and the <b>etch</b> <b>factor.</b> The applied current densities (CD) of 10, 15, 20, and 25 A/cm 2 showed proportional dissolution to the applied current. Electrolytic etching with a CD of 20 A/cm 2 demonstrated a high etch rate of 40 μm/min. and a relatively low Ra of 2. 8 μm, therefore, it was utilised in further experimental work. The highest etch rate of 50 μm/min. and an improved distribution of half-etched micro-holes was achieved by the introduction of 4 crocodile connectors (2 per electrode) and mechanically stirring of the electrolyte (800 rpm) while performing the electrolytic etching. The maximum etch depth of 143. 9 μm was produced in Ti when the electrolytic etching was performed at the same conditions for 3 minutes. The incorporation of ultrasonic agitation to the electrolytic etching and an electrolyte temperature of 130 C resulted in a decrease of the surface roughness of the etched micro-holes to 0. 5 μm. The results of the Ti sandwich structure electrolytic etching proved the concept of minimising the IEG in order to obtain a uniform Ti dissolution on a feature scale, improved control of the electrolytic dissolution over the whole area of the sample with utilisation of the lower hazard etchant at the same time...|$|E
40|$|Rates of alkali {{feldspar}} hydrolysis in the near-neutral pH range {{are up to}} 3 {{orders of}} magnitude slower in natural systems than in laboratory experiments. Correcting for differences in temperature between natural weathering and laboratory systems reduces the disparity {{by as much as}} a factor of 5. Any remaining disparity can be accounted for by differences in the ratio of effective surface area to total surface area; the ratio of effective-to-total surface area in natural systems is generally considerably smaller than in laboratory systems. This may be related, at least in part, to experimental preparation artifacts and to the fact that naturally weathered feldspars have lost much of their most reactive surface to the formation of <b>etch</b> pits.
