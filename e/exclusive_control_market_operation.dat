50|$|Next came {{long-range}} {{plans for}} dealing with the competitors themselves. Chief among these were the Japanese firm Yamaha, eating into OMC's European market, and Brunswick Corporation, makers of premium-priced Mercury outboards. A joint venture between Yamaha and Brunswick had produced a low-cost engine called Mariner; thus Brunswick then had an engine at both high and low ends of the market, leaving OMC sandwiched in the middle. With his newly united company behind him, Strang cleared this hurdle by slashing prices by 25 percent and also by making sure that all products offered by competitors were available in the OMC lineup. In another move, he bought out independent distributors overseas, thus gaining greater <b>control</b> over foreign <b>marketing</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the association and corporate behavior for {{a sample of}} manufacturing firms in India for the post-reform period 1992 - 2003. The findings suggest that a contractionary monetary policy lowers overall debt including bank debt, although the lagged response is positive, and listed firms increase their short-term bank borrowings, after monetary tightening. The responses of corporates to a monetary contraction in the post- 1997 period has been more pronounced. A disaggregated analysis of responses of firms according to size and leverage largely validates these findings. Two policy implications emerge from the analysis. First, the interest rate transmission channel has strengthened since 1998, and, second, corporates in India, especially listed ones, seem to exhibit relationship lending.

40|$|Liberalization and {{privatization}} {{are often}} associated with global demands for termination of state interference in business. The policy often result in dispute between neoliberalism and socialism. Neoliberalism perceives state interference in economic area as bad, damaging, an inefficient to economic life. State, which conduct the operation in political power logic, is perceived less or even not give the place for the expanding of healthy market structure and competitive. While socialism perceived state as central figure of economic with the centralized planning instrument and the ownership be on the hand of state. As economic system, socialism {{can be understood as}} an economic system in which the means of production, distribution, and exchange are publicly owned and operate. Since socialism assumes state as the most representative organization, so the meaning of owned and operated by public means the power of ownership and the mode of operation be on the hand of state. As political ideology, in its connection wit the economic control, socialism believe that the state should develop the economic planning and <b>control</b> on <b>market</b> <b>operation.</b> This paper prove that neoliberalism and the philosophy demands for termination of state role, in the reality, suffer a kind of paradox.

40|$|Abstract—The normal {{operation}} of real-time electrical market requires accurate state estimation in Smart Grid. However, recent {{research shows that}} strategically designed data integrity attacks can easily introduce errors into state estimation without being detected. From the perspective of attackers, this increases the chances of <b>controlling</b> real-time electrical <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> through manipulations of meter measurements. In this paper, we first reveal the intrinsic relations between data integrity attacks and real-time electrical market, and explicitly characterize their complex interactions as a process simulator. Then a simulation-based global optimization problem is formulated, from which an attacker could maximize financial incentives through constructed data integrity attacks. More importantly, we further consider the construction of data integrity attacks when power network topologies and parameters are unknown. A systematic construc-tion strategy is proposed based on recursive least square subspace estimation. As far as we know, our paper is the first attempt to attack real-time electrical market without network information. Finally, we evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed attacking strategies through numerical simulations in IEEE test systems. I...|$|R

40|$|To {{appropriate}} additional {{sources of}} fiscal revenue, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) started direct underwriting of new deficit-financing government bond, (GBs) (BOJ underwriting) on November 25, 1932. This paper examines the BOJ's underwriting policymaking process {{through the use}} of newly available archived documents from the BOJ and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Evidence from these documents contradicts conventional arguments that the BOJ was forced to underwrite GBs due to Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi's firm request and that it regarded the policy measure as temporary. Instead, the BOJ was confident it could exert monetary <b>control</b> through the <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> of selling underwritten GBs (selling operations). In addition, the BOJ willingly accepted the underwriting, expecting it to reinforce its influence over financial institutions. BOJ policymakers partly forecasted the course of events. First, the BOJ started underwriting during the Takahashi economic policy period (1931 - 36). Once it started, it was difficult for the BOJ to stop underwriting bonds. The BOJ was forced to continue underwriting deficit-financing bonds because of expanding financial demand. Second the MOF used very complex and irregular budgeting methods beginning with the budget process of fiscal 1936. This created a large deferred fiscal burden that concealed the realities of fiscal deficits. ...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 47). RobiAxiata Limited is the third largest telecommunication service provider in Bangladesh and, over time, it is steadily increasing its customer base and number of subscribers. In order to do so, Robi has to constantly increase its investment prospects to get an ideal return on invested capital. The decision to invest and which areas would provide the greatest return and least risk is crucial and must be made with care. So, Robi has to constantly analyze its potential and in which investment areas {{it is wise to}} deploy its Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) Previously, the system of CAPEX distribution lay solely in the <b>control</b> of the <b>Market</b> <b>Operations</b> and Technology. <b>Market</b> <b>Operations</b> would routinely send monthly demand forecast to the Technology division. The Technology department would then assess the areas where new technology is required or a new BTS implementation is required to send a budget requirement form to the Integrated Planning department of the Finance division. The finance division would then send the required CAPEX. The CAPEX deployed to these areas would be done without any intervention from the Finance department {{and there would be no}} financial calculations conducted, such as calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) or the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of these investment prospects. Thus, there was no way to calculate the required rate of return (RRR) of these projects and whether they will generate a net profit anytime soon. As a result, it was seen that, despite the large amounts of CAPEX deployed in these areas, there weren’t any profits being accumulated and the CAPEX was being tied down in loss generating investments.
