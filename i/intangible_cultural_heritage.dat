50|$|Because {{of strong}} German {{consumer}} preferences, labeling beer as being compliant with Reinheitsgebot {{is believed to}} be a valuable marketing tool in Germany.

States are also encouraged to enact programs to safeguard <b>intangible</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritages,</b> though any such work must be done in cooperation with the local practitioners.

It is worth mentioning that the kaba (an instrumental Albanian Isopolyphony included in UNESCO's <b>intangible</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> list) is characteristic of these ensembles.

5|$|Slavonia is a {{distinct}} region of Croatia in terms of ethnological factors in traditional music. It is a region where traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals. Typical traditional music instruments belong to the tamburica and bagpipe family. The tamburica is the most representative musical instrument associated with Slavonia's traditional culture. It developed from music instruments brought by the Ottomans during their rule of Slavonia, becoming {{an integral part of}} the traditional music, its use surpassing or even replacing the use of bagpipes and gusle. A distinct form of traditional song, originating in Slavonia, the bećarac, is recognized as an <b>intangible</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> by UNESCO.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} heritage of Slavonia is {{a blend of}} historical influences, especially those {{since the end of the}} 17th century, when Slavonia started recovering from the Ottoman wars, and its traditional culture.

In traditional music, Slavonia is a distinct region of Croatia, and the traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals, with prominence given to tamburica music and bećarac, a form of traditional song, recognized as an <b>intangible</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> by UNESCO. The cuisine of Slavonia reflects diverse influences—a blend of traditional and foreign elements. Slavonia is one of Croatia's winemaking areas, with Ilok and Kutjevo recognized as centres of wine production.|$|E

5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the <b>Intangible</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Heritage</b> of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but {{it is more likely that}} it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E

The city skyline is dominated by the Rova of Antananarivo, which was destroyed in a 1995 fire but are undergoing reconstruction. The nearby Andafiavaratra Palace was the home of 19th century Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony and currently contains a museum featuring historic artifacts of the Kingdom of Imerina, including items saved from the fire at the Rova. Downhill from the palaces is Andohalo square, where Merina kings and queens delivered speeches to the public. Tsimbazaza Zoo displays many of the island's unique animal species and a complete skeleton of the now-extinct elephant bird. Other historic buildings include the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal where Ranavalona I dispensed judgement, the second residence of Rainilaiarivony with its indigenous medicinal plant garden, the recently renovated Soarano railroad station, four late 19th century memorial churches built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs, the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and the early 20th century pavilions of the Analakely market.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} years the {{protection}} and safeguarding of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> has become a key issue of European cultural policy and this applies not only to tangible artefacts (monuments, sites, etc.), but also to <b>intangible</b> <b>cultural</b> expressions. The i-Treasures project focuses on some <b>Intangible</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Heritages</b> (ICH) and investigates whether {{and to what extent}} new technology can {{play a role in the}} preservation and dissemination of these expressions. To this aim, the project will develop a system, based on cutting the edge technology and sensors. The main purpose of this paper is to describe how the user requirements of this system were defined. The requirements definition process was based on a participatory approach, where ICH experts, performers and users were actively involved through surveys and interviews, and extensively collaborated in the complex tasks of identifying specificities of rare traditional know-how, discovering existing teaching and learning practices and finally identifying the most cutting edge technologies able to support innovative teaching and learning approaches to ICH. ...|$|R

However, since the Convention in 2003 and its operational directives have been ratified by many member states, Korea has fallen into confusion. There are some conflicts and differences between the Korea’s existing system and the UNESCO’s new one regarding the safeguarding measures. It is necessary to carefully consider the differences and distinctions between the two systems.
