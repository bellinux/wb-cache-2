50|$|Participants at midlife did not {{necessarily}} {{end up in the}} same social class as their fathers. There was <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> in the sample: 45% of men were upwardly mobile, 14% were downwardly mobile and 41% were socially stable. IQ at age 11 had a graded relationship with participant's social class. Same effect was seen for father's occupation. Men at midlife social class I and II (the highest, more professional) also had the highest IQ at age 11. Height at midlife, years of education and childhood IQ were significantly positively related to upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> while number of siblings had no significant effect. For each standard deviation increase in IQ score at the age 11, the chances of upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> increases by 69% (with a 95% confidence). After controlling the effect of independent variables, only IQ at age 11 was significantly inversely related to the <b>downward</b> in <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Which means that more years of education help a man to surpass his father's social class, and that low IQ makes a man prone to fall behind his father's social class.|$|R

5000|$|The main {{opposition}} to the drift hypothesis is the social causation thesis, which says social class position is causally related to the probability of mental illness. John W. Fox, from the University of Northern Colorado, conducted a study in 1990 that looked at previous studies concerning the relationship between social class and mental illness. These studies he looked at supported the drift hypothesis, but when he examined them, he found their conclusions were [...] "based on assumptions and methods that lacked empirical support." [...] Another statement in Fox's study was, in studies done on social class and mental illness, [...] "identify drift as an individual's <b>downward</b> intergenerational <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> after the onset of mental illness, rather than as residential drift from higher to lower class status areas". So depending on what one's definition of drift hypothesis is, there will be data either to support or refute the validity of it.|$|R

This article {{argues that a}} Rawlsian society would not provide any special protection against downward mobility, and would act rightly in declining to provide such protection. Special treatment for the downwardly mobile can be grounded neither in Rawls’s core principles—the basic liberties, fair equality of opportunity, and the difference principle—nor in other aspects of Rawls’s theory (the concept of legitimate expectations, {{the idea of a}} life plan, the distinction between allocative and distributive justice, or the distinction between ideal and nonideal theory). Instead, a Rawlsian society is willing to sacrifice particular individuals’ ambitions and plans for the achievement of justice, and offers those who lose out from justified change no special solicitude over and above the general solicitude extended to all. Rather than guaranteeing the maintenance of any particular individual or group’s economic position, it provides all of its members—the upwardly mobile, the downwardly mobile, and the immobile—a form of security that is at once more generous and more limited: that they will receive the liberties, opportunities, and resources promised by the principles of justice...|$|R

40|$|Compared {{to their}} White peers, ethnic {{minorities}} in England are often {{at higher risk}} of becoming unemployed, unable to find employment, {{and more likely to}} experience downward, rather than upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Qualifications, gender, age, marital status and migrant generation all play a role; but do not explain these ethnic inequalities, or ethnic penalties. Despite ethnic minorities being more likely to live in deprived neighbourhoods than Whites, research on ethnic inequalities in <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> has rarely taken account of the role of context. Neighbourhood deprivation may reduce life-chances for various reasons, and the concentration of ethnic minorities into deprived neighbourhoods may have additional influences for social mobility: some positive, but also some negative. In this thesis, I ask: does neighbourhood deprivation and ethnic composition explain the ethnic inequalities in <b>social</b> <b>mobility?</b> Using a longitudinal analysis of the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study, I tracked the intragenerational <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> of people living in urban areas of England between 1991 and 2001. Binary and multinomial logit regression models were fit with ethnicity as an independent variable to explore statistical differences between groups, and also for the White, Indian and Black Caribbean groups separately. My research shows that after controlling for education, couple status, {{and a number of other}} important characteristics, geography does play a role in life-chances; but does not fully explain the ethnic inequalities in <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> People in more deprived neighbourhoods tended to fare worse in all economic outcomes: more at risk of unemployment; less likely to find employment; more at risk of <b>downward</b> <b>social</b> class mobility; less likely to experience upward <b>social</b> class <b>mobility.</b> However, these results were statistically significant only among White people, with less consistent associations for ethnic minorities. Ethnic diversity had a positive influence upon outcomes (e. g. upward <b>social</b> class <b>mobility),</b> but only among White people. Positive outcomes were also more common among people living in the south of England. Place of birth was less important for <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> For policymakers attempting to reduce the geographical inequalities of deprivation and affluence, dissolving residential concentrations of minorities alone is unlikely to reduce the gap in life chances between Whites and ethnic minorities. No evidence was found to support the pejorative stereotyping of so-called ‘ethnically segregated’ neighbourhoods, which are some of the most diverse in England and, on balance, appear to improve the life chances of White people...|$|R

This report sheds new light on the debate on <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> in EU Member States and provides new evidence on patterns of intergenerational <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> It examines to what extent family background has determined people’s prospects for <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> over the last few decades.

The findings suggest that across different comparison targets, making downward (relative to upward) social comparisons was consistently related to reduced regret intensity over time among older adults. Among young adults, making <b>downward</b> <b>social</b> comparisons with personally known others, as opposed to age peers, was associated with lower regret intensity. In addition, older adults increased their reliance on <b>downward</b> <b>social</b> comparisons over time.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that social, educational, cultural and physical factors in childhood and early adulthood may influence the chances and direction of social mobility, the movement of an individual between social classes over his/her life-course. This study examined the association of such factors with intra-generational and inter-generational social mobility within the Newcastle Thousand Families 1947 birth cohort. Methods: Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the potential association of sex, housing conditions at age 5 years, childhood IQ, achieved education level, adult height and adverse events in early childhood with upward and <b>downward</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Results: Childhood IQ and achieved education level were significantly and independently associated with upward mobility between the ages of 5 and 49 - 51 years. Only education was significantly associated (positively) with upward social mobility between 5 and 25 years, and only childhood IQ (again positively) with upward social mobility between 25 and 49 - 51 years. Childhood IQ was significantly negatively associated with <b>downward</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Adult height, childhood housing conditions, adverse events in childhood and sex were not significant determinants of upward or <b>downward</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> in this cohort.
