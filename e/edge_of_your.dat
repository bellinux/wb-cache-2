GameSpot reviewer Bob Colayco summarized his review by stating that Call of Duty 2 has [...] "smooth, detailed graphics and great sound", as well as praising the artificial intelligence, realism, and variety in the campaign. GamePro called the game [...] "breathtaking", and commended the game for its [...] "strikingly realistic detail on weapons and walls, emphasized by normal mapping, exceptional shading and lighting, specular highlights, and some absolutely phenomenal particle effects". GameSpy editor Will Tuttle called it [...] "One of the finest FPSs ever created.

500|$|Dave Kehr gave {{a largely}} {{negative}} review; [...] "The film betrays no human impulse {{higher than that}} of a ten-year-old boy trying to gross out his baby sister by dangling a dead worm in her face." [...] Ralph Novak of People complained [...] "The ads that say 'this film may be too intense for younger children' are fraudulent. No parent should allow a young child to see this traumatizing movie; it would be a cinematic form of child abuse. Even Harrison Ford is required to slap Quan and abuse Capshaw. There are no heroes connected with the film, only two villains; their names are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas." [...] The Observer described it as [...] "a thin, arch, graceless affair." [...] The Guardian summarized it as [...] "a two-hour series of none too carefully linked chase sequences ... sitting on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> seat gives you a sore bum but also a numb brain." [...] Leonard Maltin gave the movie only 2 out of 4 stars, saying that the film is [...] "headache inducing" [...] and [...] "never gives us a chance to breathe", and chiding the gross-out' gags." ...|$|E

[...] Furthermore, Bryan {{believed}} that the series nine finale {{would have made a}} more fitting end to the series. Christopher Hootan stated [...] "it was with great trepidation that I sat down to watch the show's finale, which promised to put you so far on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> seat as to find your nose touching the TV screen. And it did not disappoint." [...] Hootan added [...] "as ever this was suitably peril-ridden with plenty of last minute airstrikes and time-sensitive interrogations, but the real tension lay with the fate of everyone's favourite po-faced head of operations, Harry Pearce." [...] With the Harry and Ruth storyline, the reviewer noted that the non-happy ending [...] "will annoy some," [...] but found Ruth's death [...] "a captivating bit of TV as Harry was left with the deaths of two past loves on his conscience." ...|$|E

[...] GameSpot awarded the game 8.5 out of ten and said [...] "This fast-paced racer keeps you glued to the TV and on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> seat regardless of {{which side of the}} law you're playing on." [...] Official Xbox Magazine gave the Xbox 360 version 7 out of 10, and said [...] "Hot Pursuit feels a little too safe for its subject matter, limited by pedestrian road design that doesn't express all the playfulness that we'd expect in car combat." [...] However, the UK edition of the magazine gave the game a 9 out of 10, and said [...] "It pays respect to the classic NFS games, borrows the best bits from Burnout and is a technical masterpiece.

[...] Sen also added that although the film has been impressively produced, it has been let down by the over-the-top acting by Khan, while other actors were underused and were given nothing much to do." [...] Rajeev Masand gave the film two out of five stars, calling it [...] "spectacularly boring", and wrote [...] "Don 2 is nicely shot, and there are moments where Shah Rukh Khan is riveting. But that’s not enough to hold your interest for well over two hours…even the actor’s most loyal fans will find themselves yawning." [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave 2.5 out of 5, feeling that the original film was better as compared to the sequel but praised the action sequences, writing [...] "The car chases are superb and will have you at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> seat. For the rest of the film though, you'll be slouching on that very seat, waiting for the thrills that the Don series promises."

2500|$|The film {{since its}} release, has been {{positively}} received by film critics. Toni Kan of ThisDay praised its cinematography, story and casting, concluding that: [...] "October 1 provokes {{a lot of}} questions and provides few answers but what is unequivocal is {{that at the end of}} the movie when the picture of the Queen is taken down, Kunle Afolayan, son of Ade Love, is crowned King". Onyeka Nwelue of The Trent, praised the artistic nature of the film, its subtle messages, and concluded: [...] "Mr. Afolayan incorporates facts into fiction to create an everlasting joy in this work. He is not one who is scared of exploring, and he does so beautifully. He takes his time to create. He takes his time to understand the people he is making films for. No matter how intellectually stimulating October 1 is, it can be enjoyed by anybody. At the end, one can easily say, Mr. Afolayan’s October 1 is for everyone who loves great films". Sodas and Popcorn, praised its production design, the performances from the actors, use of costumes, and also described the cinematography as [...] "the best work of art in Nigerian cinematic history". It commended the film for its attention to detail and concluded: [...] "Afolayan obviously had clear vision of what he set out to achieve and pushed his cast to give the best possible performance you could expect from them. The glory of the film, however, is in the fact that the story is not afraid to go there: explore the timeless themes of religion, ethnic rifts, corruption, abuse, pain and privilege. The film plays for 2 hours but there is enough suspense and laugh-till-your-sides-hurt humour to keep you at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> seat".|$|E

Then, if you were that kind of boy, you got some little chap to put his eye close to the shaft, with the hope of seeing Niagara Falls, and set your lips to the hole in the edge, and blew his eye full of pencil-dust. This was mean; and it was also mean to get some unsuspecting child to close the end of an elderwood tube with his thumb, and look hard at you, while you showed him Germany. You did this by pulling a string below the tube, and running a needle into his thumb. My boy discovered Germany in this way long before he had any geographical or political conception of it.|$|E

Giving their promise not to depart without permission, those four-and-twenty young bloods dieted all that day (manducaverunt) with the Lord Abbot, waiting for trial on the morrow.

Night coming on, they broke the bolts of the Town-Gates, and went off by violence!'[21] Was the like ever heard of?

Now try to make the lighter parts as dark as the rest, so that the whole may be of equal depth or darkness. You will find, on {{examining}} the work, that where it looks darkest the lines are closest, or there are some much darker lines than elsewhere; therefore you must put in other lines, or little scratches and dots, between the lines in the paler parts; and where there are any very conspicuous dark lines, scratch them out lightly with the penknife, for the eye must not be attracted by any line in particular. The more carefully and delicately you fill in the little gaps and holes the better; you will get on faster by doing two or three squares perfectly than a great many badly. As the tint gets closer and begins to look even, work with very little ink in your pen, so as hardly to make any mark on the paper; and at last, where it is too dark, use the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> penknife very lightly, and for some time, to wear it softly into an even tone. You will find that the greatest difficulty consists in getting evenness: one bit will always look darker than another bit of your square; or there will be a granulated and sandy look over the whole. When you find your paper quite rough and in a mess, give it up and begin another square, but do not rest satisfied till you have done your best with every square. The tint at last ought at least to be as close and even as that in b, Fig. 1. You will find, however, that {{it is very difficult to}} get a pale tint; because, naturally, the ink lines necessary to produce a close tint at all, blacken the paper more than you want. You must get over this difficulty not so much by leaving the lines wide apart as by trying to draw them excessively fine, lightly and swiftly; being very cautious in filling in; and, at last, passing the penknife over the whole. By keeping several squares in progress at one time, and reserving your pen for the light one just when the ink is nearly exhausted, you may get on better. The paper ought, at last, to look lightly and evenly toned all over, with no lines distinctly visible.|$|E
