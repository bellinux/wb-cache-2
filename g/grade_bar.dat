40|$|AbstractAnalytical and {{computational}} {{models are}} developed {{to predict the}} stress response of functionally <b>graded</b> curved <b>bars</b> under pure bending in elastic and partially plastic states of stress. In the analytical model, the modulus of elasticity and in the computational model, both the modulus of elasticity and the hardening parameter of the bar material are assumed to vary in the radial direction. The analytical model is based on Tresca’s yield criterion, its associated flow rule and ideal plastic material behavior, while the computational one is based on von Mises’ yield criterion, total deformation theory and a Swift type nonlinear hardening law. The models are verified not only {{in comparison to the}} published solutions, but also in comparison to each other. The results indicate that the variation of material properties, especially the variation of modulus of elasticity, strongly affects the deformation behavior of the <b>bar.</b> In a <b>graded</b> <b>bar,</b> yielding may commence at the inner, at the outer or simultaneously at both surfaces despite the fact that yielding initiates at the inner surface in a homogeneous bar...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{integral}} equation {{solution to the}} elastic-plastic problem of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>bars</b> under torsional loading is presented. The formulation is general {{in the sense that}} it can be applied to an arbitrary cross-section made of any type of elastoplastic material. In material science the Functionally Graded Material (FGM) is a non-homogeneous composite which performs as a single-phase material, by unifying the best properties of its constituent phase material. The nonlinear elastic-plastic behavior is treated by employing the deformation theory of plasticity. According to this theory, the material constants are assumed variable within the cross section, and are updated through an iterative process so as the equivalent stress and strain at each point coincide with the uniaxial material curve. In this investigation a new straightforward nonlinear procedure is introduced in the deformation theory of plasticity which simplifies the solution method. At each iteration step, the warping function is obtained by solving the torsion problem of a non-homogeneous isotropic bar using the Boundary Element Method (BEM) in conjunction with the Analog Equation Method (AEM). Without restricting the generality, the FGM material is comprised of a ceramic phase and a metal phase. The ceramic is assumed to behave linearly elastic, whereas the metal is modeled as an elastic-linear hardening material. Furthermore, the TTO homogenization scheme for estimating the effective properties of the two-phase FGM was adopted. Several bars with various cross-sections and material types are analyzed, in order to validate the proposed model and exemplify its salient features. Moreover, useful conclusion are drawn from the elastic-plastic behavior of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>bars</b> under torsional loading...|$|R
30|$|The {{quasi-static}} reversed {{cyclic loading}} test {{is the most}} commonly used method for testing components of earthquake-resistant structures in laboratory. Numerous cyclic loading tests of reinforced concrete beam-column joints have been extensively reviewed and assembled in several databases (Brooke and Ingham 2013; Kim and LaFave 2007; Lee and Hwang 2013) for various evaluations of design equations or analytical models. Brooke and Ingham (2013) assembled a database of 93 interior beam-column joint tests to evaluate the minimum joint depth; however, only 32 specimens had reinforcement grades of 490 or higher. The anchorage performance of higher <b>grade</b> <b>bars</b> has not been fully clarified. For high-strength reinforcement and concrete, Lee and Hwang (2013) also assembled a more comprehensive database consisting of 202 cruciform beam-column joints to assess current ACI 318 design provisions for the joint strength and confinement.|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} {{collision}} warning systems {{depends on how}} well the algorithm and driver interface are tailored to driver capabilities and preferences. An effective collision warning system must promote a timely and appropriate driver response while minimizing annoyance associated with nuisance warnings. A within-subject experimental design examined warning strategy and modality by contrasting graded and imminent warning strategies with auditory and haptic warning modalities. Presented on a high, head-down display placed {{directly in front of}} the driver, visual warnings were displayed in the form of <b>graded</b> <b>bars</b> representing severity, or by an imminent collision icon. Visual warnings were paired with either an auditory warning or a haptic warning in the form of a vibrating seat. Results suggest that haptic warnings may be preferred over auditory warnings, with graded haptic warnings being preferred more than imminent haptic warnings. These results support previous findings of greater acceptance of graded compared to imminent warnings, and no decrement in performance or acceptance of a haptic versus an auditory warning...|$|R
