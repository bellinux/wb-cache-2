Having only 3 electrode types (a filament, an anode and 10 different grids), the <b>driving</b> <b>circuit</b> for this tube was very simple, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it allowed a much wider viewing angle than for example nixie tubes which Nimo tried to replace.|$|E
50|$|It {{operates}} {{similarly to}} an injection locked oscillator. In an injection locked frequency divider, {{the frequency of}} the input signal is a multiple (or fraction) of the free-running frequency of the oscillator. While these frequency dividers tend to be lower power than broadband static (or flip-flop based) frequency dividers, the drawback is their low locking range. The ILFD locking range is inversely proportional to the quality factor (Q) of the oscillator tank. In integrated circuit designs, this makes an ILFD sensitive to process variations. Care must be taken to ensure the tuning range of the <b>driving</b> <b>circuit</b> (for example, a voltage-controlled oscillator) must fall within the input locking range of the ILFD.|$|E
