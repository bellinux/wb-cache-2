5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's Victorian home. His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage. This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his being a closeted homosexual. Bruce Bechdel had homosexual relationships in the military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters. At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the path of an oncoming Sunbeam Bread truck and was killed. Although the evidence is equivocal, Alison Bechdel concludes that her father committed suicide.|$|E

25|$|The pillaging of Polonnaruwa {{was to have}} dire {{consequences}} for Parākramabāhu. Angered {{by the actions of}} the forces from Dakkhinadesa, the nobles and allies of Gajabahu—including his general Gokanna—appealed to Manabharana of Ruhuna, who was at Sorabara, {{in the center of the}} country, for assistance. Despite having an alliance with Gajabahu, Manabharana had remained neutral in the war up till that point. Then, on the eve of Parākramabāhu's victory, <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the conflict and launched an invasion of Rajarata.|$|E

25|$|The {{win over}} the title-contending Cobb gave Norton another shot at a {{potential}} title-fight, and on May 11, 1981. at Madison Square Garden <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the ring with top contender Gerry Cooney, who, like Cobb, was undefeated entering the fight. Very early in the fight {{it became clear that}} Norton was no longer the caliber of fighter he once was, as Cooney's first punch caused Norton's legs to buckle. Norton continued to take shots from Cooney in his corner for nearly a full minute before Perez, who refereed his last fight, stepped in to stop the bout 54 seconds in, as Norton was slumped in his corner. Norton decided to retire following the match and turned his attention to charitable pursuits. Norton's enduring legacy as a fighter is that he is considered second to Joe Frazier as Ali's main nemesis and toughest opponent. Norton fought Ali to three decisions and was never hurt or knocked down. All three bouts were close and subject to controversy. Unfortunately, Norton was less successful against three of the greatest punchers of all time, losing by KO to Foreman and Shavers and by TKO to Cooney. Norton was considered past his prime in boxing from 1979 to 1981.|$|E
500|$|Charles Ellet and {{his team}} tied a heavier line to the kite string and pulled the joined lines across. [...] They pulled {{successive}} heavier and stronger lines across until the final bridge cable— thick—was hanging across the gorge. [...] The cable was suspended between two wooden towers [...] tall, and it was attached to an iron basket. Ellet planned to use this system as a basket ferry to shuttle workers and materials across the gorge, saving time that {{would otherwise have been}} spent on land and ferry travel. [...] Through media coverage and word-of-mouth, many people knew of Ellet's efforts and flocked to the site to watch the construction. [...] On March 13, 1848, the system was completed, and the team planned to test it by pulling the empty basket across. [...] They hit a snag when the basket kept getting stuck halfway and could not move ahead. [...] Pulling back the basket, Ellet decided to assure the watching crowd that the system was workable. [...] <b>He</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> the basket, and it moved towards the opposite shore. [...] When Ellet reached the problematic spot, he spotted the issue; the basket's rollers could not pass over a portion of the cable that had been accidentally flattened during the construction. [...] He fixed the problem and proceeded to cross to the Canadian side and back, becoming the first person to cross the gorge. [...] Although the bridge companies had prohibited Ellet from collecting tolls, he charged each person $1.00 for the chance to [...] "observe first hand the engineering wonder of bridging the Niagara". [...] On some days, the basket ferry conveyed up to 125 people across the gorge.|$|E

It was also taught that Ahiman built Anath, Sheshai built Alush, and Talmai built Talbush.

When Graham arrived, <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>into</b> a club where the players' morale was low; he started work immediately by {{sorting out the}} team's defence and Leeds became [...] "bore draw" [...] specialists, finishing the 1996–97 season in 11th place. He made some astute purchases, notably Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Bruno Ribeiro, and also introduced Australian youngster Harry Kewell from the youth team. [...] Under Graham, Leeds finished the 1997–98 season in 5th place, qualifying for the following season's UEFA Cup.
