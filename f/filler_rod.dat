The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid.

Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a <b>filler</b> <b>rod</b> may be used, but usually not.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{laboratory tests}} of arc-welded T-joints between equal width rectangular hollow sections (called “matched box connections” in ANSI/AWS D 1. 1 - 2000 Structural Welding Code). The brace and chord members were cold-formed with a nominal yield stress of 350 MPa. The welds were laid using MMAW and GMAW processes without profiling the brace ends. The brace of each specimen was loaded in tension to failure with the chord supported continuously {{so as not}} to induce significant bending effects. The test results showed that the joint strength can be improved by using backing strips for the butt (or groove) welds, while backing <b>rods</b> (or <b>filler</b> <b>rods)</b> should not be used as they led to larger variation in joint strengths, and often, inferior strengths. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the IIW Recommendations and Eurocode 3, Part 1. 8.

By varying the PES concentration and curing temperature, {{we found that the}} incorporation of attapulgite and CaSO 4 had dramatic impact on the phase separation process and the final phase morphology of blends. In blends at higher content than critical concentration, the process of phase separation was retarded by the incorporation of nanoscale fillers but accelerated by that of the micron-sized fillers, mainly due to the enhanced viscoelastic effect and the preferential wettable effect, respectively. Meanwhile both mesoscale fillers could change the cocontinuous phase structure of blends with lower PES content than critical concentration into PES-rich dispersed structure due to the surface affinity of fillers to epoxy matrix...|$|R

The preliminary assessment of the weldability revealed no propensity for hot cracking under conditions of high restraint. This result is significant, because hot cracking has been reported for all other leading aluminum lithium alloys welded with certain conventional filler alloys. The strengths for Weldalite parent welded with parent filler obtained were higher than those for alloys used in launch systems, such as 2219 and 2014 welded with 2319 and 4043 fillers, respectively.

40|$|A homogenized limit {{analysis}} {{model for}} the prediction of collapse loads and failure mechanisms of masonry walls reinforced with near surface bed joint GFRP bars is presented. Reinforced masonry homogenized failure surfaces are obtained {{by means of a}} compatible identification procedure, where each brick is supposed interacting with its six neighbors by means of finite thickness mortar joints, filler epoxy resin and FRP rods. In the framework of the kinematic theorem of limit analysis, a simple constrained minimization problem is obtained on the unit cell, suitable to estimate – with a very limited computational effort – reinforced masonry homogenized failure surfaces. A FE strategy is adopted to solve the homogenization problem at a cell level, modeling joints, bricks, <b>filler</b> and FRP <b>rods</b> by means of eight-noded infinitely resistant parallelepiped elements. A possible jump of velocities is assumed at the interfaces between contiguous elements, where plastic dissipation occurs. For mortar and bricks interfaces, a frictional behavior with possible limited tensile and compressive strength is assumed, whereas for epoxy resin and FRP bars some formulas available in the literature are adopted in order to take into account in an approximate but effective way, the delamination of the bar from the epoxy and the failure of the filler at the interface with the joint. In order to validate the model proposed, two meaningful examples are critically analyzed. The first relies on a reinforced masonry beam in four-point bending, whereas the second is a full scale wall constrained at three edges and loaded until failure with a distributed out-of-plane pressure. While the first example is useful to test the model at a cell level, since only horizontal ultimate bending moment is involved in the failure mechanism, the second provides a full assessment of the procedure proposed at a structural level. In both cases, very good agreement is found with literature data, meaning that the model proposed may provide useful information for all practitioners interested in the design of masonry walls reinforced with bed joint FRP bars...|$|R

40|$|Masonry curved structures, as for {{instance}} arches, domes and vaults, are very diffused in historical and existing structures and usually require seismic upgrading and/or rehabilitation. Where FRP external strips cannot be applied for some reasons, {{the utilization of}} FRP bars embedded near the external surface becomes a very interesting and effective alternative. In this paper, a kinematic Finite Element limit analysis model to predict collapse loads and failure mechanisms of masonry curved structures reinforced with near surface mounted FRP bars regularly distributed is presented. Reinforced masonry homogenized failure surfaces are obtained {{by means of a}} compatible identification procedure, where a central brick is supposed interacting with its neighbors by means of finite thickness mortar joints, filler epoxy resin and FRP rods. In the model, it is required only that the curved structure results from a periodic disposition of bricks, mortar and FRP bars. Therefore, any pattern (multi-leaf, multi-head and single leaf) may be potentially investigated with the procedure proposed. In the framework of the kinematic theorem of limit analysis, a simple constrained minimization problem is obtained on the unit cell, suitable to estimate – with a very limited computational effort – reinforced masonry homogenized failure surfaces. A FE strategy is adopted to solve the homogenization problem at a cell level, modeling joints, bricks, <b>filler</b> and FRP <b>rods</b> by means of 8 -noded infinitely resistant parallelepiped elements.

In order to validate the model proposed, two numerical examples are analyzed, consisting of a circular masonry arch and a hemispherical dome. For both the examples presented, comparisons with experimental evidences, where available, and alternative non-linear FE procedures are reported. Reliable predictions of collapse loads and failure mechanisms are obtained with the model proposed for all the cases analyzed, meaning that the approach may be used by practitioners for a fast and reliable evaluation of the effectiveness of a strengthening intervention...|$|R
40|$|Soy {{methyl ester}} {{polystyrene}} (SME-PS) {{is an alternative}} sealer that has been put {{through a variety of}} tests in the lab. The goal of this research is to quantify the sealer’s effectiveness at protecting concrete in the field. SME-PS is comprised of a renewable resource and a waste product; soybeans and waste styrofoam respectively. SME-PS is hydrophobic and absorbs into the surface of the concrete therefore, it reduces the ingress of water and other materials contained in the water such as deicers. Moreover, it has proven to have similar performance compared to other sealing techniques in shorter, more aggressive tests. ^ However, a need exists to understand the performance of SME-PS over longer periods of time. Approximately 4 years ago, two field locations located in Indiana - one on US 231 in Lafayette and another on 126 th Street in Fishers - were sealed with SME-PS to address this need. ^ This work revisits these sites to identify if any new damage has occurred since the time of SME-PS application. Cores were taken from the two test sections. A new test method was developed to test sealer performance in concrete pavements. This test uses a titration technique to determine chloride ingress {{from the surface of the}} concrete pavement saw cut. SME-PS shows similar performance in some locations while in others the chloride content is 20 % higher when compared to the <b>filler</b> and backer <b>rod.</b> Compared to the unsealed pavement joints, both SME-PS and filler/backer rod sealant show a reduction in chlorides of about 40 - 50 %. One observation made while preparing some of the cores for titration was that the depth of the saw cut varied greatly which start to influence results since deicers come in from the top surface. Another important caveat of the titration test is that it does not distinguish between free chlorides and bound chlorides. It is important to account for these discrepancies when interpreting the results of the test and subsequently determining sealer performance. ^ This work encompasses the first results obtained from the field. It is important to continue sampling in order to determine how long the SME-PS compares with current sealants over a longer duration of time. In addition to the two locations on Indiana roads, 60 concrete slabs made according to Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) specifications were cast at the Center for Aging Infrastructure (CAI). These slabs are exposed to the environment and deicers are sprayed on the surface to accelerate chloride ingress. Continuing data acquisition from these two experiments will help users understand how long their concrete remains sealed and when reapplication is recommended. ^ The second portion of the work highlights the mixture of SME-PS with a luminescent powder for use as a glow in the dark (GITD) concrete sealer. The luminescent powder, strontium aluminate, luminesces in the dark after being excited by light. The luminescent sealer could be used to increase concrete service life, supplement streetlights, and increase the travelling public’s safety at night. A test procedure was developed to quantify the sealer luminance and duration. Quantification of the sealer’s luminescent properties is key to evaluating the performance. The results of the tests indicate the sealed luminescent surface emits light (i. e., glows) for approximately 1 to 50 hours in a dark space after excitation depending on application rate, particle size, exposure time and orientation in the field. ...|$|R
