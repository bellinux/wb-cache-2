40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the effects of three {{different}} <b>internal</b> bank <b>ratings</b> - Risk-, Property- and Creditworthiness-Rating - on the loan maturity. We use a sample of about 5, 000 loans given to sole proprietors and corporate borrowers by two German banks from January 2003 till July 2005. The estimation results for corporate borrowers are consistent with Diamond's (1991) predictions of non-monotonic relationship between ratings and maturity. The best rated and the worst rated loans tend to have shorter maturities than loans with an intermediate rating. However, our results for sole proprietors conflict with the predictions of Diamond and with the majority of the empirical literature. We find a negative association between ratings and maturity of the loans given to sole proprietors. loan maturity, <b>internal</b> bank <b>ratings,</b> risk of default, creditworthiness...|$|R

40|$|How good is “good”? Based on the {{assumption}} that asymmetric information exists between decentralized relationship managers who create soft information in credit rating systems and a bank’s management, this study deals theoretically and empirically with the existence of rater effects in bank <b>internal</b> credit <b>ratings.</b> If relationship managers have an incentive to manipulate credit ratings, the ratings cannot be easily compared, rating fairness is reduced. Psychometric methods such as Latent Trait and Latent Class Models allow the user to identify patterns in the data, representing different rating strategies. By making use of this information, i. e. by considering the entire data matrix instead of total sums, the classification power of soft data can be considerably increased. To achieve this improvement, no additional information is needed. Since the credit rating literature has remained largely silent on this topic so far and a real-life data set is used, we consider our findings truly unique. key words: asymmetric information, bank <b>internal</b> credit <b>ratings,</b> soft facts, qualitative information, rater effects, fairness of credit ratings, psychometric method...|$|R

40|$|The Basle Accord of 1988 regulates {{how much}} equity banks must set aside as a cushion against the default risk.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{issues in}} evaluating banks ’ <b>internal</b> <b>ratings</b> of borrowers, drawing upon {{six years of}} <b>internal</b> <b>ratings</b> data from JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale exposures to perform a ratings migration analysis. While ratings agencies have previously conducted these studies based upon publicly rated debt, {{this is the first}} published study based on a bank’s <b>internal</b> <b>ratings.</b> Ratings migration analysis entails the actuarial estimation of transition probabilities for obligor credit risk ratings, with emphasis on estimation of empirical default probabilities. Measurement of changes in borrower credit quality over time is important as obligor risk ratings are a key component of a bank’s credit capital methodology. These analyses permit banks to more accurately assess and price credit risk, as well as improve their assessment of loss reserves and portfolio capital requirements. Key objectives of an <b>internal</b> <b>ratings</b> migration study include: 92 The RMA Journal April 2004 • Evaluating how well a bank differentiates risk on an ordinal basis. • Examining the consistency of obligor ratings across different lines of business (LOBs) or customer types, to suggest guidance in the risk-rating process. • Evaluating {{the extent to which a}} bank’s rating philosophy is influenced by current conditions or longer-term, through-the-cycle considerations. • Exploring how to satisfy Basel II regulatory requirements for validating the use of probabil-ities of default (PDs) associated with a bank’s ratings. Measurement of rating accuracy includes the notions of ordinal as well as cardinal accuracy. Ordinal accuracy tests the effectiveness of the ratings system in distinguishing credit risk on a relative basis. One can gauge ordinal accuracy by comparing agency ratings or default probability estimates (e. g., KMV EDFs TM) for a common universe of obligors. Cardinal accuracy is related to the validation of risk ratings by comparing realized default rates to assumed default rates. Analysis of a bank’s rating an...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{underlying}} tenets of both personality and social psychological theory assumes that questionnaire respondents have access to their thoughts and feelings. The same tenet underlies the various reversal theory states (e. g., telic/paratelic, negativism/conformity, autic mastery /sympathy, alloic mastery/sympathy), so that individuals who are more internally focused should have better access to their internal states and have higher <b>internal</b> consistency <b>ratings</b> across all measures. To evaluate this tenet, 620 participants recruited from a community sample completed a questionnaire that included the Motivational Style Profile and three self-focus measures: self-monitoring, identity formation, and private self-consciousness. Participants were divided (by median split) into low and high self-focus categories for each measure.

Although much {{research}} has been done on external ratings, much less is known about banks 4 <b>internal</b> <b>ratings.</b> This paper presents new quantitative evidence on the consistency of <b>internal</b> <b>ratings</b> based on panel data from the complete business loan portfolios of two Swedish banks and a credit bureau over the period 1997 - 2000. We study rating class distributions, - transitions and default behavior and compute the credit loss distributions that each rating system implies by means of a semi-parametric Monte Carlo re-sampling method following Carey (1998). Our results reveal, for a portfolio with identical counterparts, substantial differences in the implied riskiness between banks. Such differences could translate into different amounts of required economic capital and create (new) incentives to securitize part of their loan portfolios or increase the riskiness of loans in certain rating classes. We also shed light on the quantitative importance of portfolio composition, portfolio size and the forecast horizon for loss distributions. For example, with common portfolio parameters, credit risk can be reduced by up to 40 percent by doubling the loan portfolio size. We also discuss the relation between loss distributions and the desirable level of insolvency risk...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{examined}} two {{specific aspects of}} stage 1 of the (BIS’s) Bank for International Settlement’s proposed reforms to the 8 % risk-based capital ratio. We argue that relying on “traditional” agency ratings could produce cyclically lagging rather leading capital requirements, resulting in an enhanced rather than reduced degree of instability in the banking and financial system. Despite this possible shortcoming, we believe that sensible risk based weighting of capital requirements {{is a step in}} the right direction. The current risk based bucketing proposal, which is tied to external agency ratings, or possibly to <b>internal</b> bank <b>ratings,</b> however, lacks a sufficient degree of granularity. In particular, lumping A and BBB (investment grade corporate borrowers) together with BB and B (below investment grade borrowers) severely misprices risk within that bucket and calls, at a minimum, for that bucket to be split into two. We examine the default loss experience on corporate bonds for the period 1981 - 1999 and propose a revised weighting system which more closely resembles the actual loss experience on credit assets. ...|$|R
40|$|Credit risk {{concentration}} {{is one of}} the leading topics in modern finance, as the bank regulation has made increasing use of external and <b>internal</b> credit <b>ratings.</b> Concentration risk in credit portfolios comes into being through an uneven distribution of bank loans to individual borrowers (single-name concentration) or in a hierarchical dimension such as in industry and services sectors and geographical regions (sectorial concentration). To measure single-name concentration risk the literature proposes specific concentration indexes such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, the Gini index or more general approaches to calculate the appropriate economic capital needed to cover the risk arising from the potential default of large borrowers. However, in our opinion, the Gini index and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index can be improved taking into account methodological and theoretical issues which are explained in this paper. We propose a new index to measure single-name credit concentration risk and we prove the properties of our contribution. Furthermore, considering the guidelines of Basel II, we describe how our index works on real financial data. Finally, we compare our index with the common procedures proposed in the literature on the basis of simulated and real data.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} further {{insights into}} the nature of relationship lending by analyzing the link between relationship lending, borrower quality and collateral as a key variable in loan contract design. We used a unique data set based on the examination of credit files of five leading German banks, thus relying on information actually used in the process of bank credit decision-making and contract design. In particular, bank <b>internal</b> borrower <b>ratings</b> serve to evaluate borrower quality, and the bank's own assessment of its housebank status serves to identify information-intensive relationships. Additionally, we used data on workout activities for borrowers facing financial distress. We found no significant correlation between ex ante borrower quality and the incidence or degree of collateralization. Our results indicate that the use of collateral in loan contract design is mainly driven by aspects of relationship lending and renegotiations. We found that relationship lenders or housebanks do require more collateral from their debtors, thereby increasing the borrower's lock-in and strengthening the banks' bargaining power in future renegotiation situations. This result is strongly supported by our analysis of the correlation between ex post risk, collateral and relationship lending since housebanks do more frequently engage in workout activities for distressed borrowers, and collateralization increases workout probability...|$|R
