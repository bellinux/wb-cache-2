5|$|By {{this point}} the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding {{suggested}} that the Mk. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough for operational testing purposes. On 11 June 1939, AI was given the highest priority and provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to No 25 squadron at RAF Hawkinge (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were unfamiliar with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on the sets.|$|E

He claimed to have quit using illicit drugs on 5 June 1998. Gallagher stated in 2001, [...] "I liked drugs, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at them.

An avid figure skater {{throughout much of}} his life, Bain won over a dozen titles, the last of which came {{at the age of}} 56, and he continued to skate until the age of 70; he remained a competitive athlete until 1930. On his skill in a variety of sports, Bain once said that [...] "I couldn't see any sense in participating in a game unless <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good.</b> I kept at a sport just long enough to nab a championship, then I'd try something else." ...|$|E
500|$|Music {{is still}} an {{important}} part of Murphy's life. In 2004, he said, [...] "The only extravagant thing about my lifestyle is my stereo system, buying music and going to gigs". He no longer plays in a rock band, but regularly plays music with friends and on his own, and still writes songs. Murphy does not plan to start another band: [...] "Even if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good,</b> the very notion of being an actor with a rock band on the side would mean I'd never be taken seriously". Murphy is also a dedicated runner. In 2015, he was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed men in Britain.|$|E

After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for two years to study art. Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting {{changed the course of}} her life, Fonda saying, [...] "I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It {{was the first time that}} anyone, except my father – who had to say so – told me <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good.</b> At anything. It was a turning point in my life.

While attending a rehearsal for a workshop at the Oval House, a fire eater was teaching people how to eat fire {{and he decided to}} join. A circus agent saw him busking and hired him for three years. He later trained for three years as an actor at the Drama Centre London. Brosnan has described the feeling of becoming an actor and the impact it had on his life: [...] "When I found acting, or when acting found me, it was a liberation. It was a stepping stone into another life, away from a life that I had, and acting was something <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at, something which was appreciated. That was a great satisfaction in my life." ...|$|E

Manager Alex Inglethorpe {{described}} him by saying [...] "He's 24 {{years of age}} and he fits the bill of the type of player that will help us next season. I liken him to Tim Cahill of Everton. He likes to get forward and score goals, and has a good grounding in both League and non-League football." [...] Challinor made his debut in a 2–0 win away to Gravesend & Northfleet on 13 August 2005, before scoring his first goal on 3 September in a 2–2 away to Dagenham & Redbridge. He scored in a 4–0 win over former club Aldershot on 26 December 2005, during which he was targeted by opposition fans, after his former manager Terry Brown claimed he left Aldershot for financial reasons. After the match, Challinor said [...] "I got one over on the manager and proved him wrong, he didn't think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough. Their fans were at me throughout the game but it only made me focus more." [...] He finished 2005–06 with 13 goals in 48 appearances for Exeter.|$|E

2500|$|The Collective {{originally}} {{started out}} as an informal gathering of friends (many of them related to one another) who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment on East 36th Street in New York City to discuss philosophy. Barbara Branden said the group met [...] "because of a common interest in ideas". Greenspan recalled being drawn to Rand because of a shared belief in [...] "the importance of mathematics and intellectual rigor". The group met at Rand's apartment {{at least once a}} week, and would often discuss and debate into the early morning hours. About these discussions, Greenspan said, [...] "Talking to Ayn Rand was like starting a game of chess thinking <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good,</b> and suddenly finding myself in checkmate." [...] Eventually, Rand also allowed them to begin reading the manuscript of Atlas Shrugged (1957) as she completed it. As the years went on, the Collective would proceed to play a larger, more formal role, promoting Rand's philosophy through the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI). Some Collective members gave lectures at the NBI in cities across the United States and wrote articles for its newsletters, The Objectivist Newsletter (1962–1965) and The Objectivist (1966–1971).|$|E
