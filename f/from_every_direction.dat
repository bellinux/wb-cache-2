5|$|There are {{two main}} classes of comet: short-period comets (also called {{ecliptic}} comets) and long-period comets (also called nearly isotropic comets). Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits, below 10AU, and follow the ecliptic plane, the same plane in which the planets lie. All long-period comets have very large orbits, {{on the order of}} thousands of AU, and appear <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>direction</b> in the sky. Oort noted that there was a peak in numbers of long-period comets with aphelia (their farthest distance from the Sun) of roughly 20,000AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution.|$|E

25|$|The baldacchino is surmounted {{not with}} an {{architectural}} pediment, like most baldacchini, but with curved Baroque brackets supporting a draped canopy, like the brocade canopies carried in processions above precious iconic images.

The baldacchino stands as a vast free-standing sculptural object, central to and framed by the largest space within the building. It is so large that the visual effect {{is to create a}} link between the enormous dome which appears to float above it, and the congregation at floor level of the basilica.

25|$|Battle Action Tanks: This {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular rides at Motorworld, and it was {{featured}} prominently in the television ads. In a chainlink fence-enclosed area, small tanks could be driven around, for a fee, for five minutes at a time, with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a sensor prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other tankers often took advantage of the delay to pepper the stricken vehicle with more fire. Visitors on the outside could also join in the fun through less costly cannons mounted on the inside of the fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which usually happened several times a day, they were often pelted with tennis balls <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>direction</b> despite prohibitions against such behavior that could result in expulsion from the park. This gave the tank ride a reputation for being more dangerous for the employees than the patrons, making it the least popular place to work in the park. It is not known if there were any serious injuries from the tank ride. As of 2012, the area has not been redeveloped and only a vacant lot remains.|$|E

Joseph Simmons published the pamphlet ABC of the Invisible Empire in Atlanta in 1917; in it, he identified the Klan's goals as [...] "to shield {{the sanctity of the}} home and the chastity of womanhood; to maintain white supremacy; to teach and faithfully inculcate a high spiritual philosophy through an exalted ritualism; and by a practical devotedness to conserve, protect and maintain the distinctive institutions, rights, privileges, principles and ideals of a pure Americanism". Such moral-sounding purpose underlay its appeal as a fraternal organization, recruiting members with a promise of aid in settling in the new urban societies of rapidly growing cities such as Dallas and Detroit.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} polarizing reviews.

They do note however that the album sounds [...] "a little formulaic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] at times. Spin gave the album a 7/10, saying [...] "Thing is, dubstep's slithering textures actually suit Davis' demented croon". Henry Northmore from The List gave the album a rating of 4/5 saying that [...] "the purists (both metal and dubstep) will probably hate it, {{but if you are}} willing to have your brain assaulted <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>direction</b> by a new Frankensteinian metal/beats hybrid, you’ll find an album packed with pure adrenaline".

On 21 February, the Patricias left the small village of Sangsok and headed north to their assigned objective of a new hill called Hill 419. This hill was defended by the Chinese. The Patricias D Company led by Captain J.G. Turnbull were to attack but the ridge of the hill gave an easy line of sight for the Chinese. The Canadians took fire <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>direction</b> from cannons, rockets and small arms fire. They were under intense fire. Their attack was postponed for 36 hours but they kept up aggressive patrols and eventually the Australians gained control of Hill 619. The Australians taking Hill 619 made the Chinese leave Hill 419 and the Canadians took the hill without serious opposition. From 21 to 28 February, the Patricias suffered 10 killed and more than 21 wounded. The operation ended on 6 March 1951.|$|E
