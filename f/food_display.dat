40|$|Abstract Background Supermarkets play a {{major role}} in {{influencing}} the food purchasing behaviours of most households. Snack food exposures within these stores may contribute to higher levels of consumption and ultimately to increasing levels of obesity, particularly within socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. We aimed to examine the availability of snack <b>food</b> <b>displays</b> at checkouts, end-of-aisle displays and island displays in major supermarket chains in the least and most socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods of Melbourne. Methods Within-store audits of 35 Melbourne supermarkets. Supermarkets were sampled from the least and most socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs within 30 km of the Melbourne CBD. We measured the availability of crisps, chocolate, confectionery, and soft drinks (diet and regular) at the checkouts, in end-of-aisle displays, and in island bin <b>displays.</b> Results Snack <b>food</b> <b>displays</b> were most prominent at checkouts with only five stores not having snack foods at 100 % of their checkouts. Snack foods were also present at a number of end-of-aisle displays (at both the front (median 38 %) and back (median 33 %) of store), and in island bin displays (median number of island displays: 7; median total circumference of island displays: 19. 4 metres). Chocolate items were the most common snack <b>food</b> item on <b>display.</b> There was no difference in the availability of these snack <b>food</b> <b>displays</b> by neighbourhood disadvantage. Conclusions As a result of the high availability of snack <b>food</b> <b>displays,</b> exposure to snack foods is almost unavoidable in Melbourne supermarkets, regardless of levels of neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage. Results of this study could promote awareness of the prominence of unhealthy food items in chain-brand supermarkets outlets. </p...|$|R

50|$|In Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, fresh areca nut, betel leaf or 'fruit leaf' (daka in PNG) {{and lime}} are sold on street corners. In these countries, dried or {{flavoured}} areca nut is not popular. Betelnuts there {{are referred to}} in Tok Pisin as buai, and the red spit from them, {{as well as their}} shells and rubbish thrown out along with the spit, is called buai pekpek. There has recently been a controversial ban on selling and chewing betelnuts and spitting buai pekpek in Port Moresby. Because of this, many people have tried to smuggle betelnuts into Pom Town. Notably, there was a raid in Hanuabada in May 2015 where several bags of betelnut were confiscated, the total value of the confiscated nut sacks exceeding $180,000 USD. Areca nut chewing has recently been introduced into Vanuatu, where it is growing in popularity, especially in the northern islands of the country.In Guam and the neighboring Northern Mariana Islands, betel and areca nut chewing is a social pastime as a means to extend friendship, and can be found in many, if not most, large gatherings as part of the <b>food</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E

40|$|With {{increased}} {{concern about}} the impact of refrigerant leakage on global warming, a number of new supermarket refrigeration system configurations requiring significantly less refrigerant charge are being considered. In order to help promote the development of advanced systems and expand the knowledge base for energy-efficient supermarket technology, the International Energy Agency (IEA) established IEA Annex 26 (Advanced Supermarket Refrigeration/Heat Recovery Systems) under the ''IEA Implementing Agreement on Heat Pumping Technologies''. Annex 26 focuses on demonstrating and documenting the energy saving and environmental benefits of advanced systems design for food refrigeration and space heating and cooling for supermarkets. Advanced in this context means systems that use less energy, require less refrigerant and produce lower refrigerant emissions. Stated another way, the goal is to identify supermarket refrigeration and HVAC technology options that reduce the total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) of supermarkets by reducing both system energy use (increasing efficiency) and reducing total refrigerant charge. The Annex has five participating countries: Canada, Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The working program of the Annex has involved analytical and experimental investigation of several candidate system design approaches to determine their potential to reduce refrigerant usage and energy consumption. Advanced refrigeration system types investigated include the following: distributed compressor systems [...] small parallel compressor racks are located in close proximity to the <b>food</b> <b>display</b> cases they serve thus significantly shortening the connecting refrigerant line lengths; secondary loop systems [...] one or more central chillers are used to refrigerate a secondary coolant (e. g. brine, ice slurry, or CO 2) that is pumped to the <b>food</b> <b>display</b> cases on the sales floor; self-contained display cases [...] each <b>food</b> <b>display</b> case has its own refrigeration unit; low-charge direct expansion [...] similar to conventional multiplex refrigeration systems but with improved controls to limit charge. Means to integrate store HVAC systems for space heating/cooling with the refrigeration system have been investigated as well. One approach is to use heat pumps to recover refrigeration waste heat and raise it to a sufficient level to provide for store heating needs. Another involves use of combined heating and power (CHP) or combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems to integrate the refrigeration, HVAC, and power services in stores. Other methods including direct recovery of refrigeration reject heat for space and water heating have also been examined...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure for the simulation of fogging and defogging phenomena is presented and {{is applied to}} the prediction of the demisting process on the glass door of a refrigerated closed display cabinet. The physical problem depends on the flow field along the glass. {{both inside and outside the}} refrigerated cabinet, on the unsteady conduction through the multi-glazed door and on the heat and mass transfer phenomena within the thin water layer on the fogged surface. Thus a suite of routines for the unsteady simulation of the water layer evolution is coupled with FVM solvers for the Navier Stokes and energy equations inside the cabinet and for the conduction problem in the glass. The convective heat transfer coefficient on the exterior side of the glass door is evaluated through empirical correlations. The codes are iterated simultaneously to reproduce the physical transient. before, during and after the door opening. Simulations are carried out for a frozen <b>food</b> <b>display</b> cabinet with an air curtain flowing alone the internal side of the door. Both activated and deactivated configurations of the electric heaters inside the glass are considered. The results show a good agreement with the experimental ones and highlight the importance of taking into account the shape and the distribution of the dew droplets. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} air and product temperatures in refrigerated <b>food</b> <b>display</b> cabinets, the evaporator coils, which are normally located {{in the base of}} the cabinets, operate at temperatures below the freezing point of water. The air which is circulated over the evaporator coil is cooled below its dew point and water vapour present in the air condenses and eventually freezes on the coil surface. With continuous operation of the coil, frost will accumulate on the coil surface leading to a decrease both in the air owrate and in the overall heat transfer coef cient. In order to maintain satisfactory performance, evaporator coils are defrosted periodically. Although different defrost control strategies can be employed, for simplicity and cost considerations, defrosting in supermarket refrigeration systems is usually controlled by a pre-set time cycle. It is widely acknowledged, however, that time-based defrost may cause a number of unnecessary defrost cycles and this reduces the energy ef ciency of the refrigeration systems as well as the accuracy of temperature control of the cabinets. Implementing defrost only when it is needed or on ‘demand ’ should reduce the number of defrost cycles and lead to savings in energy and improved product quality. This paper reports on eld and experimental investigations on the processes of frosting and defrosting of medium-temperature display cabinet evaporator coils. The results show that for medium-temperature refrigeration application...|$|E
40|$|In the {{supermarket}} environment three different groups must be considered: food (food quality), personnel (working conditions) and customers. Customers {{are of particular}} interest since they make up the commercial basis for {{the supermarket}}. Currently, however, there are no recommendations on the indoor environment for this category. To start a discussion on this topic {{and to provide a}} tentative recommendation, this thesis presents a state-of-the-art overview related to different systems and their operation in supermarkets as well as theories for the thermal balance of humans, display cabinets and refrigerated food. Few studies compare the perceived indoor thermal environment in supermarkets based on questionnaires with simultaneous measurements of the thermal environment. In this thesis the findings of such investigations in the cold environment of chilled <b>food</b> <b>display</b> cabinets are discussed. The basic hypothesis is that objective measures can be used in order to estimate the perceived thermal environment sufficiently well, with the following assumptions and limitations: •	the comfort equation in ISO 7730 can be used to estimate the perceived thermal comfort (Predicted Mean Vote, PMV), in a supermarket. •	the comfort equation can be used outside its verified range in terms of thermal gradients and residence time sufficiently well to prescribe suitable thermal environments for customers and personnel in supermarkets. •	the mean temperature at the point of residence is more important for the perceived comfort than the temperature gradient between ankle and head. •	questionnaires can be used to evaluate thermal comfort for customers and personnel in a supermarket environment. This work shows {{that it is possible to}} use objective measurements in order to estimate the perceived thermal environment in supermarkets, with some limitations. Perceived and predicted PMV have shown systematic interdependence. In summer, however, differences between the measures tend to be larger. For customers, the perceived PMV is lower during the summer. The perception, however, is not as low as the predicted PMV would indicate. One reason is probably that in summer customers are wearing light clothes, light indoor shoes and are more exposed to the cold environment than the case would be in winter. However, customers do not stay very long in this environment and it is not necessary to account for a long exposure time in the cold environment. As a result of this work the thesis proposes some guiding principles for an appropriate thermal environment in chilled food aisles and discusses some ideas for future work...|$|E
