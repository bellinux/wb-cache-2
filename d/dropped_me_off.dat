5000|$|Born to a Seventh-day Adventist mother Pauline McCaulsky and Rastafarian father, Edwards {{received}} his musical calling {{at the age}} of seven, when he began singing in the church. He grew up in a small community in Rural St. Andrew, Jamaica called King Weston District. Recognizing his talent, his parents introduced him to Mr. Wong, a record producer from Portmore, St. Catherine. [...] "I did not take it seriously," [...] said Edwards [...] "My family members have always been carrying me to Portmore to see him, but I usually disappear. One day, they <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> at his studio and left me and it all began there." ...|$|E

They put me with Stretch {{who they were}} cool with. Stretch became my brother immediately. He wasn’t really recognized for the great work he was doing with Tupac and the hardcore records he did with his own group Live Squad with his brother Majesty. ... Stretch was really hurt by Tupac. I would hear him talking about how Pac was so mad at him because Stretch was with Tupac when he got set up and robbed in the studio lobby. Tupac was mad at everyone after that. I felt bad for Stretch because he really {{had a lot of}} love for Pac and he couldn’t believe that Pac thought he {{had something to do with}} it. the recording session, Stretch <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> at home and went home and he was killed. That was a real great guy. He produced [...] "Take It In Blood" [...] and [...] "Silent Murder" [...] - the irony. It was just a messed up moment for me. It was the last work he did. Very sad." ...|$|E
5000|$|After the on-field {{presentation}} an induction {{ceremony was}} held in Gillette Stadium. Each player presented a story from his soccer experience. Pope recounted his first youth national team experience. Pope's coach at the University of North Carolina, Elmar Bolowich, set up {{an invitation to the}} national team training camp, which was run by head coach Bob Gansler. Despite a surprisingly poor initial performance, Gansler allowed Pope to attend a second camp. Earnie Stewart's fear of flying was referenced in his introduction by teammate Claudio Reyna and Stewart's own address, in which he stated, [...] I’d like to thank Dutch coach Rinus Michels. I was going to the airport and my fear of flying was terrible, so my wife <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> for a flight to California. I said to myself, ‘This is it, I’m quitting, I’m never going to play for the U.S. soccer team ever again.’ I told my wife to come pick up me because I’m hanging it up. All of a sudden, I saw Rinus Michels -- and I {{never got a chance to}} tell him — he was there. At that moment, I thought, ‘If such an important person is going to step on this plane, what can happen to me?’ I step on, I called my wife again and told her : ‘Forget what I said.’ I am so very glad I decided to do that because it's been a fantastic ride. Earnie Stewart Stewart continued by referencing his departure from D.C. United on somewhat rocky terms and later his continued commitment to the U.S. National Team, despite spending most of his life in the Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has been}} twenty one {{years in the}} making. I remember the first day my father <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> at school. The year was 1987 and I have been in school ever since that September morning. For the past twenty one years, therefore, I have been gathering {{the knowledge and skills}} that have enabled me to write this dissertation. I have met many many people along the way whom I am indebted to, yet I will only have the chance to thank a handful. I would like to start by thanking my undergraduate advisor Dr. Aydan Erkmen for persuading me to earn my doctorate’s degree. Without her encouragement and contagious idealism, this dissertation would not have happened. I {{would also like to thank}} my master’s advisor Dr. Hamid Krim for giving me the opportunity to pursue my graduate studies in the United States. It has been an honor for me to work with Dr. Jose C. Principe, who for the past four years has guided me with uncanny wisdom, endless patience and witty humor. He always reminded me that knowledge is not a static entity that you put into boxes in your brain and close the lid once you are done using it, rather knowledge is dynamic. I hop...|$|E
40|$|On {{arriving}} at the University of Queensland, I walked from where the taxi <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> towards the Great Court. As I walked I could see the carvings in the sandstone on the façade of the building in front of me. The carvings depict images of land, flora, fauna, settlers, and us. In {{the corner of my}} right sight of vision, I could see Mayne Hall. My mind flicked back in what was an instant to a time 30 plus years ago. I remember putting on some of my best clothes when my family would travel form the suburb of Inala to the Alumni book fair held in the Hall. We needed to act ‘discrete’ and like we were ‘meant to be there’. Members of my family would work hard to save money to buy the books that had far more substance than the books at our local community or school library. This was my first interaction with the University of Queensland. On the first day of Courting Blakness, I walked towards and then into the Great Court. I began to explore and engage with the artworks and allow them to engage with me. I was conscious of being in the University of Queensland as I had been on all my past visits. I was conscious of the public and the private aspects of the artworks along with the public observance and surveillance of the viewers of the artworks. The contradictions and struggles that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experience are everywhere when moving in spaces and places, including universities. They contain prevailing social, political and economic values {{in the same way that}} other places do. The symbols of place and space within universities are never neutral, and they can work to either marginalise and oppress Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, or demonstrate that they are included and engaged. The artworks in the Great Court were involved in this matrix of mixed messages and the weaves of time contained the borders of the Court and within the minds of those present...|$|E

5000|$|After {{advocating the}} death penalty for Chelsea (then Bradley) Manning on 30 July 2013 in the Daily News, Kirchick was invited to appear on Russias RT TV network live panel {{discussion}} awaiting Mannings sentencing on Wednesday, 21 August 2013. He accepted; however, once {{it was his turn to}} speak, Kirchick refused to discuss Mannings sentencing, instead choosing to protest the Russian LGBT propaganda law. When asked by RT news editor Ivor Crotty if he was ready to have a conversation about Manning with the assembled panel, Kirchick retorted angrily: [...] "RT has been Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden 24/7. I havent seen anything on your network about the anti-gay laws that have been passed in Russia and the increasing climate of violence and hostility towards gay people." [...] That account was objected by one of the programs hosts who said they had a panel discussing it only the day before. Tweeting shortly after the segment, Kirchik claimed RT [...] "just called taxi company that took me to studio to <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> on the side of the highway on way to Stockholm airport".|$|R
5000|$|Born in Berkeley, California, Cometbus {{started writing}} fanzines in 1981 with Jesse Michaels (later of Operation Ivy and Common Rider) and {{started his own}} after Michaels moved to Pennsylvania in October 1981. He became an active {{participant}} in the Gilman Street Project and was a founding member of Crimpshrine, a highly influential East Bay punk rock band which also featured Jeff Ott. In a September 2016 interview Cometbus described how his personal life is not necessarily reflected in his zines stating, [...] "Growing up, I was just really, really restless. I felt cooped up. Every band interview I did was about being on the road. When I finally got to cut loose, I went on three tours in two years, then had the band <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> in the first city where I could find a room. So I’d made it out, but then came the news: my mom had cancer. I spent the next fifteen years going back and forth—caretaking first her and then my dad when they were doing badly, and when they were in remission, I’d get as far away as I could. When both were dead, I moved to New York, where I’ve lived ever since. That’s my life, in a nutshell. Which answers your earlier question about how much the fanzine reflected my personal life. Not so much." ...|$|R
