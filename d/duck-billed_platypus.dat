5|$|Other {{ichthyosaur}} remains {{had been}} discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings {{was the first to}} come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking {{it was a kind of}} fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus</b> (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps, more {{important}} is the limitation of some entire orders to certain well-defined portions of the globe. Thus the Proboscidea, comprising the single family and genus of the elephants, and the Hyracoidea, that of the Hyrax or Syrian coney, are confined to parts of Africa and Asia; the Marsupials to Australia and America; and the Monotremata, the lowest of all mammals--comprising the <b>duck-billed</b> <b>Platypus</b> and the spiny Echidna, to Australia and New Guinea. Among birds the Struthiones or ostrich tribe are almost confined to the three Southern continents, South America, Africa and Australia; and among Amphibia the tailed Batrachia--the newts and salamanders--are similarly restricted to the northern hemisphere.|$|E
60|$|Section 41. The supposition, {{that the}} general {{characters}} of the rabbit's ovum were stamped upon it as an heritage from a period when the ancestors of the mammals were egg-laying reptiles, is strengthened {{by the fact that}} the two lowest and most reptile-like of all the mammalia, the <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus</b> and the echidna, have been shown to depart from the distinctive mammalian character, and to lay eggs. And, in further confirmation of this supposition, we find, in tracing the mammals and reptiles back through the geological record, that in the Permian and Triassic rocks there occur central forms which combine, in a most remarkable way, reptilian and mammalian characteristics.|$|E
60|$|The {{earliest}} mammals, {{like the}} earliest birds, were creatures driven by competition and pursuit {{into a life}} of hardship and adaptation to cold. With them also the scale became quill-like, and was developed into a heat-retaining covering; and they too underwent modifications, similar in kind though different in detail, to become warm-blooded and independent of basking. Instead of feathers they developed hairs, and instead of guarding and incubating their eggs they kept them warm and safe by retaining them inside their bodies until they were almost mature. Most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought their young into the world alive. And even after their young were born they tended to maintain a protective and nutritive association with them. Most {34} but not all mammals to-day have mammæ and suckle their young. Two mammals still live which lay eggs and which have not proper mammæ, though they nourish their young by a nutritive secretion of the under skin; these are the <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus</b> and the echidna. The echidna lays leathery eggs and then puts them into a pouch under its belly, and so carries them about warm and safe until they hatch.|$|E
6000|$|From such a {{rude and}} {{indefinite}} beginning natural selection, {{aided by the}} various concomitant principles, has slowly built up the pedigree of man. Starting from these remote half-invertebrate forms, whose vague shape is still perhaps in part preserved for us by the soft and jelly-like larva of the modern ascidian, we rise by long stages {{to a group of}} early fishes, like the lancelet itself. From these the ganoids and then the lung-bearing mudfish must have been gradually developed. From such fish a very small advance would carry us on to the newts and other amphibians. The <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus</b> helps us slightly to bridge over the gap between the reptiles and the lower mammals, such as the kangaroo and the wombat, though the connection with the amphibians is still, as when Darwin wrote, highly problematical. From marsupials, such as the kangaroo, we ascend gradually to the insectivorous type represented by the shrews and hedgehogs, and thence once more by very well-marked intermediate stages to the lemurs of Madagascar, a group linked on the one hand to the insectivores, and on the other to the true monkeys. The monkeys, again, 'branched off into two great stems--the New World and Old World monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote period, man, the wonder and glory of the universe, proceeded.' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{brain of}} a fish is very small, {{compared}} with the spinal cord into which it is continued, and with the nerves which come off from it: of the segments {{of which it is}} composed--the olfactory lobes, the cerebral hemisphere, and the succeeding divisions--no one predominates so much over the rest as to obscure or cover them; and the so-called optic lobes are, frequently, the largest masses of all. In Reptiles, the mass of the brain, relatively to the spinal cord, increases and the cerebral hemispheres begin to predominate over the other parts; while in Birds this predominance is still more marked. The brain of the lowest Mammals, such as the <b>duck-billed</b> <b>Platypus</b> and the Opossums and Kangaroos, exhibits a still more definite advance in the same direction. The cerebral hemispheres have now so much increased in size as, more or less, to hide the representatives of the optic lobes, which remain comparatively small, so that the brain of a Marsupial is extremely different from that of a Bird, Reptile, or Fish. A step higher in the scale, among the placental Mammals, the structure of the brain acquires a vast modification--not that it appears much altered externally, in a Rat or in a Rabbit, from what it is in a Marsupial--nor that the proportions of its parts are much changed, but an apparently new structure is found between the cerebral hemispheres, connecting them together, as what is called the 'great commissure' or 'corpus callosum.' The subject requires careful re-investigation, but if the currently received statements are correct, the appearance of the 'corpus callosum' in the placental mammals is the greatest and most sudden modification exhibited by the brain in the whole series of vertebrated animals--it is the greatest leap anywhere made by Nature in her brain work. For the two halves of the brain being once thus knit together, the progress of cerebral complexity is traceable through a complete series of steps from the lowest Rodent, or Insectivore, to Man; and that complexity consists, chiefly, in the disproportionate development of the cerebral hemispheres and of the cerebellum, but especially of the former, in respect to the other parts of the brain.|$|E

50|$|Until recently, electroreception {{was known}} only in vertebrates. Recent {{research}} has shown that bees can detect the presence and pattern of a static charge on flowers. Electroreception is found in lampreys, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, chimaeras), lungfishes, bichirs, coelacanths, sturgeons, paddlefishes, catfishes, gymnotiformes, elephantfishes, monotremes, and at least one species of cetacean. The electroreceptor organs in all these groups are derived embryologically from a mechanoreceptor system. In fishes they are developed from the lateral lines. In most groups electroreception is passive, where it is used predominantly in predation. Two groups of teleost fishes are weakly electric and engage in active electroreception; the Neotropical knifefishes (Gymnotiformes) and the African elephantfishes (Notopteroidei). A rare terrestrial exception is the Western long-beaked echidna which has about 2,000 electroreceptors on its bill, compared to 40,000 for its semi-aquatic monotreme relative, the <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mammals - {{which appear}} in the fossil record after the first fishes, amphibians, and {{reptiles}} - are the only vertebrates to possess the evolutionarily recent, outermost part of the cerebral cortex known as the neocortex.The neocortex of monotremes (the <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus</b> and several species of spiny anteaters) and of marsupials (such as kangaroos, koalas, opossums, wombats, and Tasmanian devils) lack the convolutions - gyri and sulci - found in the neocortex of most placental mammals (eutherians).Within placental mammals, the size {{and complexity of the}} neocortex increased over time. The area of the neocortex of mice is only about 1/100 that of monkeys, and that of monkeys is only about 1/10 that of humans. In addition, rats lack convolutions in their neocortex (possibly also because rats are small mammals), whereas cats have a moderate degree of convolutions, and humans have quite extensive convolutions. Extreme convolution of the neocortex is found in dolphins, possibly related to their complex echolocation.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the broadcast, Parker and Stone said [...] "Damien" [...] {{would be}} the first episode in which Kenny would not be killed; ultimately, however, Kenny was shot by Jimbo {{at the end of the}} {{pay-per-view}} fight. Kenny is turned into a <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus</b> in the episode, which Parker said was done because, [...] "Duck billed platypuses are something I've always been infatuated with. They're just so bizarre." [...] In the original script, Pip, the unpopular British student inspired by the character of the same name in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, was originally supposed to be killed and permanently removed from the show after [...] "Damien", in which Damien projects Pip into the air and blows him up in a shower of fireworks. However, Parker and Stone decided they should not kill any student characters except for Kenny, so they decided not to kill Pip and to bring him back for future episodes.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Jesus is disheartened by the town's lack {{of faith}} in him, {{and he does not}} retaliate to Satan's attacks against him, despite Satan's {{apparent}} taunting of [...] "hit me". Chef and the children make it {{for the end of the}} fight and offer Jesus some words of encouragement. Inspired, Jesus finally throws a single weak punch. However, Satan then takes a dive and goes down for the count. Afterward, Satan reveals that his plan had, in fact, been to bet on Jesus and then throw the fight, winning him a lot of money and real estate from the South Park residents. The townspeople are angered by this, until Stan reminds them that Jesus told them not to bet on Satan. The whole town then asks forgiveness of Jesus, who accepts the apology. Kenny dies when Jimbo identifies him as a rare <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus</b> and shoots him. Damien bids goodbye to Stan and Kyle since his dad [...] "is always on the move" [...] he has to leave. Meanwhile, Cartman has continued his party even after kicking everyone out and having eaten all the food himself.|$|E
5000|$|The Homestead and Melville House museum have {{developed}} special programs through the years, {{such as their}} Christmas holiday celebrations when the farmhouse is [...] "...decorated in the style and traditions of Alexander Graham Bell's American wife Mabel, with stockings stuffed full of oranges and toy trinkets." [...] Costumed interpreters and slide presentations also provide the public with a more personal and comprehensive experience. They have additionally earned plaudits for their dedication to authenticity, with one reviewer writing: [...] "Although the house is kept as a historic site, it has a comfortable look of habitation about it. Freshly pressed, embroidered linens hang {{on the side of}} the bathtub, a basket of needlework waits to be completed and clothes hang in the bedrooms.Amidst all these homey little touches, are some of the Bell family's possessions, which serve as a clue to the kind of clever, inventive mind that thrived in these surroundings. In the parlor hangs a trompe-l'œil print of Saint Cecilia that looks as if it has been framed behind broken glass....Just as bizarre is the stuffed <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus</b> which sits in the study among the books and telephone wires. It was brought from Australia in 1874 by visiting relatives who must have thought it just the right sort of offbeat souvenir for the Bells." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{entire town}} bets on Jesus {{to win the}} fight, but begin to lose faith when Satan appears for the weigh-in. He is huge and weighs a little over 320 lb, while Jesus weighs a mere 135 lb, and the {{citizens}} of South Park begin changing their bets. Jesus confronts the South Park residents about their changed betting slips after learning only one person is still betting on Jesus to win. Distraught, Jesus asks Stan, Kyle and Chef to help him train. Damien gets counseling from Mr. Mackey, who recommends he just try being nice {{no matter what the}} other children do, just like with unpopular British child Pip. Damien tries to apologize to the boys for setting fire to the playground and turning Kenny into a <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus,</b> stating that he was [...] "doing his father's bidding" [...] and {{he did not have a}} choice. The boys, however, still continue to act negatively towards Damien. Cartman's birthday party begins, as does the fight. Damien and Pip arrive uninvited to the party, but the children finally accept Damien after he hurls Pip in the air and makes him explode in a shower of fireworks. However, a furious Cartman ends his party early after opening Kyle's present to discover that it's not what he had in mind.|$|E
50|$|Dr Redfern takes Maturin to see Padeen Colman, {{recovering}} in {{the hospital}} from his severe flogging for absconding from the penal colony. Maturin and Martin journey inland of Sydney to examine the local flora and fauna and collect specimens. On a second trip, they stay with Paulton in the Hunter Region, and find Padeen in better shape, assigned to work out there as Maturin had arranged. The Irishman was convicted for stealing laudanum from an Edinburgh apothecary, meriting the punishment of transportation to this penal colony. Maturin tells Padeen {{to meet him at}} Bird Island on the day Surprise is to sail. This plan is checked by Aubrey, who promised to take no escaped prisoners, leaving Maturin in a quandary. Maturin hears from Hastings of the recently arrived Waverley that his wife Diana had a daughter in April, and he is overjoyed, but tells no one else his good news. Maturin and Martin, keen to have one more look for the <b>duck-billed</b> <b>platypus,</b> locally named the 'water-mole', are taken on a final expedition in the cutter by Barret Bonden. Maturin and Martin search the local pools and spot two platypuses. Maturin manages to secure one - a male - in his net but his arm is pierced by its two poison-spurs. When the Surprise arrives to pick them up, Padeen is also taken aboard. To everyone's relief Maturin slowly regains consciousness after he is aboard.|$|E
