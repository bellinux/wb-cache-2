Gears come in several sizes: 8 tooth, 16 tooth, 24 tooth and 40 tooth spur gears; 12 tooth, 20 tooth and 36 tooth <b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> gears; and 12 tooth and 20 tooth single bevel gears. The <b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> gears are cut so they can also be meshed as spur gears. There is also a 16 tooth clutch gear, and a 24 tooth friction gear that slips when a certain amount of torque is put on it to prevent motors from damaging any parts or burning themselves out.|$|E

40|$|Two {{methods of}} mixing noise {{modification}} were studied for supersonic jets flowing from rectangular nozzles with an aspect ratio {{of about five}} and a small dimension of about 1. 4 cm. The first involves nozzle geometry variation using either single (unsymmetrical) or <b>double</b> <b>bevelled</b> (symmetrical) thirty degree cutbacks of the nozzle exit. Both converging (C) and converging-diverging (C-D) versions were tested. The <b>double</b> <b>bevelled</b> C-D nozzle produced a jet mixing noise reduction of about 4 dB compared to a standard rectangular C-D nozzle. In addition all bevelled nozzles produced an upstream shift in peak mixing noise which is conducive to improved attenuation when the nozzle is used in an acoustically treated duct. A large increase in high frequency noise also occurred near {{the plane of the}} nozzle exit. Because of near normal incidence, this noise can be easily attenuated with wall treatment. The second approach uses paddles inserted {{on the edge of the}} two sides of the jet to induce screech and greatly enhance the jet mixing. Although screech and mixing noise levels are increased, the enhanced mixing moves the source locations upstream and may make an enclosed system more amenable to noise reduction using wall acoustic treatment...|$|R
50|$|Generally, cutting axes have {{a shallow}} wedge angle, whereas {{splitting}} axes have a deeper angle. Most axes are <b>double</b> <b>bevelled,</b> i.e. symmetrical {{about the axis}} of the blade, but some specialist broadaxes have a single bevel blade, and usually an offset handle {{that allows them to}} be used for finishing work without putting the user's knuckles at risk of injury. Less common today, they were once an integral part of a joiner and carpenter's tool kit, not just a tool for use in forestry. A tool of similar origin is the billhook. However, in France and Holland, the billhook often replaced the axe as a joiner's bench tool.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>bevel</b> or {{compound}} bevel — A back bevel, {{similar to}} a sabre or flat grind, is put on the blade behind the edge bevel (the bevel which is the foremost cutting surface). This back bevel keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a single bevel, sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a single bevel blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the bevel is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double bevels are common {{in a variety of}} edge angles and back bevel angles, and Western kitchen knives generally have a <b>double</b> <b>bevel,</b> with an edge angle of 14-16° (included angle of 28-32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).|$|E
50|$|A broadaxe is a large-(broad) headed axe. There are two {{categories}} of cutting edge on broadaxes, both are used for shaping logs by hewing. On one type, one side is flat {{and the other side}} beveled, a basilled edge, also called a side axe, single bevel, or chisle-edged axe. On the other type, both sides are beveled, sometimes called a <b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> axe, which produces a scalloped cut.On the basilled broadaxe the handle may curve away from the flat side to allow an optimal stance by the hewer in relation to the hewn surface. The flat blade is to make the flat surface but can only be worked from one direction and are right-handed or left-handed. The <b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> axe has a straight handle can be swung with either side against the wood. A double beveled broad axe can be used for chopping or notching and hewing. When used for hewing, a notch is chopped {{in the side of the}} log down to a marked line, called scoring. The pieces of wood between these notches are removed with an axe called joggling and then the remaining wood is chopped away to the line.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>bevel</b> knives {{are those}} {{made in the}} Western tradition. They are {{generally}} thinner at the spine but often thicker behind the edge. They are made to not steer left or right during the cut. They do not require as much care or knowledge to perform adequately as single bevel knives. Japan adopted French and German cutlery ideas after World War II and hybridized them to fit Japanese cutting techniques and culture. Knives are often flatter than their European counterparts.|$|E
5000|$|Chisel grind — As on a chisel, {{only one}} side is ground (often at an edge angle of about 20 - 30°); the other remains flat. As many Japanese culinary knives tend to be chisel ground they are often sharper than a typical <b>double</b> <b>bevelled</b> Western culinary knife; a chisel grind has only a single edge angle; if a sabre ground blade has the same edge angle as a chisel grind, it still has angles {{on both sides of}} the blade centerline, and so has twice the {{included}} angle. Knives that are chisel ground come in left and right-handed varieties, depending upon which side is ground. Japanese knives feature subtle variations on the chisel grind: firstly, the back side of the blade is often concave, to reduce drag and adhesion so the food separates more cleanly; this feature is known as urasuki. Secondly, the kanisaki deba, used for cutting crab and other shellfish, has the grind on the opposite side (left side angled for right-handed use), so that the meat is not cut when chopping the shell.|$|R
40|$|Understanding screech is {{especially}} important for the design of advanced aircraft because screech can cause sonic fatigue failure of aircraft structures. Although the connection between shock-cell spacing and screech frequency is well understood, the relation between non-uniformities in the shock-cell structures and the resulting amplitude, mode, and steadiness of screech have remained unexplored. This paper addresses the above issues by intentionally producing spanwise (larger nozzle dimension) variations in the shock-cell structures and studying the resulting spanwise screech mode. The spanwise oblique shock-cell structures were produced using imperfectly expanded convergent-divergent rectangular nozzles (aspect ratio = 5) with nonuniform exit geometries. Three geometries were studied: (a) a nozzle with a spanwise uniform edge, (b) a nozzle with a spanwise oblique (single bevelled) edge, and (c) a nozzle that had two spanwise oblique (<b>double</b> <b>bevelled)</b> cuts to form an arrowhead-shaped nozzle. For all nozzles considered, the screech mode was antisymmetric in the transverse (smaller nozzle dimension) direction allowing focus on changes in the spanwise direction. Three types of spanwise modes were observed: symmetric (1), antisymmetric (2), and oblique (3). The following significant results emerged: (1) for all cases the screech mode corresponds with the spanwise shock-cell structure, (2) when multiple screech modes are present, the technique presented here makes it possible to distinguish between coexisting and mutually exclusive modes, (3) the strength of shocks 3 and 4 influences the screech source amplitude and determines whether screech is unsteady. The results presented here offer hope for a better understanding of screech and for tailoring shock-containing jets to minimize fatigue failure of aircraft components...|$|R

50|$|Single bevel knives are knives {{made in the}} Japanese {{tradition}} and have an omote (front or face on the right for right-handers), a shinogi (where the front bevel meets the flat of the blade face), and a urasuki (backside hollow to release food). These knives are usually a little thicker at the spine and body than Japanese double bevels but are thinner right behind the edge. They leave a better surface finish but the produce must bend a further distance due to the thickness. These are the knives of the established traditional Japanese cuisine and were originally developed from <b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> knives from China. They are sharpened along the single bevel by applying pressure to the shinogi to raise it and to the edge. Honbadzuke is the initial sharpening to form a flat surface along {{the perimeter of the}} urasuki to strengthen it, straighten the backside, and lay geometry for future sharpening. The omote is sharpened much more than the urasuki {{in order to maintain the}} function of the single bevel. Kansai style knives usually have pointed tip for use standing up (which helps in decorative tip work) and Edo style knives have a square tip for use sitting down (which makes a more robust working knife). The standard Japanese knife kit includes the yanagiba, deba, and usuba. They are essential to Washoku (Japanese cuisine).|$|E
5000|$|The most {{development}} of small economy cars occurred in Europe. There was {{less emphasis on}} long-distance automobile travel, a need for vehicles that could navigate narrow streets and alleys in towns and cities (many were unchanged since medieval times), and the narrow and winding roads commonly found in the European countryside. Ettore Bugatti designed a small car for Peugeot. The 1911 Peugeot Bébé Type 19. It had an 850 cc 4-cylinder engine. The Citroën Type A was the first car produced by Citroën from June 1919 to December 1921 in Paris. Citroën had been established to produce the <b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> gears that its logo resembles, but had ended the First World War with large production facilities, from the production of much needed artillery shells for the French army. Andre Citroen was a keen adopter of U.S. car manufacturing ideas and technology in the 1920s and 1930s. Andre Citroen re-equipped his factory as a scaled down version of the Ford River Rouge Plant, that he had visited in Detroit Michigan. It was advertised as [...] "Europe's first mass production car." [...] The Type A reached a production number of 24,093 vehicles. The Opel 4 PS, Germany's first 'peoples car', popularly known as the Opel Laubfrosch (Opel Treefrog), was a small two-seater car introduced by the then family owned auto maker Opel, early in 1924, which bore an uncanny resemblance to the little Torpedo Citroën 5 CV of 1922.|$|E

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) as alternatives to conventional austenitic {{stainless steels}} {{for the construction of}} pipelines is becoming more wide-spread, particularly for sour service applications where corrosion resistance / stress corrosion cracking resistance is required in aggressive chloride / sulphide environments. While these steels show many superior characteristics, limitations are associated with the welding of these steels, particularly controlling the weld structure and properties and understanding how the weld metallurgy may influence the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC). The focus {{of this paper is to}} report on the findings from a detailed study of the various weld sections within a DSS pipeline, as a function of heat input and type of weld, in terms of the metallurgical structure, composition and mechanical properties and to assess the susceptibility to IGC. Welding was performed using the manual Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) technique at both high and low heat input conditions. Two different join configurations (<b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> single V bevel and <b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> single U joint configuration) were adopted. Structural analysis consisted of (i) optical microscopy of welded specimens; (ii) ferrite content determination; (iii) Vickers hardness measurements; (iv) Charpy impact studies and (v) transverse tensile testing. Two test methods namely a modified ASTM A 262 and a modified Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation (DL-ERP) test was used to determine susceptibility to IGC. The electrolyte solution used was 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 + 0. 001 M TA (thioacetamide). The test was conducted at 60 ºC. The potential was scanned from - 500 mV (SCE) to + 200 mV (SCE) and back to - 500 mV (SCE) at a rate of 1. 67 mV/s. The ratio of the reactivation charge to the passivation charge was calculated. From the results obtained it can be shown that the fill region was most susceptible to IGC for all weld conditions...|$|E
40|$|Resonators {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of electronic products. They provide a stable reference frequency to ensure the operation of these products. Recently, the electronic products have the trend of miniaturization, which rendered the size reduction of the resonators as well [1]. Better design of the resonators relies on a better understanding of the crystals ' nonlinear behavior [2]. The nonlinearities affect the quality factor and acoustic behavior of MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System) and nano-structured resonators and filters [3]. Among these nonlinear effects, Drivel Level Dependence (DLD), which describes the instability of the resonator frequency due to voltage level and/or power density, is an urgent problem for miniaturized resonators [2]. Langasite and GaPO 4 are new promising piezoelectric material. Resonators made from these new materials have superior performance such as good frequency-temperature characteristics, and low acoustic loss [2]. In this thesis, experimental measurements of drive level dependence of langasite resonators with different configurations (plano-plano, single bevel, and <b>double</b> <b>bevel)</b> are reported. The drive level dependence of GaPO 4 resonators are reported as well for the purpose of comparison. The results show that the resonator configuration affects the DLD of the langasite resonator. Experiments for DLD at elevated temperature are also performed, and it was found that the temperature also affects the DLD of the langasite resonator. i...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{small size}} planar {{monopole}} antenna operating from 0. 1 to 1100 MHz is proposed. A planar monopole antenna constructed with 148 mm x 64 mm of radiating element and 80 mm square of ground plane {{is suitable for}} cognitive radio (CR) applications where it can cover a very high frequency and a partial of ultra high frequency (UHF) band for spectrum sensing. The proposed monopole antenna is designed by combining a beveling technique and resistor lumped element loading by employing FR 4 substrate for low-cost intention. The integration of the resistor with <b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> contributes to the behavior of an inductor as more current are excited to the ground eventually making the radiating element becomes more magnetic. Furthermore, {{it is found that}} 50 degrees of dual bevel angle give optimization results for the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. As a result, the low frequency has shifted to the left and enhanced the antenna's impedance bandwidth significantly from 2. 2 : 1 (103 %) to 11 : 1 (200 %). The proposed antenna is also extensively proficient in producing divisive radiation patterns with vertical polarization at four different frequencies; 200, 500, 800, and 1000 MHz. The presented antenna performances clarify the potential of the approach between simulation and the measurement results. Instead of CR, the proposed antenna has attractive potentials to be used for GSM, broadcasting, UHF radio frequency identification (RFID) and radio astronomy applications in the future...|$|E
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2009, an {{important}} archaeological campaign {{was carried out in}} the heart of the downstream Seine region. It allowed us to locate a well-preserved occupation site attributed to the Upper Magdalenian. The operation concerns a surface area of 103 hectares located from the left bank of the Seine along the edge of the river and slightly downstream, to the most concave part of a meander which gives a strongly asymmetrical aspect to the bottom of the valley. The Magdalenian occupation was discovered in an alluvial sandy silt layer which provides a favourable context for the preservation of archaeological remains. The occupation is located on the edge of a former channel, probably restored during the Late Glacial. A gravel ridge has protected the deposits from the Holocene alluvial erosion. At present, only a surface of about 10 square meters in the main find concentration has been uncovered, but a quantity of test pits show that the archaeological layer extends over nearly 200 square meters. We provisionally suggest a possible relationship of contemporaneity between this occupation unit and two other sets of remains (a horse skull and a stony structure) discovered a few hundred metres away, in a similar stratigraphic position. With the exception of a few fragile remains that were removed during the field work, the other objects have been left in situ and the entire occupation site has been preserved for later excavations. The archaeological remains are mainly composed of reindeer bones and antlers, flint tools, backed bladelets and lithic remains, an antler point as well as a probable shell adornment. More than two hundred flint artefacts were removed, among which we found two burins. The raw materials exploited by the Magdalenians consisted mainly of a flint of the Late Cretaceous epoch, probably stemming from the Campanian and Santonian stages. Furthermore, the presence of a tertiary material has been detected. This raw material, strongly recalling the red flint from the Ludian stage of the Eocene epoch, has already been found in several other regional occupations (blades or other tools). Among the artefacts preserved in situ, we identified several other burins and, to a lesser extent, scrapers and piercers. A few backed bladelets were mixed with the debitage products close to the northwest edge of the hearth. A reindeer antler point was also removed from the rest of the archaeological floor before the excavated surface was refilled. This antler point was discovered less than 2 metres from the west edge of the hearth and a few centimetres away from a large worked reindeer antler fragment. It has a subrectangular section and presents a <b>double</b> <b>bevel</b> as well as a longitudinal groove. The morphology of this point is very similar to other examples known in the regional Magdalenian. All the rocks have been left in situ, and the information concerning this category of artefact is only based on field observations. They are characterized by their morphological and petrographical diversity, and include mainly sandstone, sandstone-shale and limestone. Apart from rocks contained in the hearth, probably reserved for its functioning, some other large blocks could have composed elements of the infrastructure in view of their size and weight. Such elements are known in the other Magdalenian occupations of the Paris Basin where they sometimes delimited a circle several metres in diameter. One of the main interests of this occupation lies in the presence of numerous bone remains. Almost all the determined elements relate to the reindeer. The discovery of reindeer tarsi in anatomical connection and the presence of skeleton elements particularly sensitive to taphonomical depletion, like antler fragments, ribs and vertebrae, obviously show exceptional preservation conditions and the absence of post-depositional disturbances. A first estimation based on teeth series and forelimbs (the radius fragments), gives a Minimum Number of Individuals of two reindeers brought back to the occupation site. At present, the absence of teeth series belonging to very young individuals prevents a more accurate seasonal determination of the Magdalenian visits. However, the presence of a large-sized antler from a hunted animal, belonging to an adult male reindeer, permitted the processing of this specimen to be estimated at between September and mid-December. The occupation would thus have taken place in the autumn or at the beginning of the winter, unless it is considered that the reindeer antler could have been transported for several months as a stock of raw material. Besides the reindeer remains, we observed a diaphysis fragment with dimensions suggesting an attribution to a horse or a bovine, and the horse skull discovered outside the occupation site. All the artefacts are located around the pit hearth, close to a large ochrestained area. The low density of remains suggests a short-term residence. A small pit was identified close to the hearth. Considering the bone remains, we note an asymmetrical distribution in relation to the hearth. There are a lot of bone fragments to the south of the fire area, while they are almost absent to the north. Such a pattern probably points to the repetitive disposal behaviour of the prehistoric people. Two debitage product concentrations, related to bladelet production, are located to the north-east of the hearth. Two other flint concentrations seem to be more probably toss zones. Finally, we observe a group of tertiary flint blades near a large sandstone slab. This group could be interpreted as a spare space of unused blades. With regard to the spatial organization, some levels of Pincevent (Seine-et-Marne) offer the most striking parallels. Two bone fragments were sent to a laboratory in order to obtain radiocarbon dates. The first one, a reindeer radius fragment which was collected close to the hearth, delivered a date of 12, 000 ± 70 BP. The second one, a cheek tooth from the isolated horse skull, delivered a date of 12, 230 ± 70 BP. These results are very similar to those obtained for the nine other Paris Basin Magdalenian sites. We hope that OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) analysis (in progress) could provide this Upper Magdalenian occupation with an accurate chronological context through the Weichselian Late Glacial chronozones. The outstanding conservation of this occupation site already makes La Haye one of the most important site for regional Magdalenian studies. The analysis of this occupation will be completed by exhaustive excavations. Since the planned building project has been cancelled, the site area is no longer threatened. However, new excavations are scheduled for the coming years. Une opération d’archéologie préventive réalisée durant l’été 2009 dans le département des Yvelines, au coeur du territoire Seine-Aval, a permis de repérer une unité d’occupation très bien conservée qui est rapportée à la phase supérieure du Magdalénien. Elle a été découverte dans une couche d’alluvions limono-sableuses qui s’est révélée un contexte particulièrement favorable à la conservation des vestiges. Actuellement, seuls une dizaine de mètres carrés ont été fouillées, mais les sondages réalisés dans les environs immédiats indiquent qu’elle se développe sur une surface d’environ 200 mètres carrés. À l’exception des éléments les plus fragiles qui ont été prélevés, les vestiges ont été conservés in situ pour une fouille ultérieure. Ils se composent principalement d’ossements et de ramures de renne, d’outils et de déchets de taille en silex, d’une pointe de sagaie ainsi que d’un probable élément de parure. L’ensemble se répartit de manière structurée autour d’un foyer en cuvette aménagé au moyen de blocs rocheux et à proximité duquel s’étend une nappe d’ocre rouge. La faible densité des vestiges évoque un séjour plutôt bref que les premiers indices de saisonnalité tendent à placer à l’automne. L’équipement technique et la structuration de l’espace habité permettent d’établir de nombreuses comparaisons avec quelques autres gisements magdaléniens de plein air du Bassin parisien. Par ailleurs, nous suggérons provisoirement une possible relation de contemporanéité entre cette unité d’occupation et deux autres ensembles (un crâne de cheval et une structure pierreuse) découverts à quelques centaines de mètres de distance dans une position stratigraphique analogue. Les aspects chronologiques sont d’ores et déjà documentés au moyen de datations radiocarbone obtenues sur os. Nous fondons aussi de nombreux espoirs sur les résultats d’analyses OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) en cours qui pourraient permettre un calage plus précis de l’occupation au sein de l’une des chronozones du Tardiglaciaire weichsélien.
