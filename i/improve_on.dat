He also helped Newcastle to a second consecutive FA Cup final and qualification for the following season's UEFA Cup, scoring twice in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, but they once again lost; this time 2–0 to treble-chasing Manchester United.|$|E

5|$|Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 {{when he was}} {{contacted}} by Chicagoan Burton Spain. Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 {{and set out to}} perfect and even <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> the Titlist splice. Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks were in high demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E
5|$|Croyle {{started the}} 2004 season hoping {{to help his}} team <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> their last season's record of 4–9. Croyle started three games, {{completing}} 44-of-66 passes for 534 yards with six touchdowns. But during the third {{game of the season}} against Western Carolina University, Croyle tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his other knee. Croyle was forced to sit {{out the rest of the}} season, and the team finished with a 6–6 record.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí was {{inspired}} above all by mediaeval Gothic art, {{but wanted to}} <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> its structural solutions. Neo-gothic {{was one of the}} most successful historicist styles at that time, above all as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc. Gaudí studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in León and Burgos, and became convinced that it was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of ruled surfaces, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.|$|E

Saints Row: The Third was built using the Havok physics engine.|$|E
5|$|Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri praised {{his team}} for their efforts, {{and said that}} despite a few regrets, they could exit with {{confidence}} from their performance. He commented that the team reaching the final had inspired the city of Turin and the whole of Italy.

5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not {{to go out on a}} second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E

Damon Hill was able to <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> his disastrous Friday session before the red flag, improving his time by one second and qualifying fourth as a result. A time posted by Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and final position on the grid; Paul Belmondo and Barrichello did not qualify.|$|E
5|$|Since MD 404 is {{the main}} route for {{travelers}} between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches, the road has a high accident rate. To <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway. A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $7.7 million for widening {{as a part of}} the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009; this section was widened in 2012. Widening on the remainder of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton is expected to be completed in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The HDMI founders began {{development}} on HDMI 1.0 on April 16, 2002, {{with the goal}} of creating an AV connector that was backward-compatible with DVI. At the time, DVI-HDCP (DVI with HDCP) and DVI-HDTV (DVI-HDCP using the CEA-861-B video standard) were being used on HDTVs. HDMI 1.0 was designed to <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> DVI-HDTV by using a smaller connector and adding audio capability and enhanced YCbCr capability and consumer electronics control functions.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 1995 season after having {{finished}} with an 84 overall record in 1994. That season culminated with a 4523 loss to Tennessee in the 1994 Gator Bowl. Heading into the 1995 season, fans and coaches expected Tech to <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> its previous performance. Most commentators, however, expected a season comparable to 1994's: a second-place {{finish in the}} Big East {{and a trip to}} the Gator Bowl. This was borne out by the preseason college football polls. The AP Poll put Tech 24th, while the coaches' poll had Tech 26th.|$|E
5|$|The {{first session}} on Thursday began in heavy rain. Although some cars {{attempted}} {{to carry out}} wet weather testing, the conditions forced all the teams back to their garages.

No one was able to <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> their qualifying times from the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Although tape {{samplers}} {{had been}} explored in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The {{concept of the}} Mellotron originated when Chamberlin's sales agent, Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin's Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, who said they could <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed to help finance the recording of the necessary instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon, they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron, because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.|$|E

5|$|As {{the top ten}} took to {{the track}} for the final part of qualifying, Nico Rosberg was unable to beat his time set in Q2 with his first fast lap. Hamilton however {{improved}} on his time, being more than three-tenths of a second faster than Rosberg. When both drivers were unable to <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> their times with their second timed laps, Hamilton took the 44th pole position of his career. Row two was {{taken up by the}} two Finns, Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas, who narrowly beat the two Lotuses of Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado. Both Lotus drivers had emerged from their pit boxes simultaneously for their final timed laps, entering the track side-by-side. The two Red Bulls finished eighth and ninth, splitting the two Force India cars of Nico Hülkenberg and Sergio Pérez.|$|E
5|$|Babangida's {{fortunes}} {{started to}} change {{towards the end of}} 1998. Having missed {{the start of the season}} with malaria, Babangida gradually lost his starting line-up position as Morten Olsen was looking to <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> the team's inconsistent performances both in the domestic league and in Europe. Babangida started two of his team's opening Champions League games. The European season, however, ended in disappointment as Ajax finished bottom of their group behind Olympiacos, Dinamo Zagreb and Porto. Overall, Babangida appeared in 18 league games for Ajax that season, starting only seven. He didn't feature in the Dutch Cup final where Ajax managed to retain the trophy after beating Fortuna Sittard in the final.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Llandudno to Fred and Rose Southall, he was the middle child of three boys. Southall played youth {{football}} for his school team and the Llandudno Swifts, where he played alongside Joey Jones. He was educated at Ysgol John Bright, though left without any qualifications at age 16. At age 14 he toured Germany with the Llandudno Swifts and was offered {{a chance to play}} for the youth team of Bundesliga outfit Fortuna Düsseldorf, but decided against the move to Germany. The Swifts were a poor side that were regularly beaten heavily, though the near constant barrage of shots he faced enabled Southall to <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> his shot-stopping skills.|$|E
