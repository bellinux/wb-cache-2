These horses are held in quarantine—usually three days—or until tests are completed. Because the disease equine piroplasmosis (<b>equine</b> <b>babesiosis)</b> is endemic in Mexico but not established in the United States, transportation of horses from Mexico to the United States requires evaluation of horses for the presence of this disease.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of {{asymptomatic}} carriers {{should be}} considered if parasites are still detected after 3 months. In mild-to-moderate babesiosis, the treatment of choice {{is a combination of}} atovaquone and azithromycin. This regimen is preferred to clindamycin and quinine because side effects are fewer. The standard course is 7 to 10 days, but this is extended to at least 6 weeks in people with relapsing disease. Even mild cases are recommended to be treated to decrease the chance of inadvertently transmitting the infection by donating blood. In life-threatening cases, exchange transfusion is performed. In this procedure, the infected red blood cells are removed and replaced with uninfected ones.Imizol is a drug used for treatment of babesiosis in dogs.Extracts of the poisonous, bulbous plant Boophone disticha are used in the folk medicine of South Africa to treat <b>equine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> B. disticha {{is a member of the}} daffodil family Amaryllidaceae and has also been used in preparations employed as arrow poisons, hallucinogens, and in embalming.

40|$|Rhipicephalus microplus (formerly Boophilus microplus) is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} tick parasite of livestock in the world. R. microplus is a hard tick that can be found on many hosts including cattle, buffalo, horses, donkeys, goats, sheep, deer, pigs, dogs and some wild animals. Heavy tick burdens on animals can decrease production and damage hides. R. microplus can also transmit babesiosis (caused by the protozoal parasites Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis) and anaplasmosis (caused by Anaplasma marginale). Under experimental conditions, this tick can transmit Babesia equi, the cause of <b>equine</b> piroplasmosis. <b>Babesiosis</b> or “cattle fever ” was eradicated from the United States between 1906 and 1943, by eliminating its vectors R. microplus and Rhipicephalus annulatus. Before its eradication, babesiosis cost the U. S. an estimated $ 130. 5 million in direct and indirect annual losses; in current dollars, the equivalent would be $ 3 billion. R. microplus and R. annulatus still exist in Mexico, and a permanent quarantine zone is maintained along the Mexican border to prevent their reintroduction into the U. S.

Apicomplexans Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina are the causative agents of bovine babesiosis, and apicomplexan Theileria equi causes <b>equine</b> piroplasmosis. Bovine <b>babesiosis</b> and <b>equine</b> piroplasmosis are the most economically important parasite diseases that affect worldwide cattle and equine industries, respectively. The recent sequencing of the B. bovis and T. equi genomes has provided the opportunity to identify novel genes involved in parasite biology. Here we characterize three members of the CCp family, named CCp 1, CCp 2 and CCp 3, in B. bigemina, B. bovis and T. equi. Using B. bigemina as an in vitro model, expression of all three CCp genes and proteins was demonstrated in temperature-induced sexual stages. Transcripts for all three CCp genes were found in vivo in blood stages of T. equi, and transcripts for CCp 3 were detected in vivo in blood stages of B. bovis. However, no protein expression was detected in T. equi blood stages or B. bovis blood stages or B. bovis tick stages. Collectively, the data demonstrated a differential pattern of expression of three orthologous genes of the multidomain adhesion CCp family by B. bigemina, B. bovis and T. equi.

40|$|Babesia {{species have}} a {{worldwide}} distribution, affecting {{a wide range}} of mammalian hosts. The major route of transmission is inoculation by an infected Ixodid tick. Babesia species of major economic concern are those that cause bovine and <b>equine</b> <b>babesiosis.</b> Historically, bovine Babesia species, Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina caused significant economic losses in the United States in the 1860 ??????s, as thousands of cattle died. Also, outbreaks of <b>equine</b> <b>babesiosis,</b> caused by Babesia equi or Babesia caballi, have occurred in the United States resulting in the death of some horses and millions of dollars in losses. A constant risk of reinfection with bovine and equine Babesia species exists, as stray and smuggled animals from Mexico, where bovine babesiosis is endemic, may carry infected ticks as they cross the border, and, thousands of horses from B. equiand B. caballi-endemic regions are imported through Florida every year. Vaccines have been developed for a number of Babesia species, none of which result in sterile immunity. The live attenuated vaccine is the most commonly used vaccine against Babesia species. However, the basis for the vaccine is to maintain a carrier state in order to prevent disease. Other vaccine designs have been developed to invoke protection without a carrier state but have been unsuccessful. It has been shown that the cysteine protease is important in the life cycle of a number of parasitic organisms, making it a good target for vaccine development. The vaccine design for this study incorporated the cysteine protease of Babesia microti. Babesia microti naturally infects Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) and is the major cause of human babesiosis in the United States. Using B. microti in the vaccine design allowed for the use of a mouse model to determine whether the cysteine protease of other economically important Babesia species may make a good vaccine target. The vaccine design incorporated a prime-boost strategy, priming with DNA encoding the cysteine protease and boosting two times with either DNA encoding the cysteine protease or cysteine protease peptide, followed by parasite challenge. Analysis of daily percent parasitemias, packed cell volume, and seroconversion of all groups revealed that a protective immune response against B. microti was not elicited by this vaccine strategy...|$|E
40|$|A {{competitive}} inhibition {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (CI ELISA) was developed to detect antibody to Babesia equi. One hundred fifty-four equine serum samples from 19 countries were tested for antibody to B. equi by the complement fixation test and by CI ELISA.

40|$|Both Babesia equi and Babesia caballi are endemic {{in large}} parts of South Africa. Attempts were made to obtain pure local {{isolates}} of both B. equi and B. caballi {{for the purpose of}} developing serological tests to study the epidemiology of <b>equine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> in this country. The indirect fluorescent antibody test was used to screen horses for B. equi and B. caballi in an endemic area. Seven horses and 3 donkeys between 3 and 36 months of age that tested negative were subsequently splenectomized. The splenectomy operation was performed through the abdominal approach. A 100 % survival rate was achieved through this method, probably because it reduced the risk involved in the operation. Blood collected from naturally infected horses and passaged in fully susceptible spenectomized horses and a donkey, under laboratory conditions, produced 2 isolates of Babesia caballi and 1 of B. equi.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of autochthonous clinical cases of canine and <b>equine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> in Belgium {{during the last}} two decades suggests that the vector of the pathogens responsible for these diseases, Dermacentor reticulatus (Ixodida: Ixodidae), may be present in this country. Consequently, evidence for the presence of this tick species in different locations within Belgium was investigated. Four different locations were monitored by flagging in 2010; these included the locations at which D. reticulatus was previously found on a dog in 2009 and on two red deer in 2007. Two different species of tick were identified, Ixodes ricinus (Ixodida: Ixodidae) and D. reticulatus. A total of 282 D. reticulatus adult ticks (98 males, 184 females) were collected from the four sites. Ticks were found mainly from early March until the end of May and a peak in activity was apparent in March. A Babesia spp. (Piroplasmida: Babesiidae) genus-specific polymerase chain reaction test based on the amplification of a fragment of the 18 S rRNA gene was used to investigate the potential presence of Babesia spp. All DNA extracts isolated from the total tick samples yielded negative results. Additional studies to accurately determine the distribution and vectorial capacity of this important tick species in Belgium are warranted. Peer reviewe...|$|E

An evaluation of {{the ability of the}} BceICT to detect antibodies in sera from uninfected horses and experimentally infected horses showed high sensitivities and specificities of 83. 3 % (10 / 12 sera) and 92. 9 % (52 / 56 sera), respectively, for the anti-B. caballi antibody and 94. 1 % (16 / 17 sera) and 88. 2 % (45 / 51 sera), respectively, for the anti-B. equi antibody. Results from the detection of antibodies in field-collected sera indicated that the BceICT results corresponded with those of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), showing 91. 8 % correspondence (67 / 73 sera) for B. caballi and 95. 9 % correspondence (70 / 73 sera) for B. equi, and that the BceICT results also corresponded with the ICT for B. caballi and for B. equi, both of which were 98. 2 % (55 / 56 sera).

A possible explanation for this variation in vaccine efficacy is amino acid sequence divergence between the recombinant Bm 86 vaccine component and native Bm 86 expressed in ticks from different geographical regions of the world. Results There was 91. 8 % amino acid sequence identity in Bm 86 among R. microplus and R. annulatus sequenced from South Texas infestations. When South Texas isolates were compared to the Australian Yeerongpilly and Cuban Camcord vaccine strains, there was 89. 8 % and 90. 0 % identity, respectively. Most of the sequence divergence was focused in one region of the protein, amino acids 206 - 298.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although Ixodes spp. are {{the most}} common ticks in North-Western Europe, recent reports {{indicated}} an expanding geographical distribution of Dermacentor reticulatus in Western Europe. Recently, the establishment of a D. reticulatus population in Belgium was described. D. reticulatus is an important vector of canine and <b>equine</b> <b>babesiosis</b> and can transmit several Rickettsia species, Coxiella burnetii and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), whilst Ixodes spp. are vectors of pathogens causing babesiosis, borreliosis, anaplasmosis, rickettsiosis and TBEV. METHODS: A survey was conducted in 2008 - 2009 to investigate the presence of different tick species and associated pathogens on dogs and cats in Belgium. Ticks were collected from dogs and cats in 75 veterinary practices, selected by stratified randomization. All collected ticks were morphologically determined and analysed for the presence of Babesia spp., Borrelia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia DNA. RESULTS: In total 2373 ticks were collected from 647 dogs and 506 cats. Ixodes ricinus (76. 4 %) and I. hexagonus (22. 6 %) were the predominant species. Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0. 3 %) and D. reticulatus (0. 8 %) were found in low numbers on dogs only. All dogs infested with R. sanguineus had a recent travel history, but D. reticulatus were collected from a dog without a history of travelling abroad. Of the collected Ixodes ticks, 19. 5 % were positive for A. phagocytophilum and 10. 1 % for Borrelia spp. (B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. burgdorferi s. s., B. lusitaniae, B. valaisiana and B. spielmanii). Rickettsia helvetica was found in 14. 1 % of Ixodes ticks. All Dermacentor ticks were negative for all the investigated pathogens, but one R. sanguineus tick was positive for Rickettsia massiliae. CONCLUSION: D. reticulatus was confirmed to be present as an indigenous parasite in Belgium. B. lusitaniae and R. helvetica were detected in ticks in Belgium for the first time. [URL]...|$|E
