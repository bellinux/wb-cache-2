5|$|Darla's <b>just</b> misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're <b>just</b> kind of warped. From her perspective—first {{she has to}} eat—she <b>just</b> happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she <b>just</b> lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|I was <b>just</b> {{trying to}} make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's <b>just</b> always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was <b>just</b> for a good laugh. It was a goof, <b>just</b> for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it <b>just</b> so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was <b>just</b> what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
