500|$|Executive {{producer}} Robert H. Justman didn't {{care for}} Chapel; he described {{her as a}} [...] "wimpy, badly written, and ill-conceived character." [...] He added that the additional camera lenses used by director Jerry Finnerman in that episode for close-ups of her quivering lip only [...] "served to emphasize the lack of character written into the character." [...] He had complained to Roddenberry of Barrett's acting skills, but stopped when {{he became aware of}} their relationship. It was only after Barrett's first appearance as Lwaxana Troi in the [...] episode [...] "", that he came to realize that it was the Chapel character he disliked, not Barrett herself and told her that his opinion had changed. Barrett also didn't care for the character of Chapel, saying [...] "I've never been a real aficionado of Nurse Chapel, I <b>figured</b> <b>she</b> was kind of weak and namdy-pamdy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Once, when he {{told her}} the story of some college pranks wherein the endless feuds of freshmen and sophomores <b>figured,</b> <b>she</b> clapped her hands {{together}} according to her habit, and laughed aloud--a clear, musical, silvery peal. It fell on Eric's ear with a shock of surprise. He thought it strange that she could laugh like that when she could not speak. Wherein lay the defect that closed for her the gates of speech? Was it possible that it could be removed? ...|$|E

I saw the light shine on her bare arms and her bright eyes, and there went out of me a yell so big that I thought it was my death.|$|E

60|$|They did not, however, hold it {{in peace}} all this time. They became {{continually}} involved in difficulties and contests with the native Britons, who could ill brook the oppressions of such merciless masters as Roman generals always proved in the provinces which they pretended to govern. One of the most formidable rebellions that the Romans had to encounter during their disturbed and troubled sway in Britain was led on by a woman. Her name was Boadicea. Boadicea, like almost all other heroines, was coarse and repulsive in appearance. She was tall and masculine in form. The tones of her voice were harsh, {{and she had the}} countenance of a savage. Her hair was yellow. It might have been beautiful if it had been neatly arranged, and had shaded a face which possessed the gentle expression that belongs properly to woman. It would then have been called golden. As it was, hanging loosely below her waist and streaming in the wind, it made the wearer only look the more frightful. Still, Boadicea was not by any means indifferent to the appearance she made in the eyes of beholders. She evinced her desire to make a favorable impression upon others, in her own peculiar way, it is true, but in one which must have been effective, considering what sort of beholders they were in whose eyes she <b>figured.</b> <b>She</b> was dressed in a gaudy coat, wrought of various colors, with a sort of mantle buttoned over it. She wore a great gold chain about her neck, and held an ornamented spear in her hand. Thus equipped, she appeared at the head of an army of a hundred thousand men, and gathering them around her, she ascended a mound of earth and harangued them--that is, as many as could stand within reach of her voice--arousing them to sentiments of revenge against their hated oppressors, and urging them to the highest pitch of determination and courage for the approaching struggle. Boadicea had reason to deem the Romans her implacable foes. They had robbed her of her treasures, deprived her of her kingdom, imprisoned her, scourged her, and inflicted the worst possible injuries upon her daughters. These things had driven the wretched mother to a perfect phrensy of hate, and aroused her to this desperate struggle for redress and revenge. But all was in vain. In encountering the spears of Roman soldiery, she was encountering the very hardest and sharpest steel that a cruel world could furnish. Her army was conquered, and she killed herself by taking poison in her despair.|$|E

50|$|The {{party was}} fantastic, from the {{viewpoint}} of Amos. They left the meeting and went to the bar. Of course, the parties, although large and exciting, were invite only.

Shelby acted really interested in everything that Amos said as he was the first business associate of Lai's that she had met who seemed vulnerable.
