5|$|These Nishidhis {{detail the}} names, dates, the {{duration}} of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, Nishidhis are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in mandapas (pillared pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> or pillars of the temple.|$|E

25|$|On Thursday 18 November 2010 Sgt Andrews {{was cleared}} of any {{wrongdoing}} {{with regards to the}} allegation of assault in Melksham Custody against Somerville. Sgt Andrews claimed that Pamela Somerville had grabbed hold of the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> of the cell and on letting go she had fallen to the floor. Mr Justice Bean declared Somerville was drunk when she was put in the cells and he believed that Sgt Andrews did not intend to throw her to the floor.|$|E
25|$|To breach doors quickly, {{battering}} rams, shotguns with breaching rounds, or explosive charges {{can be used}} {{to break}} the lock or hinges, or even demolish the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> itself. SWAT teams also use many non-lethal munitions and weapons. These include Tasers, pepper spray canisters, shotguns loaded with bean bag rounds, Pepperball guns, stinger grenades, flash bang grenades, and tear gas. Ballistic shields are used in close quarters situations to provide cover for SWAT team members and reflect gunfire. Pepperball guns are essentially paint ball markers loaded with balls containing Oleoresin Capsicum ("pepper spray").|$|E
25|$|This is {{an older}} method of water-saving {{automatic}} flushing, which only operates when the room has been used. A push-button switch is {{mounted in the}} <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> of the restroom, and triggers the flush valve for all restroom urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when the restroom is not being used. This method requires a spring-operated automatic door closer, since the flush mechanism only operates when the restroom door opens.|$|E
50|$|It {{opens on}} a central hall that ends {{slightly}} {{before it reaches}} the western wall. Much of the finishing on the first floor, such as <b>doors,</b> <b>frames,</b> cornices, and plaster decoration in ceilings is from the house's mid-19th century renovations. The largest original piece remaining is a mantelpiece in the northeast parlor, decorated with garlands and fruit baskets. Folding interior shutters still exist on all the windows. Upstairs, the <b>doors,</b> <b>frames</b> and fireplace trim is also original.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{floor space}} is approximately 360 ft2 m2. Height {{of the interior}} walls from the floor to wooden ceiling beams is 13.5 ft. The interior walls are paneled with pine boards that run horizontally, {{up to the top}} of two <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> that are centered in the north and south facades. The <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> are 4.5 ft wide and support double-leaf wooden doors that are 6.5 ft tall. The south facing doors are covered in sheet metal.|$|R

25|$|The {{purpose of}} door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger {{trapping}} devices, or finger guards) {{is to reduce}} the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.|$|E
25|$|This {{opening on}} the end of the north wing {{consists}} of a full width, battened door bearing four vertical, recessed panels similar to the south door. The frame and brickwork surrounding it are probably reworked. This is especially evident in the brick framing on the top that is now a simple course of Flemish bond. The wooden <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> consists of three sets of flat boards, becoming progressively narrower toward the doorway. There is a bevel between the outermost frame member and a semi-round molding between the two inner boards. Both the north and south doors are secured by strap hinges on the inside.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls and}} sanctum's <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> of the both levels are {{intricately}} carved. These show themes such as makaras and other mythical creatures, apsaras, elephants in {{different stages of}} activity, females in waving or welcoming gesture. The upper level of Cave 6 is significant in that it shows a devotee in a kneeling posture at the Buddha's feet, an indication of devotional worship practices by the 5th century. The colossal Buddha of the shrine has an elaborate throne back, but was hastily finished in 477/478 CE, when king Harisena died. The shrine antechamber of the cave features an unfinished sculptural group of the Six Buddhas of the Past, of which only five statues were carved. This idea may have been influenced from those in Bagh Caves of Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
