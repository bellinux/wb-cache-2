50|$|No-knead {{bread is}} a method of bread baking that uses a very long {{fermentation}} (rising) time instead of kneading to form the gluten strands that give the bread its texture. It {{is characterized by a}} low yeast content and a very wet dough.

5000|$|The word hachee has {{its origins}} in the French word for [...] "chopping": hacher. Hachees have been {{described}} in Medieval buffets, although the exact recipe usually isn't described. The stew probably has its origin in the reuse of meat cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> together with vegetables that happened to be available. Acidic fluids such as wine or vinegar were added to make the meat more tender.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven,</b> {{was another}} popular method of baking while using {{an open fire}} or <b>a</b> fire <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hearth. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven,</b> unlike the tin kitchen, is made of iron, and would collect and {{concentrate}} the heat of coals placed beneath {{and on top of}} the oven, while preventing the coals from direct contact with the food, and isolating smoke from the fire from the baking food.|$|R

The cheese was simmering and browning away, most delightfully, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> before the fire; the pettitoes were getting on deliciously <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little tin saucepan on the hob; and Mrs. Bardell and her two friends were getting on very well, also, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little quiet conversation about and concerning all their particular friends and acquaintance; when Master Bardell came back from answering the door, and delivered the message intrusted to him by Mr. Samuel Weller.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> the Netherlands, <b>a</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> {{is called}} <b>a</b> braadpan, which {{literally}} translates to frying pan or roasting pan. The design most used {{today is a}} black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan, that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, <b>a</b> well known <b>Dutch</b> manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, {{it proved to be}} <b>a</b> revolution <b>in</b> the kitchen. <b>A</b> braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, {{but it can also be}} used for making traditional stews such as hachée. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.|$|R

5000|$|Recipes for Dutch {{apple pie}} {{go back to}} the Middle Ages. An early Dutch {{cookbook}} from 1514, Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen ("A notable little cookery book"), documents a recipe for Appeltaerten (compare modern Dutch [...] "apple pies"). This early recipe was a simple one, requiring only a standard pie crust, slices of especially soft apples with their skin and seeds removed, and den selven deeghe daer die taerte af ghemaect es (roughly meaning [...] "the same dough that the pie crust is made of") to fill in the top. It was then baked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> typical <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven.</b> Once baked, the top crust (except at the edges) would be cut out from the middle, after which the apple slices were potentially put through a sieve before the pie was stirred with a wooden spoon. At this point the book recommends adding several spices to the pie, namely: cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, mace and powdered sugar. Finally, after mixing the ingredients into the pie with cream, it is once again put into the oven to dry.|$|R

50|$|Kettle corn was {{introduced}} to the United States in the 18th century. It is referenced in the diaries of Dutch settlers in Pennsylvania circa 1776. It was a treat sold at fairs or consumed at other festive occasions. The corn, oil, sugar, and salt are cooked together <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cast iron kettle, or possibly <b>a</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven.</b> This produces <b>a</b> noticeable sweet crust on the popcorn; however, this method requires constant stirring or the sugar will burn. Alternatively, a batch of plain popped corn can be sweetened with sugar or honey before adding salt. This combination was widely popular in the early 19th century but fell from wide usage during the 20th century.|$|R

Dutchie is used as a patois term to refer to a food cooking pot such as <b>a</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> <b>in</b> Jamaica and the Caribbean. It has since become a drug reference, denoting a blunt stuffed with marijuana and rolled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wrapper from <b>a</b> <b>Dutch</b> Masters cigar, since American and British listeners assumed that the term was a drug reference.|$|R
