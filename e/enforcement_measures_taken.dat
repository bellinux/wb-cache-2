40|$|This Comment {{will first}} examine the {{fundamental}} policy differences and opposing perspectives underlying {{the conflict between}} Canada and the United States regarding extraterritorial antitrust enforcement. Par- ticular conflict areas will then be discussed. Second, this Comment will explore the reasons underlying {{the failure of the}} Fulton-Rogers Under- standing to prevent instances of serious disagreement concerning particu- lar antitrust <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> <b>taken</b> by the United States during the 19702 ̆ 7 s. Third, this Comment will analyze the 1984 Understanding, fo- cusing on its departure from the weaknesses of the Fulton-Rogers Under- standing, its specific provisions addressing concerns within the major categories of previous conflict, and its likely successes and failures in eliminating future conflict in light of the difficulties encountered in previ- ous cases. Finally, this Comment will conclude that, while the 1984 Un- derstanding is of great value as an expression of renewed interest in mitigating future conflict between the two nations, and while its detailed procedures for early identification, recognition, and evaluation of diverging national interests involved in transnational antitrust proceed- ings represent a vastly improved dispute settlement regime, it contains few meaningful substantive provisions which might serve as guarantors that the interests brought to light through implementation of the proce- dural guidelines will be fairly reconciled. The 1984 Understanding thus constitutes but one step toward the ultimate goal of establishing broadly applicable substantive provisions for resolution of multinational antitrust enforcement disputes...|$|E

30|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the highly decentralized labor inspection system in Argentina, I constructed an <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> (logarithm {{of the number of}} inspected firms per hundred formal firms) with variation at the province, sector, and time level.

To deal with the possible endogeneity of the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> in this setting, I instrumented it using a measure of the arrival cost of labor inspectors to the firms.|$|R

30|$|Of {{particular}} {{relevance to}} the use of the enforcement approach is Almeida and Aterido (2008) which developed a proxy for locally varying enforcement, again based on the Enterprise Surveys. The main <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> used were the numbers of visits by labor or tax inspectors. In their empirical model, they include both their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> (visits by inspectors) and in one specification also its interaction with the country-level rigidity of labor regulations. Their results show that enforcement by itself has a negative effect on the probability of formal training but that its interaction with labor law rigidity has a positive and significant effect. Two possible shortcomings, however, would seem to be (1) that no allowance is given to a direct effect of labor law rigidity on training (or the firm’s perceived severity of these regulations as in the “obstacles approach) and (2) the possible endogeneity or selection bias in their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|R

40|$|Cooperative Spectrum sharing can {{be thought}} of as a {{reorganization}} of rights between stakeholders [2]. The principal stakeholders are the Primary User (PU), who holds the spectrum license, and the Secondary User(s) who uses the spectrum temporarily. Any rights management system requires a set of strategies and technologies to enforce the rights [3]; the timing of the enforcement action (ex-ante and ex-post) also plays a significant role [4]. The cooperative spectrum sharing approaches that have been proposed by the NTIA emphasize ex-ante actions, which are designed to prevent a PU’s signal from harmful interference that could occur by the SU [1, 5]. A comprehensive enforcement framework would include protecting the rights of the SU in addition to having an ex post component that can efficiently and effectively adjudicate claims of interference. Determining the role of ex-post enforcement in a spectrum sharing scheme is of significant importance since cooperative spectrum sharing will without doubt result in interference events. To evaluate the role of the ex-post enforcement approach, a hypothetical scenario of using the recommended protection zones and the involved entities will be used to analyze the current <b>enforcement</b> timing <b>measures</b> and to evaluate the usage of ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> The hypothetical scenario concerns about the behaviors of the SUs, if SU-mobile devices transmitting near PU-base station or transmitting with high power signal within the protection zone. This behavior will cause harmful interference to the PU signal and data received by the PU will be lost. To guarantee SU behavior the suggested ex-ante and ex-post <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be explained and analyzed. Then, ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be applied to this scenario and analyzed. The purpose of analyzing the ex-post-only <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> is to evaluate how these measures might work, and what the limits are on their effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Park {{officials}} at Carara National Park, Costa Rica, face considerable challenges. They believe poaching {{has become a}} significant threat to the park’s biodiversity and that their <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures,</b> largely due to limited funds, are inadequate. Through family-level interviews in six communities surrounding Carara National Park, this study aims to understand the dynamics of poaching by identifying animals at risk of poaching and identifying communities to target future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> Interviews inquired about interactions with wildlife, perceived populations of wildlife, sale of wildlife, opinions towards hunting, and observed hunting activities. Summary statistics, CART modeling and probit regressions are {{used to analyze the}} data. Results indicate hunting is not prevalent {{in terms of the number}} of families that hunt. However, these families can still have significant impacts on wildlife populations with poaching occurring for both subsistence and market-oriented reasons. Two potential community sets are identified as areas to target enforcement. Based on the number of reported families engaging in hunting, enforcement should be targeted in Bijagual and Tárcoles. However, exploring truthfulness through CART and probit regression analysis indicates enforcement should be targeted in El Sur and La Hacienda. Ultimately, future <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> will be determined by Carara officials. Although potential target communities are identified and management practices such as ecotourism and community-based management are potentially viable avenues for reducing poaching, the park faces considerable challenges for enforcement due to its limited financial capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Copyright {{regime has}} been unable to answer to the changed {{consumption}} models and needs of the consumers. The regime is typically perceived as overly restrictive and unfair among the pub-lic. Given the lack of convenient legal options, the consumers have resorted to piracy. Instead of proactively developing better legal options, the copyright right holders have pushed for more effective <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures.</b> The proportionality of these measures have been seriously questioned. The <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> referred to above require monitoring of the internet. However, inter-net users do not access the internet under their own name, but under an IP address that is allo-cated to the device connected to the internet. The IP address can further be linked to the sub-scriber of internet access service, making it personal data. The monitoring of the internet and the processing of internet user’s personal data constitutes an interference with the fundamental rights to privacy and personal data protection of the individual. Additionally, some <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> interfere with internet user’s fundamental right to a fair trial.
