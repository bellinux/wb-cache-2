The C-32As feature the blue-and-white paint scheme used by the USAF for its VIP transport fleet, while the C-32Bs are painted in solid white with minimal identification markings.

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for <b>emergency</b> <b>support,</b> with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior {{to the arrival}} of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the hijacking {{and that there were}} Americans on board, members of the Reagan administration in Washington D.C. (in a time zone seven hours earlier than Egypt) moved to take decisive action. The Terrorist Incident Working Group (which included National Security Council staff member Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North) met in accord with predetermined counter-terrorist procedures. They recommended that a State Department <b>Emergency</b> <b>Support</b> Team be sent to Rome to assist the embassy there as the vessel was Italian. The Group also recommended that the Pentagon dispatch a team of special operations forces to Europe in case the ship needed to be seized to rescue the hostages. These recommendations were approved by the Operational Sub-Group chaired by John Poindexter and orders were sent to the State and Defense Departments. U.S. Army Major General Carl Stiner put two platoons, drawn from the Navy's counter-terrorism unit, SEAL Team Six and Army commandos from Delta Force, en route to Europe to be operating with NATO ally permission from a British base at Akrotiri, Cyprus. The U.S. State Department asked countries along the Mediterranean to deny Achille Lauro access to their ports in order to keep it in International Waters. They also sought to keep the press away from the ship to prevent giving the terrorists a worldwide stage.|$|E

The first, Building 3500, which {{was known as}} the [...] "Green Monster," [...] was damaged during an earthquake on 9 January 1982. The two earthquakes, which were centered in Miramichi, New Brunswick caused irreparable structural damage to the facility, which led to it being replaced with a sturdier hospital in 1987. The new hospital included a dental clinic and outpatient rooms, in addition to over twenty beds. Internal medicine, optometry, general surgery, pediatrics, mental health, and radiology services were also provided at the base, in addition to the 24-hour <b>emergency</b> <b>support</b> services.

Finally, a case study of evaluating typical cities affected by typhoon in Zhejiang Province was given, with the results that Ningbo, Zhoushan, Wenzhou, Hangzhou and Jinhua have better logistics support capability than other cities in Zhejiang, which should put more hard work on the construction of emergency logistics in case to minimize the loss of typhoon disaster...|$|R

40|$|Emergency {{management}} practice can {{be supported by}} ICT in many ways, and numerous ICT-based systems are available that offer support in the different phases of emergency management. Yet, many such systems do not provide as much <b>support</b> to <b>emergency</b> management as expected or wished for.

This paper describes aspects of human functioning that should be considered in the design of ICT-based <b>emergency</b> management <b>support</b> systems, and points out why they matter. This is illustrated with examples of GIS in emergency management. The paper also briefly sketches how better adjustment to end users can be incorporated into the design of ICT-based systems for <b>emergency</b> management <b>support.</b> It is recommended that human factors are properly considered in both the design and operational phases of ICT-based <b>emergency</b> management <b>support</b> systems, which can be realized through cooperation between experts in emergency management, human factors and GIS...|$|R
