5|$|In {{addition}} to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they {{may be used for}} the legal and illegal <b>disposal</b> of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other hazardous waste, such as munitions. They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals. Future deep-sea waste <b>disposal</b> activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge, carbon-dioxide sequestration, and <b>disposal</b> of dredge spoils.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} produce mostly, {{among the}} berkelium isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage {{and before the}} fuel <b>disposal,</b> most of it beta decays to californium-249. The latter has a half-life of 351 years, which is relatively long {{when compared to the}} other isotopes produced in the reactor, and is therefore undesirable in the <b>disposal</b> products.|$|E

5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage <b>disposal,</b> which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space for open pit garbage disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal <b>disposal</b> of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful <b>disposal</b> of garbage bags at traffic intersections and public areas.

5|$|The {{proposed}} land-based subductive waste <b>disposal</b> method would {{dispose of}} nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land, and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement.

5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep <b>disposal</b> of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW <b>disposal.</b> The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste <b>disposal</b> in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Food waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and <b>disposal</b> of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection and <b>disposal</b> {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections.|$|E
