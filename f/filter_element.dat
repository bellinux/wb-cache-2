2500|$|The 1988 Fiero {{brought a}} new {{suspension}} design, thought by many to have {{a striking resemblance to}} those designed by Lotus, which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with [...] by [...] wide wheels up front and [...] by [...] wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic power steering unit, the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production — one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> and balance shaft. A [...] "Formula" [...] option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the [...] speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last window sticker was placed on the last Fiero to roll off the Pontiac, Michigan plant line. The 1988 Fiero is the most desired by automotive collectors because of the improvements made to the 1988 model year, and this being the last year of production. The 1988 Mera seen as the most sought after model and tops the Fiero list in resale value this model is commonly used to create [...] "kit cars" [...] (replicas of high end sports cars).|$|E

40|$|Filter {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the most suitable filter for removing large quantities of aluminum corrosion product (boehmite) from reactor water. Filters tested included the following: wire-wound, sintered <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> sintered ceramic fllter <b>elements,</b> cotton stringwound <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> felted-cotton <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> cation resin, adsorption resin, diatomaceous earth precoat filter, and a wood-cellulose precoat filter. Parameters measured were flow rate, filter-influent and -effluent boehmite concentration, pressure drop, and final filter load. The pressure drop and efficiency of the filters was correlated with boehmite load. Boehmite deposits on filters as a nonporous gelatinous cake, and causes a rapidly increasing pressure drop. Tests indicate that the optimum load with <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> and precoat <b>filters</b> is achieved at a pressure drop of 25 psi. Very little additional load {{can be obtained by}} operating to a higher pressure drop. Of the filters tested, the precoat filter snd 40 to 60 mesh cation resin were the more effective in removing boehmite. The efficiency of the precoat filter was in excess of 99 %, and the efficiency of the cation resin was for the most part in excess of 95 %. For various reasons, the other filters were eliminated from final consideration. The test program and available literature indicated that an <b>element</b> type precoat <b>filter</b> using wood cellulose as the precoat media would be most suitable for the proposed application.
