5|$|Humans {{have been}} hunting mammals in Asia {{for at least}} 40,000years, but until recently, slow lorises were only hunted at a {{sustainable}} level. However, hunting pressure since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to overexploitation, because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets {{began to appear in}} Phnom Penh and Sen Monorom, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks of hunters, traders, and middlemen. Bright <b>flashlights</b> make spotting slow lorises much easier at night because of their eye shine, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow lorises began as improved batteries for spotlights became available.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2006acquisition of the Cherry Springs airport, a new Public Programming {{field has}} been {{established}} on the former airstrip. This field is northeast of PA Route 44 and is intended for educational programs or stargazing, but not for those who spend the night. Overnight observers and those with large telescopes use the Astronomy Field southwest of the highway. Nighttime visitors may only use <b>flashlights</b> with red filters, and may only point them at the ground. The Astronomy Field has further restrictions on lights, {{and parts of the}} park are light-free zones.|$|E

50|$|For {{an analogy}} to more easily {{understand}} {{the differences in}} deflected vertically and horizontally polarized signals, place a mirror {{on the floor in}} the middle of a room. Have somebody hold a <b>flashlight</b> on the other side of the room. The <b>flashlight</b> represents a signal and your eyes are the receiver. The mirror represents a flat roof within region 1 of the Fresnel Zone. Have the <b>flashlight</b> move up and down representing vertical polarization. Note that in the mirror, the <b>flashlight</b> moves in the opposite direction, that is, it moves down and up rather than up and down. This is out-of-phase. Now have the <b>flashlight</b> move to the left and right representing horizontal polarization. If you look in the mirror, the reflected image of the <b>flashlight</b> moves exactly in tandem with the actual <b>flashlight.</b> Left is left, right is right. This is in-phase.|$|R

50|$|Almost any item can be booby-trapped in some way. For example, booby {{trapping}} a <b>flashlight</b> is {{a classic}} tactic: a <b>flashlight</b> already contains most of the required components. First of all, the <b>flashlight</b> acts as bait, tempting the victim to pick it up. More importantly, {{it is easy to}} conceal a detonator, some explosives, and batteries inside the <b>flashlight</b> casing. A simple electrical circuit is connected to the on/off switch. When the victim attempts to turn the <b>flashlight</b> on to see if it works, the resulting explosion blows their hand or arm off and possibly blinds them.|$|R
5|$|During {{the scene}} where Ray's stolen minivan is {{attacked}} by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, <b>flashlights</b> and Maglights. The IL crew admitted that {{the destruction of the}} Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{has only}} {{performed}} this song live once, on The Virgin Tour in 1985. It {{was the first}} song of the second act of the show. Madonna wore a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly-button exposed, {{and a number of}} crucifixes in different sizes, hanging from different parts of her body. As the guitar intro of the song started, Madonna appeared on the side-stage and started dancing energetically, while <b>flashlights</b> fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled the steel structure present on the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main stage. It was included on the video release, titled , which was shot in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|The ground teams carry {{equipment}} on their person {{that they use}} while in the field. This equipment includes <b>flashlights,</b> signal mirrors, tactical vests, safety vests, and food that will last them at least 24hours. The equipment carried by ground teams varies much by the mission at hand. Urban direction finding (UDF) missions necessitate only a small kit of gear. But intensive mountain search and rescue can require packs that provide for up to 72 hours of operational supplies and tool for the location, rescue and extraction of lost or crashed parties. This gear includes the above, plus additional water, meals, and survival gear. Although a standardized list {{is provided by the}} national command, many teams modify the list to match the needs of the mission.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{evaluate}} whether ultrasonography (US) -guided vascular access {{can be learned}} and performed faster with the sonic <b>flashlight</b> than with conventional US and to demonstrate sonic flashlight-guided vascular access in a cadaver. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and oral and written informed consent were obtained. The sonic <b>flashlight</b> replaces the standard US monitor with a real-time US image that appears to float beneath the skin and is displayed where it is scanned. In studies 1 and 2, participants performed sonic flashlight-guided needle insertion tasks in vascular phantoms. In study 1, 16 participants (nine women, seven men) with no US experience performed 60 simulated vascular access trials with sonic <b>flashlight</b> or conventional US guidance. With analysis of variance (ANOVA) and power-curve fitting, improvement with practice rate and mean differences between techniques and tasks were examined. In study 2, 14 female nurses (mean age, 50. 1 years) proficient with conventional US performed simulated vascular access trials on three tasks with the sonic <b>flashlight</b> and conventional US. With random assignment, half the participants used the sonic <b>flashlight</b> first and half used conventional US first. Mean performance with each technique and that with each task were compared by using ANOVA. In study 3, feasibility of sonic <b>flashlight</b> guidance for access to internal jugular and basilic veins was demonstrated in a cadaver. RESULTS: For study 1, learning rates (ie, decrease in access time over trials) did not differ for vascular access with sonic <b>flashlight</b> and conventional US. Overall, participants achieved faster vascular access times with sonic <b>flashlight</b> guidance (P 3 ̆c. 007). In study 2, participants performed procedures faster overall with the sonic <b>flashlight</b> (P 3 ̆c. 02) and found the sonic <b>flashlight</b> easier to use. In study 3, sonic flashlight-guided vascular access was gained in the cadaver. CONCLUSION: Learning and performance of vascular access were significantly faster with the sonic <b>flashlight</b> than with conventional US, and vascular access could be gained in a cadaver; the sonic <b>flashlight</b> is ready for clinical trials...|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{hurricane}} made landfall, Mexico's natural disaster fund provided $1.45 million in aid to repair pipelines, highways, and buildings. The United Methodist Committee on Relief distributed food baskets to 720 survivors and provided 180 families with wood for rebuilding their homes. In addition, the Civil Protection Agency in Baja California, the Baja bush Pilots, and the Mexican Red Cross asked for donations of such as utensils, <b>flashlights,</b> lanterns, batteries, clothing, and light bedding. Following the hurricane, a riot in Santa Rosalía broke out {{due to lack of}} water. There was also a lack for shelter, as such this left many people sleeping in their cars. Within a week, the Mexican government assessed the damage form the hurricane, with 15 of them begin sent to Santa Rosalía and shortly thereafter, the Mexican Red Cross sent out relief efforts to the devastated area, especially in Santa Rosalía3. A total of 4,460 food kits were sent, 1,152 hygiene kits, 765 cleaning kits, 225 children's kits, and 181 kitchen kits.|$|E
5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on <b>flashlights</b> in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E
