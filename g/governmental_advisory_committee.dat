40|$|Road-transport {{accounts}} for a substantial proportion of the air quality objective pollutants experienced within the post-industrial cityscape. Traditionally, investigations have quantified the temporal health effects of such pollutants, yet the confined nature of European intraurban environments often determine spatial variations in traffic pollutant levels, {{which tend to be}} associated with a plethora of social disparities. Recently, elements of spatial heterogeneity have attracted the attention of <b>governmental</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>committees,</b> whom acknowledge a limited understanding of spatially inclusive practices in-spite of their potentially valuable applications (COMEAP 2006). Through considering spatial variations in children’s respiratory health, across the model British multicultural City of Leicester (Vidal-Hall 2003), this project aimed to address the inadequacies of temporal models in capturing Pearce et al’s (2010) wider ‘triple jeopardy’. The projects findings indicated significant global relationships to exist between children’s hospitalisations, social-economic-status, ethnic minorities, and PM 10 road-transport emissions within Leicester. ‘Local Indicators of Spatial Association’ and ‘Geographically Weighted Regression’ identified important localised variations within the dataset, specifically relating to a ‘double-burden’ of residentially experienced road-transport emissions and deprivation effecting inner-city children’s respiratory health. Further examination of the spatial field’s, revealed critical distance-responses to exist between respiratory health fronts and select socio-environmental phenomenon, thus recognising the importance of exposure gradients found in the every-day environment. It was suggested that exposure to detrimental socio-environmental factors initiated upper respiratory episodes, with prolonged contact impeding recovery leaving the child vulnerable to infection, exacerbating previous complaints and potentially causing conditions of greater severity. These findings provide a preliminary link between extreme cases of ‘Catarrhal Child Syndrome’ and socio-environmental influences, a conclusion previously eluding medical practitioners. Interestingly, affluent intra-urban communities tended to contribute the highest levels of emission from private transport, whilst residentially experiencing few environmental burdens. Thus, indicating that environmental injustices prevail across the model British multicultural city of Leicester. To readdress such environmental imbalances, the project suggested and explored a selection of general and community tailored transport schemes. In conclusion, geostatistical approaches are viewed to be an effective set of tools for health and urban planners, in the management of localised issues, which have previously been ‘filtered’ out by temporal practices...|$|R

5000|$|Failing to get {{the name}} {{directly}} reserved by ICANN {{in response to the}} Dakar request, in January 2013, the African Union Commission directly appointed a South African company UniForum to administer the [...]africa TLD on behalf of Africa.

DotConnectAfrica stated the AU RFP to select a Registry was issued shortly after Dakar meeting in December and an award was made in January, an incredibly short period of evaluation time compared to what even ICANN registry selection process for an applicant would take nearly 6 -8 months. Additionally, the AU RFP imposed a [...] "community application restrictions" [...] which is not in line with the ICANN RFP for a gTLD applicant, making it impossible for any serious applicant to legitimately participate in the process, except Uniform that was directly recommended by the Chairman of the AFTLD (African Top Level Domian Name organization) who also runs the South African [...]ZA authority, as well as whose organization is represented at the AU DotAfrica TaskForce.

In addition, the African Union (and its individual member states) can avail itself of any of the appropriate objection processes mentioned above in the event an application is received for any string - even those beyond representations of [...]Africa - that may raise concern" [...] and so filed an [...] "early warning" [...] objecting to DCA's application for the dotAfrica TLD with ICANN's <b>Governmental</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> (GAC). Therefore, the objection by the AUC stated that [...] "the application fails to meet the minimum requirements prescribed by ICANN in the gTLD Applicant Guidebook concerning geographic names" [...] and thatDCA’s application constitutes an unwarranted intrusion and interference with the mandate given to the AUC by African Head of States and African Ministers responsible for Communication and Information Technologies. In this regard the AUC has been mandated to establish dotAfrica (.Africa) as a continental Top-Level Domain for use by organisations, businesses and individuals with guidance from African Internet Agencies and in doing so to set up the structures and modalities for the implementation of the dotAfrica (.Africa) project.
