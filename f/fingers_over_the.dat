5|$|The {{children}} were {{taught how to}} read by a system devised by the school's founder, Valentin Haüy. Not blind himself, Haüy was a philanthropist who {{devoted his life to}} helping the blind. He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children using a technique of embossing heavy paper with the raised imprints of Latin letters. Readers would trace their <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> text, comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which Haüy could appreciate.|$|E
25|$|Mustafizur Rahman is {{probably}} the most successful bowler of the off cutter. Instead of rolling the <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> seam of sliding it back he flicks his wrists at the very last moment with very less change to his action. Thus the 'Fizz' grips the surface and deviates the ball from its line and gets a sudden jump like bounce with slower pace. He even bowls a fast off cutter. Thus Nasser Hossain rightly described him as a 'fast off spinner'. A good example would be Andre Russels dismissal by Mustafizur in the Vivo IPL 2016.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it is also}} possible, {{by holding}} the seam at an angle and rolling the <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> surface of the ball, to produce a {{deliberate}} off cutter in which the ball veers away from the off side when it bounces on the pitch, or leg cutter in which it veers away from a right-handed batsman. Former Australian bowler Dennis Lillee employed a leg cutter of this sort to considerable effect; however, deliveries of this kind will be slower than if the bowler simply bowls with the seam upright, hoping for movement {{one way or the}} other. Some bowlers deliberately use cutters more for their surprise slowness than the deviation off the pitch - a tactic very effectively used by Mustafizur Rahman.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other {{classical}} stringed instruments, classical guitar playing and notation use formal {{positions of the}} left hand. The 'nth position' means that the hand is positioned with <b>the</b> first <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> nth fret.|$|R

2500|$|When Frank Miller {{expanded}} most of Daredevil's abilities, {{he attempted}} to make them [...] "extraordinary enough to be exciting, but not on par with Superman", noting Superman's distinctly unbelievable powers. When Miller joined the title in 1979, {{the first thing he}} did to the character was [...] "revamp" [...] his radar sense and made it less distinct and more believable; he wanted Daredevil to have the [...] "proximity" [...] sense that some martial artists claim to have. Due to the character's sensitive sense of touch, Daredevil can read by passing his <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> letters on a page though laminated pages prevent him from reading the ink. Daredevil has commonly used his superhuman hearing to serve as a polygraph for interrogation by listening for changes in a person's heartbeat. This ability can be fooled if the other person's heart is not beating at a natural rate, such as if they have an artificial pacemaker.|$|E

50|$|Johann Sebastian Bach {{introduced}} an innovation in fingering for the organ and the clavier. (A similar, although according to Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach less radical, innovation {{was introduced by}} François Couperin, {{at roughly the same}} time in 1716, in his book L'art de toucher le clavecin.) Prior to Bach, playing rarely involved the thumb. Bach's new fingering retained many features of the conventional fingering up until that point, including the passing of one <b>finger</b> under or <b>over</b> another (playing many of Bach's works requires such fingering, especially passing <b>the</b> third <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fourth or <b>the</b> fourth <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fifth.), but introduced the far greater use of the thumb. Modern fingering also uses the thumb to a similar extent, and involves the passing of the thumb under the other fingers, but does not, as Bach's did, generally involve the passing of any other <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> or under one another.|$|R

50|$|The Monument to Soviet tank crews was a {{memorial}} located in Prague, Czech Republic, {{made up of}} an IS-2m tank on a pedestal.
