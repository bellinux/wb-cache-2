Correct assessment of the significance of ketonuria is obviously important, because some patients would probably require a decrease rather than an increase of insulin dosage.

40|$|The {{effect of}} insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} on the hepatic microsomal activity of cytochrome P 450 III and P 450 IV family proteins {{was investigated in}} rats pretreated with streptozotocin. In order to discern between {{the effects of the}} diabetogen per se and those of the ensuing diabetes, streptozotocin-treated rats received in addition either nicotinamide to prevent the onset of diabetes or daily treatment with insulin to antagonize the effects of diabetes. Streptozotocin-treated rats displayed higher ethylmorphine and erythromycin N-demethylase activities and lauric acid hydroxylase activity. Increases were also detected immunologically by using monospecific polyclonal antibodies against the P 450 III and P 450 IV families. All effects were prevented by nicotinamide and effectively antagonized by insulin. In order to evaluate the role of the ketone bodies in the diabetes-induced increases in the above activities, rats were rendered hyperketonaemic by dietary administration of medium-chain triacylglycerols. These hyperketonaemic animals displayed high laurate hydroxylase activity and P 450 IV apoprotein levels, similar to those seen in the diabetic animals. <b>Hyperketonaemia</b> induced by dietary means caused a modest increase in the demethylation of erythromycin and had no significant effect on the N-demethylation of ethylmorphine. Furthermore, no marked increases were evident in the P 450 III apoprotein levels in the hyperketonaemic animals. It is concluded that insulin-dependent diabetes induces proteins of the P 450 III and P 450 IV families, and that the <b>hyperketonaemia</b> that accompanies diabetes is largely responsible for the changes in the latter family...|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} of adrenocortical and thyroid hormones in {{the pathogenesis of}} ketosis, {{as well as the}} ovarian consequences of this metabolic disorder, were studied in _ 2 parity cows (n= 199) in 3 large scale dairy herds. To compare the plasma/serum concentrations of certain hormones Šcortisol, thyroxin (T 4), triiodothyronine (T 3), insulin, insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) ¹ and metabolites Šglucose (G), acetoacetic acid (ACAC), βOH-butyrate (BHB), non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), trigliceride (TG), total cholesterol (TCh) ¹, and the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood samples were taken 1 to 3 days after calving and again 4 times 7 days apart. The ACTH-challenged cortisol responsiveness and the TRH-induced T 4 /T 3 increase were determined between days 1 to 3 and again between days 28 to 35. The resumption of ovarian cyclicity was followed up by individual progesterone (P 4) profiles based on milk samples taken 3 times a week for about 80 to 85 days. BHB level of 1 mmol/L was estimated as a border line between hyper- (> 1 mmol/L) and normoketonaemic (< 1 mmol/L) conditions. Five different ketone patterns were distinguished: (1) non-ketotic (n= 98; normoketonaemia in all samples), (2) early type ketosis (n= 45; hyperketonemia was detected only in the first week after calving), (3) late type (lactational) ketosis (n= 11; after a normoketonaemic period increasing <b>hyperketonaemia</b> was detected in the 5 th, or in the 4 th and 5 th weeks), (4) temporary ketosis (n= 11; <b>hyperketonaemia</b> was detected for 1 - 2 weeks in the 2 nd and 3 rd or in the 3 rd and 4 th weeks); (5) long-lasting ketosis (n= 34; <b>hyperketonaemia</b> has been detected since calving for 4 to 5 weeks or until dying / emergency slaughtering). Simultaneously with the hyperketonaemic stage increased NEFA, ACAC, depressed TCh, glucose and decreased insulin, IGF- 1, T 4 and T 3 concentrations were detected in almost all the cases. Obvious metabolic and endocrine alterations were found, however, only in long-lasting ketosis. The TRH-stimulated T 4 and T 3 responses remained almost unaffected proving intact thyroid function in early and late type as well as in temporary ketosis. Depressed thyroid response and delayed onset of cyclic ovarian function were detected only in cases of long-lasting ketosis. The cows characterized by lower than normal (<mean-SD of non-ketotic cows) ACTH-stimulated cortisol response on days 1 - 3 after calving showed poorer chance for spontaneous recovery. There was a significant negative correlation between the IGF- 1 level in the 1 st week after calving and the duration of the postpartum acyclic period.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{demonstrated}} {{relationship between}} rumination time and health status, the general welfare and metabolic condition of ruminants are often assessed by the examination of rumen function.

The studied sample gave a highly significant response, showing that the selected diseases had a diminishing impact on RA and LW and no influence on MY. It can be concluded that the change of RA as determined by electronic monitoring, complemented by the change of LW, is a useful general indicator of health status and subclinical disease before the appearance of clinical signs...|$|E
40|$|Ketosis was {{diagnosed}} in {{a flock of}} Merino ewes that conceived from synchronised oestrus in the early autumn period. On day 140 of pregnancy the ewes were sampled for determination of βOH-butyrate (BHB), AST, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), total cholesterol (TCH), insulin, T 4, T 3, cortisol, IGF- 1 and leptin. The results were evaluated according {{to the number of}} fetuses born some days later and the presence of <b>hyperketonaemia</b> (BHB: ≥ 1. 60 mmol/l). In May, about 3 months after lambing, cyclic ovarian function was induced (Cronolone + eCG), and the ewes were inseminated artificially (AI) 48 h after the removal of gestagen-containing sponge. At the time of AI and 10 days later blood samples were collected again to check the plasma levels of the same constituents as previously (in samples taken at AI), and to monitor the ovarian response by assaying progesterone (in both samples). On day 140 of gestation significantly lower BHB levels were detected in dams with single (n = 41) than in those with twin (n = 57) pregnancies. <b>Hyperketonaemia</b> was found only in ewes bearing twins (n = 27). These animals had higher NEFA and cortisol, and lower TCH, insulin, IGF- 1, leptin and T 3 levels than their normoketonaemic twin-bearing flock-mates, and those with single pregnancy. The blood glucose concentrations varied within a wide range, and the means of groups did not exhibit any significant differences. The formerly hyperketonaemic individuals were characterised by lower leptin level 3 months after lambing, and they showed a poorer response to the cycle-induction procedure than the others. The non-responders had lower IGF- 1 and leptin levels than those ovulated after this treatment. It was concluded that the subclinical form of ovine ketosis is characterised by complex endocrine alterations, reflecting an obvious form of negative energy balance. If attempts to induce cyclic ovarian function outside the breeding season are made soon after lambing, the ovarian response and fertility of these ewes may also be depressed...|$|E
40|$|Low {{expression}} of the mitochondrial 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase gene during development correlates with an unusually low hepatic ketogenic capacity and lack of <b>hyperketonaemia</b> in piglets.

The 581 bp region proximal to the transcription start site permits transcription of a reporter gene, confirming {{the function of the}} promoter. The pig mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase promoter is trans-activated by the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and a functional response element for PPAR (PPRE) has been localized in the promoter region.

Glucagon caused a rise in glucose 3 hours after a meal with a fall in lactate and alanine; no effect of glucagon was seen after a 12 -hour fast. Normal increments in glucose followed oral galactose or alanine. Liver and abdominal wall muscle biopsies were taken. Glycogen content was subnormal in liver but normal in muscle. Glycogen synthetase (EC 2. 4. 1. 11) was virtually absent from liver but fully active in muscle. Hepatic glycogen synthetase deficiency causing fasting hypoglycaemia has been confirmed.

40|$|Abstract The rate of {{turnover}} and oxidation of plasma free {{fatty acids}} (FITA) was measured in 7 normal anaesthetized dogs infused at a constant rate with l‐ 14 C‐palmitate for 5 h. After a control period, sustained <b>hyperketonaemia</b> was induced by infusing sodium aceto‐acetate (AA). This produced a fall in plasma FFA (33 %) and in blood sugar (24 %), without changes in immuno‐reactive insulin (IRI) concentrations. During the control period, the turnover rate of carbon of FFA averaged 131 μat. /kg/min, 32 % of which were oxidized, thus supplying 17. 7 % of the total CO 2 production. At {{the end of the}} AA infusion, the mean turnover rate of FFA was reduced to 75 μat. C/kg/min; since only 13. 9 % of these were oxidized, the contribution of FFA to total CO 2 production was reduced to 4. 3 %. In the light of previous work showing that ketone infusions also reduce the rate of turnover and oxidation of glucose in dogs, we conclude that, under appropriate experimental conditions, ketones may strongly reduce the role of FFA and glucose as sources of energy.

40|$|Insulin {{action is}} viewed as a set of {{branching}} pathways, with some actions serving to regulate energy metabolism and others to regulate cellular growth and development 1. Thus far, available genetic evidence has supported this view. In humans, complete lack of insulin receptors due to mutations of the insulin receptor gene results in severe growth retardation and mild diabetes 2, 3. In mice, targeted inactivation of insulin receptor sub-strate- 1, an important substrate of the insulin receptor kinase, leads to inhibition of growth and mild resistance to the metabolic actions of insulin 4, 5. To address the question of whether both metabolic and growth-promoting actions of insulin are mediated by the insulin receptor, we have generated mice lacking insulin receptors by targeted mutagenesis in embryo-derived stem (ES) cells. Unlike human patients lacking insulin receptors 6 − 9, mice homozygous for a null allele of the insulin receptor gene are born at term with apparently normal intrauterine growth and development. Within hours of birth, however, homozygous null mice develop severe hyperglycaemia and <b>hyperketonaemia,</b> and die as the result of diabetic ketoacidosis in 48 − 72 hours. These data are consistent with a model in which the insulin receptor functions primarily to mediate the metabolic actions of insulin...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Diabetes ketoacidoisis (DKA) is {{characterized}} by <b>hyperketonaemia,</b> metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycemia. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the demographic profile, clinical characterstics of patients admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis in BPKIHS, medical ward. Settings and Design: The hospital based descriptive study. Materials and Methods: We took all the patients admitted with a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as defined ADA 2006 consensus statement in medical ward from January 2010 to December 2010. The statistical operations was done through Manufactured by IBM Corp. Results: Only sixteen patients (7 type 1 and 9 type 2 DM) were with DKA. When compared to the 16 subjects with type 1 DM,the type 2 were older (56. 8 s 25. 7 years) and had a significantly higher PH levels (7. 11 s 7. 28 P = 0. 04). The mean body mass index was 20. 5 ± 2. 44 in both Type 1 and type 2 DM. Four were on diet control and Insulin respectively. Five were on oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) and three on both (insulin and OHA). Infection was most common precipitating factor (56. 25 %) followed by poor drug compliance (37. 5 %) and first presentation (6. 25 %). Conclusions: We found majority of patients were type 2 DM.

40|$|In the {{suckling}} newborn rat, blood {{ketone bodies}} begin to increase slowly 4 h after birth and then rise sharply between 12 and 16 h, whereas the major increase in plasma non-esterified fatty acids and liver carnitine occurs {{during the first}} 2 h of life, parallel {{with the onset of}} suckling. In the starved newborn rat, which shows no increase in liver carnitine unless it is fed with a carnitine solution, the developmental pattern of the ketogenic capacity (tested by feeding a triacylglycerol emulsion, which increases plasma non-esterified fatty acids by 3 -fold) is the same as in the suckling animal. This suggests that the increases in plasma non-esterified fatty acids and liver carnitine seen 2 h after birth in the suckling animal are not the predominant factors inducing the switch-on of ketogenesis. Injection of butyrate to starved newborn pups resulted in a pattern of blood ketone bodies which was similar to that found after administration of triacylglycerols, but, at all time points studied, the <b>hyperketonaemia</b> was more pronounced with butyrate. It is suggested that, even if the entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria is a rate-limiting step, {{it is not the only}} factor controlling ketogenesis after birth in the rat.

A positive correlation between the amount of calcium levulinate administered and the degree of hyperglutamic acidaemia was found. Replacement of the calcium levulinate by another calcium salt caused a reversal of the biochemical abnormalities of the patients. Two of the infants had a 22 q 11 microdeletion. This development of severe acidosis in infants who had been given a calcium supplement in the form of calcium levulinate may be related to genetic predisposition. The paradoxal <b>hyperketonaemia</b> and generalized aminoaciduria in 4 other patients suggested disturbed function ofthe mitochondrial respiratory chain. The hypothesis of the occurrence of an underlying defect of the mitochondrial respiratory chain was tested in the muscle tissue of one 22 q 11 patient, but this showed no abnormalities. Excessive accumulation of glutamate because of dysfunction ofglutamine synthetase, which forms glutamate from glutamine seems unlikely because of the relatively low values of plasma glutamate compared to the glutamine plasma levels.

40|$|Background: Ovine {{pregnancy}} toxaemia is {{a common}} metabolic disorder of ewes due to increased foetal energy requirements in late pregnancy. This pathology is a metabolic condition characterized by hypoglycaemia and <b>hyperketonaemia</b> resulting in {{the inability of the}} animal to maintain an adequate energy balance. The response to treatment is effective, if it is started {{in the early stages of}} the disease, when irreversible neurological injuries have not yet been established. The aim was to evaluate three therapeutic alternatives to effectively reverse the disease process in its early stages. For this, thirty adult Corriedale ewes, pregnant with a single lamb, were randomly separated in three groups of ten animals each, at day 130 of gestation. From that day onwards, ewes were locked up for forage fasting until glycaemia reached clinical values defining sub-clinical pregnancy toxaemia (1. 59 ± 0. 24 mmol/L). After fasting, ewes grazed and received a treatment for 4 days: 50 ml i. v. infusions of hypertonic glucose and 20 UI insulin/ewe/day s. c. or 100 ml/ sheep/ 12 h of glycerol together with propylene glycol oral solution or fed with pasture supplemented with two daily intakes 300 g/sheep of cracked corn.

The ruminal microflora hydrolyses a good part of NSPs, however, recently there have been attempts to enhance the rate of utilisation by using external polysaccharidase enzymes. In the present study the effects of an enzyme preparation (Rumino-Zyme) high in xylanase activity were studied on ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, parameters of energy and protein metabolism, milk yield, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and body condition score of high-yielding dairy cows. A lignolytic enzyme preparation produced by the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus was applied in the present experiment and fed to dairy cows at 34 g/day dosage in the period between calving and the 110 th day of lactation. This preparation increased VFA concentration in the rumen from about 32 days after calving and onward. Increased VFA concentration was followed by an about 5 to 10 % increase in milk production and an almost 0. 1 % increase in butterfat production. Increased VFA concentration produced more balanced energy metabolism in the experimental cows as indicated by the lower incidence rate of <b>hyperketonaemia,</b> and lower acetoacetic acid and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration in the blood of the experimental cows. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity was tendentiously higher in the control group and the proportion of cows that had AST activity higher than 100 U/l was also higher in the control group. Both control and experimental cows showed balanced protein and acid-base metabolism throughout the experiment. Enhanced VFA concentration contributed to an improvement in energy balance in the experimental cows with a resultant improvement of feed intake and feed utilisation.

Intravenous injection of streptozotocin (10 rabbits, dose 30 - 200 mg/kg) was not followed so regularly by hyperglycaemia but even {{so many of these}} animals also showed increased sensitivity to ADP. After neither alloxan nor streptozotocin did the increased sensitivity correlate with the dose of agent used, the time between its injection and ADP testing, or changes in the rabbit's body weight. Again, ADP sensitivity did not correlate with the degree of hyperglycaemia, <b>hyperketonaemia</b> or hyperlactacidaemia. There was no rapid change in ADP sensitivity after i. v. injection of glucose to produce hyperglycaemia in normal rabbits, nor after parenteral or topical administration of insulin. Use of a removable skull capsule allowed serial observations on individual animals and these, together with observations on rabbits injected first with alloxan and later with daily insulin, showed reversibility of the increased ADP sensitivity by regular insulin injection for at least 5 days; this effect did not depend upon return of blood glucose levels to normal. In cross-perfusion experiments the increased ADP sensitivity was found to be dependent upon a blood factor for such sensitivity was shown by the head of a normal rabbit perfused with blood from a diabetic trunk. The results did not exclude a contribution of a mural factor to the results in intact animals after alloxan.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{study the}} {{pathogenesis}} of diabetic cardiomyopathy, reliable animal models of type 2 diabetes are required. Physiologically relevant rodent models are needed, which not only replicate the human pathology but also mimic the disease process. Here we characterised cardiac metabolic abnormalities, and investigated the optimal experimental approach for inducing disease, in {{a new model of}} type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet for three weeks, with a single intraperitoneal injection of low dose streptozotocin (STZ) after fourteen days at 15, 20, 25 or 30 mg/kg body weight. Compared with chow-fed or high-fat diet fed control rats, a high-fat diet in combination with doses of 15 - 25 mg/kg STZ did not change insulin concentrations and rats maintained body weight. In contrast, 30 mg/kg STZ induced hypoinsulinaemia, <b>hyperketonaemia</b> and weight loss. There was a dose-dependent increase in blood glucose and plasma lipids with increasing concentrations of STZ. Cardiac and hepatic triglycerides were increased by all doses of STZ, in contrast, cardiac glycogen concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing STZ concentrations. Cardiac glucose transporter 4 protein levels were decreased, whereas fatty acid metabolism-regulated proteins, including uncoupling protein 3 and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4, were increased with increasing doses of STZ. Cardiac PDH activity displayed a dose-dependent relationship between enzyme activity and STZ concentration. Cardiac insulin-stimulated glycolytic rates were decreased by 17 % in 15 mg/kg STZ high-fat fed diabetic rats compared with control rats, with no effect on cardiac contractile function. CONCLUSIONS: High-fat feeding in combination with a low dose of STZ induced cardiac metabolic changes that mirror the decrease in glucose metabolism and increase in fat metabolism in diabetic patients. While low doses of 15 - 25 mg/kg STZ induced a type 2 diabetic phenotype, higher doses more closely recapitulated type 1 diabetes, demonstrating that the severity of diabetes can be modified according to the requirements of the study...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the {{relationship}} between the body condition and the results of metabolic profile tests done in the milk (DIM) of dairy cows in different days. Moreover, critical points in the early pre- and postpartum period were also analysed. In the experiment, blood and urine samples were taken from 1984 clinically healthy cows (from 49 large scale dairy farms in Hungary), selected randomly from various groups of cows with different physiological stage of lactation and gestation, 3 - 5 hours after the morning feeding. During the experiment body condition scoring (BCS) was measured on 1 - 5 scale, as well. It was concluded, that the BCS (body condition score) decreased from the 1 st day of lactation (3. 48) onwards till the 44 th day (2. 65) and slightly increased till the day 218 (2. 89). The haemoglobin value and the glucose concentration in blood samples were ranging within the physiological range and followed the tendency of BCS and the relationship between them and DIM was (P< 0. 001). There was a close negative correlation between the NEFA (non-esterified-fatty-acid) concentration in blood samples and BCS change and it was found that these values were significantly different (P< 0. 01) compared to the DIM. The aceto-acetic acid concentration exceeded the upper limit of the physiological range indicating <b>hyperketonaemia</b> at DIM 18. The AST (aspartate aminotransferase, liver-enzyme) activity value exceeded the upper limit of physiological range and followed the tendency of BCS change.

40|$|Introduction: Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} (DKA) {{is a major}} life-threatening {{complication of}} both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Insulin treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis is guided using the changes in blood glucose levels, blood gas analysis and urine ketone measurement. Evidence {{for the use of}} capillary β -Hydroxybuterate in the monitoring of therapy for diabetic ketoacidosis is not sufficient, and needs to be evaluated in adult patients. The present study was undertaken to determine if quantitative measurement of β- Hydroxybuterate can simplify the management of diabetic ketoacidosis, and if the correction of <b>hyperketonaemia</b> could predict resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis. Methods: A prospective, descriptive study, evaluating measurement of capillary β-Hydroxybuterate in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis was performed. The relationship between capillary β-Hydroxybuterate levels and values of pH was assessed during treatment and as a possible end point evaluation for intravenous insulin therapy. Patients were recruited at two hospitals over a 24 month period. All patients were treated according to a standard DKA management protocol. Data was collected until resolution of DKA and all patients were followed up until discharge. Results: 54 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age of included patients was 36. 4 years (SD 10. 32). The relationship between capillary ketones, (β - hydroxybuterate) and pH was explored using non- linear mixed models, fitted with restricted cubic splines. The results from this analysis suggest a complex, time dependant association between pH and measured β - Hydroxybuterate. Assessing if β-Hydroxybuterate could predict normalisation of pH, was done with logistic regression (with subject-specific intercept and slope) including restricted cubic splines. From this model it is evident that the cut-off values for resolution, using capillary ketones, is definitely time dependent. Conclusion: This study did not show to a clinically significant, applicable relationship between capillary β-Hydroxybuterate levels and values of pH during treatment of DKA. A single cut-off value for DKA resolution could not be determined, suggesting that β-Hydroxybuterate capillary measurement alone cannot be used as a possible end point evaluation for intravenous insulin therapy.
