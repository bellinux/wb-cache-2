50|$|Halogens {{are highly}} reactive, {{and as such}} can be harmful or lethal to {{biological}} organisms in sufficient quantities. This high reactivity {{is due to the}} high electronegativity of the atoms due to their high effective nuclear charge. Because the halogens have seven valence electrons in their outermost energy level, they can gain an electron by reacting with atoms of other elements to satisfy the octet rule. Fluorine {{is one of the most}} reactive elements, attacking otherwise-inert materials such as glass, and forming compounds with the usually inert noble gases. It is a corrosive and <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>gas.</b> The reactivity of fluorine is such that, if used or stored in laboratory glassware, it can react with glass in the presence of small amounts of water to form silicon tetrafluoride (SiF4).

40|$|Early {{concerns}} over the handling of toxic materials related primarily {{to the safety of}} the operator. Safety procedures relating to prevention of ingestion, inhalation and skin contact, have been developed and in the field of CVD processing, many good standard practices are being used. Frequently, the safety procedures adopted for dealing with <b>toxic</b> <b>gases</b> and fumes rely on dilution in a forced air extraction enclosure to a level which under normal operating conditions reduce the <b>toxic</b> <b>gas</b> concentration to levels below the maximum exposure limit (MEL). Today, however, much more attention is being paid to the environmental issues and simply to dilute toxic fumes is no longer considered an acceptable practice. Handling of liquid and solid toxic waste products also poses concerns regarding final safe disposal, and the techniques employed as part of the CVD process for removal of toxic waste will impact significantly on this. This paper considers the issues involved in handling of <b>toxic</b> <b>gases</b> and particularly techniques for scrubbing gas effluent. The types of scrubber commonly used will be discussed and the results reported on two types of commercially available scrubbers that have been used on MOCVD systems in our laboratories. In addition we will consider the opportunities for replacing some of the <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>gases</b> with less hazardous materials and report on current progress with substitutes for arsine and phosphine.

The reaction mechanism appears to be the same on Pt SPEs as on Pt microelectrodes. Furthermore, the analytical utility was studied to understand the behaviour of these <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>gases</b> at low concentrations on SPEs, with calibration graphs obtained from 10 to 80 ppm. Three different electrochemical techniques were employed: linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV), with no significant differences in the limits of detection (LODs) between the techniques (LODs were between 1. 4 to 3. 6 ppm for all three techniques for both gases). The LODs achieved on Pt SPEs were lower than the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration Permissible Exposure Limit (OSHA PEL) limits of the two gases (5 ppm for HCl and 10 ppm for MA), suggesting that Pt SPEs can successfully be combined with RTILs to be used as cheap alternatives for amperometric gas sensing in applications where these <b>toxic</b> <b>gases</b> may be released...|$|R
