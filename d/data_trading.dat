40|$|Motivated by the {{recently}} launched mobile <b>data</b> <b>trading</b> markets (e. g., China Mobile Hong Kong's 2 nd exChange Market), {{in this paper}} we study the mobile <b>data</b> <b>trading</b> problem under the future data demand uncertainty. We introduce a brokerage-based market, where sellers and buyers propose their selling and buying quantities, respectively, to the trading platform that matches the market supply and demand. To understand the users' realistic trading behaviors, a prospect theory (PT) model from behavioral economics is proposed, which includes the widely adopted expected utility theory (EUT) as a special case. Although the PT modeling leads to a challenging non-convex optimization problem, the optimal solution can be characterized by exploiting the unimodal structure of the objective function. Building upon our analysis, we design an algorithm to help estimate the user's risk preference and provide trading recommendations dynamically, considering the latest market and usage information. It is shown in our simulation that the risk preferences {{have a significant impact on}} the user's decision and outcome: a risk-averse dominant user can guarantee a higher minimum profit in the trading, while a risk-seeking dominant user can achieve a higher maximum profit. By comparing with the EUT benchmark, it is shown that a PT user with a low reference point is more willing to buy mobile data. Moreover, when the probability of high future data demand is low, a PT user is more willing to buy mobile data due to the probability distortion comparing with an EUT user.

40|$|Following {{the trend}} of <b>data</b> <b>trading</b> and data publishing, many online social {{networks}} have enabled potentially sensitive data to be exchanged or shared on the web. As a result, users' privacy could be exposed to malicious third parties since they are extremely vulnerable to de-anonymization attacks, i. e., the attacker links the anonymous nodes in the social network to their real identities {{with the help of}} background knowledge. Previous work in social network de-anonymization mostly focuses on designing accurate and efficient de-anonymization methods. We study this topic from a different perspective and attempt to investigate the intrinsic relation between the attacker's knowledge and the expected de-anonymization gain. One common intuition is that the more auxiliary information the attacker has, the more accurate de-anonymization becomes. However, their relation is much more sophisticated than that. To simplify the problem, we attempt to quantify background knowledge and de-anonymization gain under several assumptions. Our theoretical analysis and simulations on synthetic and real network data show that more background knowledge may not necessarily lead to more de-anonymization gain in certain cases. Though our analysis is based on a few assumptions, the findings still leave intriguing implications for the attacker to make better use of the background knowledge when performing de-anonymization, and for the data owners to better measure the privacy risk when releasing their data to third parties...|$|E

40|$|The {{idea of an}} {{open data}} market envisions the {{creation}} of a <b>data</b> <b>trading</b> model to facilitate exchange of data between different parties in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. The data collected by IoT products and solutions are expected to be traded in these markets. Data owners will collect data using IoT products and solutions.

Data captured by IoT products will allow data consumers to further understand the preferences and behaviours of data owners and to generate additional business value using different techniques ranging from waste reduction to personalized service offerings. In open data markets, data consumers will be able to give back part of the additional value generated to the data owners.
