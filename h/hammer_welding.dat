5000|$|Close {{inspection}} {{reveals that}} it may be made up from pieces of different swords fitted together. Part of this could have come from a late-13th-century sword.David Caldwell, [...] writes that [...] "Apart from the reshaping of the guard, this sword does not appear untypical of the two-handed swords in use in the lowlands of Scotland in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth centuries.” (page 174) and that the blade has a ricasso, which is not a medieval feature. However, the blade appears to be made of 3 separate pieces <b>hammer</b> <b>welded</b> together. The bottommost piece has a flattened diamond cross-section, and so perhaps might be a 13th-century sword, and therefore there is some hope for those who think that Wallace's sword is there.|$|R
50|$|A closed eyebar will {{typically}} have a rectangular {{cross section of}} constant thinness throughout its length and a constant width {{for all but the}} ends. The ends will transition to a wider part that is terminated by a rounded end. In the center of this end will be a hole which will receive a cylindrical pin, which may have provision to accept one or more nuts or bolts.If of round cross section the bar will typically be end-forged to create a head, which is then flatted by additional forging. The head may then be machined to a precise thickness and flatness. An alternative method for using round bar is to form a loop and to forge-weld (<b>hammer</b> <b>weld)</b> or electrically weld the free end to the main bar.|$|R

50|$|The most {{well-known}} and oldest forge-welding {{process is the}} manual-hammering method. Manual hammering is done by heating the metal to the proper temperature, coating with flux, overlapping the weld surfaces, and then striking the joint repeatedly with a hand-held <b>hammer.</b> The <b>weld</b> surfaces are usually formed for the proper joint, and then struck with a hammer to join them. The joint is often formed to allow space for the flux to flow out, by beveling or rounding the surfaces slightly, and hammered in a successively outward fashion to squeeze the flux out. The hammer blows are typically not as hard as those used for shaping, preventing the flux from being blasted out of the joint at the first blow.|$|R

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and <b>hammering.</b> Arc <b>welding</b> and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|R
6000|$|But the Prince Prospero {{was happy}} and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his {{presence}} a thousand hale and light-hearted friends {{from among the}} knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion {{of one of his}} castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy <b>hammers</b> and <b>welded</b> the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think.

50|$|For instance, two {{processes}} {{were used}} in constructing iron armor. In the first, hammering, large lumps of iron of scrap or puddled iron were heated to welding temperature and placed under heavy steel <b>hammers.</b> Repeated blows <b>welded</b> these lumps into one solid plate and shaped it to the required form and dimensions. Hammered iron plate was the armor used in the earliest ironclad vessels, including HMS Warrior. The second method, rolling, involved stacking iron lumps atop one another, heating them to welding temperature and passing them between two iron rollers to become one plate of the required size. Rolled iron was difficult to produce initially, as it required machinery of immense size and great power. However, when the Special Committee tested both types of plate in 1863, it found that rolled iron was superior to hammered due to greater uniformity in quality. The committee and iron manufacturers worked together on how to more easily produce rolled plate, which became standard use in warships beginning in 1865.|$|R

Deverell, engineer of Surrey, filed a patent for a steam-powered hammer or stamper.The <b>hammer</b> would be <b>welded</b> to a piston rod contained in a cylinder.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In {{heavy truck}} {{applications}} welds {{are commonly used}} to join structural steel components that are subjected to cyclical loads. In cases where a weld fatigue issue is discovered in the field the customer desires to have low-cost methods to increase service life. This research was initiated to recommend a process for treating welded joints on heavy trucks that can be accomplished in the field with limited manufacturing resources. Surface peening is a cold working process that introduces beneficial residual compressive stresses in {{the surface of a}} work piece. Two different surface peening processes were evaluated for their ability to increase fatigue life in fillet welds. These processes were hammer peening and rotary flap peening. T-shaped fillet weld test samples were fabricated and subjected to cyclic loading in three configurations; as-welded, <b>welded</b> and <b>hammer</b> peened, and <b>welded</b> and flap peened. Metallographic inspection was used to further evaluate the test samples following fatigue testing. Fatigue life estimation methods were considered based on both experimentally measured strain data and stress/strain results obtained through the use of finite element methods. Stress-life analyses based on weld classifications established by British Standard BS 7608 were conducted. Strain-life analyses based on the use of A 36 steel fatigue properties with the application of a fatigue notch factor were also conducted...|$|R
6000|$|... § 5. Now, so {{far from}} the labor's being turned to good account which is given to our English [...] "finishing," [...] I believe it to be usually {{destructive}} of the best powers of our workmen's minds. For it is evident, in the first place, that there is almost always a useful and a useless finish; the <b>hammering</b> and <b>welding</b> which are necessary to produce a sword plate of the best quality, are useful finishing; the polishing of its surface, useless.[38] In nearly all work this distinction will, more or less, take place between substantial finish and apparent finish, or what may be briefly characterized as [...] "Make" [...] and [...] "Polish." [...] And so far as finish is bestowed for purposes of [...] "make," [...] I have nothing to say against it. Even the vanity which displays itself in giving strength to our work is rather a virtue than a vice. But so far as finish is bestowed for purposes of [...] "polish," [...] there is much to be said against it; this first, and very strongly, that the qualities aimed at in common finishing, namely, smoothness, delicacy, or fineness, cannot in reality exist, in a degree worth admiring, in anything done by human hands. Our best finishing is but coarse and blundering work after all We may smooth, and soften, and sharpen till we are sick at heart; but take a good magnifying glass to our miracle of skill, and the invisible edge is a jagged saw, and the silky thread a rugged cable, and the soft surface a granite desert. Let all the ingenuity and all the art of the human race be brought to bear upon the attainment of the utmost possible finish, and they could not do what is done in the foot of a fly, or the film of a bubble. God alone can finish; and the more intelligent the human mind becomes, the more the infiniteness of interval is felt between human and divine work in this respect. So then it is not a little absurd to weary ourselves in struggling towards a point which we never can reach, and to exhaust our strength in vain endeavors to produce qualities which exist inimitably and inexhaustibly in the commonest things around us.|$|R
60|$|Our world, then, cannot {{understand}} St. Thomas, {{any more}} than St. Francis, without accepting very simply a flaming and even fantastic charity, by which the great Archbishop undoubtedly stands {{for the victims of}} this world, where the wheel of fortune grinds the faces of the poor. He may well have been too idealistic; he wished to protect the Church as a sort of earthly paradise, of which the rules might seem to him as paternal as those of heaven, but might well seem to the King as capricious as those of fairyland. But if the priest was too idealistic, the King was really too practical; it is intrinsically true to say he was too practical to succeed in practice. There re-enters here, and runs, I think, through all English history, the rather indescribable truth I have suggested about the Conqueror; that perhaps he was hardly impersonal enough for a pure despot. The real moral of our mediæval story is, I think, subtly contrary to Carlyle's vision of a stormy strong man to <b>hammer</b> and <b>weld</b> the state like a smith. Our strong men were too strong for us, and too strong for themselves. They were too strong for their own aim of a just and equal monarchy. The smith broke upon the anvil the sword of state that he was hammering for himself. Whether or no this will serve as a key to the very complicated story of our kings and barons, it is the exact posture of Henry II. to his rival. He became lawless out of sheer love of law. He also stood, though in a colder and more remote manner, for the whole people against feudal oppression; and if his policy had succeeded in its purity, it would at least have made impossible the privilege and capitalism of later times. But that bodily restlessness which stamped and spurned the furniture was a symbol of him; it was some such thing that prevented him and his heirs from sitting as quietly on their throne as the heirs of St. Louis. He thrust again and again at the tough intangibility of the priests' Utopianism like a man fighting a ghost; he answered transcendental defiances with baser material persecutions; and at last, on a dark and, I think, decisive day in English history, his word sent four feudal murderers into the cloisters of Canterbury, who went there to destroy a traitor and who created a saint.|$|R
60|$|The treatment, however, that I have {{to bring}} before you is of another kind; {{and it is in}} the hope that we shall be able before long to have such a thing as the {{manufacture}} of platinum of this kind, that I am encouraged to come before you, and tell you how far Deville has gone in the matter, and to give you illustrations of the principles on which he proceeds. I think it is but fair that you should see an experiment shewing you {{the way in which we}} get the adhesion of platinum. Probably you all know of the welding of iron: you go into the smith's shop, and you see him put the handle of a poker on to the stem, and by a little management and the application of heat he makes them one. You have no doubt seen him put the iron into the fire and sprinkle a little sand upon it. He does not know the philosophy he calls into play when he sprinkles a little sand over the oxide of iron, but he has a fine philosophy there, or practises it, when he gets his welding. I can shew you here this beautiful circumstance of the sticking together of the particles up to the fullest possible intensity of their combination. If you were to go into the workshops of Mr. Matthey, and see them <b>hammering</b> and <b>welding</b> away, you would see the value of the experiment I am about to shew you. I have here some platinum-wire. This is a metal which resists the action of acids, resists oxidation by heat, and change of any sort; and which, therefore, I may heat in the atmosphere without any flux. I bend the wire so as to make the ends cross: these I make hot by means of the blowpipe, and then, by giving them a tap with a hammer, I shall make them into one piece. Now that the pieces are united, I shall have great difficulty in pulling them apart, though they are joined only at the point where the two cylindrical surfaces came together. And now I have succeeded in pulling the wire apart, the division is not at the point of welding, but where the force of the pincers has cut it, so that the junction we have effected is a complete one. This, then, is the principle of the manufacture and production of platinum in the old way.|$|R
5000|$|The {{legitimate}} Japanese {{sword is}} made from Japanese steel [...] "Tamahagane". [...] The most common lamination method the Japanese sword blade is formed from {{is a combination of}} two different steels: a harder outer jacket of steel wrapped around a softer inner core of steel. This creates a blade which has a hard, razor sharp cutting edge with the ability to absorb shock in a way which reduces the possibility of the blade breaking when used in combat. The hadagane, for the outer skin of the blade, is produced by heating a block of raw steel, which is then hammered out into a bar, and the flexible back portion. This is then cooled and broken up into smaller blocks which are checked for further impurities and then reassembled and reforged. During this process the billet of steel is heated and hammered, split and folded back upon itself many times and re-welded to create a complex structure of many thousands of layers. Each different steel is folded differently, in order to provide the necessary strength and flexibility to the different steels. The precise way in which the steel is folded, hammered and re-welded determines the distinctive grain pattern of the blade, the jihada, (also called jigane when referring to the actual surface of the steel blade) a feature which is indicative of the period, place of manufacture and actual maker of the blade. The practice of folding also ensures a somewhat more homogeneous product, with the carbon in the steel being evenly distributed and the steel having no voids that could lead to fractures and failure of the blade in combat.The shingane (for the inner core of the blade) is of a relatively softer steel with a lower carbon content than the hadagane. For this, the block is again <b>hammered,</b> folded and <b>welded</b> in a similar fashion to the hadagane, but with fewer folds. At this point, the hadagane block is once again heated, hammered out and folded into a ‘U’ shape, into which the shingane is inserted to a point just short of the tip. The new composite steel billet is then heated and hammered out ensuring that no air or dirt is trapped between the two layers of steel. The bar increases in length during this process until it approximates the final size and shape of the finished sword blade. A triangular section is cut off from the tip of the bar and shaped to create what will be the kissaki. At this point in the process, the blank for the blade is of rectangular section. This rough shape is referred to as a sunobe.|$|R
