40|$|Using neutron {{diffraction}} under pressure at room temperature, we observed that pyrrhotite undergoes a ferrimagnetic to paramagnetic transition at about 2. 8 GPa. Complete demagnetization of remanence {{at the same}} pressure is confirmed in an independent experiment. Such a process provides a quantitative explanation of the magnetic structure of the Martian Southern Hemisphere assuming that pyrrhotite is the major magnetic mineral and that our static experiments can be extrapolated to dynamic pressure conditions. Indeed, the 3 GPa <b>isobaric</b> <b>line</b> during the two large impacts of Argyre and Hellas separates the magnetized and unmagnetized zones. We also infer a reinterpretation of Martian meteorites paleomagnetic signal...|$|E

30|$|The South Rumaila {{oil field}} has four {{production}} sectors: Qurainat (north), Shamiya, Rumaila, and Janubia (south). The area investigated includes Rumaila sector and souther and northern parts from Shamiya and Janubia sectors, respectively. This sector was {{selected based on}} the availability of data and the ability to represent the largest part, where the production and injection operations are carried out. In this sector, two kinds of boundary conditions encountered: a no-flow and an aquifer boundaries. The no-flow northern and southern boundaries are assumed, because the <b>isobaric</b> <b>lines</b> are perpendicular to these boundaries, where the production flow lines are in parallel. The infinite active aquifer at the eastern and western flanks represents a no-flow boundaries (Al-Mudhafer et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new type of spline {{functions}} defined over a quadrangular mesh equipped with an equivalence relation, {{in such a way that}} physical spaces with a complex topology can be represented as an homomorphic image of such meshes. We provide general definitions, a dimension formula for a subclass of these spline spaces, an explicit construction of their bases and also a process for local refinement. These developments, motivated by plane curvilinear mesh constructions are illustrated on several parametrization problems. Our main target in these constructions is to approximate <b>isobaric</b> <b>lines</b> of magnetic fields encountered in MHD simulation for Tokamaks.

Topics include a history of wind usage (grinding grain, pumping water, transportation), including the development of wind power in the United States and its more recent adaptations for producing electricity. There is also discussion of the physics behind the operation of a windmill and what drives the wind patterns in Earth's atmosphere. The lesson includes an activity in which students use online resources to study the relationship between barometric pressure and wind speed and direction. They will collect data on barometric pressure, wind speed, and wind direction for several days, map it, and look for relationships between wind speed and direction and the <b>isobaric</b> <b>lines</b> on the map.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{telegraph}} it was possible to simultaneously collect data, such as surface temperature and sea-level pressure, to draw synoptic weather charts. With Charles Todd's appointment as Postmaster General to the Colony, he trained not only his telegraph operators, but also his postmasters as weather observers. These observers provided valuable data points that, in combination with telegraphed observations from the other colonies (including New Zealand), showed the development and progress of weather activity across {{a large part of the}} Southern Hemisphere. Todd's best known feat was his construction management of the Overland Telegraph from Adelaide to Port Darwin. This line of communication was critical to his capacity to create continent-wide synoptic charts as the telegraphic observations from the Outback enabled the connection of data points on the east coast of Australia with similar data points on the west and southern coasts. These continent-scale <b>isobaric</b> <b>lines</b> allowed Todd and his staff to draw synoptic charts that in the early 1880s had a greater breadth than any (known) synoptic charts drawn elsewhere in the world.|$|R

Sometimes damage {{to the extent that the}} economic system, social disrupts a country. The aim of this study is to analyze the synoptic conditions of severe storms is Zab basin. In this study, given the scale of temporal and spatial distribution, wind speed and comprehensiveness of the three threshold size and calculate the 90 th percentile wind speed, Forty days pervasive and severe storms were selected. Sea level pressure data and the elevation data of 500 hp level from the database NCEP/NCAR were extracted. Matrix was formed that storm was on the rows and elevation data middle levels of the atmosphere, was on the columns. Then, principal components that explain the variation in height level pressure hp 500 were identified. To identify synoptic patterns, cluster analysis integration "ward's " was performed on these components. The results showed that five synoptic pattern of atmospheric middle level, in the form of three major causes of severe storms in the Zab River Basin: Cut off low pattern, Shallow trough pattern of long wave and deep trough pattern of short wave. The most frequent traffic synoptic pattern of a synoptic pattern of middle levels and 60 % of the patterns assigned to itself, causing severe storms in the Zab River Basin. Irregularities in the movement and position of the polar vortex caused the jet stream and storm paths meridian winds greater control and troughs are driven towards the low latitudes deeper. Because of the special arrangement of relatively strong and contrasting surface synoptic, the pressure gradient and energy exchange at its maximum reached compression <b>Isobaric</b> <b>lines</b> and as a result, Strong winds in the catchment area level has been created. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} recent three-flavor QCD lattice {{data for}} the pressure, speed of soun d and interaction measure at nonzero temperature and vanishing chemical potentia l within a virial expansion. For the deconfined phase we use a phenomenological model which includes non-pert urbative effects from dimension two gluon condensates that reproduce the free en ergy of quenched QCD very well. The hadronic phase is parameterized by a generalized resonance-gas model. Furthermore, we extend this approach to finite quark densities introducing an ex plicit μ-dependence of the interaction. We calculate pressure, quark-number density, entropy and energy density and compare to results of lattice calculatio ns. We, additionally, investigate {{the structure of the}} phase diagram by calculating the <b>isobaric</b> and isentropic <b>lines</b> as well as the critical endpoint in the (T, μ_q) -plane.
