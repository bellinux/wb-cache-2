60|$|Now she laughed; it was {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> laugh for several moons.|$|E
60|$|At times, {{my memory}} reverts to Helena Gracedieu, {{and to what}} I {{discovered}} when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> diary.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked puzzled}} {{at me for}} a moment--then smiled (the first time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> do so for many a long day)--then put her arms round my neck.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{never was}} a dearer or a blesseder young lady than is my young lady, Sir,' said Susan, 'and I ought to {{know a great deal}} better than some for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in <b>her</b> grief and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in her joy (there's not been much of it) and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> with <b>her</b> brother and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> in her {{loneliness}} and some <b>have</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>I</b> say to some and all--I do!' and here the black-eyed shook her head, and slightly stamped her foot; 'that she's the blessedest and dearest angel is Miss Floy that ever drew the breath of life, the more that I was torn to pieces Sir the more I'd say it though I may not be a Fox's Martyr..' ...|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE [Shakes her head.] No; it's all right. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> Let {{her know}} we are here the moment she comes in.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Casby, could you, for the {{satisfaction}} of the friends <b>I</b> <b>have</b> mentioned, and under any obligation of secrecy that you may consider it your duty to impose, give me any information at all touching Miss Wade? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> abroad, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> at home, but I know nothing of her. Could you give me any account of her whatever?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose it}} is worth {{following}} up,' said Mark, rather reluctantly. 'I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> I think I should know Miss Headworth again, and she would hardly know me.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{advanced}} {{that the}} notion was in their heads already. But {{it was much more}} vividly in my head since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> up there with my own eyes, tempting Providence.|$|E
6000|$|I {{made the}} {{customary}} reply, {{and explained that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> at the opera. [...] "Are you staying in London?" [...] I asked. [...] "May I have the honor of calling on you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Pala. But I did: I am {{an eagle}} where <b>I</b> love; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> this half hour.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Betsey Jane,' {{returned}} Mrs Wickam in {{her most}} solemn tones, 'was put upon as that child has been put upon, and changed as that child <b>has</b> changed. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> sit, often and often, think, think, thinking, like him. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> look, often and often, old, old, old, like him. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard her, many a time, talk just like him. I consider that child and Betsey Jane on the same footing entirely, Miss Berry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} she always be at his chambers? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> there twice, Mrs. Orme. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> indeed;--with my own eyes." ...|$|R
60|$|Nor would I ever kiss her, after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> lips {{pressed by}} the snake's, though she {{sometimes}} coaxed me, and grew pettish and vexed when I would not; but she guessed not my reason.|$|E
60|$|I noted {{to myself}} at the moment, too, that in my heart, though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> but once before, I thought of her already simply as CÃ©sarine. And I {{was pleased to see}} her: fascinated: spell-bound.|$|E
60|$|Although no {{suspicion}} {{of the truth}} came to me, something about her reminded me of Hester. Even so had Hester liked to wander about the garden in the twilight. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> thus a thousand times.|$|E
6000|$|... "A perfect lady. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> {{and spoken}} to her; I answer for her manners, and I {{guarantee}} her personal appearance. Charming--charming!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You needn't {{take the}} trouble. She's coming home-along to-night of <b>her</b> own accord. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> this morning, {{and she told}} me so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but she's always nice. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> {{at home as}} much {{almost as}} you could do; and then she's so {{sincerely}} religious." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Chalmers, {{a gentleman}} in Ayrshire, a {{particular}} friend of mine, {{asked me to}} write a poetic epistle to a young lady, his Dulcinea. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> but was scarcely acquainted with her, and wrote as follows:-- ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the chamber}} {{that is called}} the Alabaster Hall, the roof of which is upborne by columns of black marble, we stayed. For beyond was the private chamber of Cleopatra, the same in which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> sleeping.|$|E
6000|$|... "One pearl I will take, {{with this}} {{particular}} object"--said Emily, with more feeling than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> manifest since she had {{got back into the}} world, [...] "if Miss Wallingford will do me the favour to select it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not always," [...] Littleson answered. [...] "Twice <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> with Norris Vine, {{and twice}} {{with a young}} Englishman {{who was on the}} steamer." ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE. Why impossible? They tell me strange {{stories about}} no one's seeing her. Miss Phoebe, I {{will not leave}} this house until <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} impossible, doctor; {{but it is}} true. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> myself," [...] and he shuddered. [...] "She has been stabbed to the heart." ...|$|R
60|$|After a short absence {{the widow}} {{returned}} to me, with a composed manner and a quiet smile. The meeting with Mr. Keller {{seemed to have}} been completely dismissed from her thoughts, in the brief interval since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> last.|$|E
60|$|She saw me as I advanced, {{and rose}} {{for a moment}} to receive me. I thought her, then, still more {{colourless}} and thin than when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> last; the flashing eyes still brighter, and the scar still plainer.|$|E
60|$|She was a {{stranger}} to me, yet I felt that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> or someone very like her before. Possibly {{she was one of}} Mr. Lawrence's many nieces who might have come up to Woodlands upon hearing of his illness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, Mirabel,' exclaimed a young man, 'who is that girl? I want to know. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> {{several times}} lately. By Jove, {{she is a}} fine creature!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} give an opinion until <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> Does she {{look as if}} she might have been a pretty woman at one time of her life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you call}} often? No; not often. I went to her last night because she {{had given me a}} commission. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> three or four times altogether." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, as for Justine Marie, I {{knew what}} she was as well as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> I knew she was well enough; there were girls like her in Madame Beck's school--phlegmatics--pale, slow, inert, but kind-natured, neutral of evil, undistinguished for good.|$|E
60|$|When {{the very}} tip of Sappho's tail had melted into the foliage of the road, I arose {{to my feet}} {{and took a deep breath}} of the happy air. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> and it was with her father she was riding.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{brought my}} {{mistress}} {{home from the}} Opera, sir. I rode on the box with Mrs. Delarey's chauffeur. After <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> safely in the hotel, I went {{up to my room}} for two minutes and left the hotel by the back entrance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And is {{at present}} in this Castle," [...] said Tressilian. [...] "I know it, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> Was it {{by her own}} choice she found refuge in my apartment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} it, mother. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> when she wouldn't kill even a fly. If she could only be made {{to see all the}} good she could do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seen her! Oh, yes, {{of course}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her.</b> Did she not send for me? {{and in that}} case it was not on the cards that I should disobey her." ...|$|R
