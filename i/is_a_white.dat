5|$|The {{fluorides}} of tantalum can be {{used for}} its separation from niobium. Tantalum forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3 of the type , , and , although multi-core complexes and substoichiometric compounds are also known. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> solid with a melting point of 97.0°C and tantalum pentachloride (TaCl5) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> solid with a melting point of 247.4°C. Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic tantalum tetrachloride (TaCl4). While the trihalides can be obtained by reduction of the pentahalides with hydrogen, the dihalides do not exist. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Tin(II) chloride, {{also known}} as stannous chloride, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> {{crystalline}} solid with the formula 2. It forms a stable dihydrate, but aqueous solutions tend to undergo hydrolysis, particularly if hot. SnCl2 is widely used as a reducing agent (in acid solution), and in electrolytic baths for tin-plating.
