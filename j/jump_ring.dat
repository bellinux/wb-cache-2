50|$|For making wire wrapped jewelry, {{the basic}} {{component}} is wire. Using just wire and wire working tools, a craftsperson can construct whatever jewelry component is required, including eye pins, <b>jump</b> <b>rings,</b> ear wires, clasps, bezels and bails.

50|$|A craftsperson {{can also}} choose to {{purchase}} pre-made components {{instead of making}} them himself.

50|$|Wire is {{measured}} by diameter, which is indicated by gauge numbers. The lower the gauge, the thicker the wire. A 12 or 14-gauge wire is fairly heavy, but ideal for making bangles and chokers. 10-gauge wire is very thick and stiff, while 26-gauge wire is very fine, almost as thin as hair. This thin wire is well-suited for coiling embellishments. 16-gauge wire is good for making <b>jump</b> <b>rings</b> and links for necklaces and bracelets, and 18-gauge wire is good to use for adding embellishments and making finer links.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>jumping</b> <b>ring</b> {{experiment}} {{is an outstanding}} demonstration of Faraday's laws of electromagnetic induction and also of Lenz's law. A conducting non-magnetic ring is placed over the extended vertical core of a solenoid. When ac power {{is applied to the}} solenoid, the ring is thrown off or held in a state of levitation. This phenomenon happens because the induced current in the ring flows in the direction to counter that of the solenoid current. Consequently, two magnetic fields repel each other, giving rise to the jump effect. The induced current is corresponding to the jump height of a ring. In this work, the jump heights of brass, copper and aluminium rings subjected to different parameters such as temperature, vertical length of ring and applied solenoid current were investigated...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new model, and the validating experiments, that unveil the rich physics behind {{the flight of}} a {{conductive}} ring in the Thomson experiment, a physics veiled by the fast thrust that impels the ring. We uncover interesting features of the electro-dynamics of the flying ring, e. g. the varying mutual inductance between ring and the thrusting electromagnet, or how to measure the ring proper magnetic field {{in the presence of}} the larger field of the electromagnet. We succeed in separating the position and time dependences of the ring variables as it travels upward in a diverging magnetic field, obtaining a comprehensive view of the ring motion. We introduce a low-cost <b>jumping</b> <b>ring</b> set-up that incorporates simple innovative devices, e. g. a couple of pick-up coils connected in opposition that allows us to scrutinize the ring electro-dynamics, and to confirm the predictions of our theoretical model with good accuracy. This work is within the reach of senior students of science or engineering, and it can be exploited either as a teaching laboratory experiment or as an open-end project work...|$|R
40|$|In this {{extended}} essay, a <b>jumping</b> <b>ring</b> setup {{has been}} established in order to find magnetic force applied on a ring as a function of applied current. A basic setup consists of a solenoid, ferromagnetic rod core and non-ferromagnetic electrically well conductive ring put on the core. In this work, however, a programmable microcontroller unit was included into the system so that time of flight of the ring could be measured. Electrical devices were also included for overcurrent protection. A set of time of flight versus jumping distance of an aluminum ring measurement has been made together with voltage and current measurements on the solenoid. Impedance of the solenoid was found using voltage-current linear curve fit. From inductance-impedance relationship, magnetic energy stored in the solenoid was calculated. Ring speeds were calculated to obtain the acceleration and hence the net force applied on the ring. Net force acting on the ring as a function of current was plotted. Finally, it was surprisingly observed that jump height increases as the mass of ring increases within a certain mass range...|$|R

5000|$|For making <b>jump</b> <b>rings,</b> 10- to 18-gauge wire (2.5 to 1.3 mm) is used. Bracelet and {{necklace}} wire {{components are}} generally {{made out of}} wire that is 16-, 18- or 20-gauge (1.3 to 0.8 mm). Earring wires are usually made out of 18- or 20-gauge wire (1.0 to 0.8 mm). When making wire wrapped jewelry, these components are connected to one another with wire that is generally 20- to 26-gauge (0.8 to 0.4 mm). Frequently the connections between wire components will include a bead on the wire connector in a technique called a wire-wrapped loop. Most glass beads (but not all) are manufactured with a hole that is 1 mm in size. This will accommodate 20-gauge wire, but will probably not accommodate 18-gauge wire. Some glass beads, almost all freshwater pearls and some gemstone beads will have smaller holes and will {{require the use of}} wire thinner than 20-gauge. (The largest wire that can go through the beads is generally chosen. Beads and gemstones are much harder than the wire, and will over time saw into the wire; so thicker wire will last longer.) ...|$|R
