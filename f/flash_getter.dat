50|$|Those {{unfamiliar}} with sealed vacuum devices, such as vacuum tubes/thermionic valves, {{high pressure sodium}} lamps or some types of metal-halide lamps, are often mistaken into thinking the <b>flash</b> <b>getter</b> deposit is caused {{as a result of}} the failure of the device. Note that contemporary high intensity discharge lamps tend to use non-evaporable getters rather than flash getters.|$|E
50|$|Those {{familiar}} with such devices can often make qualitative assessments {{as to the}} hardness or quality of the vacuum within {{by the appearance of}} the <b>flash</b> <b>getter</b> deposit, a shiny deposit indicating a good vacuum. As the getter is used, the deposit often becomes thin and translucent particularly at the edges. It can take on a brownish-red semi translucent appearance and this indicates poor seals or extensive use of the device at elevated temperatures. A white deposit, usually of barium oxide indicates total failure of the seal on the vacuum system. as depicted in the fluorescent display module depicted above.|$|E
40|$|EWR No. VTE- 188 [...] Tubes {{processed}} by <b>flashing</b> <b>getters</b> {{immediately prior to}} seal-off from vacuum systems are compared for total residual gas pressure to tubes {{processed by}} <b>flashing</b> <b>getters</b> after tubes were sealed off vacuum systems. Comparisons of residual pressures determined from current flows in the cold cathode ion gauge...|$|R
50|$|In systems {{which need}} to be opened to air for maintenance, a {{titanium}} sublimation pump provides similar functionality to <b>flashed</b> <b>getters,</b> but can be flashed repeatedly. Alternatively, nonevaporable getters may be used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flashed</b> <b>getters</b> are {{prepared}} by arranging {{a reservoir of}} volatile and reactive material inside the vacuum system. Once the system is evacuated and sealed, the material is heated (usually by radio frequency induction heating). After evaporating, it is deposited as a coating on the interior surfaces of the system. <b>Flashed</b> <b>getters</b> (typically made with barium) are commonly used in vacuum tubes. The getter will usually {{be seen as a}} silvery metallic spot {{on the inside of the}} tube's glass envelope. Large transmission tubes and specialty systems often use more exotic getters, including aluminium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, strontium, caesium and phosphorus.|$|R
50|$|The typical <b>flashed</b> <b>getter</b> used {{in small}} vacuum tubes (seen in 12AX7 tube, top) {{consists}} of a ring shaped structure made from a long strip of nickel, bent up into a long, narrow trough and then folded into the ring shape with the trough opening facing upwards in the specific case depicted above. The trough is filled {{with a mixture of}} barium azide and powdered glass.|$|R
50|$|If the getter {{is exposed}} to {{atmospheric}} air (for example, if the tube breaks or develops a leak), it turns white and becomes useless. For this reason, <b>flashed</b> <b>getters</b> are only used in sealed systems. A functioning phosphorus getter {{looks very much like}} an oxidised metal getter, although it has an iridescent pink or orange appearance which oxidised metal getters lack. Phosphorus was frequently used before metallic getters were developed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flashed</b> <b>getter</b> - The getter {{material}} is held inactive in a reservoir during assembly, then heated and evaporated after initial evacuation, usually by induction heating. The vaporized getter, usually a volatile metal, instantly reacts with any residual gas, then condenses {{on the cool}} walls of the tube in a thin coating, the getter spot or getter mirror, which continues to absorb gas. This {{is the most common}} type, used in low power vacuum tubes.|$|R
