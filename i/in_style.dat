5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the album was mixed, but largely positive. The departure <b>in</b> <b>style</b> from Hello Master was frequently noted {{for better or for}} worse, and comparisons of the group to influential hard rock and heavy metal acts such as Thin Lizzy and Black Sabbath were once again made.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Kraków {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture.

5|$|Much of Fauré's piano {{music is}} {{difficult}} to play, but is rarely virtuosic <b>in</b> <b>style.</b> The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is a classical restraint and understatement.|$|E
5|$|Psychedelic rock is {{a diverse}} style of rock music inspired, influenced, or {{representative}} of psychedelic culture, which is centred around perception-changing hallucinogenic drugs. Psychedelic rock {{is intended to}} replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. Many psychedelic groups differ <b>in</b> <b>style,</b> and the label is often used indiscriminately.|$|E
50|$|The cathedral, {{which had}} been rebuilt <b>in</b> Gothic <b>style</b> <b>in</b> the 14th and 15th centuries, was seriously damaged by a fire in 1622, after which it was rebuilt <b>in</b> Baroque <b>style.</b> After another major fire in 1772, {{rebuilding}} was carried out <b>in</b> Neoclassical <b>style.</b>|$|R

5|$|Taft did {{not enjoy}} the easy {{relationship}} with the press that Roosevelt had, choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as his predecessor had.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is uncertain, but {{is thought to be}} a Gothic or Indo-Aryan term {{assigned}} to a Slavic tribe.

5|$|A {{second wave}} of work {{took place on the}} city walls in the late 15th century. Backed by {{substantial}} communal effort and financial contributions, Newingate was rebuilt between 1450 and 1470, and probably closely resembled the West Gate <b>in</b> <b>style.</b> Burgate was rebuilt in brick from 1475 onwards, again thanks to public contributions, but it was not completed until 1525, furnished with gunports and anachronistic battlements. Queningate was closed up at shortly after the 15th century, probably following {{the construction of a new}} postern gate nearby. West Gate was appointed the city gaol in 1453 by Henry VI, with Canterbury Castle serving as the county gaol.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the window}} is the album title {{and at the top}} of the cover is the band's name in a {{typeface}} more crafty than on previous album covers. Though the general design of the cover is that of a 1930s hotel <b>in</b> <b>style,</b> the typeface juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E

5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close <b>in</b> <b>style</b> to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either <b>in</b> <b>style</b> or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
5|$|Although the Gospel of John is anonymous, Christian {{tradition}} {{historically has}} attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee {{and one of}} Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related <b>in</b> <b>style</b> and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.|$|E

5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not {{to the extent that}} the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman <b>in</b> <b>style</b> and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior <b>in</b> <b>style</b> to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Henry {{was buried}} in Westminster Abbey {{in front of the}} church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor. A few years later, work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current {{location}} in Westminster Abbey. His gilt-brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by William Torell; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly naturalistic <b>in</b> <b>style,</b> but it is probably not a close likeness of Henry himself.|$|E
