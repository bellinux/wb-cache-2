5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a <b>horizontal</b> <b>line</b> was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
5|$|Nucleases are {{enzymes that}} cut DNA strands by catalyzing the {{hydrolysis}} of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from {{the ends of}} DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the <b>horizontal</b> <b>line.</b> In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting {{as part of the}} restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} fuel {{at the core}} of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it evolved into a red giant. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star. That is, it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly <b>horizontal</b> <b>line</b> on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen. When helium was exhausted in the core a helium-burning shell formed in addition to {{the hydrogen}}-burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the asymptotic giant branch, or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.) If the star had sufficient mass, in time carbon fusion could begin in the core, producing oxygen, neon and magnesium.|$|E

40|$|A ladder lottery, {{known as}} the “Amidakuji” in Japan, is a network with n {{vertical}} <b>lines</b> and many <b>horizontal</b> <b>lines</b> each of which connects two consecutive vertical lines. Each ladder lottery corresponds to a permutation. Ladder lotteries are frequently used as natural models in many areas. Given a permutation π, an algorithm to enumerate all ladder lotteries of π with the minimum number of <b>horizontal</b> <b>lines</b> is known. In this paper, given a permutation π and an integer k, we design an algorithm to enumerate all ladder lotteries of π with exactly k <b>horizontal</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R
