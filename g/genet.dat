5|$|Washington {{was deeply}} irritated by this subversive meddling, and when <b>Genêt</b> allowed a French-sponsored warship to sail out of Philadelphia against direct presidential orders, Washington demanded that France recall <b>Genêt.</b> However, {{by this time}} the {{revolution}} had taken a more violent approach and <b>Genêt</b> would have been executed had he returned to France. He appealed to Washington, and Washington allowed him to remain, making him the first political refugee to seek sanctuary in the United States.|$|E
5|$|While Kentuckians despised the British and Spanish, {{they had}} a strong {{affinity}} for the French. They admired the republican government that had arisen from the French Revolution, and they had not forgotten France's aid during the Revolutionary War. When French Ambassador Edmond-Charles <b>Genêt,</b> popularly known as Citizen <b>Genêt,</b> arrived in the United States in April 1793, George Rogers Clark was already considering an expedition to capture Spanish lands in the west. Genêt's agent, André Michaux, was dispatched to Kentucky to assess the support of Kentuckians toward Clark's expedition. When he gained an audience with Governor Shelby, he did so with letters of introduction from Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Kentucky Senator John Brown.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>Genêt</b> episode, Washington, after {{consulting}} his Cabinet, issued a Proclamation of Neutrality on April 22, 1793. In it he declared the United States neutral {{in the conflict}} between Great Britain and France. He also threatened legal proceedings against any American providing assistance {{to any of the}} warring countries. Washington eventually recognized that supporting either Great Britain or France was a false dichotomy. He would do neither, thereby shielding the fledgling U.S. from, in his view, unnecessary harm.|$|E
5|$|During the {{campaign}} Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized {{his response to}} Jefferson's second letter regarding the <b>Genêt</b> affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's attention {{to the situation in}} the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Isaac Shelby {{relocated}} to Kentucky, on lands awarded {{to him for}} his military service, and became involved in Kentucky's transition from a county of Virginia, to a separate state. His heroism made him popular with the state's citizens and the Kentucky electoral college unanimously elected him governor in 1792. He secured Kentucky, from Indian attacks and organized its first government. He used the Citizen <b>Genet</b> affair to convince the Washington administration to make {{an agreement with the}} Spanish for free trade on the Mississippi River.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the representation of}} macho masculinity found in Jean <b>Genet's</b> novels through the framework of theories of gender performativity. While <b>Genet's</b> novels have been condemned by contemporary gay critics for representing homosexuality as an abject or failed masculinity, {{it is argued that}} emphasis on this aspect of his work has tended to overshadow the importance of the virile, phallic man to his work. <b>Genet's</b> homoeroticisation of machismo provides a focus for analysis of his representation of masculinity as a whole, and especially of the relationship between heterosexual and homosexual men found in his novels. Rather than reading <b>Genet's</b> representation of macho as a specifically "gay" macho that confirms the heterocentric privileging of heterosexual masculinity, this paper argues that, in <b>Genet's</b> novels, all macho is represented as inherently performative in a way that questions the logic of heterocentric privilege...|$|R

5|$|In 1789 Marshall {{was elected}} again to a {{convention}} to consider separation from Virginia. After Kentucky's separation from Virginia in 1792, {{he was elected}} to represent Woodford County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. The most notable piece of legislation he authored was an act that simplified the classification and taxation of land. He was reelected to his position in 1794. He opposed allocating men or supplies for George Rogers Clark's proposed attack upon the Spanish at New Orleans. The attack was promoted by Edmond-Charles <b>Genêt,</b> and Marshall accused sitting governor Isaac Shelby of complicity in the matter.|$|E
5|$|In March 1794, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers {{in the event of}} an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled <b>Genêt.</b> Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean <b>Genet.</b> Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E

5|$|In February 1793 {{the newly}} formed French Republic {{declared}} war on Great Britain, extending the French Revolutionary Wars that had begun the year before on the continent. The French Navy {{was in a state}} of upheaval due to the social consequences of the French Revolution, and as a result found itself at a disadvantage to the Royal Navy, which had been preparing for war since June 1792. In response, the French sent several frigate squadrons to sea, including their newest ships and best sailors and officers in an attempt to disrupt British commerce in the early stages of the war. One such squadron was sent in April 1793 to the United States, carrying the French ambassador to the United States, Edmond-Charles <b>Genêt.</b> After the ambassador disembarked, the squadron, under the command of Captain Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart, dispersed to raid British shipping along the coast, capturing or destroying more than 60 merchant vessels before retiring to American ports for repairs.|$|E
5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with <b>Genêt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a <b>Genet</b> and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E

40|$|Clonality is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in plants, allowing <b>genets</b> to persist asexually for much {{longer periods of time}} than ramets. The relative frequency of sexual vs. asexual reproduction determines long-term dominance and persistence of clonal plants at the landscape scale. One of the most familiar and valued clonal plants in North America is aspen (Populus tremuloides). Previous researchers have suggested that aspen in xeric landscapes of the intermountain west represent <b>genets</b> of great chronological age, maintained via clonal expansion in the near absence of sexual reproduction. We synthesized microsatellite data from 1371 ramets in two large sampling grids in Utah. We found a surprisingly large number of distinct <b>genets,</b> some covering large spatial areas, but most represented by only one to a few individual ramets at a sampling scale of 50 m. In general, multi-ramet <b>genets</b> were spatially cohesive, although some <b>genets</b> appear to be fragmented remnants of much larger clones. We conclude that recent sexual reproduction in these landscapes is a stronger contributor to standing genetic variation at the population level than the accumulation of somatic mutations, and that even some of the spatially large clones may not be as ancient as previously supposed. Further, a striking majority of the largest <b>genets</b> in both study areas had three alleles at one or more loci, suggesting triploidy or aneuploidy. These <b>genets</b> tended to be spatially clustered but not closely related. Together, these findings substantially advance our understanding of clonal dynamics in western North American aspen, and {{set the stage for a}} broad range of future studies...|$|R

40|$|Clonal {{structure}} and reproductive biology in the gynodioecious herb Glechoma hederacea L. Lamiaceae The frequencies of females, hermaphrodites and partially male-sterile (PMS) <b>genets</b> of Glechoma hederacea were estimated in natural populations in S Sweden. The frequency of females and PMS <b>genets</b> in natural populations varied from 0 to 100 %. The {{temporal and spatial}} variation in stamen fertility in PMS <b>genets</b> was studied {{in the field and}} in cultivation. Hermaphrodite flowers were self-compatible, seed production was found to be pollen limited and the clonal structure of the species usually caused a reduction in seed set in females. Hermaphrodite and PMS clones were usually larger than female clones and more heterozygous. Disomic inheritance of duplicated loci was found in this tetraploid species, and segregation ratios for allozymes conformed to Mendelian expectation. Allozymes were used to establish multilocus genotypes in seven populations in S Sweden and three populations in the S Czech Republic. Clonal diversity in an area of c. 100 m 2 was greatest in an ephemeral population (PD i. e. proportion of distinguished <b>genets</b> = 0. 98) and lowest in more stable habitats (PD = 0. 01). Little evidence of intermingling of different <b>genets</b> was found...|$|R
