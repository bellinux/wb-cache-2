5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
25|$|The {{average time}} to death once a lethal {{injection}} protocol has been started is about 7 to 11 minutes. Since {{it only takes}} about 30 seconds for the thiopental to induce anesthesia, 30–45 seconds for the pancuronium to cause paralysis, and about 30 seconds for the potassium to stop the heart, death can theoretically be attained {{in as little as}} 90 seconds. Given that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> administer the drug, time for the line to flush itself, time for the change of the drug being administered, and time to ensure that death has occurred, the whole procedure takes about 7–11 minutes. Procedural aspects in pronouncing death also contribute to delay, so the condemned is usually pronounced dead within 10 to 20 minutes of starting the drugs. Supporters of the death penalty say that a huge dose of thiopental, which is between 14 and 20 times the anesthetic induction dose and which has the potential to induce a medical coma lasting 60 hours, could never wear off in only 10 to 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|All viperids have {{a pair of}} {{relatively}} long solenoglyphous (hollow) fangs {{that are used to}} inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws, just behind the eyes. Each of the two fangs is {{at the front of the}} mouth on a short maxillary bone that can rotate back and forth. When not in use, the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath. The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently. During a strike, the mouth can open nearly 180° and the maxilla rotates forward, erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged, as they are brittle. The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract, injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target. This action is very fast; in defensive strikes, it will be more a stab than a bite. Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey. Secondarily, it is used for self-defence, though in cases with nonprey, such as humans, they may give a dry bite (not inject any venom). A dry bite allows the snake to conserve their precious reserve of venom, because once it has been depleted, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> replenish, leaving the snake vulnerable.|$|E

500|$|Lynch {{described}} {{the attractiveness of}} the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: [...] "I'm a sucker for a continuing story... Theoretically, you can get a very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita's identity, Betty's career and Adam Kesher's film project.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the Naga Epic, with many believing the price was too high. Rich Brown of CNet said the mouse does not warrant the high price tag and awarded it an overall rating of 7.3/10. The reviewers at PC Magazine thought the Epic was expensive, but commended the mouse's attractiveness and wireless feature. Mathew McCurley of Engadget commended the long-lasting battery and the wireless capability of the mouse and stated that [...] "if you're interested in trying something new, give it a shot." [...] He said that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{get used to the}} design and feel.|$|E
500|$|Sara Stewart of the New York Post {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "Sure, it's not as novel as the first time we were here, but {{directors}} Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud stay true to the clever, slapstick vibe." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Despicable Me 2 feels like an opportunity to get together with some old friends, hang out, and discover what they've been up to." [...] Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The scope of the 'toon espionage-adventure goings-on is surprisingly limited. But the filmmakers so clearly love working on these characters, their creative joy is infectious." [...] Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "The animation is beguiling, particularly when Lucy drives her car into the ocean, transforming it into a submarine that scoots around sharks and fish." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "While not quite as charming or unique as the original, Despicable Me 2 comes awfully close, extending co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin's delightfully silly sensibility to a bit larger universe." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "It's a credit that the writing can be so funny in the moment, that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> realize there's no cohesive story, zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either the characters in the film or the people watching in the theater." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{important}} for elementary school children to spend a long time learning to express algebraic properties without symbols before learning algebraic notation. When learning symbols, many students believe letters always represent unknowns and struggle {{with the concept of}} variable. They prefer arithmetic reasoning to algebraic equations for solving word problems. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> move from arithmetic to algebraic generalizations to describe patterns. Students often have trouble with the minus sign and understand the equals sign to mean [...] "the answer is...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buckley and Wester, {{along with}} Patrick J. Doody and Chris Valenziano, penned the series. They found the format—ten three-minute segments—difficult to manage because each webisode {{has to work}} both {{individually}} {{and as part of}} the overall storyline. However, Wester noted, [...] "We couldn't get too indulgent, we couldn't delve into long conversations. That helps not only with the storytelling but with the comedy... With drama, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> establish an emotional connection with the characters. With comedy, you can jump right in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dom Lawson of The Guardian {{praised the}} band's new direction, saying, [...] "The Swedes' 10th album, Heritage, is a brave, melancholic and often {{beautiful}} heavy rock record that revels in the warm, analogue tones and shimmering mellotrons of the pre-punk 70s while still exuding {{a sense of}} wonder at new ideas". Some critics have {{gone so far as}} to call it one of the band's best. In a positive review for PopMatters, Brice Ezell warned that the album takes some warming up to, commenting, [...] "Heritage isn't the type of record to blow away one's mind upon first listen; <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> grow in its complexities". The album has won numerous awards from music publications and has been nominated for the Album of the Year Award by Prog, presented by Classic Rock.|$|E
50|$|The film sparked {{controversy}} and was halted by the Soviet film authorities by cutting state subsidy for the film's budget during the production process, so <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> find money and complete the film.

2500|$|Orwell, in {{the hills}} around Zaragoza, {{describes}} the [...] "mingled boredom and discomfort of stationary warfare," [...] the mundaneness of {{a situation in which}} [...] "each army had dug itself in and settled down on the hill-tops it had won." [...] He praises the Spanish militias for their relative social equality, for their holding of the front while the army was trained in the rear, and for the [...] "democratic 'revolutionary' type of discipline ... more reliable than might be expected." [...] "'Revolutionary' discipline depends on political consciousness—on an understanding of why orders must be obeyed; <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> diffuse this, but it also takes time to drill a man into an automaton on the barrack-square." [...] Throughout the chapter Orwell describes the various shortages and problems at the front—firewood ("We were between two and three thousand feet above sea-level, it was mid winter and the cold was unspeakable"), food, candles, tobacco, and adequate munitions—as well as the danger of accidents inherent in a badly trained and poorly armed group of soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|Economy, {{increased}} accuracy, performance, commercial ammunition shortages, and hobby {{interests are}} all common motivations for handloading both cartridges and shotshells. Reloading fired cartridge cases {{can save the}} shooter money, or provides the shooter with more, and higher quality, ammunition within a given budget. Reloading may not be cost effective for occasional shooters, as <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recoup {{the cost of the}} required equipment, but those who shoot on a regular basis will see benefit as the brass cartridge case or shotgun shell hull (the most expensive components) can be reused many times (with proper maintenance). Besides economy, the ability to customize the performance of ammunition is a common goal. [...] Hunters may desire cartridges with specialized bullets or specific performance as regards bullet and velocity. Target shooters seek the best achievable accuracy, as well as the best shot-to-shot consistency, or precision. Shotgunning enthusiasts can make specialty rounds not available in commercial inventories at any price. [...] Many handloaders also customize their cartridges and shells to their specific firearms, usually in pursuit of accuracy: they can assemble precision ammunition using cartridge cases that have been fire formed in the chamber of a specific firearm.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1970, {{shortly after}} the birth of their only child Tamala Georgette, Jones was straitjacketed and {{committed}} to a padded cell at the Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida, after a drunken bender; he was kept there to detoxify for 10 days before being released with a prescription for Librium. Jones managed longer stretches of sobriety with Wynette than he had enjoyed in years but as the decade wore on his drinking and erratic behavior worsened, leading to the couple's divorce in 1976. Jones accepted the responsibility for the failure of the marriage but vehemently denied Wynette's allegations in her autobiography that he beat her and fired a shotgun at her. Remarkably, Jones and Wynette continued playing shows and drawing crowds in the years after their divorce, as fans began to see their songs mirroring their stormy relationship. [...] In 1980, they recorded the album Together Again and scored a hit with [...] "Two Story House". Jones also spoke publicly about his hopes for a reconciliation and would jokingly reference Tammy in some of his songs - during performances of his 1981 hit [...] "If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will)" [...] he would sing [...] "Tammy's memory will" [...] - but the recrimination continued unabated. [...] After years of sniping, Jones and Wynette appeared to make peace in the 1990s, recording a final album, One, and even touring together again before Wynette's death in 1998. [...] In 1995 Jones told Country Weekly, [...] "Like the old saying goes, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> heal things and they've been healed quite a while." ...|$|E
