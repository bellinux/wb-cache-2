25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E

And it really turns me off when people from one religion say theirs is the only way. And I believe all religions are just different ways to spirituality. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> that universality, well, then I'm all for it." [...] Despite Scott's pluralist perspective, The Waterboys have been labelled as [...] "Christian rock" [...] by some reviewers and heathens by some Christians [...]|$|E
2500|$|Jamaican male sexual {{identity}} {{has long been}} defined in opposition to homosexuality. According to Dr. Kingsley Ragashanti Stewart, a {{professor of anthropology at}} the University of the West Indies, [...] "A lot of Jamaican men, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> them a homosexual, ... will immediately get violent. It's the worst insult you could give to a Jamaican man." [...] Dr. Stewart believes that homophobia influences almost every aspect of life and shapes the everyday language of ghetto youth. [...] "It's like if you say, 'Come back here,' they will say, 'No, no, no don't say 'come back'.' You have to say 'come forward,' because come back is implying that you're 'coming in the back,' which is how gay men have sex." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Hynden Walch. In the episode [...] "Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy", {{she is the}} only {{cheerleader}} at X-Men academy. After she becomes a victim of Ringmaster, she still shows her peppy side in her cheers (Call me Phoenix, call me Jean. Red-haired, mutant, prom night queen. I'll rap you with a mental hurl, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> me Marvel Girl! Go Mutants!), after she's done her cheer she uses the Phoenix Force and creates a heavy windstorm in the hallway to open the lockers and find a fractal while under Ringmaster's control. Oddly while the comic book cover intro for the episode shows Jean wearing a childlike version of her classic Phoenix costume, she wears a cheerleader uniform with a X-logo in the actual episode. She also makes an appearance in the episode [...] "Ice Man Cometh" [...] where she is telekinetically keeping the water from the melted ice caps from hitting the school.|$|E
2500|$|A {{critical}} backlash began {{over the}} repetitive {{nature of his}} lyrics, his clean-cut image, and his perceived over-reliance on sampling others' entire hooks for {{the basis of his}} singles—criticisms also directed to his contemporary, Vanilla Ice. He was mocked in music videos by 3rd Bass (including a rap battle with MC Serch), The D.O.C., DJ Debranz, and Ice Cube. Oakland hip-hop group Digital Underground criticized him in the CD insert of their Sex Packets album by placing Hammer's picture in it and referring to him as an unknown derelict. Q Tip criticized him in [...] "Check the Rhyme," [...] asking, [...] "What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> it that then stop." [...] LL Cool J dissed him in [...] "To tha Break of Dawn" [...] (from the Mama Said Knock You Out album), calling Hammer an [...] "amateur, swinging a Hammer from a bodybag ," [...] and saying, [...] "My old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap.", though this could have been seen as a response to Hammer calling him out in [...] "Let's Get it Started", when he was mentioned along with Run DMC and Doug E Fresh as rappers that Hammer claimed to be better than. (LL Cool J would later compliment and commend Hammer's abilities/talents on VH-1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop, which aired in 2008). However, Ice-T came to his defense on his 1991 album O.G. Original Gangster: [...] "A special shout out to my man M.C. Hammer: a lot of people dis you, man, but they just jealous." [...] Ice-T later explained that he had nothing against people who were pop-rap from the start, as Hammer had been, but only against emcees who switch from being hardcore or dirty to being pop-rap so that they can sell more records.|$|E
