40|$|Abstract:- While simple pulse <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ultrasound</b> {{transducer}} is conventionally used in ultrasound imaging, the coded <b>excitation</b> scheme <b>of</b> the transducer {{was proposed}} recently {{to improve the}} image quality and penetration depth. In this article, a novel combined “pulse excitation- coded excitation ” approach is presented. The most distinctive feature of the proposed approach, {{in comparison to the}} previously reported coded excitation methods, {{is the fact that the}} excitation codes in our approach are adaptively generated for each scan line using the information obtained by a simple pulse excitation prior to the coded <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> the transducer. Therefore, the interaction between the tissue and the ultrasound beam travelling through it is the main source of information, which is used to generate the codes in the new scheme. A systematic method for generating the ultrasound signals due to the coded <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> the transducer is explained in this paper.

Embrittlement is {{on the basis of}} vacancies and Cu-rich precipitates which in the size range of 1 - 3 mm contribute with the coherent residual stresses of the 3 rd kind to an increase in hardness and strength (yield strength and tensile strength) as well as with a reduction of the upper shelf value of Charpy energy and a shift in the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature to higher temperatures.

40|$|AbstractThis work aims at {{applying}} the laser-ultrasonic method for nondestructive {{evaluation of the}} depth of the subsurface damage in machined silicon wafers. It is based on different mechanisms of laser <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> by absorption of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser pulses at the fundamental wavelength: the concentration–deformation mechanism in the single-crystalline silicon and the thermoelastic one in the damaged layer. Due to the uniform heating of the whole damaged layer during the laser pulse action the amplitude of the compression phase of the laser-induced ultrasonic signal is proportional to the damaged depth. The rarefaction phase of this signal arises by absorption of the rest of laser energy in the single-crystalline silicon beneath the damaged layer. The empirical relation between {{the depth of the}} subsurface damage and the ratio of the amplitudes of compression and rarefaction phases of the laser-induced ultrasonic signal can be fitted by a linear function within the depth variation and the corresponding spread of the signal amplitudes. This relation can be used for in situ quantitative nondestructive evaluation of the depth of the subsurface damage in machined silicon wafers; the minimal reliably detectable depth is estimated at the level of 0. 15 – 0. 2 μm...|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} is presented for calculating thermoelastic generation <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> {{in a metal}} plate exposed to nanosecond pulsed laser heating, sufficient to cause melting but not ablation. Detailed consideration {{is given to the}} spatial and temporal profiles of the laser pulse, penetration of the laser beam into the sample, the appearance and subsequent growth and then contraction of the melt pool, and the time dependent thermal conduction in the melt and surrounding solid throughout. The <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ultrasound</b> takes place during and shortly after the laser pulse and occurs predominantly within the thermal diffusion length of a micron or so beneath the surface. It is shown how, because of this, the output of the thermal simulations can be expressed as axially symmetric transient radial and normal surface force distributions. The epicentral displacement response to these force distributions is obtained by two methods, the one based on the elastodynamic Green’s functions for plate geometry determined by the Cagniard generalized ray method and the other using a finite element numerical method.

40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the assessment of}} variation in elastic property of soft biological tissues non-invasively using laser speckle contrast measurement. The experimental {{as well as the}} numerical (Monte-Carlo simulation) studies are carried out. In this an intense acoustic burst of ultrasound (an acoustic pulse with high power within standard safety limits), instead of continuous wave, is employed to induce large modulation of the tissue materials in the ultrasound insonified region of interest (ROI) and it results to enhance the strength of the ultrasound modulated optical signal in ultrasound modulated optical tomography (UMOT) system. The intensity fluctuation of speckle patterns formed by interference of light scattered (while traversing through tissue medium) is characterized by the motion of scattering sites. The displacement of scattering particles is inversely related to the elastic property of the tissue. We study the feasibility of laser speckle contrast analysis (LSCA) technique to reconstruct a map of the elastic property of a soft tissue-mimicking phantom. We employ source synchronized parallel speckle detection scheme to (experimentally) measure the speckle contrast from the light traversing through ultrasound (US) insonified tissue-mimicking phantom.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of ultrasonic waves {{has been studied}} in single crystals of undoped and doped bismuth germanium oxide (Bi 12 GeO 20) and undoped bismuth silicon oxide(Bi 12 SiO 20). These crystals are piezoelectric (Cubic Space Group I 23) and direct <b>excitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> was used wherever possible. Attenuation measurements were made from 10 to 190 MHz over the temperature range 4. 2 to 260 K. A large attenuation peak was observed in the undoped crystals between 35 and 50 K for only those ultrasonic modes whose velocity depends on the elastic modulus C 44 This peak is {{shown to be a}} single anelastic relaxation peak and is interpreted as due to point defects. Using the selection rules for anelastic relaxation in cubic crystals, it is deduced that these defects must have trigonal symmetry. The magnitude of the attenuation peak in doped BGO samples is strongly dependent on the presence of dopants. Doping with Al, Ga, Pb, P + Ga, Ga+Cr, all removed the attenuation peak, while Cr increased it and Zn reduced it. A strong correlation was observed between the attenuation peak, the colour of the crystals and the optical absorption just below the band gap measured in these samples by other workers. These results indicate that the same defect centre is responsible for both the optical and the ultrasonic absorption. Possible defects are discussed taking the optical absorption, X-ray diffraction, EPR and other available measurements into consideration. The ultrasonic attenuation was measured before and after annealing at 450 °C in vacuo or in pure oxygen. No change was observed for an undoped sample. However, for the Cr doped sample the attenuation was reduced by vacuum annealing and restored by oxygen annealing. This seems to be closely related to previous observations of photo-chromic behaviour in BSO doped with Cr. Measurements were also made to study the effects of gamma irradiation on the attenuation in undoped BSO. <p...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} {{for determining the}} Rayleigh wave dispersion of surface treated materials.

The High precision Ultrasound Goniometer (HUGO) allows to vary both: the sound beam angles and the distance between the excitation and detection sound beams. Thus, the Rayleigh wave velocity and its dispersion can be determined by two independent methods: by the drop in the reflexion coefficient at the Rayleigh angle and by change in travel time for a given change in travel distance.
