500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I did not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why the elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, I {{see that they are}} like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this is what happens to me".|$|E
500|$|Sociological social {{psychology}} focuses on micro-scale social actions. This area may {{be described as}} adhering to [...] "sociological miniaturism", examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behaviour of small groups. Of special concern to psychological sociologists is <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> a variety of demographic, social, and cultural facts {{in terms of human}} social interaction. Some of the major topics in this field are social inequality, group dynamics, prejudice, aggression, social perception, group behaviour, social change, non-verbal behaviour, socialization, conformity, leadership, and social identity. Social psychology may be taught with psychological emphasis. In sociology, researchers in this field are the most prominent users of the experimental method (however, unlike their psychological counterparts, they also frequently employ other methodologies). Social psychology looks at social influences, as well as social perception and social interaction.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} theodicy was {{expanded}} mainly {{with the thought}} of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion. There is this ethical part of religion, including [...] "(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy. These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves {{to be able to be}} in a correct relationship with supernatural powers, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> evil – or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people". There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class. [...] "Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved." [...] Weber also writes that [...] "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God... theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next." [...] Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.|$|E
500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided that we needed to get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

2500|$|The Performance artist, sculptor, and theorist Joseph Beuys {{was perhaps}} the most {{influential}} German artist of the late 20th century. His main contribution to theory was the expansion of the Gesamtkunstwerk to include the whole of society, as expressed by his famous expression [...] "Everyone is an artist". This expanded concept of art, known as social sculpture, defines everything that contributes creatively to society as artistic in nature. The form this took in his oeuvre [...] varied from richly metaphoric, almost shamanistic performances based on his personal mythology (<b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Explain</b> Pictures to a Dead Hare, I Like America and America Likes Me) to more direct and utilitarian expressions, such as 7000 Oaks and his activities in the Green party.|$|E

2500|$|Beuys's {{first solo}} {{exhibition}} {{in a private}} gallery opened on 26 November 1965 {{with one of the}} artist's most famous and compelling performances: <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Explain</b> Pictures to a Dead Hare. The artist could be viewed through the glass of the gallery's window. His face was covered in honey and gold leaf, an iron slab was attached to his boot. In his arms he cradled a dead hare, into whose ear he mumbled muffled noises as well as explanations of the drawings that lined the walls. Such materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey is the product of bees, and for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), bees represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemical enquiry, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for a masculine principle of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys is sitting with the hare, has been described [...] "by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century," [...] though Beuys disagreed with the description.|$|E
2500|$|Predicting {{critical}} reception to the {{new direction}} of the album, Cronise proposed that [...] "It will absolutely alienate some fans.

So I'm sure we alienated people with our second album." [...] Despite this, he assured that {{the sound of the}} music would not change as much, explaining that [...] "There'll definitely still be heavy stuff on the record, and fast, thrashy, and slow and sludgy stuff like we've done before. Heavy metal, basically. But a lot of the songs are just what I'd call hard rock songs. The attitude and the vibe is different. It's not as aggressive, sonically. It's a little bit more ... I don't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> it. It's just rock. It's a rock album.

2500|$|From the {{scattered}} references in the Talmud {{it is impossible}} to determine exactly Mar Samuel's proficiency in astronomy; but he knew how to solve many mathematics problems and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> many phenomena. He says himself: [...] "Although I am as familiar with the courses of the stars as with the streets of Nehardea, I can not explain the nature or the movements of the comets" [...] (Ber. 58b). Samuel devoted himself especially to that branch of applied astronomy that deals with calendric science, which he taught to his colleagues and pupils. His astronomical studies of the revolutions of the moon enabled him to predict the beginning of the month ("Rosh Chodesh") as it was determined in Palestine, and he claimed to be able to remove the necessity of celebrating double holy days in the Diaspora (R. H. 20b; comp. Rashi ad loc.). He also computed a Hebrew calendar for sixty years, which he subsequently sent to R. Johanan, the head of the Palestinian teachers, as a proof of his knowledge (Ḥul. 95b). He was called [...] "Yarḥina'ah" [...] or [...] "Yarhinai" [...] ("yeraḥ" [...] = [...] "month") because of this familiarity with calendric science and this ability to determine independently the beginning of the month (B. M. 85b). According to Krochmal ("He-Ḥaluẓ," [...] i. 76), [...] "Shoḳed," [...] another name given to Samuel, means [...] "astronomer" [...] (Yer. Ket. iv. 28b); but Hoffmann's view that [...] "Shoḳed" [...] (for which Babli has [...] "Shaḳud"; Ket. 43b) means [...] "the watchful, diligent one," [...] is more likely correct. This name {{is said to have been}} given to Samuel because, despite his medical and astronomic studies, he devoted himself to the study of the Law.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{planned to be}} developed simultaneously with the previous Zero Escape game, Virtue's Last Reward, with the two games being [...] "paired as a set", and with Virtue's Last Reward having a cliffhanger ending. With Zero Time Dilemma, Uchikoshi intended to resolve all mysteries left from the previous game, {{as well as all}} introduced in the third, while also attempting to make the story enjoyable for first-time players. This was used as a [...] "basic framework" [...] to write the story within. In addition to figuring out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the mysteries while avoiding contradictions with Virtue's Last Reward, they added side stories to the narrative to give it [...] "a little extra punch". They also took the time-travel ability some characters in Virtue's Last Reward have into consideration, as it opened up for more narrative possibilities. Uchikoshi worked with two other writers; the three helped each other come up with ideas and figure out the best ways to make the story work. When coming up with the story, he knew from the start that he wanted Sigma, Phi and Diana to be on one team, and Akane on another; this left open slots in the teams, which were filled with other characters as story development progressed. The script took one year to write. While Uchikoshi had already had an idea for the setting and events of Zero Time Dilemma when writing Virtue's Last Reward, the game structure changed when the time came to implement it. One reason was that characters [...] "take on {{a life of their own}} and make their own decisions" [...] when he writes from their point of view, and that characters might pull the story in a different direction than he had originally planned; most of the time, he would let the story go where the characters want to go rather than forcing it to follow his original plans, leading to changes in story and structure. The budget partly dictated the game's setting in an enclosed space as it required few art assets to develop.|$|E
