40|$|Person-environment (PE) <b>fit</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the most pervasive concepts in psychology. This study presents an integrative investigation of three levels of PE fit: person-vocation (PV) <b>fit,</b> person-organization (PO) <b>fit,</b> and person-job (PJ) <b>fit,</b> using multiple conceptualizations (e. g., value congruence, needs-supplies <b>fit)</b> of each <b>fit</b> level. While a trend in the PE <b>fit</b> literature has been the inclusion of only one <b>fit</b> level with a single conceptualization, researchers call for the addition of multiple conceptualizations of multiple <b>fit</b> levels in a single study. Traditionally, PO <b>fit</b> has been conceptualized as value congruence, whereas PV <b>fit</b> has remained untouched in the literature investigating the direct measurement of <b>fit</b> perceptions. Therefore, new <b>fit</b> perceptions scales assessing PO <b>fit</b> using a needs-supplies <b>fit</b> conceptualization and PV <b>fit</b> using a variety of conceptualizations were introduced. To address the limitation of employing direct measures, common method variance was modeled with a positive affect factor. The study accomplished two objectives. First, a previously supported three-factor model of <b>fit</b> perceptions consisting of PO value congruence (PO-VC), PJ needs-supplies (PJ-NS), and PJ demands-abilities (PJ-DA) <b>fit</b> was strongly replicated. Second, this model was expanded by examining additional conceptualizations (needs-supplies, demands-abilities <b>fit,</b> value, personality, and interest congruence) of <b>fit</b> levels (PV, PO, and PJ <b>fit).</b> Results suggested that professionals make distinctions based on both the <b>fit</b> level and <b>fit</b> conceptualization and these <b>fit</b> perceptions uniquely influence their attitudes and behaviors. A six-factor model (PO-VC, PJ-NS, PJ-DA, PO needs-supplies <b>fit</b> [PO-NS], PV demands-abilities <b>fit</b> [PV-DA], and general PV <b>fit)</b> best <b>fit</b> the data. Providing ample evidence of construct validity, PO <b>fit</b> perceptions (PO-VC and PO-NS <b>fit)</b> were related to the organization-focused outcome of organizational identification, whereas the profession-focused outcome of occupational commitment was exclusively predicted by PV <b>fit</b> perceptions (PV-DA and general PV <b>fit).</b> As expected, both needs-supplies <b>fit</b> perceptions (PO-NS and PJ-NS <b>fit)</b> predicted intentions to quit and job satisfaction. Recommendations for future research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis was to {{illuminate}} the concept of <b>fit</b> in cause-related marketing (CRM) by proposing and testing a valenced model for CRM <b>fit.</b> The model was created based on an integration of extant CRM <b>fit</b> literature and theoretical frameworks. It distinguishes three general <b>fit</b> types (positive, neutral, negative) along the two dimensions of commonality and valence. Within the general <b>fit</b> categories, a further classification into nine sub-types of <b>fit</b> was suggested. In two studies it was shown that negative <b>fit,</b> compared to positive and neutral <b>fit,</b> constituted a <b>fit</b> type that was most difficult to interpret and classify {{in that it was}} seen as negative, positive, and also neutral <b>fit.</b> Commonality and valence ratings, together with <b>fit</b> categorizations, suggested a re-ordering of some <b>fit</b> categories, particularly natural theme, prevention, created theme, and general interest <b>fit.</b> In terms of CRM attitudes and purchase intentions, positive <b>fit</b> types were rated most favorable. The negative prevention <b>fit</b> sub-type evoked responses comparable to positive <b>fit</b> sub-types. Generally, negative <b>fit</b> types were regarded as most unfavorable relative to positive <b>fit</b> and neutral <b>fit...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} recession, {{organizations}} continue {{to search for}} the 2 ̆ 2 right 2 ̆ 2 employees. Such circumstances highlight the importance of further understanding how individuals make employment decisions and assess <b>fit.</b> By surveying 140 applicants who had recently finished the interview process at a large Midwestern hospital, the current study assessed the multidimensionality and predictive power of person-environment <b>fit</b> (person-vocation <b>fit,</b> person-job <b>fit,</b> person-person <b>fit,</b> and person-organization <b>fit).</b> Results suggested that person-environment <b>fit</b> is multi-faceted; <b>fit</b> dimensions simultaneously work together during the pre-hire phase. Specifically, person-person <b>fit,</b> person-organization <b>fit,</b> and person-vocation <b>fit</b> were significant predictors of organizational attraction. Person-person <b>fit</b> and person-job <b>fit</b> significantly predicted intentions to accept an employment offer. In addition, organizational attraction was identified as a partial mediator between overall person-environment <b>fit</b> and job offer acceptance intentions. Such findings contribute to the organization <b>fit</b> literature and provide practitioners with key insights on how applicants assess <b>fit</b> during the pre-employment stage...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{successful}} use of superheating on other Drummond classes, Robert Urie experimentally <b>fitted</b> a superheated boiler to No.126 in December 1920, {{together with an}} extended smokebox and larger cylinders. The additional weight of the new boiler raised the centre of gravity of the locomotive, thereby adding to problems of instability on faster main line trains, whilst simultaneously preventing its use on many branch lines. As a result, no further examples were <b>fitted,</b> and No.126 was eventually broken up for spare parts in 1937. In 1931 No. 672 was experimentally <b>fitted</b> with the Strowger-Hudd Automatic Warning System, but the equipment was not adopted by the Southern Railway and the equipment later removed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the cost-effectiveness between double and single Fecal Immunochemical Test(s) (<b>FIT)</b> in a mass CRC screening. A two-stage sequential screening was conducted. <b>FIT</b> {{was used as a}} primary screening test and recommended twice by an interval of one week at the first screening stage. We defined the first-time <b>FIT</b> as <b>FIT</b> 1 and the second-time <b>FIT</b> as <b>FIT</b> 2. If either <b>FIT</b> 1 or <b>FIT</b> 2 was positive (+), then a colonoscopy was recommended at the second stage. Costs were recorded and analyzed. A total of 24, 419 participants completed either <b>FIT</b> 1 or <b>FIT</b> 2. The detection rate of advanced neoplasm was 19. 2 % among both <b>FIT</b> 1 + and <b>FIT</b> 2 +, especially high among men with age ≥ 55 (27. 4 %). About 15. 4 % CRC, 18. 9 % advanced neoplasm, and 29. 9 % adenoma missed by <b>FIT</b> 1 were detected by <b>FIT</b> 2 alone. Average cost was $ 2, 935 for double <b>FITs</b> and $ 2, 121 for <b>FIT</b> 1 to detect each CRC and $ 901 for double <b>FITs</b> and $ 680 for <b>FIT</b> 1 to detect each advanced neoplasm. Double <b>FITs</b> are overall more cost-effective, having significantly higher positive and detection rates with an acceptable higher cost, than single <b>FIT.</b> Double <b>FITs</b> should be encouraged for the first screening in a mass CRC screening, especially in economically and medically underserved populations/areas/countries...|$|R

40|$|Academics and {{practitioners}} alike {{have studied the}} concept of person-environment <b>fit</b> (P-E <b>fit)</b> {{during the last two}} decades. How well a person <b>fits</b> the work environment may be an effective indicator of attitudes and behaviors in organizations. P-E <b>fit</b> is not completely conceptualized, so existing studies of <b>fit</b> theory have focused only on particular dimensions of <b>fit</b> leading to contradictory results. Therefore, Study 1, using multi-dimensional environment <b>fit,</b> tested relationships among the environment <b>fits,</b> work related attitudes, and outcomes at the individual, group, and organization levels.
