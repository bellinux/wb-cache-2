50|$|Repeated {{application}} of liquid hog manure in excess to crop needs can have detrimental effects on soil phosphorus status. Also, {{application of}} biosolids may increase available phosphorus in soil. In poorly drained soils or {{in areas where}} snowmelt can cause periodic waterlogging, dereducing conditions can be attained in 7-10 days. This causes {{a sharp increase in}} phosphorus concentration in solution and phosphorus can be leached. In addition, reduction of the soil causes a shift in phosphorus from resilient to more labile forms. This could eventually increase the potential for phosphorus loss. This is of particular concern for the <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>management</b> of such areas, where disposal of agricultural wastes has already become a problem. It is suggested that the water regime of soils that are to be used for organic wastes disposal is taken into account in the preparation of waste management regulations.|$|E
50|$|Successful efforts using {{integrated}} {{pest management}} (IPM) of the glassy-winged sharpshooter {{include the use of}} insecticides, parasitoids (especially wasps in the family Mymaridae), and the impact of naturally occurring pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi. One of the newly discovered pathogens is a virus specific to sharpshooters. The leafhopper-infecting virus, Homalodisca coagulata virus-1 (HoCV-1, Dicistroviridae), has been shown to increase leafhopper mortality. The virus occurs in nature and is spread most readily at high population densities through contact among infected individuals, contact with virus-contaminated surfaces, and/or as an aerosol in leafhopper excreta. One of the most successful biocontrol efforts has been the mass rearing and release of four different leafhopper parasitoids (in the mymarid genus Gonatocerus), which have been very successful in reducing the number of eggs that survive. The traditional means of insect management, such as scouting and land owner reports of leafhopper presence, followed by highly focused insecticide treatments, have also been of great value in reducing leafhopper numbers; all of these impacts have produced a system wherein reasonable, <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>management</b> of this insect pest is being maintained.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} {{handling}} toxic waste {{has become a}} global problem as international trade has arisen out of the increasing toxic byproducts produced with the transfer of them to less developed countries. In 1995, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights began to notice the illicit dumping of toxic waste and assigned a Special Rapporteur to examine the human rights aspect to this issue (Commission resolution 1995/81). In September 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to strengthen the mandate to include the entire life-cycle of hazardous products from manufacturing to final destination (aka cradle to grave), as opposed to only movement and dumping of hazardous waste. The title of the Special Rapporteur has been changed to the “Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>management</b> and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes."(Human Rights Council 18/11). The Human Rights Council has further extended the scope of its mandates as of September 2012 due to {{the result of the}} dangerous implications occurring to persons advocating environmentally sound practices regarding the generation,management, handling, distribution and final disposal of hazardous and toxic materials to include the issue of the protection of the environmental human rights defenders.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an issue}} of growing importance in the construction industry.

Debris from demolition also has significant recycling potential. Construction and demolition (C&D) debris combined comprises 24 percent of municipal solid waste, which is leading to increased costs and regulation.

30|$|Date {{palm tree}} (Phoenix Dactylifera L.) is {{cultivated}} in arid and semi-arid regions. It has high tolerance to water shortage and extreme hot temperature. According {{to the latest}} statistical data of Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO 2014), the total world production of date was about 8.897 billion tons. Date palm industry is rapidly expanding worldwide, and approximately 35  kg of palm residues per tree is generated annually (Nasser et al. 2016). Date seed biomass is non-edible waste which represents {{about one-third of the}} date weight (Sait et al. 2012) making them the largest agricultural by-product in palm-growing countries. Therefore, finding ways to use this agricultural waste sustainably will benefit date producers by creating value-added product as well as offer an <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> waste <b>management</b> option.|$|R

The growth and concentration of Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s swine production facilities in recent years pose environmental concerns in terms of manure application to agricultural land.

A portable kit was used that can test for ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus in both liquid and solid manure, facilitating on-site, immediate testing. The results of this on-farm testing kit, which is currently available to producers, were then compared with laboratory analysis to determine the kit 2 ̆ 7 s accuracy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Maharlou-Bakhtegan Catchment in the {{southern}} part of Iran is faced with water scarcity. This problem is exacerbated by environmental degradation, climate change effects, mismanagement of water resources, along with a major dependence of water demand supplies on the limited groundwater resources. In this study, a combined approach of DPSIR model along with the scenario analysis was employed to derive the optimal management strategies for the <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> water resources <b>management</b> of Maharlou-Bakhtegan Catchment considering the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources. Cause-effect relationships were identified by DPSIR framework and 15 scenarios were developed based on them. For evaluating each scenario, 9 integrated water resources management indicators were introduced and evaluated by MODSIM. The results demonstrated that in scenario Scen- 14, restriction for the irrigation area development, as well as other management solutions, which led to 100 % supply of domestic and industrial water demands and 91 % supply of agricultural water demands. Also in the last scenario the value 1. 79 kg / m 3 was received by the Agricultural water productivity indicators. Moreover, by satisfying all IWRM indicators as well as enhancing zero for negative water balance of the aquifers in Scen- 14, it is clearly indicated that this scenario revealed more efficient management solutions for the <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> water resources <b>management</b> of the catchment.
