5|$|Air Hong Kong was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the Airbus A300-600F General Freighter, {{which is a}} new variant of the Airbus A300-600F. This new variant has a cargo loading system capable of handling virtually <b>every</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> container and pallet, and a side door {{at the rear of}} the lower deck capable of handling large items of general freight. The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground. There were different rules for <b>every</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E

The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|E

40|$|During solar eclipses the {{scientists}} can be observe and studying the solar atmosphere. The stratified {{structures of the}} solar atmosphere are mainly the photosphere, the chromosphere and the corona. In this work we used the Least Square (LS) method to investigate the statistical study of the solar eclipses during 20 centuries (1 – 2000). We found the formula for total number <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> solar eclipse. We get the frequency distribution of all eclipses for 20 centuries over Egypt; the percentage ratio for partial solar eclipse is 43. 2 %, while the percentage ratio for the annular solar eclipse is 30. 1 %, and the percentage ratio for total and hybrid solar eclipses are 22. 3 % and 4. 4 % respectively. The General Linear Trend formula for predicting the future values for <b>every</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> solar eclipse was obtained and determined during next 500  years (2001 – 2500). We compare our results with calculated once by NASA for each <b>types</b> <b>of</b> solar eclipse. Our results are in a good agreement with that published by NASA...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of <b>every</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E
