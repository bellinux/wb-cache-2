25|$|The typical {{depiction}} of a dwarf in Egyptian art is realistic, showing a normally grown torso and head, but visibly shortened and slightly bent arms and legs. These proportions point to achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia as the conditions responsible for the dwarfism of the individual. Yet, there are also reliefs of small peoples with normal body proportions and it remains unclear if these representations show real pygmies or <b>if</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are represented small in order to reflect their low rank or accentuate the main scene of the relief.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June, reports {{emerged that}} LulzSec hacked into and stole user {{information}} from the pornography website www.pron.com. They obtained and published around 26,000 e-mail addresses and passwords. Among the information stolen were records of two users who subscribed using email addresses associated with the Malaysian government, three users who subscribed using United States military email addresses and 55 users who LulzSec claimed were administrators of other adult-oriented websites. Following the breach, Facebook locked the accounts of all users who had used the published e-mail addresses, and also blocked new Facebook accounts opened using the leaked e-mail addresses, fearing that users of the site would get hacked after LulzSec encouraged people to try and see <b>if</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> used identical user name and password combinations on Facebook as well.|$|E
25|$|During the Archaic Period, from 6000–1000 BC, mixed conifer-hardwood forests {{as well as}} mixed prairie-forests {{replaced}} Wisconsin's conifer forests. People {{continued to}} depend on hunting and gathering. Around 4000 BC they developed spear-throwers and copper tools such as axes, adzes, projectile points, knives, perforators, fishhooks and harpoons. Copper ornaments like beaded necklaces also appeared around 1500 BC. These people gathered copper ore at quarries on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan and on Isle Royale in Lake Superior. They may have crafted copper artifacts by hammering and folding the metal and also by heating it to increase its malleability. However it is not certain <b>if</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> reached the level of copper smelting. Regardless, the Copper Culture of the Great Lakes region reached a level of sophistication unprecedented in North America. The Late Archaic Period also saw the emergence of cemeteries and ritual burials, {{such as the one}} in Oconto.|$|E
50|$|In the 1854 case Addington v. Wilson, the Supreme Court of Indiana {{held that}} a {{testator}} who disinherited his daughters because he believed them to be witches was not for that reason alone so insane as to deem him incapable of making a valid will. The court justified its decision by pointing to distinguished jurists and religious figures who affirmed the possibility of witchcraft; <b>if</b> <b>these</b> <b>people's</b> beliefs did not render them insane, neither did the testator's.|$|R

25|$|Many railfans have a {{fixation}} with steam locomotives, which sometimes also fascinate the general public, {{as seen by}} the attendance at stations to view steam-hauled railtours. Sometimes the appeal of trains is nostalgic, recalling an earlier era when the railroads {{played a central role}} in commerce and transportation, and the depot was the center of every town. Nostalgia may also result from the long, lonesome wail of the train's horn, which mimics vocalizations that want for a more simple time reminiscent of home, as heard in country or folk music worldwide. Sometimes the appeal is due to a fondness for large machinery that can be inspected and photographed up close. Sometimes there is an appeal of the scenery of the railroad running through open, uninviting terrain, or the gritty ambiance of the urban train yard. In this case, urban exploration poses a similar appeal. Some people were raised near streetcar tracks or railways. Everyday activities were associated with railroad, which seemed to be a part of life. This may lead to an interest in railcars, how they move, numbering, and other rail systems in the world and how they compare with their native ones. <b>If</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> move to another locale, their interest in railroads might be nostalgic.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Nobel Prize-winning {{economist}} Thomas Schelling published [...] "Models of Segregation", a {{paper in}} which he demonstrated through a [...] "checkerboard model" [...] and mathematical analysis, that even when every agent prefers {{to live in a}} mixed-race neighborhood, almost complete segregation of neighborhoods emerges as individual decisions accumulate. In his [...] "tipping model", he showed that members of an ethnic group do not move out of a neighborhood as long as the proportion of other ethnic groups is relatively low, but if a critical level of other ethnicities is exceeded, the original residents may make rapid decisions and take action to leave. This tipping point is viewed as simply the end-result of domino effect originating when the threshold of the majority ethnicity members with the highest sensitivity to sameness is exceeded. <b>If</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> leave and are either not replaced or replaced by other ethnicities, then this in turn raises the level of mixing of neighbors, exceeding the departure threshold for additional people.|$|E

40|$|The {{civil war}} is often {{understood}} in terms of stark oppo¬sites. It seems only natural to think of North and South, of Union and Confederacy, of freedom and slavery. But the habit of thinking in opposites often extends {{to other parts of the}} war where it serves us less well: battlefield and homefront, soldier and civilian, male and female, and black and white, as <b>if</b> <b>these</b> places, <b>people,</b> and ex¬periences were not swept up in the same all-consuming war...|$|R
60|$|The prisoners rode {{near the}} center of the column, {{surrounded}} by troopers. For a time they were both silent.

50|$|Opening a {{new school}} was exciting! Most of the {{students}} had attended Christenberry Junior High School and were happy to be back in a community school. The challenge of establishing traditions that could be carried on by future generations required thought and creativity which early classes clearly demonstrated. <b>If</b> <b>these</b> same <b>people</b> were to visit the school today, they would experience deja vu - seeing a school that is once again showing the Falcon tradition with a renovation cost exceeding $18 million.|$|R
