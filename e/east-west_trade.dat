5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign policy innovation was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's precedent in two ways. The first {{was that it}} was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, <b>East–West</b> <b>trade,</b> European security and human rights. The second part of the policy was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union. Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% of GNP was spent on the military.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra prospered {{as part of}} the Umayyad Caliphate, and its {{population}} grew. It was a key stop on the <b>East-West</b> <b>trade</b> route, with a large souq (market), built by the Umayyads, who also commissioned part of the Temple of Bel as a mosque. During this period, Palmyra was a stronghold of the Banu Kalb tribe. After being defeated by Marwan II during a civil war in the caliphate, Umayyad contender Sulayman ibn Hisham fled to the Banu Kalb in Palmyra, but eventually pledged allegiance to Marwan in 744; Palmyra continued to oppose Marwan until the surrender of the Banu Kalb leader al-Abrash al-Kalbi in 745. That year, Marwan ordered the city's walls demolished.|$|E

25|$|In 1647, the {{great-grandson}} of Ngagi Wangchuk, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, {{noted for}} the building of several other prominent buildings in Bhutan, began constructing a dzong in Trongsa, given its strategical importance. He named it the Chökhor Rabtentse Dzong {{and it was the}} seat of power of the Wangchuck dynasty before they became rulers of Bhutan in 1907. The rulers of Trongsa, the penlops of the Wangchuck dynasty, who resided at Trongsa Dzong were very powerful, exerting influence over all of eastern and central Bhutan, controlling <b>east-west</b> <b>trade</b> for centuries. The only road connecting eastern and western Bhutan (the precursor to the modern Lateral Road), passed through the courtyard of the dzong. By the 19th century, the penlops, ruling from Trongsa Dzong, had become so powerful that Trongsa had effectively become the capital of Bhutan, although never officially so. Its strategic location added to its importance on the <b>east-west</b> <b>trade</b> route and was a source of revenue to the Trongsa penlop. They later became the monarchs of Bhutan that rule to this day.|$|E

500|$|The Court {{agreed with}} Malaysia that the Johor Sultanate had {{original}} title to Pedra Branca, rejecting Singapore's {{argument that the}} island was terra nullius. It found it was not disputed that Johor had established itself as a sovereign state with a certain territorial domain in Southeast Asia since it came into existence in 1512. As Pedra Branca had always been known as a navigational hazard in the Singapore Strait, which was a vital channel for international navigation in <b>east-west</b> <b>trade</b> between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, it was inconceivable that the island had remained undiscovered by the local community. It was therefore reasonable to infer that Pedra Branca lay within the general geographical scope of the Johor Sultanate. Further, during {{the existence of the}} old Johor Sultanate, {{there was no evidence of}} any competing claims over the islands in the Singapore Strait. It also agreed with Malaysia's submission that descriptions of the relationship between the Sultan of Johor and the Orang Laut in 19th-century official British reports proved that the Sultan exercised sovereign authority over the Orang Laut. Since the Orang Laut made the islands in the Singapore Strait their habitat, this confirmed the [...] "ancient original title" [...] of the Johor Sultanate to those islands, including Pedra Branca. As regards Singapore's argument that the traditional concept of Malay sovereignty was based on control over people rather than territory, the Court observed that sovereignty comprises control over both persons and territory. However, it was not necessary to deal with the point further as it had already found that Johor had territorial sovereignty over Pedra Branca.|$|E
50|$|Cilicia lay at {{the eastern}} end of the Mediterranean coast, just north of Cyprus.

The town itself was founded by Dan O'Connor, who in 1903 formed a steamship company on the lake and established its first store on the future townsite.

2500|$|The rise of Bruges as {{a center}} of trade and a {{corresponding}} revival of the North Sea economic importance began in 1134 when a storm tide created a deeper waterway to the city allowing the entry of large ships to port.

[...] Bruges became the end point of the Hanseatic <b>East-West</b> <b>trade</b> line that began in Novgorod and was very important for maritime connections between France, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands and the Hanseatic regions of Northern Europe.

A cunning and pragmatical ruler, Malik Ayyaz turned the city into the main port of Gujarat (known to the Portuguese as Cambaia) and one of the main entrepôts between India and the Persian Gulf, avoiding Portuguese hostility by pursuing a policy of appeasement and even alignment - up until Hussain unexpectedly sailed into Diu.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{some debate}} over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or as slaves.

The alternate explanation, proposed by Romanian scholar P. P. Panaitescu, was that following the Crusades, an important <b>East-West</b> <b>trade</b> route passed through the Romanian states and the local feudal lords enslaved the Roma for economic gain for lack of other craftsmen. However, this theory is undermined by the fact that slavery was present before the trade route gained importance.|$|E

50|$|Hippolus is {{an ancient}} Greek mariner {{credited}} in Pliny the Elder's Periplus of the Erythyaean Sea with the discovery in 45 AD of the pattern of monsoon winds.

Then in the autumn the pattern of winds reversed allowing an equally speedy return from India. This resulted in a dramatic increase in trade between the Indian and the Greco-Roman world.

2500|$|Originally a fortress, it {{was founded}} in 303 BC with the name Dura by the Seleucids on the {{intersection}} of an <b>east-west</b> <b>trade</b> route and the trade route along the Euphrates. Dura controlled the river crossing on the route between his newly founded cities of Antioch and Seleucia on the Tigris. Its rebuilding as a great city built after the Hippodamian model, with rectangular blocks defined by cross-streets ranged round a large central agora, was formally laid out in the 2nd century BC. [...] The traditional view of Dura-Europos as a great caravan city is becoming nuanced by the discoveries of locally made manufactures and traces of close ties with Palmyra (James). Instead, Dura Europos owed its development to its role as a regional capital.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the latter}} half of the 2nd century, Christianity had spread east {{throughout}} Media, Persia, Parthia, and Bactria. The twenty bishops and many presbyters were more of the order of itinerant missionaries, passing from place to place as Paul did and supplying their needs with such occupations as merchant or craftsman. By AD 280 the metropolis of Seleucia assumed the title of [...] "Catholicos" [...] and in A.D. 424 a council of the church at Seleucia elected the first patriarch to have jurisdiction over the whole church of the East, including India and Ceylon (Sri Lanka). The seat of the Patriarchate was fixed at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, since this was an important point on the <b>East-West</b> <b>trade</b> routes which extended both to India and China, Java and Japan. Thus the shift of ecclesiastical authority was away from Edessa, which in A.D. 216 had become tributary to Rome. the establishment of an independent patriarchate with nine subordinate metropoli contributed to a more favourable attitude by the Persian government, which no longer had to fear an ecclesiastical alliance with the common enemy, Rome.|$|E

50|$|The thesis {{explains}} Canadian {{economic development}} as a lateral, <b>east-west</b> conception of <b>trade.</b> Innis argued that Canada developed as it did {{because of the nature}} of its staple commodities: raw materials, such as fish, fur, lumber, agricultural products and minerals, that were exported to Britain and the West Indies. This trading link cemented Canada's cultural links to Britain. The search for and exploitation of these staples led to the creation of institutions that defined the political culture of the nation and its regions.|$|R
40|$|Canada needs a “Made-in-Canada” {{approach}} to electricity transmission that better exploits {{the benefits of}} <b>east-west</b> power <b>trading.</b> In this study, the author explains how to overcome the impediments to electricity trading that currently exist at provincial borders. To ensure continued access to US markets, most Canadian provinces have complied with US electricity trading rules. But when transplanted in Canada these rules limit provinces with competitive electricity markets, where electricity customers may choose among suppliers (Alberta and Ontario), in sharing the benefits of trade with their neighbouring monopoly utilities (such as in British Columbia, Manitoba, or Quebec). Some provinces rely mostly on hydroelectric generation, while others rely more on fossil or nuclear-fuelled generation. Carr says Canada would benefit from more electricity <b>trading</b> on an <b>east-west</b> axis because the sharing of different forms of electricity generation – and time-zone diversity – would allow better use of each province’s generation capacity. Carr makes several specific recommendations for provincial action. He also recommends the federal government support provincial initiatives {{in the event of}} NAFTA challenges.
