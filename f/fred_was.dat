5|$|Born in Blackpool, {{a coastal}} town in north-west England, Swift's first club was Blackpool Gas Works, {{where he worked}} as a coke-keeper. A spell at nearby Fleetwood followed, during which Swift {{attracted}} interest from a number of Football League clubs. Potential suitors included Blackpool (where Frank's elder brother <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> the goalkeeper), Blackburn Rovers, Bradford City and Manchester City. The first to offer Swift a contract were Manchester City, who played in the First Division, the highest level of English football. Initially signed as an amateur in October 1932, eighteen-year-old Swift turned professional the following month, receiving a wage of ten shillings (50p) per week. The following December he was called up to the first team, having previously made only three reserve team appearances.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the}} easternmost forming major hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin since {{satellite}} observations became available. Forming out of a strong tropical wave on September7, 2009 near the Cape Verde Islands, Fred gradually organized within an area of moderate wind shear. The following day, decreasing shear allowed the storm to intensify and develop well-organized convective banding features. Later on September8, Fred attained hurricane intensity and underwent rapid intensification overnight, attaining its peak intensity as a strong Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120mph (195km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). Shortly after reaching this intensity, the hurricane began to weaken as wind shear increased and dry air hampered convective development.|$|E
5|$|Story and {{characters}} were a primary concern for Gilbert and Winnick. The pair based the game's cast on friends, family members, acquaintances, and stereotypes. For example, Winnick's girlfriend Ray was {{the inspiration for}} Razor, while Dave and Wendy were based, respectively, on Gilbert and a fellow Lucasfilm employee named Wendy. According to Winnick, the Edison family was shaped after characters from EC Comics and Warren Publishing magazines. The sentient meteor that brainwashes Dr. <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> inspired by a segment from the 1982 anthology film Creepshow. A man-eating plant, {{similar to that of}} Little Shop of Horrors, was included as well. The developers sought {{to strike a balance between}} tension and humor with the game's story.|$|E

5|$|Within a year, Laurel Grove failed. <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> inexperienced {{and made}} poor bargains with local merchants. Before the war, {{plantations}} {{had been largely}} self-sufficient, but Fred paid high prices for goods shipped in from Savannah and Charleston. He took days off {{at a time to}} visit saloons in Jacksonville. An unanticipated infestation of cotton-worm larvae (Helicoverpa zea) destroyed much of the cotton crop. Only two bales were produced by Laurel Grove; Stowe realized the venture was a failure. Fred committed himself to a rehabilitation asylum in New York, and at some point in 1867, Stowe purchased the cottage and the attached grove in Mandarin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tropical}} cyclones in {{the extreme}} eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by high pressures from a subtropical ridge, this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance. Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband, resembling the precursor to an eye, tightened around the center. At 06:00UTC on August30, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred 390mi (625km) east-southeast of Praia, Cape Verdeamong the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record-keeping began in 1851. A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light upper winds, and above-average sea surface temperatures. The storm developed a thick, circular central dense overcast with good outflow, and the eye feature became well established {{at all levels of}} the circulation. Based on these characteristics, as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75mph (120km/h) winds, <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 00:00UTC, August31. Then centered 165mi (270km) east-southeast of Sal, Cape Verde, it became the easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in the tropical Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> the easternmost Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{to form in}} the tropics, and {{the first}} to move through Cape Verde since 1892. The second hurricane and sixth named storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Fred originated from a well-defined tropical wave over West Africa in late August2015. Once offshore, the wave moved northwestward within a favorable tropospheric environment and strengthened into a tropical storm on August30. The following day, Fred grew to a Category1 hurricane with peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) as it approached Cape Verde. After passing Boa Vista and moving away from Santo Antão, it entered a phase of steady weakening, dropping below hurricane status by September1. Fred then turned to the west-northwest, enduring increasingly hostile wind shear, but maintained its status as a tropical cyclone despite repeated forecasts of imminent dissipation. It fluctuated between minimal tropical storm and tropical depression strength through September45. Curving sharply to the north, Fred's circulation pattern had diminished considerably by September6, and the storm dissipated later that day.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} that the Atlantic {{hurricane}} basin has been thoroughly studied since 1851, {{there was only one}} other storm prior to Hurricane Fred to attain Category 3 intensity south of 30°N and east of 35°W. This storm was Hurricane Frances in 1980. Frances attained major hurricane status farther south and east than Fred; however, <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> the strongest of the two, peaking with estimated winds of 120mph (195km/h) and a minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). Just over a year later, this intensity record was broken by Hurricane Julia, which attained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a pressure of 948mbar (hPa; 27.99inHg) at 17.7°N and 32.2°W, becoming the easternmost-forming Category4 hurricane on record. In one of the NHC's discussions on Hurricane Fred, it was mentioned that due to the unusual location of a storm of its intensity, the hurricane would likely have gone unnoticed before the advent of satellite imagery in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Fred and John Lillywhite, as well {{as their}} elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into {{business}} as sports outfitters. Perhaps because of this multiplicity of Lillywhites, latter day accounts of their non-cricketing activities sometimes conflict as to who did what. What is clear is that <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> a manager, probably from 1848 to 1855, in the firm of Lillywhite Brothers, a tobacconist and sports outfitter in Islington, then on the outskirts of London.|$|E
25|$|The defence next {{called a}} {{succession}} of women {{who claimed to have}} been attacked or assaulted by a lone male whose physical description matched that of Fred West between 1966 and 1975. These seven women each testified they had recognised their attacker as Fred West when his photograph appeared in the media in 1994. The intention of this testimony was to illustrate to the jury that <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> capable of abducting, assaulting or attempting to attack women without Rose (although the prosecution had never disputed this fact). Despite this, the physical recollections of several of these women varied greatly.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1980s, rumours of Rose's {{sex life}} had reached {{several of the}} children's classmates, and {{although}} the West children had been instructed never to divulge details of their home lives to their peers, Heather did confide to her friends {{that many of these}} rumours were true.

25|$|Three months later, {{the couple}} vacated the Cheltenham flat and {{relocated}} {{to the ground}} floor flat of a two-storey house in Midland Road, Gloucester. On 17 October 1970, Rose gave birth to their first child: a daughter they named Heather Ann (although speculation remains Heather may have been sired by Rose's own father). Two months later, <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> imprisoned for the theft of car tyres and a vehicle tax disc. He would remain imprisoned until 24 June 1971. As he served this six-and-a-half-month sentence, Rose, having just turned 17, looked after the three girls, with both Charmaine and Anna Marie being informed to refer to Rose as their mother.|$|E
25|$|Charmaine's {{body was}} {{initially}} stowed {{in the coal}} cellar of Midland Road until <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> released from prison. He would later bury her naked body in the yard close {{to the back door}} of the flat, and although he remained adamant he had not dismembered this particular victim, a subsequent autopsy suggested the body had been severed at the hip (although this damage may have been caused by building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976). In addition, several bones—particularly patellae, finger, wrist, toe and ankle bones—were missing from her skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes (this would prove to be a distinctive discovery in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994).|$|E
25|$|The {{body of the}} Wests' former {{friend and}} housemate, Terrence Crick, was found in his car in the Scarborough {{district}} of Hackness in January 1996. He was 48 years old. Crick had become acquainted with Fred while he had resided at the Lake House Caravan Park in 1969; he had reported Fred to the authorities on several occasions after having been shown both surgical instruments Fred claimed to have used to perform illegal abortions, and Polaroid images of the subjects' genitals {{he claimed to have}} taken immediately after the procedures, before suggesting Crick assist him in recruiting pregnant girls to perform upon. Crick had believed the information he had provided to police was ignored as <b>Fred</b> <b>was</b> a known police informant. The stress and guilt Crick had felt over the fact the information he had provided had not resulted in charges being brought apparently led him to take his own life; an inquest later recorded a verdict of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. His widow later submitted a formal complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.|$|E
