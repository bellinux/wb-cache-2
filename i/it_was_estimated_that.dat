5|$|Another Trojan in this wave, TorrentLocker, {{initially}} {{contained a}} design flaw comparable to CryptoDefense; it {{used the same}} keystream for every infected computer, making the encryption trivial to overcome. However, this flaw was later fixed.

In 2008 a more precise number of Mup genes {{in a range of}} species was determined by analyzing the DNA sequence of whole genomes.|$|E
5|$|CryptoLocker was {{isolated}} by {{the seizure of}} the Gameover ZeuS botnet as part of Operation Tovar, as officially announced by the U.S. Department of Justice on 2 June 2014.

5|$|Despite these atrocities, {{the main}} cause of the {{population}} decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably African sleeping sickness, smallpox, swine influenza and amoebic dysentery, ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> half-a-million Congolese had died from sleeping sickness. Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while excess deaths rose.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{there were}} 10,000 foxes in London.
