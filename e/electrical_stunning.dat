The stunning methods used were electrical whole-body and head-only stunning with different voltages (25 vs 100 V) and frequencies (50 vs 200 Hz), and mechanical captive bolt stunning. Before being stunned, the broilers were restrained either by shackling them by the feet, restraining their heads while they were standing, or placing them in a cone. Convulsions during and after stunning were subjectively scored. At 1 d post-mortem, the pH, color, and the intensity and number of hemorrhages, of breast and thigh muscles were measured. Convulsions were, in order of increasing intensity, observed after whole-body stunning using 50 Hz, whole-body stunning using 200 Hz, head-only stunning, and captive bolt stunning. No differences in ultimate pH were measured. A consistent difference in color was observed between whole-body and head-only stunning. Head-only stunning resulted in darker and more red (P ≤ 0. 01) breast muscles. Head-only and captive bolt stunning resulted in hemorrhages that were located more distal in the breast muscle than those observed after whole-body stunning.

40|$|Assessing {{unconsciousness}} {{is important}} to safeguard animal welfare shortly after stunning at the slaughter plant. Indicators that can be visually evaluated are most often used when assessing unconsciousness, {{as they can be}} easily applied in slaughter plants. These indicators include reflexes originating from the brain stem (e. g. eye reflexes) or from the spinal cord (e. g. pedal reflex) and behavioural indicators such as loss of posture, vocalisations and rhythmic breathing. When physically stunning an animal, for example, captive bolt, most important indicators looked at are posture, righting reflex, rhythmic breathing and the corneal or palpebral reflex that should all be absent if the animal is unconscious. Spinal reflexes are difficult as a measure of unconsciousness with this type of stunning, as they may occur more vigorous. For stunning methods that do not physically destroy the brain, for example, <b>electrical</b> and gas <b>stunning,</b> most important indicators looked at are posture, righting reflex, natural blinking response, rhythmic breathing, vocalisations and focused eye movement that should all be absent if the animal is unconscious.

Under commercial conditions, none of the indicators mentioned above should be used as a single indicator to determine unconsciousness after stunning.

40|$|During {{the past}} 15 years {{crocodile}} farming {{has become more}} important and sophisticated all over the world. In South Africa there are currently an estimated one million Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) on commercial farms, mostly for leather production. The management, especially of crocodiles that are close to slaughter, is very intensive as the skins of these animals {{have to be in}} immaculate condition to achieve good prices on the international markets. In this regard, the electric stunner is often used on a daily basis on most farms in South Africa to safely handle crocodiles. However, this technique (electrical immobilisation) has only been scientifically evaluated in the Australian saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). As crocodilian species might react differently to the electrical immobilisation procedure, the aim of the project was to compare certain physiological parameters of Nile crocodiles captured by either <b>electrical</b> immobilisation (<b>stunning)</b> or captured manually by noosing. This study was conducted during the summer of 2012 on a commercial crocodile farm near Pongola, South Africa. In total 45 crocodiles were used of which 23 crocodiles were captured by electrical immobilisation and 22 by means of noosing. Physiological parameters chosen for monitoring were serum corticosterone, blood lactate, blood glucose, as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine kinase (CK). The concentrations and activities of these parameters were determined in blood samples collected immediately after capture by the two methods. Animals were then tied and blind-folded and kept in a quiet place. Four hours later blood samples were collected again from each animal to monitor changes in concentrations and activities of these parameters. In all cases the time was recorded that it took to capture each animal. In addition, total handling time until blood collection was also recorded on an individual basis. Our results indicate that although corticosterone increased greatly within the four hour interval in both groups, there was no difference (p> 0. 05) between the two methods of capture. Lactate did not increase significantly within the four hour period in both groups, but was higher when animals were noosed. Glucose concentrations rose within four hours, but no significant differences could be detected between the two capture methods. While ALT and ALP did not show any clear trend, increased activities were detected for AST and CK in the four hour period after capture. Both, AST and CK levels were higher in noosed animals. Noosing a crocodile took longer to restrain the animal when compared to the stunning method. On average stunning took 118 seconds from start of capture until an animal was under control while noosing took 186 seconds per animal. As a consequence the noosed animals struggle for a longer time, which most probably caused exhaustion and muscle damage; explaining the higher levels of blood lactate, AST and CK. One helper was injured (bite wound) trying to control a crocodiles using the noose method. Electrical immobilisation is therefore considered to be the better option for commercial farms, from a physiological perspective, as well as an animal welfare and human safety viewpoint.

40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> in {{the process}} of {{slaughtering}} poultry is used to induce unconsciousness and immobilize the animal for easier processing. Unconsciousness is a function of brain damage. Brain damage has been studied with brain impedance recordings under ischemic conditions. This experiment studies brain impedance as a response to a general epileptiform insult caused by <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> and ischemia caused by exsanguination. Brain impedance was recorded in 10 broiler chickens for each of three killing methods: whole body <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning,</b> which induces cardiac arrest; head only <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> followed by exsanguination; and exsanguination without stunning. Brain impedance was converted into relative extracellular volume (ECV) values. Results showed that, immediately after <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning,</b> the ECV decreased 5. 5 % from base ECV. With exsanguination only, the ECV decreased from base ECV only after 4 min after neck cutting. The ECV decrease after 10 min did not differ between treatments. With a time of 228 s to reach one-half of the ECV decrease found at 10 min, <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> resulted in a much faster change in ECV than exsanguination only (373 s).

40|$|The general {{method for}} {{stunning}} poultry before slaughter is by immersion of a chicken's head into an electrified waterbath. This method results in carcass and meat quality deficiencies. The major problems are hemorrhages and {{a delay in}} onset of rigor mortis, which {{increases the risk of}} cold shortening with early deboning. In two experiments, this study examines the early postmortem metabolism in the breast muscle and its effect on ultimate meat quality. The first experiment describes the effects of 5 h feed deprivation on the availability of glycogen from the liver and the breast muscle, of waterbath and head-only <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning</b> on pH and metabolite levels up to 6 h in unprocessed muscle, and the consequences on meat quality. The second experiment compares the same measurements after waterbath and head-only <b>electrical</b> <b>stunning,</b> CO(2) /O(2) /N(2) and Ar/CO(2) gases, and captive needle stunning.
