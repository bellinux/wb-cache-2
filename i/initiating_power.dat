Detonation cord will initiate most commercial high explosives (dynamite, gelignite, sensitised gels, etc.) but will not initiate less sensitive blasting agents like ANFO on its own. 25 to 50 grain/foot (5.3 to 10.6 g/m) detonation cord has approximately the same <b>initiating</b> <b>power</b> as a #8 blasting cap in every 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) along its entire length. A small charge of PETN, TNT, or other explosive booster is required to bridge between the cord and a charge of insensitive blasting agent like ANFO or most water gels.|$|E
40|$|In 1975, {{negotiations}} were initiated with two major resource developers toward <b>initiating</b> <b>power</b> plant projects at {{three of the}} Imperial Valley resource areas, Brawley, Salton Sea and Heber. The projects at Brawley and Salton Sea are substantially different from that at Heber in objective, size and design. The reasons for these differences {{are related to the}} different nature of the geothermal brines and to different operating philosophies of the resource developers involved. The projects at Brawley and Salton Sea include the construction and operation by Edison of 10 MW (gross) units. The contracts with the field developer for these resources are such that Edison will purchase steam. It is, therefore, the developer's responsibility to drill and complete the geothermal production and injection wells, and to construct and operate the steam separators and flash vessels, brine processing equipment, injection pumps, and steam scrubbing equipment. These units are 10 MW rather than 50 to 100 MW due to the technical risks associated with producing, handling and injecting the very high salinity brines at these locations. In addition, the reliability of turbine operation with relatively impure steam is a major concern. The Heber plant, on the other hand, will utilize a much cleaner resource. The technical risk is, therefore, judged to be substantially lower. The plant at Heber will be a commercial 45 MW unit. Edison will buy brine, and will own and operate all of the brine handling equipment except for the wells and collection manifolds...|$|E
40|$|Potassium 1, 1 '-dinitroamino- 5, 5 ' bistetrazolate (K_ 2 DNABT) is a {{nitrogen}} rich (50. 3 % by weight, K 2 C 2 N 12 O 4) green {{primary explosive}} with high performance characteristics namely {{velocity of detonation}} (D = 8. 33 km/s), detonation pressure (P = 31. 7 GPa) and fast <b>initiating</b> <b>power</b> to replace existing toxic primaries. In the present work, we report density functional theory (DFT) calculations on structural, equation of state, vibrational spectra, electronic structure and absorption spectra of K_ 2 DNABT. We have discussed the influence of weak dispersive interactions on structural and vibrational properties through the DFT-D 2 method. We find anisotropic compressibility (b < a < c) from pressure dependent structural properties. The predicted bulk modulus reveals that the material is harder than cyanuric triazide (C 3 N 12) and softer than lead azide (Pb(N 3) 2). A complete assignment of all vibrational modes has been made and compared with the available experimental results. The calculated zone centre IR and Raman frequencies show a blue-shift {{which leads to a}} hardening of the lattice upon compression. In addition, we have also calculated the electronic structure and absorption spectra using the recently developed Tran Blaha-modified Becke Johnson potential. It is found that K_ 2 DNABT is a direct band gap insulator with a band gap of 3. 87 eV and the top of the valence band mainly dominated by 2 p-states of oxygen and nitrogen atoms. K_ 2 DNABT exhibits mixed ionic (between potassium and tetrazolate ions) and covalent character within tetrazolate molecule. The presence of ionic bonding suggests that the investigated compound is relatively stable and insensitive than covalent primaries. From the calculated absorption spectra, the material is found to decompose under ultra-violet light irradiation...|$|E

40|$|The {{assignment}} of this master thesis consists of <b>initiating</b> <b>power,</b> subcarrier allocation in a dynamic FFR based scheme designed for multi-cell OFDMA networks {{and to enhance}} the throughput of all center users in bandwidth hungry borrower cells (overloaded cells) which was previously degraded by original FFR 3 scheme {{as a result of}} partitioning of system bandwidth into center and edge bands respectively. The method uses band borrowing to compensate center user’s throughput loss in a semi and fully overloaded system. The scheme uses dynamic programming method (0 / 1 knapsack problem) to bargain an edge band on various power levels and tends to check the best combination (power and sub-carrier) which the system can utilize while still maintaining acceptable throughput loss for the users {{at the edge of the}} neighboring cell (lender cell). The algorithm consists of generating a borrowing request to neighboring cells for utilizing their edge bands by the overloaded borrower cell if their average center user throughput reaches below a minimum threshold value set in the system. The borrowing method uses 0 / 1 knapsack problem to capture an edge band based on limiting factors of total cost in average throughput losses by neighbors (Ci) and Un (tolerable mean user edge user throughput loss by lending cell). While solving knapsack problem the lender (neighbors) will check Ci and Un before granting the right to use its edge band. The later stage requires reducing subcarrier power level in order to utilize the lenders edge band using "soft borrower" mode. The borrowed sub-carriers will be activated take power from the original center band sub-carriers of the overloaded cell by taking into account the interference between the lender and the borrower. In case of negative (0) reply from the lender cell after the first request, multiple requests are generated at reduce power level at every step to order to acquire more bands. If a neighbor has band borrowing requests from multiple overloaded base stations, the band will be granted to the one which gives minimal loss in terms of throughput to the lender cell. The simulation results are analyzed w. r. t reuse- 1 and FFR 3 scheme of a multi cell regular and irregular scenarios comprising of lightly to heavily overloaded cells with various subcarrier allocation patterns. An overhead and time assessment is also presented between borrower and lender cells. Simulation results show an increase of 60 % in center user’s throughput w. r. t original FFR 3 scheme with an acceptable loss of 18 % at the edges in complex overloaded scenarios while the overall system throughout increases by 35 %...|$|E

However, we analyzed train schedules and determined that the cellular railway network had considerable potential for energy saving. We designed a simple train detection strategy using the handover procedure to <b>initiate</b> <b>power</b> saving. We also proposed a flexible and effective solution based on the mealy-type finite state machine to transit the cell state between an energy-saving mode and a full running mode. The key design principle of the proposed solution consists in forming an orthogonal group and cluster, based on network deployment and train schedules, to simplify the state transition. Our evaluations using a real network deployment led to a significant energy saving of up to 33 % with different power-saving strategies and factors.|$|R
