[...] "Good-by, Miss Helena. I {{am going to}} stay {{for a day or two}} with a friend." [...] What friend? Who cares? ...|$|E
6000|$|The other {{remained}} coldly unaffected, after a {{first start}} of surprise at his cordiality, and then reviled {{the dust and}} heat. [...] "But I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> run down to Newport, to-morrow, for a week," [...] he said. [...] "By the way, you look as if you needed a little change. Aren't you going anywhere this summer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{he needed}} a lot of saving," [...] laughed Flo. [...] "But," [...] her pretty face growing more serious, [...] "I believe it was all Fate, and nothing else. Had we {{not come to the}} beach this afternoon, the boy might have drowned; so, as I {{suggested}} the trip, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> credit myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These twelve years, more likely," [...] said Wemmick. [...] "Yes. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> holiday.

60|$|I left {{very quietly}} a little later, without {{going up to}} the drawing-room. A few days {{afterwards}} I heard that Meadows had gone. The Ashcroft-Fowlers, I am told, are giving up in despair. They are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> suite of ten rooms and four baths in the Grand Palaver Hotel, and rough it there for the winter.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'll have HIM. I won't {{miss the}} other things. We're {{to be married}} a year from next June. Jo {{graduates}} from St. Columbia this spring, you know. Then he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> mission church down on Patterson Street in the slums. Fancy me in the slums! But I'd go there or to Greenland's icy mountains with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the winter}} Cowles remarked to me that he {{intended}} to marry Miss Northcott as soon as possible--probably some time in the spring. He was, as I have already remarked, fairly well off, and the young lady had some money of her own, so that there was no pecuniary reason for a long engagement. [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> house out at Corstorphine," [...] he said, [...] "and we hope to see your face at our table, Bob, as often as you can possibly come." [...] I thanked him, and tried to shake off my apprehensions, and persuade myself that all would yet be well.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{announced}} in July 2012 that the band was {{to be taking a}} hiatus. In an interview with Billboard Aaron Lewis stated that [...] "We're not breaking up. We're not gonna stop making music. We're just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hiatus that really hasn't ever been taken in our career. We put out seven records in 14 years. We've been pretty busy." [...] Lewis also had plans to release his first solo album The Road. During such time, Mike Mushok auditioned, and was selected, to play guitar for former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted's new band Newsted. He featured on their debut album Heavy Metal Music.|$|E
5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek states [...] "Continuum is European jazz rife with funkiness; it's just more {{specific}} sound. It {{may require a}} closer listen, at least initially, but once experienced, its depth and constancy are unmistakable". PopMatters' John Garratt said [...] "While their playing can be every bit as spritely as Ronin, Continuum captures Mobile in a low, pensive light. This isn’t {{to say that the}} music isn’t as successful overall, it’s just that establishing a warm sense of intimacy with it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> work on your part". All About Jazz reviewers said, [...] "With its variety of styles, Continuum is the best of Mobile's albums to date, despite the very high bar set from the beginning" [...] and [...] "there's little doubt that those who've become fans of Ronin's more eminently groove-laden music will be (if they weren't already) ready for this group's richer compositional rigor...for whom the term Continuum is, indeed, wholly appropriate for its broader-spectrum'd musical treasures". London Jazz News' John L. Walters noted [...] "Bärtsch's music is always urgent but never in a hurry, and his sidemen follow the leader’s calm self-discipline. What improvisation there is takes place within the broad structures of the compositions - Mobile may not be a ‘blowing’ band in the jazz sense of the word, but it interprets the music as if it were". In JazzTimes, Steve Greenlee wrote [...] "There is a clean, icy quality to this music—a hallmark of Scandinavian jazz—that invites comparisons to electronica and to the work of Philip Glass and film composer Thomas Newman... Continuum, beginning to end, is mesmerizing".|$|E

Can someone just waltz in and grab a hundred­year­old trademark, suddenly own this whole history? It seemed a little weird 2 ̆ 7 cause a trademark is like a kind of property. And if you think of this like land [...] . SMITH: Like, hey, I notice you haven 2 ̆ 7 t mowed your lawn for a while, so I 2 ̆ 7 m just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> part of your property. KESTENBAUM: Yeah, it seems crazy, right? McKenna said, I 2 ̆ 7 m thinking about trademarks wrong. They 2 ̆ 7 re a funny kind of property. MARK MCKENNA: So the idea is that, you know, trademarks are not property in a full sense like other things. So trademark rights really exist for the purpose of helping producers signal something to consumers that, you know, we are the source of this product.

40|$|Memorial day {{is coming}} up, {{and maybe you}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> car trip.

But this much is sure: no American president could do anything similar today.
