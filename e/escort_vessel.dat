5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Seeadler was converted into a mine storage hulk in Wilhelmshaven. An accidental explosion in April 1917 destroyed the ship, and her wreck was never raised. Condor {{was used for the}} same purpose in Kiel; she survived the war and was broken up for scrap in 1921 in Hamburg. Cormoran, still stationed in Tsingtao, was scuttled in the harbor because her engines were in poor condition. Geier meanwhile operated against British merchant shipping in the Pacific following the onset of hostilities. By October, she was running low on coal and had been isolated from any sources of support; she therefore steamed to Hawaii, where she was interned by the US Navy. After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, she was seized and commissioned as USS Schurz for use as an <b>escort</b> <b>vessel.</b> She was sunk after colliding with a merchant ship in June 1918.|$|E
25|$|Chanticleer served chiefly as an <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> and cruised off the European coast. Commander Stewart Blacker assumed {{command in}} May 1813. In 1813, she took three prizes near the German {{archipelago}} of Heligoland in the North Sea. Commander J. Thomson replace Blacker in July 1814.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Whitehurst circled, {{apparently}} out of control. Yet, when Vigilance {{caught up}} with the damaged ship and came alongside at 1530, the more serious fires on board the <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> had been controlled. Vigilance's fire fighting and damage control parties helped to extinguish the remaining blaze and made emergency repairs.|$|E

25|$|One {{explanation}} {{for the presence of}} the naval trawler reported by the crews of MTB 627 and MTB 653 has been fronted by several researchers. In the Hustadvika area was a small tugboat, the Hopplafjord, which rescued survivors after the sinking of the two ships. Hopplafjord, being similar to a naval trawler in size and profile, may have been misinterpreted as an <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> by the MTB commander.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 1933, the British Admiralty placed orders with Devonport Dockyard for two sloops, Grimsby and , {{the first}} of a new class named after Grimsby that was {{eventually}} to number eight ships built for the Royal Navy, four for the Royal Australian Navy and one for the Royal Indian Marine. The , while based on the previous , was intended to be a more capable <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> than previous sloops, and carried a more powerful armament.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1941, Vendetta was docked for refit in Singapore, {{but after}} the Japanese invaded, the {{destroyer}} had to be towed to Fremantle, then Melbourne. After the refit, which converted the destroyer into a dedicated <b>escort</b> <b>vessel,</b> ended in December 1942, Vendetta {{spent the rest of}} World War II operating as a troop and convoy escort around Australia and New Guinea. Vendetta was decommissioned in late 1945, and was scuttled off Sydney Heads in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Bathurst {{began her}} career in January 1941 {{as part of the}} 21st Minesweeping Flotilla, {{operating}} off Australia's east coast. Between March and May, she was assigned as a patrol and <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> to Singapore, before proceeding to Colombo and joining the British Eastern Fleet. Bathurst spent the month of June patrolling the Red Sea, then was deployed {{for three and a half}} months as a blockade vessel in the Gulf of Tadjoura. During this time, the corvette captured at least three small vessels.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October, Marietta sailed from Virginia for the Philippines. Steaming via the Suez Canal, {{she arrived}} Manila on 3 January 1900. Operating {{in support of}} American forces ending the Philippine insurrection, the gunboat acted as a patrol and convoy <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> in the Islands, {{assisting}} and cooperating with the Army In military expeditions and landings until ordered home on 3 June 1901.

Then, steaming independently, she cruised to Tjilatjap, on the south coast of Java, where her landing force began to receive training in jungle warfare. The plan to use Tulsas bluejackets as infantry in a last-ditch defense of Java never progressed beyond the initial training stage, and her erstwhile ground troops returned to the ship as she was being outfitted to become a convoy <b>escort</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Entering {{service in}} 1941, Nestor {{spent most of}} her career as a patrol and <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Far East. In December 1941, the {{destroyer}} located and sank the German submarine U-127. In June 1942, Nestor sailed as part of the Operation Vigorous escort force, protecting a supply convoy to Malta. On the evening of 15 June, the ship was heavily damaged by air attack. Despite attempts to tow the ship to base, Nestor was abandoned and scuttled off Crete the next morning. Nestor is the only ship of the RAN that never operated in Australian waters.|$|E

500|$|After working up, Brilliant was {{assigned}} to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla in Gibraltar in July 1943 and remained with them until September 1944 when she began a refit at Portsmouth. The ship was reassigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the English Channel in November. On 24 December 1944, Brilliant was escorting the troopship [...] when the ship was struck by a torpedo from , 5 nautical miles off Cherbourg. Brilliant was able to rescue about 500 survivors from the damaged troopship, but due to various communication failures, no other vessels reached her before she sank and 764 died. The ship collided with the Canadian corvette [...] in dense fog on 21 January 1945 off the Isle of Wight. Brilliants bow was badly damaged and she was transferred to Antwerp, Belgium, for permanent repairs after emergency repairs were made at Portsmouth. They were not completed until 23 April and the ship returned to Portsmouth for conversion to a submarine target and <b>escort</b> <b>vessel.</b> This was completed on 26 May and Brilliant escorted the light cruiser [...] with King George VI aboard as he visited the Channel Islands on 7 June. From 13 June, based at Holy Loch, Scotland, she escorted surrendered U-boats as part of Operation Deadlight before being paid off into reserve in November 1945. Her radar and communications equipment was removed before the ship was reduced to Category C reserve at Holy Loch on 29 April 1946. Brilliant was allocated to the Target Trials Committee on 11 September and was used evaluate the shock effects of a [...] underwater explosion in April 1947. The ship was turned over to the British Iron and Steel Company for scrapping on 21 February 1948. She was broken up beginning in April at Troon by the West of Scotland Shipbreaking Co.|$|E
