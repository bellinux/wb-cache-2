25|$|Bullying: A bully may project his/her own {{feelings}} of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite {{the fact that}} a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability. Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even <b>international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the military}} intervention by a multi-state coalition acting under the Security Council mandate since 19 March 2011 occasioned an <b>international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> between Libya and the intervening states. Some academics believe that this intervention transformed the legal nature of the conflict as a whole, {{with the result that}} even the rebels should have been considered as one of the parties to an overarching international conflict spanning the whole Libyan territory. Others doubt this on account of both legal and factual considerations.|$|E
25|$|The Bosnian War was an <b>international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> {{that took}} place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995. Following a number of violent {{incidents}} in early 1992, the war is commonly viewed as having started on 6 April 1992. The war ended on 14 December 1995. The main belligerents were the forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and those of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat entities within Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska and Herzeg-Bosnia, which were led and supplied by Serbia and Croatia, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|The Bosnian War was an <b>international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> {{that took}} place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between April 1992 and December 1995. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), after popular pressure, had decided to {{intervene}} in the Bosnian War after allegations of war crimes against civilians were made by various media organizations. NATO military involvement primarily involved enforcement of a [...] "No Fly Zone" [...] code named Operation Deny Flight to discourage military aircraft of the Bosnian-Serb Armed Forces from attacking Bosnian civilians and Bosniak and Croat forces. As part of that operation, two F-16s from the 555th Fighter Squadron based at Aviano Air Base, Italy, were patrolling the skies above Bosnia on June 2, 1995.|$|E

2500|$|Israel has {{a policy}} of {{targeted}} killings against those it considers proven to have intentions of performing a specific act of terrorism {{in the very near}} future or to be linked with several acts of terrorism. In 2006, the Supreme Court of Israel issued its judgment in The Public Committee against Torture in Israel v. The Government of Israel. The case addressed the issue of whether the state acts illegally in its policy of targeted killings. The court considered that the legal context is a conflict [...] "of an international character (<b>international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict).</b> Therefore, the law that applies to the armed conflict between Israel and the terrorist organizations is the international law of armed conflicts." [...] The court decided that [...] "members of the terrorist organizations are not combatants [...] They do not fulfill the conditions for combatants under international law" [...] and that [...] "they do not comply with the international laws of war." [...] They concluded that [...] "members of terrorist organizations have the status of civilians" [...] but that [...] "the protection accorded by international law to civilians does not apply at the time during which civilians take direct part in hostilities." [...] They ruled that they could not determine whether targeted killings are always legal or always illegal, but the legality must be established on a case by case basis. Their ruling stated [...] "it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is prohibited according to customary international law, just as it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is permissible according to customary international law. The law of targeted killing is determined in the customary international law, and the legality of each individual such act must be determined in light of it." [...] The judgment included guidelines for permissible and impermissible actions involving targeted killings and provided the conditions for investigating the criminality of some of the actions.|$|E

Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind." [...] POW status under GCIII has far fewer exemptions than [...] "Protected Person" [...] status under GCIV. Captured combatants in an <b>international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> automatically have the protection of GCIII and are POWs under GCIII unless they are determined by a competent tribunal to not be a POW (GCIII Article 5).|$|E

50|$|Historically the law {{of armed}} {{conflict}} only applied to sovereign states. Non-international conflicts were governed by the domestic law of the State concerned.

50|$|Furthermore, many of today’s <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> do {{not take}} place between States but are of a non-international character.

5000|$|In its verdict against Ante Gotovina, the ICTY for {{the first}} time also {{concluded}} that the war in Croatia constituted an <b>international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> as the military of Serbian Krajina acted as an extension to Serbia's military. In particular, the Trial Chamber considered the evidence pertaining to Serbian President Milošević's control and influence over SVK forces and Serbia/FRY's funding, arming and supplying of the Krajina Serbs. Based on the above evidence, the Trial Chamber finds that Serbia/FRY had overall control of the SVK. Recalling the agreement of all the parties that Croatia and Serbia were engaged more broadly in hostilities around the beginning of the Indictment period, the Trial Chamber further finds that the armed conflict that existed {{at the outset of the}} Indictment period was international. If it was not already an <b>international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> in 1991, then it became one based on the SVK acting on behalf of Serbia/FRY ICTY in its verdict against Ante Gotovina ...|$|E
