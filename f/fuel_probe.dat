50|$|The optimal {{approach}} is {{from behind and}} below (not level with) the drogue. Because the drogue is relatively light (typically soft canvas webbing) and subject to aerodynamic forces, it can be pushed around by the bow wave of approaching aircraft, exacerbating engagement even in smooth air. After initial contact, the hose and drogue is pushed forward by the receiver a certain distance (typically, a few feet), and the hose is reeled slowly back onto its drum in the HDU. This opens the tanker's main refueling valve allowing fuel to flow to the drogue under the appropriate pressure (assuming the tanker crew has energized the pump). Tension on the hose is aerodynamically 'balanced' by a motor in the HDU so that as the receiver aircraft moves fore and aft, the hose retracts and extends, thus preventing bends in the hose that would cause undue side loads on the <b>probe.</b> <b>Fuel</b> flow is typically indicated by illumination of a green light near the HDU. If the hose is pushed in too far or not far enough, a cutoff switch will inhibit fuel flow, which is typically accompanied by an amber light.

40|$|New {{in-flight}} fuel {{estimation technique}} for LCA {{has been proposed}} using least square (LS) method. This report contains the details of LS models for aircraft fuel estimation, the procedure for building the LS models and their utilization to estimate the fuel quantity in the internal fuel tanks of LCA from flight data. Initially a set of LS coefficients has been estimated separately for each FCG (<b>Fuel</b> Capacitance Gauging) <b>probes</b> using individual FCG probe count, aircraft accelerations, aircraft attitudes and the reconstructed fuel content time history (of the fuel tank in which the particular probe is located) from the same flight data. Using the estimated LS coefficients, an algorithm ‘FELS’ (Fuel Estimation by Least Squares technique) has been developed in MATLAB to estimate fuel content in the internal tanks of LCA. The performance of the FELS has been verified with 56 different flight data of PV 2, PV 3, LSP 1 and LSP 2 aircraft (flights without drop tanks) and compared with lookup table based estimates, the technique currently being used on LCA.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} one {{sediment}} cores were collected {{to characterize the}} spatial distribution of petroleum hydrocarbons within and just outside Blind Pass, St. Pete Beach, Florida. Twenty-five percent of the cores exhibited levels of petroleum hydrocarbons above detection limits of the gas chromatograph/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) (0. 01 mg/Kg), but at generally low concentrations. Petroleum hydrocarbon speciation studies of these samples (gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy [GC/MS]) indicate above-detection level (1 μg/Kg) petroleum hydrocarbons {{are similar to the}} non-volatile petroleum hydrocarbons found in a Bouchard 155 reference sample collected after the 1993 oil spill in the area, but are in a much degraded and weathered state. Individual petroleum hydrocarbons were, in all but one case, below the threshold effective level (TEL) described in the literature (MacDonald, 1994). The petroleum hydrocarbons were primarily found at 100 - 300 cm depth in Blind Pass cores. Above-detection level petroleum hydrocarbons were generally found in samples from cores {{in the center of the}} channel, near the edges of the shoal, and just outside of Blind Pass. A second mixture of hydrocarbons, primarily phthalates, ketones, and ether, was found at relatively shallow core depths (0 - 99 cm) in the Mid- and North End Channel cores. These suggest a separate source of contamination, possibly storm water runoff. The fuel fluorescence detector (FFD) probe was investigated for its ability to detect petroleum hydrocarbons in marine sediments. When analyzed with the FFD, all sediments from the cores produced peaks of fluorescence, but none above the background levels of Blind Pass native sediments. All but two samples analyzed by GC/FID were below the detection limits (100 ppm) of the FFD. These samples were found in dark-colored sediments. The combination of the detection limits of the instrument, sediment color, and the degraded nature of the heavier weight petroleum hydrocarbons may have resulted in fluorescence outputs below background levels. These studies demonstrate that the distribution of petroleum hydrocarbons within Blind Pass sediments is generally low and patchy. However, 25 % of the cores exhibited levels above detection using GC/FID/MS. These cores could be subjected to individual speciation studies which indicate generally below TEL levels and an association of some, but not all, with the 1993 oil spill in Blind Pass.

40|$|This work investigates {{distinctive}} water distributions in {{the aged}} and fresh GDL {{samples of the}} SGL 29 BC and its forerunner, the SGL 25 BC. In this regard, all the GDL samples are tested in a point injection device during tomographic ex-situ measurements. On the other hand, fresh SGL 25 BC samples at anode and cath-ode of the <b>fuel</b> cell are <b>probed</b> within a <b>fuel</b> cell operation via radiographic in-situ and tomographic quasi in-situ measurements. Through the ex-situ measurements {{the distribution of the}} injected water in the GDL is analyzed in 3 D. Likewise, the distributions of liquid water in the cathodic and anodic GDL are examined in 3 D by the assistance of the quasi in-situ measurements. The in-situ measurements yield the dynamic characteristics of water transport in the fuel cell, so the effect of different electric loads on water formation and water discharge is investigated. At the end, water distribution resulting from the fuel cell operation is compared to the water distribution provided by the point injection device. In the light of the ex-situ measurements, it is found out that the aged SGL 25 BC sample has greater water content than the fresh SGL 25 BC sample. Likewise, the water amount occupying the pore spaces in the aged SGL 29 BC sample is less than the water amount detected in the aged SGL 25 BC sample. The in-situ measurements indicate that water discharge rate reduces if current density is increased such that it pro-vides a transition from the activation polarization zone to the ohmic zone. The quasi in-situ measurements reveal that water amount at cathode is greater than the water amount at anode which is mostly induced by the back diffusion through the polymer electrolyte membrane. Furthermore, water amount underneath the ribs is larger than the water amount under the channel configuration in the anodic GDL. However, water amounts under the channel and ribs do not differ from each other in the cathodic GDL. Based on the point injection test, promising results are achieved to enhance water transport during fuel cell operation. According to these results, the injected water prefers a nearly straight pathway while mi-grating through XY-plane from the MPL zone to the upper water outlet. It means that a limited diffusion in the XY-plane takes place within the water transport, decreasing remaining water content in the GDL. This finding of point injection can be adapted to the fuel cell operation by producing GDLs consisting of elongated pore spaces or elongated holes through XY-plane. By this means, water discharge through the GDL can be accelerated, avoiding water flooding. As a result of this improvement, the efficiency of fuel cell operation is enhanced especially for aged GDL samples in which water accumulations are formed more easily...|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} corrosion of steam superheaters {{is a major}} obstacle {{that has to be}} overcome in order to increase the electricity generating efficiency of power boilers burning biomass or waste. This thesis addresses this issue by a combination of well-controlled model experiments in the laboratory and short and long term field exposures using cooled probes in full-scale biomass and waste fired boilers. The work primarily concerns the effect of alkali salts such as KCl, K 2 CO 3 and K 2 SO 4 on the {{high temperature}} corrosion of 304 L type stainless steel (Fe 18 Cr 10 Ni). 	 	The laboratory experiments show that KCl and K 2 CO 3 strongly accelerate the high temperature corrosion of 304 L steel. The two salts react with the chromium rich oxide on the sample surface, forming K 2 CrO 4. The formation of chromate(VI) is a sink for chromium in the oxide and leads to a loss of its protective properties. This result in rapid oxide growth and the formation of a thick duplex scale consisting of an outer hematite (Fe 2 O 3) layer with scattered potassium chromate particles on top and an inner layer consisting of FeCrNi spinel-type oxide. This scale shows striking similarities with the duplex scale developed on 304 L in O 2 + H 2 O in the absence of salt. This corrosion morphology is referred to as “Type A”. The duplex scale is relatively poorly protective and can be penetrated by chloride ions, resulting in the formation of transition metal chlorides at the metal/oxide interface. In contrast to KCl and K 2 CO 3, K 2 SO 4 does not react with chromium in the oxide to form chromate. This explains why potassium sulphate does not cause accelerated corrosion of 304 L. Exposure in the presence of KCl also resulted in another type of corrosion (“Type B”) with corrosion product agglomerates (mainly iron oxide) forming at the KCl crystallites. The oxide agglomerations are not associated with a localized attack of the steel. Hence, “Type B” corrosion is considered to be of secondary importance. Several field exposures were performed in order to investigate if corrosion in commercial boilers can be mitigated by sulphur-containing additives to the <b>fuel.</b> Using cooled <b>probes,</b> the addition of sulphur was shown to decrease corrosion rate by 50 %. Adding sulphur to the fuel completely suppressed the formation of chromate(VI) and decreased the amount of transition metal chlorides on the samples. The mitigation of corrosion is attributed to the conversion of alkali chloride to alkali sulphate in the flue gas and in the deposits. The results imply that the “chromate formation” mechanism is important for superheater tubes in biomass- and waste- fired boilers...|$|R
40|$|This work builds {{upon the}} {{significant}} contributions of previous researchers to further advance the chirped-probe pulse femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CPP fs CARS) technique. ^ The CPP fs CARS laser system was reconfigured for spectral {{isolation of the}} signal from the CARS input beams. Previously, scatter from the pump beam was frequency degenerate with the signal beam, resulting in signal noise. In preparation for measurements in sooty flames and spray flames, the optical parametric amplifier was reconfigured to output the frequency-doubled idler at 982 nm instead of the doubled signal at 675 nm. The CARS signal, generated at 675 nm, then had complete spectral isolation from the other sources of intense laser radiation. ^ The spectral fitting routine was optimized. Computational processing time for an entire data set previously required several weeks. Using basic estimates {{as well as more}} complicated ultrafast laser measurement techniques, sensible ranges were established for xviii the floating variables in the fitting algorithm used to determine laser parameters which yielded faster and more consistent convergence. A new methodology was developed to directly measure the instrument response function (IRF) of the data acquisition system. This frequency-dependent IRF was applied to each synthetic spectrum prior to fitting with an experimental spectrum. Lastly, the code was modified to allow for batch processing of multiple sets of single-shot signal spectra. ^ Laser parameters are first determined through measurements at known conditions in a nearly-adiabatic flame, and then used in spectral fitting to determine single-shot temperature measurements of experimental data. A new data processing technique, based on the statistical method of maximum likelihood, was developed and implemented to combine results from multiple sets of laser parameters in an error-weighted mean. ^ A new testing protocol, that characterizes measurement performance with randomized validation spectra of known temperature, was performed 25 times over a period of four months. Aggregated results showed mean accuracy and precision of 2. 7 % and ± 3. 5 % across flame temperatures, and 9. 9 % and ± 6. 1 % at room temperature. ^ CPP fs CARS was initially unsuccessful in the highly-luminous ethylene-nitrogen diffusion flame due to the strong background levels. Exploiting the incoherent nature of soot incandescence, a ~ 26 -foot extension was implemented in the signal beam collection path which reduced the recorded background level by ~ 45 %. Single-laser-shot spectra were able to fit for temperature determination, and a full set of radial scans was performed at seven axial locations. This flame was extremely bright and exhibited visibly-unsteady behavior. Analysis of the temperature fields showed increased RMS fluctuation levels, but the average temperature profiles were largely symmetrical. Fourier analysis revealed the presence of coherent structures in the temperature spectrum of all flames, and was attributed to a Kelvin-Helmholtz-type instability driven by density gradients in the shear layer between the pilot flame and coflow. This instability peaked at 3 diameters axially and decayed thereafter in all flames except in the ethylene-nitrogen diffusion flame, where it increased in strength moving radially outward with height. Conjecture offered to explain why the temperature instability seemed to amplify only in xix the diffusion flame, is that the potential for hydrodynamic-thermodynamic coupling is stronger in a diffusion flame compared to a premixed flame. Vorticity and eddies created by a shear layer instability can increase the reaction zone surface area, thereby increasing the rate of heat release. After the OPL extension, the CARS technique was successful in performing single-shot temperature measurements in this highly-luminous flame. ^ CPP fs CARS was demonstrated {{for the first time in}} spray flames. The Sydney Needle Spray Burner (SYNSBURN™) produced acetone and ethanol spray flames of variable density and fuel loading using. Radial and axial probe volume locations were chosen targeting the region where the coaxial pilot ignites and anchors the spray flame. The CPP fs CARS technique was most successful in the dilute spray flames. Signal dropout was most severe on centerline, but typically below 10 % on average. Examples of interferences from hydrocarbon <b>fuel</b> in the <b>probe</b> volume are presented. The interferences were attributed to two separate phenomena and categorized based on the probable phase of the fuel—liquid or gas. Interference caused by liquid fuel was considered unavoidable, but easily identified because the spectra could not be analyzed. Interference from vapor fuel was more problematic as the nitrogen signal was only moderately corrupted in the high-frequency region. The spectra could be fit but temperature was over predicted. Rejecting individual signal spectra, based on a fitting error threshold, was shown effective in excluding shots with significant interference from fuel droplets, but shots with only minor interference would require a more-advanced rejection criterion. Analysis of the temperature fields shows that the spray flames with a higher degree of fuel atomization are effectively ignited and anchored by the pilot. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) ...|$|R
