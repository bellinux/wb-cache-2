However, its Cu-dotted surface morphology allowed the Cu-dotted oxide surface to be more antibacterial than the smooth Cu plate surface. The enhanced antibacterial property was attributed to the superhydrophilic behaviour of the Cu-dotted oxide surface that allowed the bacteria to have a more effective killing contact with Cu due to spreading of the bacterial suspension media.

To more clearly express these mostly electrochemical fuel-cycles, a thermodynamic reaction model was contrived. To investigate the electrolytic reverse hydrolysis hypothesis, attempts were made to prepare metal-supported, electrolytic reverse hydrolysis anode compartments. The glycine nitrate process facilitated the synthesis of nickel iron oxide (anode) and select doped ceria fluorite and double-doped LaGaO 3 perovskite (solid oxygen anion electrolytes) powders. Hydridic electrolyte compositions belonging to the Na 2 BH 5 -Na 413205 quasi-binary system were synthesized from NaH, NaBH 4 and NaB 02. Analyses for the materials' compatibilities and solubilities studies (823 + 10 °K, 1. 00 f 0. 01 MPa) included induction coupled plasma, inert x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. NaH reduces magnetite to austenite; hence, the most promising solid oxygen anion electrolyte, Lao 7 Sro 3 GauFeo 3 Mgo 103. 6 (LSGFM), cannot be in direct contact with these hydridic electrolytes. The other oxides of Lao 8 Sro 2 Ga 08 Mg 0203. 6 are significantly soluble in these melts, but either a quenching or an electrochemical technique will be required to more accurately assess their values. For the preparation of small, metal-supported, electrolytic reverse hydrolysis anode compartments, suspension plasma spraying was used for the depositions of the anode and solid oxygen anion electrolyte layers. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction were used for the analyses of the resultant coatings' characteristics. In consequence of LSGFM's remarkable specific conductivity at — 673 °K, a solid oxygen anion electrolyte-supported, electrolytic reverse combustion or electrolytic reverse hydrolysis anode compartment design may be considered, but this will require the addition of a protective, solid oxygen anion electrolyte layer.

Due to the strong oxidizing potential of the chemicals produced (chlorine, oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and other oxidants), the organic pollutants were wet oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.

Electrolytic etching in a 2 : 1 mixture {{of alcohol and}} 40 % HF is mainly used for the delineation of p+p- and n+n- junct ions and for those p-n junctions where both sides are very lightly doped. The delineation which is accomplished partly by surface attack and partly by sLaining may be markedly enhanced by a subsequent oxidation. Thus, the combination of <b>electrolytic</b> etch-ing and <b>oxidation</b> {{has been found to}} be successful for the delineation of all junctions of practical interest. Furthermore, the existence of doping inhomogeneities can be revealed by this technique. Figure 3 shows an angle lap of an n-type pitaxial SiC layer on an n-type substrate. It is clearly seen that there are impurity striations in the substrate whereas the doping of the epitaxial layer is uniform. In conclusion, it can be stated that the thermal oxidation of silicon carbide is a useful tool for polytype discrimination. An unambiguous determination of the polytype (6 H or 15 R), however, is possible only in those cases where the dependence of the oxidation rate on the conductivity type and the doping level is neg-ligible or can be taken into account properly. The electrolytic etching technique serves for the delineation of impurity concentration gradients. A combination of both methods often provides an enhanced contrast. Fig. 3.

40|$|A new {{strategy}} of confined etchant layer technique (CELT) for the micropatterning of Nafion film was described and tested. The local decomposition of polymer is realized {{by using an}} electrochemically combined chemical system to ignite and scavenge the radical reaction of polymer. For micropatterning, a copper mold is employed as the working electrode in a three-electrode cell that also contains a reference electrode and a counter electrode. Whereas the mold electrode is naturally placed on a Nafion film/glassy carbon (GC) sheet workpiece, the self-weight of the mold electrode and the soft feature of Nafion film result in a tight contact between the electrode and film. When the mold is electrochemically oxidized, the GC sheet works as a bipolar electrode in this electrochemical system. The GC sheet surface close to the mold acts as the cathode of a thin-layer electrolytic cell that has contained the mold anode and Nafion electrolyte. The rest of GC surface as the anode of bipolar electrode forms another cell with the counter electrode in bulk solution. In the thin-layer <b>electrolytic</b> cell, the <b>oxidation</b> dissolution and the reduction deposition of metal copper simultaneously occur. Specially, the deposited metal can be re-oxidized after growing up to contact with the mold anode, so as {{to result in a}} redox cycle of metal copper within Nafion film. When an additional copper sheet contacts with the GC sheet to undertake the anode function of GC bipolar electrode, the redox cycle can be conveniently established at the low potential and cause the large current. Importantly, this redox cycle enables to maintain the decomposition of Nafion via radical intermediates, but the radical reactions can be controllably interrupted by using 4 -amino- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) as a radical scavenger. For Nafion film containing TEMPO, the decomposition of polymer is confined within a very thin layer around the mold surface. This novel method allows us to etch micropatterns with no need of any distance-adjustment equipment, which {{plays a key role in}} current micropatterning technologies such as scanning electrochemical microscope. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the EC process, the coagulant is generated in situ by <b>electrolytic</b> <b>oxidation</b> of an appropriate anode material.
