5|$|The <b>Interview</b> <b>was</b> not {{released}} in Japan, as live-action comedy films do not often perform {{well in the}} market. In the Asia-Pacific region, it was released only in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin {{had hoped}} to read Classics at Merton College, Oxford, but the end of National Service in the United Kingdom meant there was more {{competition}} for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered—an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya. Instead, Chatwin's father asked one of his clients for a letter of introduction to the auction house Sotheby's. An <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.|$|E
5|$|In February 1935, at Bridge's instigation, Britten {{was invited}} to a job {{interview}} by the BBC's director of music Adrian Boult and his assistant Edward Clark. Britten was not enthusiastic {{about the prospect of}} working full-time in the BBC music department and was relieved when what came out of the <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> an invitation to write the score for a documentary film, The King's Stamp, directed by Alberto Cavalcanti for the GPO Film Unit.|$|E
50|$|No <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> required, {{although}} <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> {{offered and}} can help.|$|R
30|$|All of the <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> recorded. In four cases, <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} by two interviewers, allowing field note comparison to aid understanding and internal {{validity of the}} study. In all other cases, <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> undertaken by the same single interviewer. The researchers followed an iterative approach to data collection (Strauss and Corbin, 1990), jointly reflecting on each interview before subsequent <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> undertaken.|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} {{interviewing}} in the PSID {{has changed over}} time. Until 1972, <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> done in person using paper, but after 1973 phone <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> used. Starting in 1993, <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone (CAT) technology.|$|R
5|$|In May 2006, The Sunday Business Post {{reported}} that Steorn {{was a former}} dot-com company which was developing a microgenerator product {{based on the same}} principle as self-winding watches, as well as creating e-commerce websites for customers. The company had also recently raised about €2.5 million from investors and was three years into a four-year development plan for its microgenerator technology. Steorn later stated that the account given in this <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> intended to prevent a leak regarding their free energy technology.|$|E
5|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, the three judges {{decided that the}} appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed instanter– at once), {{on the basis that}} the 8March 2003 <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> not voluntary and so was inadmissible, and by admitting it the trial judge had made an error of law resulting in a miscarriage of justice.|$|E
5|$|Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, {{formed an}} action group, later {{to be called}} the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of {{progress}} in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman. Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and Boys' Brigade officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> cancelled. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama and the ensuing Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.|$|E
30|$|Participant <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} between December 2012 and February 2014. <b>Interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{performed in}} a quiet, closed room in a hospital or hotel, with no other person present. Participants <b>were</b> <b>interviewed</b> once, with interviews lasting 50 – 90  min. The six semi-structured <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> based on a loose structure comprising open-ended questions, and were conducted according to the methodological orientation of Sandelowski (2000). <b>Interviews</b> <b>were</b> face-to-face and performed by a professional interviewer who first introduced herself and obtained written informed consent.|$|R
50|$|A couple {{interview}} (or joint couple interview, or {{more broadly}} conjoint interview, joint interview or dyadic <b>interview)</b> <b>is</b> {{a method of}} qualitative research used in the social sciences, where two spouses <b>are</b> <b>interviewed</b> together. Such an <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> typically semi-structured or unstructured. Couple <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> important in household research, often from a psychological, sociological, anthropological or social geographical perspective, and are also frequently used within health research. A couple <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> a form of joint interviewing (interviews involving two interviewees), {{the subject of a}} growing methodological research literature.|$|R
50|$|The {{reference}} <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> {{structured to}} help the librarian provide answers to the library user. In general, the <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> composed of the following stages.|$|R
5|$|In October 1971, the {{journalist}} Numa Sadoul conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, {{in which the}} latter opened up about {{many of the problems}} he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> published as Tintin et moi ("Tintin and I") in 1975. Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, Moi, Tintin ("I, Tintin"), which premiered in 1975.|$|E
5|$|King Philip, who {{ascended the}} Spanish throne in 1556, {{acknowledged}} {{the new political}} reality and cultivated his sister-in-law. She was a better ally than the chief alternative, Mary, Queen of Scots, {{who had grown up}} in France and was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, King Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult with Elizabeth. This <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> conducted at Hatfield House, where she had returned to live in October 1555. By October 1558, Elizabeth was already making plans for her government. On 6 November, Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir. On 17 November 1558, Mary died and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{spent her}} days writing; her main project {{was a book}} about Henry Morton Stanley and his search for Emin Pasha, but she also {{maintained}} an intimate correspondence with Stevie Smith, which was full of Bloomsbury gossip and intrigue. She undertook a dangerous journalistic assignment to interview the former Romanian Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu in Cluj, Transylvania, at the time full of German troops, and soon to be transferred by Romania to Hungary {{as part of the}} Second Vienna Award of August 1940, imposed by the Germans and Italians. Like many of her experiences, the <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> to be incorporated into a future work; others included her impromptu baptism of Reggie with cold tea because she feared being separated from him after death, and Reggie's production of a Shakespeare play, in which she was promised a prime role that was given to another.|$|E
30|$|All <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{recorded}} and transcribed. We also took notes about participants’ reactions to specific questions. The <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted {{according to the}} availability of the participants.|$|R
30|$|The {{pilot study}} began by formulating the main {{research}} themes, which {{were derived from}} the project’s strategic goals. These themes were used during the pilot interview round. In thematic <b>interviews</b> there <b>were</b> 14 experts who <b>were</b> <b>interviewed.</b> All the <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> performed face to face. Pilot <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> summarized and reported in a memo document.|$|R
50|$|Applications for The Amazing Race 6 {{were due}} on April 13, 2004. Semi-finalist <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> held in May 2004 and final casting <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}} at Los Angeles in June 2004.|$|R
5|$|Rob Van Dam (RVD) and Bill Alfonso {{interrupted}} the promo, with RVD stating {{it had nothing}} to do with SmackDown!. RVD claimed that WWE deserved no credit, that the <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> a shoot with no scripts, and that missing One Night Stand was worse than missing WrestleMania. The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights turning off, and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through a table for the victory.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> videotaped, at the {{beginning}} of the second interview, Lyons said that he wanted video recording to be stopped. It has been alleged that the decision to terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview. A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record, including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue. As the interview continued, Lyons was asked if he wanted to make a formal statement, to which he agreed. This statement contains a number of points about the killings that were not known to the public at the time. Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in the first interview are not included in the statement, although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|The British {{television}} {{premiere of}} the video was extremely controversial. The video had not been ready when the track debuted in the UK singles chart. By {{the time it was}} finalised, the track had dropped in the chart. McCartney flew to London to premiere the video on the BBC1 TV show Top Of The Pops, but the show had a strict policy that no single that had dropped in position could feature on the programme and refused to show it. A furious argument ensued, with claims McCartney threatened to withdraw all his music from the corporation. As a compromise, the BBC offered to air the video two days later on The Late, Late Breakfast Show hosted by Noel Edmonds, a variety show that featured live music performances, but rarely aired videos. They agreed to show it on the programme only if McCartney appeared live and gave an interview. He reluctantly agreed and appeared with his wife Linda live on the show on Saturday, 29 October 1983; his first live UK TV appearance since 1973. The <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> stilted and the McCartneys made little or no effort to answer any of Edmonds' questions. After some reportedly hostile negotiations, the programme's entire show was built around the 'medicine men' theme of the video and the guest who had been booked to appear that week Olivia Newton John had to agree to appear to promote the video in a skit, reportedly against her will and she expressed anger at having her 'starring' role in the show downgraded into a lesser guest spot {{to make way for the}} video and McCartney. The airing of the video on this highly rated show was successful as the track climbed back up the chart the following week and aired on Top Of The Pops on Thursday, 4 November 1983.|$|E
50|$|The <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> {{the section}} on the show when the {{politicians}} or other invited characters appear. It is often the longest part of the show, but some <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> really short.|$|R
50|$|The Stokes <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> a {{secondary}} <b>interview</b> conducted {{on a couple}} {{who are trying to}} obtain an immigration green card in the United States {{on the basis of their}} marriage. It occurs when the immigration officer conducting the adjustment of status interview suspects that a couple's marital status is fraudulent. The Stokes <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> offered as a second chance for the couple to prove their marriage's legitimacy. What separates the Stokes interview from the initial adjustment of status <b>interview,</b> which <b>is</b> usually the only interview necessary in the process, is that during the Stokes <b>interview</b> couples <b>are</b> <b>interviewed</b> separately instead of together. The two <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> recorded and compared for discrepancies. Applicants have a right to have an attorney present throughout both separate interviews. The Stokes <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes known as a marriage fraud interview.|$|R
50|$|Each show {{typically}} {{consists of}} two guests. Harris interviews her guests in person. Most of her <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> conducted in a studio in New York City, but some are recorded “on the road” while Jessica is traveling to another state or country. On occasion, <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> remotely recorded. The style of the <b>interviews</b> <b>is</b> very conversational. Guests paint a personal picture of their experiences through anecdotes.|$|R
25|$|The whole <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on July 17, the release {{date of the}} album.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{a half-hour}} radio <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> aired in which Noten {{discusses}} his monograph with Brett Littman, {{the director of}} The Drawing Center art museum in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Jericho {{was also}} the first wrestler {{attached}} and interviewed for the wrestling documentary, Bloodstained Memoirs. The <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> recorded in the UK during a Fozzy tour in 2006.|$|E
50|$|In general {{clinical}} practice with assessment of personality disorders, {{one form of}} <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> the most popular; an unstructured interview. The actual preferred method <b>is</b> a semi-structured <b>interview</b> but there <b>is</b> reluctance to use this type of interview because they can seem impractical or superficial. The reason that a semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> preferred over an unstructured <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> that semi-structured <b>interviews</b> tend to <b>be</b> more objective, systematic, replicable, and comprehensive.Unstructured interviews, despite their popularity, tend to have problems with unreliability and are susceptible to errors leading to false assumptions of the client.|$|R
30|$|The <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> semistructured {{covering}} {{issues related}} to the different phases of the care process and how they were experienced, what kind of support and guidance would have been necessary in each phase and also about the changes in lifestyle after getting sick. The <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted by nursing students and therefore the <b>interview</b> form <b>was</b> detailed to guarantee consistent interviews with several student interviewers. The students made notes either on paper or directly to an electronic form. None of the <b>interviews</b> <b>was</b> recorded nor transcribed verbatim.|$|R
30|$|Semi-structured <b>{{interviews}}</b> <b>were</b> also conducted, {{but these}} interviews {{differed from the}} interviews given after the first survey, in that these <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> only given {{to those who had}} used the mobile and ubiquitous system. In addition, these interviews differed as they were aimed at gathering qualitative data surrounding the use of the ubiquitous system itself, whereas the first round of semi-structured <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> aimed at understanding acculturation difficulties in more depth.|$|R
25|$|On 31 March, IAEA {{corrected}} {{the value}} of iodine-131 that had been detected in the Iitate village to 20millionBq/m2. The value that had been announced at a press <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> about 2millionBq/m2.|$|E
25|$|A short video <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} at the Design Miami 2008 exhibition. Noten explains {{how some of}} his most famous works came about and that his intuition {{plays an important role in}} the creative process.|$|E
25|$|An {{oral history}} <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} with Germer on {{his experience as}} a United Auto Workers organizer in 1959. That material rests at the Reuther Library of Wayne State University, located in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E
30|$|Cognitive {{debriefing}} <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted during}} a single RSV season in 2014. The majority of <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted via telephone {{to allow for}} expedited recruitment, minimize the time before interview, and to accommodate scheduling requests from caregiver participants. Transcripts from both <b>interview</b> modes <b>were</b> compared in terms of {{quantity and quality of}} the data collected.|$|R
50|$|Telephone <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> often {{conducted}} by employers {{in the initial}} interview round of the hiring process, this type of interview allows an employer to screen candidates on the candidates experience, qualifications, and salary expectations pertaining to the position and the company. The telephone interview saves the employers' time and eliminates candidates that are unlikely to meet the company’s expectations. Employers tend to perform telephone interviews as a structured <b>interview.</b> The questions <b>are</b> custom tailored to meet the position in question. With the telephone interview {{there may not be}} direct contact between the employer and employee, however, the expectations are still there. Telephone <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> scheduled and questions are generally prepared in advance, similar to the way other <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> conducted. Another common reason a company looks to the telephone <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> that these <b>interviews</b> can <b>be</b> conducted on-the-fly. The interviewer does not have to assign company resources to the phone <b>interview.</b> It <b>is</b> a cost-effective method to short-list candidates for the position being interviewed for.|$|R
30|$|Semi-structured <b>interview</b> {{guidelines}} <b>were</b> used {{to collect}} the data of the four habitual entrepreneurs. <b>Interviews</b> <b>were</b> also carried out with people within their social environment, and their observations were supplemented and verified using secondary data, e.g., newspaper articles and information from the internet (following Eisenhardt 1989). Overall, 36 <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted over a 1 -year period.|$|R
