5|$|Wind <b>dispersal</b> of seeds, or anemochory, {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{primitive}} means of <b>dispersal.</b> Wind <b>dispersal</b> can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these <b>dispersal</b> mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind <b>dispersal</b> is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this <b>dispersal</b> mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced <b>dispersal</b> capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind <b>dispersal</b> is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind <b>dispersal</b> include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, the ABA–NBA merger {{saw those}} two rival leagues join forces. Four ABA teams joined the NBA; the {{remaining}} teams were dissolved and their players distributed among the remaining NBA squads in a <b>dispersal</b> draft.

5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind. The general wind {{circulation}} moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in <b>dispersal</b> of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed <b>dispersal</b> in plants, it provides <b>dispersal</b> for {{a large percentage of the}} biomass of land plants.|$|E

5|$|Many {{tropical}} {{tree species}} have seeds that are dispersed by ants. Seed <b>dispersal</b> by ants or myrmecochory is widespread and new estimates suggest that nearly 9% of all plant species may have such ant associations. Some plants in fire-prone grassland systems are particularly dependent on ants for their survival and <b>dispersal</b> as the seeds are transported to safety below the ground. Many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.|$|E
5|$|Several species show clumped distributions. <b>Dispersal</b> {{limitation}} {{has been}} invoked {{to explain the}} clumped distribution of adults and limited recruitment of seedlings in both A.erinacea in Ecuador and A.minima in Puerto Rico.

5|$|Some bioluminous {{bacteria}} infect nematodes that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may attract predators to {{the dead}} insect thus assisting in the <b>dispersal</b> of both bacteria and nematodes. A similar reason {{may account for the}} many species of fungi that emit light. Species in the genera Armillaria, Mycena, Omphalotus, Panellus, Pleurotus and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium, cap and gills. This may attract night-flying insects and aid in spore <b>dispersal,</b> but other functions may also be involved.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1990s, Foley has {{collaborated with}} Marta Mirazón Lahr on {{research}} {{relating to the}} evolution of modern humans and their diversity.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the environmental context of human <b>dispersals</b> into Asia up to 0. 5 mya. These <b>dispersals</b> were probably intermittent, often discontinuous, and initially confined to warm grasslands and open woodlands across southern Asia. During the Early Pleistocene, {{the effects of}} the uplift of Tibet and the inception of the monsoon were muted by the low-amplitude nature of northern hemisphere glaciations. By the Middle Pleistocene, further uplift, stronger monsoonal circulation, and higher-amplitude, glacial-interglacial cycles made much of Southwest and Central Asia more arid than previously. Two other Mid-Pleistocene developments were important: first, the appearance of Acheulean assemblages, possibly as far east as southern China; and secondly, the first appearance of hominids at latitudes 40 - 45 ° N during interglacial episodes. Hominid <b>dispersals</b> in both Europe and Asia were probably broadly similar in that hominids did not habitually live beyond 40 ° N until c. 500 kya. Rather than dividing Asia longitudinally into areas east or west of the Movius line, latitudinal divisions between warm/hot and cool/cold environments might be more appropriate.

50|$|Anthropologists in the 1980s {{were divided}} {{regarding}} {{some details of}} reproductive barriers and migratory <b>dispersals</b> of the Homo genus. Subsequently, genetics {{has been used to}} investigate and resolve these issues. According to the Sahara pump theory evidence suggests that genus Homo have migrated out of Africa at least three and possibly four times (e.g. Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis and two or three times for Homo sapiens). Recent evidence suggests these <b>dispersals</b> are closely related to fluctuating periods of climate change.|$|R

5|$|In 1949, the British {{botanist}} E. J. H. Corner published The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree. His {{theory was}} that endozoochory (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of seed <b>dispersal,</b> and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that <b>dispersal</b> method, in particular red durian (D. dulcis) exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.|$|E
