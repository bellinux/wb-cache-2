5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|The 1910Cuba hurricane, {{popularly known}} as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the United States in October1910. It formed in the southern Caribbean on October9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October16, corresponding to Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeastern United States on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> to sea.|$|E

5|$|When growing {{conditions}} improve, {{such as the}} arrival of warmer weather and the longer days associated with spring in temperate regions, growth starts again. The expanding shoot pushes <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> shedding the scales in the process. These leave behind scars {{on the surface of}} the twig. The whole year's growth may take place in just a few weeks. The new stem is unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms) have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk. In some tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a Lammas growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss of early foliage to insect predators.|$|E
5|$|Different {{units of}} the {{regiment}} were stationed at other forts throughout the island {{under the command of}} William P. Burnham. Lieutenant Teófilo Marxuach, the officer of the day, was stationed at El Morro Castle at San Juan Bay on 21 March 1915. The Odenwald, built in 1903 (not {{to be confused with the}} German World War II war ship which carried the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the San Juan Bay and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship from the walls of the fort. Sergeant Encarnación Correa then manned a machine gun and fired warning shots with little effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} French and Spanish fleet under Villeneuve's command numbered 33 {{ships of}} the line. Napoleon Bonaparte had intended for Villeneuve to sail into the English Channel {{and cover the}} planned invasion of Britain, but the entry of Austria and Russia into the war forced Napoleon to call off the planned invasion and transfer troops to Germany. Villeneuve had been reluctant to risk an engagement with the British, and this reluctance led Napoleon to order Vice Admiral François Rosily to go to Cádiz and take command of the fleet, sail it into the Mediterranean to land troops at Naples, before making port at Toulon. Villeneuve decided to sail the fleet out before his successor arrived. On 20 October 1805, the fleet was sighted making <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of harbour by patrolling British frigates, and Nelson was informed that {{they appeared to be}} heading to the west.|$|E

5|$|The natives {{launched}} a furious mass assault against Santa María de Comayagua. The depleted garrison fought <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> {{under cover of}} night and {{set out on a}} desperate march to Gracias a Dios, leaving the town to be sacked – not even the livestock were spared. All across the province the Spanish were short of soldiers, arms and supplies, except at the Peñol de Cerquín, which remained the focus of Spanish attention. In {{a very short period of}} time, Spanish control had collapsed across Honduras; only two small Spanish pockets remained – at Gracias and San Pedro. Montejo sent Gonzalo de Alvarado to San Salvador to seek assistance, which was readily supplied in the form of 100 Indian auxiliaries, 1000 Indian carriers, livestock, arquebuses, crossbows, gunpowder, ammunition, shields, spears, armour and iron. Further supplies were forthcoming from San Miguel, but similar requests sent to Guatemala were largely rebuffed, as a response to Montejo's policies which were perceived as undermining the rights of Guatemalan colonists.|$|E
5|$|The two routes {{serve as}} Oneonta's main street, {{following}} Chestnut and Main streets across the city's western and central areas. Along the way, NY7 and NY23 pass Hartwick College and serve Oneonta's central business district. NY23 breaks from NY7 just northeast of downtown to follow James F. Lettis Highway, a four-lane divided highway, south into the southern {{half of the}} city. As it heads south on the arterial, it connects to Interstate88 (I-88) at an interchange on the northern bank of the Susquehanna River. NY28—which overlaps with I-88 from Oneonta to exit17 northeast of the city—leaves the freeway here, following NY23 across the river to a large commercial district on the south bank. NY28 leaves NY23 here to proceed to the southwest while NY23 goes eastward past several large strip malls and big-box retailers on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of both Oneonta and Otsego County.|$|E
5|$|Within Wayne County, {{the area}} around NY21 becomes more {{developed}} as it enters the village of Palmyra, where the road is village-maintained from the southern village line to its junction with NY31 in the village's historic center. The route briefly overlaps NY31 along East Main Street before crossing both the Erie Canal and the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the village. From Palmyra to Williamson, the land surrounding NY21 is predominantly rural in nature. However, midway between the two locations, NY21 comes close to the hamlet of Marion, which it bypasses to the west. In Williamson, NY21 passes through the town center at a junction with Ridge Road before ending at an intersection with NY104 in a more commercial section of the town.|$|E

5|$|Jones and Mutt are {{captured}} by Mac and the Soviets {{and taken to}} their camp in the Amazon jungle, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood, who reveals that Mutt is Jones' son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power, and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his four allies escape with the skull, but Marion and Jones get caught into a dry sandpit, to be recaptured by the Soviets after Oxley accidentally brings them as assistance. On their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a CIA double-agent to regain Jones' trust, and Jones' team fights <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by siafu ants. Jones and his allies cause many of the Soviets to fall from a cliff, and they survive three waterfalls in an amphibious vehicle. Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent, is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{introduce}} and map the specific professional operation of the Crisis Center for children and a family {{in the framework of}} post-divorce care { [...] } so called assisted meetings. The assisted meetings represent after-divorce-coming together of the child and the parent with whom the household is not shared and with whom the contact does not work for some reasons. The target of these meetings is to help to renew, establish or deepen the relationship between the child and the parent. The theoretical part is about the divorce and its consequences. In the practical part, the secondary analysis of data was used. It brings the knowledge of the characteristics of the families, who cooperated with the Crisis Center in the framework of the assisted meetings.
