If we voluntarily place road-racing under police control, we sign its death warrant.... If we are to race on the road, for heaven's sake let us do it as free citizens, and not by permission of the police.|$|E
2500|$|Boll {{does not}} {{shy away from}} his critics. In the Alone in the Dark DVD commentary, he {{responds}} to criticism that his adaptations make significant changes to the plot and style of the source material: [...] "Fans are always totally flipping out and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fan of a video game has his own agenda {{in his head and}} has his ideas about what is a good movie and what is a bad movie." [...] Referring to House of the Dead, Boll said: [...] "I think I made a perfect House of the Dead movie, because it really shows how the game is. It's a lot of fun, it's over-the-top action." [...] Boll is especially critical of his Internet detractors. Referring to two Ain't It Cool News critics who negatively reviewed his work, Boll said, [...] "Harry (Knowles) and Quint (Eric Vespe) are retards." [...] Boll later claimed Knowles was being [...] "played" [...] by film studios that [...] "kissed his ass" [...] with set visits and pretend offers to produce large-budget films and suggested to Knowles the reason he did not like him was because, [...] "I never kissed your ass, Harry." ...|$|E

60|$|A fourth figure leaped nimbly in and aided me {{in closing}} <b>the</b> door, {{therefore}} <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{game at the}} Bridewell had been played without an error, for it could be none other than Silas Brownrigg who followed Hiram so closely.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said that}} a wind was blowing and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shores are sandy, so I suppose that all {{footprints}} would have been filled in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For myself I {{have little}} faith," [...] Fischer observed, [...] "in any new explosives. In Germany they believe, <b>I</b> <b>understand,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> limit of destructiveness has been attained." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had I six sisters I {{could be}} solitary no where," [...] said Katherine, simply; [...] "besides, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country where Mr. Miller resides is {{beautiful}} and populous." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{was told}} {{directly}} by Shiro Ishii of the kamikaze mission [...] "Cherry Blossoms at Night", which was named by Ishii himself. I {{was a leader}} of a squad of seventeen. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mission was to spread contaminated fleas in the enemy's base and contaminate them with plague.|$|R
60|$|Even as I {{fought with}} my adversary <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English officer, and, probably, the miller, aroused by {{the noise of}} the scrimmage, were coming to the rescue, and the thought flashed through my mind that in a few moments more the battle would be decided in favor of his majesty's forces.|$|R
60|$|The firemen were on deck waiting, apparently, to be drowned. The {{engineer}} {{came and}} dragged them below, and the crew, gasping, {{began to work}} the clumsy Board of Trade pump. That showed nothing serious, and when <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rathmines was really on the water, and not beneath it, I asked what had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Forrester, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lady has always {{expressed}} herself {{as being in}} favour of a single life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are variable, then? That is {{distinctly}} curious, because--but do <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> type of the delusion varies? For example, Mr. Sargent {{believes that}} he can buy the Great Buchonian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Kenge," [...] said Allan, {{appearing}} enlightened {{all in a}} moment. [...] "Excuse me, {{our time}} presses. Do <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> whole estate is found to have been absorbed in costs?" ...|$|E
60|$|At almost <b>the</b> {{same instant}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure}} {{began to be}} painful, before a single cry had been uttered by my assailant, a second shock was felt by me, while the weight which pressed {{me down to the}} earth was increased, and dimly <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sergeant had leaped upon the back of him who was strangling me.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{of which}} means what?" [...] Saul demanded, and <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lad's heart was heavy, for {{within the hour}} he had been crowded against the wall, and a red-coated captain of the Foot had shaken him soundly {{because he did not}} give way to the swaggerers who had come into Virginia to teach us manners.|$|R
60|$|After a time, {{and it was}} {{impossible}} for me to decide whether I had remained on watch one hour or two, a tiny gleam of light could be seen in the direction where I knew the prisoners were stationed, and as it increased in size <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> brutes were making ready for their horrible sport.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{these are}} your quarters,' he said. 'You do {{yourself}} pretty well, young man. So <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Nugget has gone wrong in transit. He has altered his plans on the way?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Mr. Barclay. [...] "If my opinion's of any value, I don't {{think it}} would be wise. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> best time for getting a shot at {{flighting}} ducks is in the twilight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt sure}} that you would not," [...] Borrowdean answered.

60|$|He {{had hardly}} more than ceased {{speaking}} when a great uproar could be heard from the distance, and, without turning my head, <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British regulars and the Johnson Greens were pressing {{the attack on the}} west and the front, in order to hold our men at <b>the</b> walls <b>that</b> we {{might not be able to}} regain possession of the stockade.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is Bulcester, then, such an intemperate constituency? <b>I</b> had <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Nonconformist {{interest}} was strong there,' said Merton.|$|R
60|$|SMITH. But <b>I</b> do <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Duke's nephew and niece see witches and fairies {{between here}} and your lamp.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No {{matter at}} all; but now <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boy, sure of Paradise, can yet enter Government service, {{my mind is}} easier. I must get to my horses. It grows dark. Do not wake him. I have no wish to hear him call thee master.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{say that}} I {{think you have}} made an awkward mistake, Miss Layard.

6000|$|... "Very soon indeed," [...] Prince Maiyo answered. [...] "Next week I {{go down to}} Devenham. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister and Sir Edward Bransome will be there.

5000|$|According to Zeevi, a {{personal}} meeting with Hitler's former secretary, Traudl Junge, in 1999, triggered the film. He said: [...] "When I {{sat in front}} of her <b>I</b> suddenly <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> need to try and <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> evil <b>that</b> led to <b>the</b> horrors of the Holocaust {{was an integral part of}} <b>the</b> narrative. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dialogue with the 'other side' can teach us many new things on the fertile ground on which the hatred grew and in parallel convey a message of hope for the future". He said he hoped to provoke discussion of the Holocaust [...] "in an intelligent manner and from a new point of view" [...] and to [...] "provide an indisputable answer to Holocaust deniers".|$|R
60|$|While {{one might}} have counted fifty I stood dazed, unable to {{understand}} what had happened, and bleeding from a dozen scratches caused {{by the fall of}} fragments which absolutely covered the deck of the pungy to a depth of two or three inches. Then <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fort had been blown up, Captain Dyson believing he could not hope, with the small force under his command, to withstand an assault from the fleet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very soon <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man {{was running}} with a {{definite}} object {{and to a}} definite point; {{he was trying to}} reach the river. I thought the sight very pitiful, this one poor creature being hunted to death by so many. Also I wondered why he did not free himself from the bundle on his back, and came to <b>the</b> conclusion <b>that</b> he must be a witch-doctor, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bundle contained his precious charms or medicines.|$|R
6000|$|No hurry whatever, my dear hostess. Gad, we've {{enough to}} talk about!

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> General {{will not}} be {{responsible}} in any way for any loss I may suffer in consequence of being dismissed from Training; as I am aware that the Cadets are received into Training for the very purpose of testing their suitability {{for the work of}} Salvation Army Officers.|$|E
60|$|I {{got your}} letter sent to Gad's Hill this morning. Until I {{received}} it, I supposed the piece {{to have been}} put into English from your French by young Ben.

60|$|I walked {{sometimes}} in the Mall with my woman Amy, but I kept no company and made no acquaintances, only made as gay a show as I was able to do, and that upon all occasions. I found, however, the world was not altogether so unconcerned about me as I seemed to be about them; and first <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> neighbours began to be mighty inquisitive about me, as who I was, and what my circumstances were.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] Mr. Sabin said. [...] "I {{scarcely}} thought <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{society was}} by no means in its former flourishing condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pratt," [...] he said, [...] "am <b>I</b> to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{greeting}} {{which you}} {{offered to the}} occupants of this carriage, when you entered, was intended to include me?" ...|$|R
