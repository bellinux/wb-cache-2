5|$|Despite initial {{difficulties}} {{in finding a}} producer willing {{to take charge of}} the debut album of a newly signed band, Don Gilmore ultimately agreed to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> project, with Andy Wallace hired as the mixer. Recording sessions, which mostly involved re-recording the songs off the demo tape, began at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California in early 2000 and lasted four weeks. Shinoda's rapping sections in most of the songs were significantly altered from the original, while most choruses remained largely unchanged. Due to the absence of Dave Farrell and Kyle Christener, {{who took part in the}} 1999 extended play, the band hired Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck as stand-in bassists; Delson also played bass throughout most of the album. The Dust Brothers provided additional beats for the track “With You”.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1953 and February 1954, the RAAF {{underwent}} major organisational change, as it transitioned from a geographically based command-and-control {{system to}} {{one based on}} function, resulting {{in the establishment of}} Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. At the same time, RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne was absorbed by the Department of Air in Canberra. Hely was acting Air Member for Personnel from 3January to 7March 1955, between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Val Hancock and Fred Scherger. On 24January 1956, he became AOC Training Command, taking over from Air Vice Marshal Murdoch. He was succeeded as DCAS by Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy. Hely's rank of air vice marshal became substantive on 5September. In January 1957, Point Cook retired its last de Havilland Tiger Moth trainers, signalling the end of the biplane era in the RAAF. That May, Hely was seconded to the Department of Defence and posted to Washington,D.C., to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Australian Joint Services Staff.

25|$|Custer's younger brother, Captain Tom Custer, spurred {{his horse}} over a hastily thrown up {{barricade}} of the still deploying Confederate cavalry and captured 3 Confederate officers and 11 enlisted men, {{as well as}} the battle flag of the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry, for which he received the Medal of Honor. Barringer's Confederate cavalry had bought enough time for Major General Bushrod Johnson's infantry division to pass nearby Namozine Church.

25|$|There {{were two}} primary routes from Seattle to the Yukon gold fields. One was by ship to the {{south-east}} Alaskan towns of Dyea and Skagway, and then via land for 30 miles over high mountain passes {{from where the}} miners could travel down the tributaries of the Yukon River. The other route was longer and more costly but faster and less grueling: Miners would take a coastal steamer to the Yukon delta port of St. Michael, from where they could transfer to a river steamer to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Yukon River. The Roanoke was brought to Seattle specifically by the North American Transportation and Trading Company to serve the long coastal route to St. Michael, sometime calling at intermediate ports such as Dutch Harbor.

25|$|Born in Illinois, Rumsfeld {{attended}} Princeton University, {{graduating in}} 1954 {{with a degree}} in political science. After serving in the Navy for three years, he mounted a campaign for Congress in Illinois' 13th Congressional District, winning in 1962 at the age of 30. While in Congress, he was a leading co-sponsor of the Freedom of Information Act. Rumsfeld reluctantly accepted an appointment by President Richard Nixon to head the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969; appointed Counsellor by Nixon and entitled to Cabinet-level status, he would also <b>head</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Economic Stabilization Program before being appointed Ambassador to NATO. Called back to Washington in August 1974, Rumsfeld was appointed Chief of Staff by President Ford.

500|$|After {{completing}} his tour as DCAS, Scherger was posted to Washington, D.C., to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Australian Joint Services Staff. Promoted to substantive air vice marshal, he became AOC of RAF Air Headquarters Malaya in January 1953. In this role, he commanded all Commonwealth air {{forces in the}} region and was responsible for operations against communist guerrillas during the emergency. Scherger deliberately sited his headquarters, which had been based in Singapore when he took over, next to the offices of the Director of Operations in Kuala Lumpur, to more closely align air tasking with overall military planning. He expanded the use of helicopters for troop delivery and casualty evacuation, and presided over a change in tactics that saw an earlier policy of indiscriminate saturation bombing of jungle areas replaced by one of precision strike against enemy camps. He also pioneered psychological warfare in the form of [...] "voice" [...] aircraft broadcasting propaganda, close cooperation between light aircraft spotters and ground forces to aid bombing missions, and defoliation to clear jungle cover.|$|E
500|$|The parkway {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Routes 9 and 9N (Canada Street) {{in the town}} of Lake George. The parkway passes through a gate, heading up the base of Prospect Mountain.

500|$|In January 1951, Walters was {{appointed}} AOC RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London. That December, {{he was part}} of the Australian contingent at the Commonwealth Air Forces Conference, where an RAAF presence was sought in the Middle East; this eventually resulted in No.78 Wing being re-formed and deployed to Malta in July 1952. Although Walters was keen to use the opportunity to acquire the RAAF's first North American F-86 Sabres, political realities led him to negotiate a deal whereby the wing was equipped with leased British de Havilland Vampire FB.9s. In October 1952, Walters was promoted to acting air vice marshal and posted to Washington,D.C., to <b>head</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Australian Joint Services Staff as successor to Air Vice Marshal Scherger. Walters' rank was made permanent in January 1954, when he succeeded Air Vice Marshal McCauley to become AOC Home Command. [...] Walters held this post, responsible for directing the RAAF's combat units, for three years. His tenure witnessed the introduction of the CAC Sabre to operational service with the Air Force, when No.3 Squadron took delivery of its first machine in March 1956.|$|E
