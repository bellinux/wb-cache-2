5|$|According to Carroll family tradition, Powis {{told his}} new clerk that he {{believed}} King James was receiving bad advice related to the religious turmoil in England. Powis {{was concerned about the}} consequences <b>for</b> <b>English</b> Catholics. He supposedly spoke on Carroll's behalf to an associate of his, Charles Calvert, proprietor of the Maryland colony. Charles Calvert's grandfather, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, was a former member of Parliament and Secretary of State to James I, whose Catholicism had effectively ended his political career. Intense lobbying by George Calvert had led to the granting of a hereditary charter to the Calvert family. The Maryland colony was established in the 1630s on land granted by this charter. It was intended as a haven <b>for</b> <b>English</b> Catholics and other religious minorities. Powis may have encouraged Carroll to emigrate to Maryland with the hope that the younger man's career would come to greater fulfillment in a place with less religious conflict than England at the time.|$|E

5|$|Although the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition was {{traditionally}} {{the most prestigious}} venue <b>for</b> <b>English</b> artists to display their new material, Watts chose to exhibit Hope at the smaller Grosvenor Gallery.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1590s, his championing of native Scottish {{tradition}} {{was reduced to}} some extent by the increasing likelihood of his succession to the English throne. William Alexander and other courtier poets started to anglicise their written language, and followed the king to London after 1603. James's role as active literary participant and patron made him a defining figure in many respects <b>for</b> <b>English</b> Renaissance poetry and drama, which reached a pinnacle of achievement in his reign, but his patronage of the high style in the Scottish tradition, which included his ancestor James I of Scotland, became largely sidelined.|$|E
