2500|$|Computerized {{cognitive}} behavioral therapy (CCBT) {{has been}} described by NICE as a [...] "generic term for delivering CBT via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or <b>interactive</b> <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> system", instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. It is also known as internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or ICBT. CCBT has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist. In this context, {{it is important not to}} confuse CBT with 'computer-based training', which nowadays is more commonly referred to as e-Learning.|$|E

5000|$|In 1985, <b>Voice</b> <b>Response</b> Inc. (formerly Call-It Co) a {{subsidiary}} of Lee Enterprises, Davenport IA, entered the fast-growing <b>Interactive</b> <b>Voice</b> (IVR) <b>response</b> market {{under the direction of}} Bob Ross, President. [...] About a year later, VRI introduced one of the first [...] "successful" [...] IVR applications that utilized voice recognition (rather than touch tone) to capture caller <b>responses.</b> <b>Voice</b> recognition technology had great difficulty with regional and ethnic differences and nuances which resulted in a high incidence of error. VRI discovered that hesitation (delayed response) signaled caller confusion or misunderstanding which often resulted in an inaccurate response. VRI developed proprietary techniques that measured user response times and used the data to make real-time changes to the application's dialog with the caller. VRI found that the confidence level of a [...] "suspect" [...] caller response could be increased by asking [...] "Did you say (Chicago), Yes or No", a standard question heard in order taking or reservation making IVR applications today. VRI pioneering applications, including subscription fulfillment for Time -Life Magazine, proved faster and less expensive than call centers using live operators and although VRI did not survive, their voice recognition processes became industry standards and VRI's patent USPTO - patent RE34,587 was eventually licensed by Intel/Dialogic and Nuance.|$|R

40|$|The rapidly {{advancing}} {{mobile communication}} {{technology and the}} decrease in costs {{make it possible to}} incorporate mobile technology into home automation systems. We propose a mobile and internet based home automation system that consists of a mobile phone with android capabilities, an internet based application, and a home server. The home appliances are controlled by the Arduino which receives commands from the server computer, which operates according to the commands received from the mobile application via the wireless network or the internet. In our proposed system the home server is built upon a Wi-Fi technology which receives commands from the client and the command is processed via Arduino, which allows a user to control and monitor any parameters related to the home by using any Java capable cell phone or via the internet. This paper presents an innovative low cost design and implementation of automated ambience control using user mood or based on weather conditions, <b>interactive</b> <b>voice</b> based <b>response,</b> appliance control, and, home security together with the design of android application to enable the cell phone to send commands and receive alerts through the server...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{irreversible}} ErbB family blocker afatinib and the reversible EGFR {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor gefitinib are approved for first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed {{to compare the}} efficacy and safety of afatinib and gefitinib in this setting. Methods This multicentre, international, open-label, exploratory, randomised controlled phase 2 B trial (LUX-Lung 7) was done at 64 centres in 13 countries. Treatment-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and a common EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu 858 Arg) were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive afatinib (40 mg per day) or gefitinib (250 mg per day) until disease progression, or beyond if deemed beneficial by the investigator. Randomisation, stratified by EGFR mutation type and status of brain metastases, was done centrally using a validated number generating system implemented via an <b>interactive</b> <b>voice</b> or web-based <b>response</b> system with a block size of four. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation; independent review of tumour response was done in a blinded manner. Coprimary endpoints were progression-free survival by independent central review, time-to-treatment failure, and overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01466660. Findings Between Dec 13, 2011, and Aug 8, 2013, 319 patients were randomly assigned (160 to afatinib and 159 to gefitinib). Median follow-up was 27 · 3 months (IQR 15 · 3 – 33 · 9).
