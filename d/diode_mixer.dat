5000|$|One classic {{design for}} a {{harmonic}} mixer uses a step recovery diode (SRD). The mixer's subharmonic input is first amplified to a power level that might be around 1 watt. That signal then drives a step recovery diode impulse generator circuit that turns the sine wave into something approximating an impulse train. The resulting impulse train has the harmonics of the input sine wave present to a high frequency (such as 18 GHz). The impulse train can then be used with a <b>diode</b> <b>mixer</b> (also called a sampler).The SRD usually has a very high frequency multiplication ratio, {{and can be used}} as the basis of a comb receiver, monitoring several harmonically related frequencies at once.

However, the reverse saturation current of InGaAs/InP diodes is expected to be much greater than that of GaAs diodes. These predictions are confirmed by experiment. The mixer analyses predict that sub-harmonically pumped anti-parallel InGaAs/InP <b>diode</b> <b>mixers</b> are expected to offer a 2 dB greater conversion loss and a somewhat higher single sideband noise temperature than their GaAs counterparts.

40|$|GaAs-based, sub-harmonically pumped Schottky <b>diode</b> <b>mixers</b> offer {{a number}} of {{advantages}} for array implementation in a heterodyne receiver system. Since the radio frequency (RF) and local oscillator (LO) signals are far apart, system design becomes much simpler. A proprietary planar GaAs Schottky diode process was developed that results in very low parasitic anodes that have cutoff frequencies {{in the tens of}} terahertz. This technology enables robust implementation of monolithic mixer and frequency multiplier circuits well into the terahertz frequency range. Using optical and e-beam lithography, and conventional epitaxial layer design with innovative usage of GaAs membranes and metal beam leads, high-performance terahertz circuits can be designed with high fidelity. All of these mixers use metal waveguide structures for housing. Metal machined structures for RF and LO coupling hamper these mixers to be integrated in multi-pixel heterodyne array receivers for spectroscopic and imaging applications. Moreover, the recent developments of terahertz transistors on InP substrate provide an opportunity, for the first time, to have integrated amplifiers followed by Schottky <b>diode</b> <b>mixers</b> in a heterodyne receiver at these frequencies. Since the amplifiers are developed on a planar architecture to facilitate multi-pixel array implementation, it is quite important to find alternative architecture to waveguide-based mixers...|$|R
