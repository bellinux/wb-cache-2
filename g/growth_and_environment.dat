In this case, we will be able to study how the basic conclusions of the neoclassical growth model change. The results justi:tY that opposite measures to those defended by traditional neoclassical models must be introduced to improve long term per capita income.

Empirical data are increasingly available, but the theories behind those data remain a matter of debate. This paper presents an elementary theoretical model of the interactions between the economic process <b>and</b> the <b>environment,</b> drawing on a theory developed by Georgescu-Roegen, in which the laws of thermodynamics are applied to the economic process. The model assumes that the <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> distribution process is currently operating amid conditions of environmental distress. The model is able to predict and explain the observed {{relationship between}} economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> the <b>environment,</b> identifying new public policy implications. The paper thus aims to contribute to the debate on the choices that society must make about the future of humanity...|$|R
