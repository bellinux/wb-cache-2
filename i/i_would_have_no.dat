500|$|Charles's {{beheading}} {{was scheduled}} for Tuesday, 30 January 1649. Two of his children remained in England {{under the control of}} the Parliamentarians: Elizabeth and Henry. They were permitted to visit him on 29 January, and he bade them a tearful farewell. The following morning, he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear: [...] "the season is so sharp as probably may make me shake, which some observers may imagine proceeds from fear. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> such imputation." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, Lippi's {{successor}} as Italy's coach, Cesare Prandelli, {{stated that}} he would consider Totti for the 2014 World Cup squad. In October 2013, Prandelli said, [...] "Totti is in fantastic form. His condition right now does make you reflect. If the World Cup was around the corner, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubts and would absolutely call him up. But we will evaluate the player's condition one month prior to the World Cup." [...] However, {{at the time of}} the choice of the final 23-man Italian squad for the World Cup, the Italy coach excluded the Roma striker, preferring to focus the team around younger players. Some in the media criticised the decision, such as former Brazilian international footballer Cafu, who had been Totti's teammate at Roma, who revealed that he would have liked to see Totti competing for Italy at the World Cup in Brazil, and that he preferred the Roma captain over Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Without Totti, Italy was eliminated in the first round for the second consecutive time, finishing third in their group.|$|E
2500|$|... "In view of your appalling {{criminal}} history, and {{in view of}} the particularly serious {{nature of}} the crime for which you have been convicted, it is only appropriate that you be sentenced to life imprisonment. Even if the murder of Nicole Patterson had never occurred, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> hesitation in imposing a term of life imprisonment upon you.|$|E
60|$|FAULKLAND Ah! Julia, {{that last}} word is grating to me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> title to your gratitude! Search your heart, Julia; perhaps {{what you have}} mistaken for love, is but the warm {{effusion}} of a too thankful heart.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not feel}} {{disposed}} to record those two Chancery cases; firstly, because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> <b>no</b> part in engendering {{in the mind of}} any human creature, a hopeful confidence in that den of iniquity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "but I {{am not going}} back to Sadler's to-night. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> <b>no</b> bed than split wood for an hour after dark in order to procure one. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> prefer a couch of dried leaves." ...|$|R
2500|$|... she defiantly stated {{before the}} entire Grand Council, [...] "Now they [...] have started the aggression, and the {{extinction}} of our nation is imminent. If we just fold our arms and yield to them, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> face to see our ancestors after death. If we must perish, why don't we fight to the death?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Along {{with the}} blue shirts, the red ties, the clenched fists, the raised arm salute, came the banners, the slogans, the demonstrations; all the trappings that make for totalitarian, unthinking mass fervor. These now became regular {{features}} at party gatherings. I can still recall the howl of triumph that rose from these young people at one of our meetings when {{for the first time}} Norman Thomas returned the clenched fist salute to them. As I stood at his side, my arms deliberately folded to indicate that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> part of this, their cheers for Thomas rose to almost uncontrollable frenzy." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Cixi {{received}} an ultimatum demanding that China surrender total control over all its military and financial affairs to foreigners, she defiantly stated before the Grand Council, [...] "Now they [...] have started the aggression, and {{the extinction of}} our nation is imminent. If we just fold our arms and yield to them, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> face to see our ancestors after death. If we must perish, why not fight to the death?" [...] It {{was at this point}} that Cixi began to blockade the legations with the armies of the Beijing Field Force, which began the siege.|$|E

6000|$|... "Set to {{work and}} produce abortions!" [...] cried Roderick with ire. [...] "Preach that to others. Production with me must be either {{pleasure}} or nothing. As I said just now, I must either stay in the saddle or not go at all. I won't do second-rate work; I can't if <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> cleverness, apart from inspiration. I am not a Gloriani! You are right," [...] he added after a while; [...] "this is unprofitable talk, and it makes my head ache. I shall take a nap and see if I can dream of a bright idea or two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I did not betray them," [...] said Hayraddin, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> asked <b>no</b> guerdon {{from you}} or from them, but from him whom their keeping {{on the right}} hand {{side of the river}} might have benefited. The party that I have served is the party who must pay me." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Collins, [...] "What we're {{in court}} {{deciding}} {{seems to be}} a level or two down from what, before we went into the jury, we supposed the trial was about, or had been initially about, which was who leaked [...] Some jurors commented at some point: 'I wish we weren't judging Libby. You know, this sucks. We don't like being here.' But that wasn't our choice." [...] Collins described how after 10 days of deliberations, [...] "What we came up with from that was that Libby was told about Mrs. Wilson nine times...We believed he did have a bad memory, but it seemed very unlikely he would not remember about being told about Mrs. Wilson so many times....Hard to believe he would remember on Tuesday and forget on Thursday." [...] Collins told the press [...] "Well, as I said before, I felt like it was a long, you know, haul to get this jury done. And if Mr. Libby is pardoned, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> problem with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{explained}} her viewpoint to a journalist: [...] "I knew that, if I {{continued to}} appear in any more mediocre pictures, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> career left worth fighting for." [...] Davis' counsel presented her complaints—{{that she could be}} suspended without pay for refusing a part, with the period of suspension added to her contract, that she could be called upon to play any part within her abilities regardless of her personal beliefs, that she could be required to support a political party against her beliefs, and that her image and likeness could be displayed in any manner deemed applicable by the studio. Jack Warner testified, and was asked, [...] "Whatever part you choose to call upon her to play, if she thinks she can play it, whether it is distasteful and cheap, she has to play it?" [...] Warner replied, [...] "Yes, she must play it." [...] The case, decided by Branson J. in the English High Court, was reported as Warner Bros. Studios Incorporated v. Nelson in [...] 1KB 209. Davis lost the case and returned to Hollywood, in debt and without income, to resume her career. Olivia de Havilland mounted a similar case in 1943 and won.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{come back}} to myself," [...] said Helen, wanting to {{continue}} the argument. [...] "You declared I didn't know myself. That <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> self-control. I will!" ...|$|E
500|$|The King {{wrote of}} the {{incident}} to his brother-in-law, Frederick William III of Prussia, [...] "If each of these seven gentlemen had addressed a letter to me expressing his opinion, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> cause to take exception to their conduct. But to call a meeting and publish their opinions even before the Government had received their protest—that is {{what they have done}} and that I cannot allow." [...] Ernest received a deputation of Göttingen citizens, who, fearing student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in Europe, especially in Britain. In the House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British King, Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British Throne by his actions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> You <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{reason to}} love Cetywayo, {{and it does}} not matter to you whether or no I return to his kraal to mend guns there. If you think that he will be angry because I am missing, you had better cross the border also; we can go together." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{great man}} was {{standing}} with two unopened epistles in his hand. [...] "Eames," [...] said he, [...] "here are letters--" [...] Then he stopped himself, and began upon another subject.

60|$|MER. But {{how shall}} I {{be sure that}} I also shall be welcomed? Had I this hope but from one that can tell, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{hesitation}} at all, but would go, being helped by Him that can help, though the way be never so tedious.|$|E
5000|$|... "It's just unbelievable. I {{finished}} the Tour de France a little tired, but the Olympics, I must go there." [...] About the breakaway group, he continued, [...] "It was up-down, up-down, too many people. It was very dangerous. I {{knew that if}} I was following the group <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> chance in the sprint. I finish my career with this victory." ...|$|R
5000|$|President Obama {{signed the}} bill shortly {{after it was}} passed by the Senate. In doing so, the {{president}} said, [...] "Is this the deal <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> preferred? <b>No.</b> But this compromise does make a serious down payment on the deficit reduction we need, and gives each party a strong incentive to get a balanced plan done {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} you don't wish to tell me!" [...] cried the girl. [...] "But you might <b>have</b> trusted me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> defended you, <b>no</b> matter what you had done--the worse the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} long tramp before me even now," [...] I {{said in a}} tone of dismay to my father, who had {{accompanied}} me to the river. [...] "With a craft like that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> hope of escape if peradventure the lobster backs gave chase." ...|$|E
60|$|The scene {{came to my}} mind; the dimly-lit room, the {{delicate}} form lying on the couch, cold and indifferent, while I was given over to an agony of despair. I remembered the glitter of the jewelled ring against the white hand. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> mercy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay--ay--I {{know all}} about it--but you didn't stick to it {{long enough to get}} spoiled. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> man aboard the Swash who made more than two v'y'ges as second officer.

40|$|Although I {{wrote this}} {{dissertation}} myself, it is a cumulative {{result of the}} tapestry of life I’ve woven {{over the past five}} years. Thus, I feel compelled to highlight some individuals who have had key contributions to the successful completion of the dis-sertation. Chris and Tina: department support staff who make IOE a great place and who make sure you’re never out of luck. Blake, Esra, and Irina: officemates supreme and friends off the court as well. Archis Ghate: mentor and confidant; having access to him saved me wasted effort and helped me develop better writing skills. Robert Smith: my advisor from day one, without whom <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> clue in approaching this topic. The notions of “well-posed ” and “coalescent ” are his creations, and he always asked questions that pushed me to better understand the topic. Mom and Dad: cheerleaders and friends; growing up in their loving and sup-portive home allowed me to get to graduate school in the first place...|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, Ratcliff {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with the Sun that she retrained as a counsellor, before retiring. She added that [...] "If you had asked me last year if I wanted to go back to acting <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said <b>no.</b> <b>I</b> was working too hard then and I felt tired. Now, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say yes. If anyone needs someone to play a bag lady, I could do that." ...|$|R
60|$|When thus {{every part}} of the {{situation}} was contrived as well as might be for discovery, and to render intriguing dangerous, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> guards, no eyes, no spies set over the ladies, but shall expect them to be tried by the principles of honour and strict virtue.|$|E

50|$|OW: In the {{original}} script {{we had a}} scene based on a notorious thing Hearst had done, which I still cannot repeat for publication. And I cut it out because I thought it hurt the film and wasn’t in keeping with Kane’s character. If I’d kept it in, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> trouble with Hearst.
