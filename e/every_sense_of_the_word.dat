25|$|Robin's mother {{comes back}} on a leave from her spy duties to help care for Robin until {{the birth of her}} grandchild. Patrick realizes what Robin and this baby truly mean to him and knows that he wants them to be a family in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> but Robin still has concerns. Although Robin states that Patrick could see his child as much as he wants, she does not believe he is fully {{committed}} or prepared to give up his bachelorhood for a family. He takes her to court and only after his moving testimony does she realize Patrick truly wants this, her and their child, their family. They wait for their baby as a happy, loving committed couple. On August 12, 2008, Patrick and Robin learn their baby is a girl. As Patrick goes into full panicked father mode, Robin tries to calm him down. Later, when Patrick sees Robin with Jason, he expresses his concern that he does not want his child to be around such a dangerous target and Robin agrees.|$|E

"I {{was born}} in a family that lived long years in mediocrity {{bordering}} on destitution, and which is to this day poor in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> My father is a good man whose life has nothing remarkable except [...] having served in subordinate positions in the War of Independence... My mother is the true figure of Christianity in its purest sense; with her, trust in Providence was always the solution to all difficulties in life." ...|$|E
500|$|The painting's content, presentation, and {{emotional}} force secure {{its status as}} a groundbreaking, archetypal image of the horrors of war. Although it draws on many sources from both high and popular art, The Third of May 1808 marks a clear break from convention. Diverging from the traditions of Christian art and traditional depictions of war, it has no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged {{as one of the first}} paintings of the modern era. According to the art historian Kenneth Clark, The Third of May 1808 is [...] "the first great picture which can be called revolutionary in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> in style, in subject, and in intention".|$|E

500|$|Mariam is {{an ethnic}} Pashtun born in Herat, 1959 to a Pashtun father. She {{is the child}} of Jalil and Nana born out of the wedlock. She suffers shame {{throughout}} her childhood because of the circumstances of her birth. Khaled Hosseini described her portrayal: [...] "The key word with Mariam {{is that she is}} isolated in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> She is a woman who is detached from the day-to-day norms of human existence. Really, she just wants connection with another human being." [...] Despite initially resenting Laila, she becomes a [...] "friend and a doting alternative mother" [...] to her through the [...] "common hardship" [...] of being married to the [...] "abusive, psychologically imposing" [...] Rasheed.|$|E
500|$|West {{was also}} {{regarded}} for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA described West as [...] "obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win… {{a level of}} intensity so high it could melt lead". Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: [...] "He took a loss harder than any player I've ever known. He would sit by himself and stare into space. A loss just ripped his guts out." [...] Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a [...] "Jerry West Night", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: [...] "Jerry, you are, in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> truly a champion… If I could have one wish granted, {{it would be that}} you would always be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was forced}} to write the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond to Talleyrand and ongoing events. Upon {{completing}} the work, she wrote to her friend William Roscoe: [...] "I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject.– Do not suspect me of false modesty– I {{mean to say that}} had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word...</b> I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." [...] When Wollstonecraft revised the Rights of Woman for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.|$|E

500|$|In {{its initial}} {{run at the}} Opéra-Comique, Carmen {{provoked}} little public enthusiasm; it shared the theatre for a while with Verdi's much more popular Requiem. Carmen was often performed to half-empty houses, even when the management gave away large numbers of tickets. Early on 3 June, {{the day after the}} opera's 33rd performance, Bizet died suddenly of heart disease, at the age of 36. It was his wedding anniversary. That night's performance was cancelled; the tragic circumstances brought a temporary increase in public interest during the brief period before the season ended. Du Locle brought Carmen back in November 1875, with the original cast, and it ran for a further 12 performances until 15 February 1876 to give a year's total for the original production of 48. Among those who attended one of these later performances was Tchaikovsky, who wrote to his benefactor, Nadezhda von Meck: [...] "Carmen is a masterpiece in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> ... one of those rare creations which expresses the efforts of a whole musical epoch". After the final performance, Carmen was not seen in Paris again until 1883.|$|E
500|$|Nieuwendyk was {{regarded}} as a leader throughout his career. [...] He was the captain of the Flames for four seasons, and his teammates in Dallas praised him as a player who would help guide the younger players as they began their careers. His presence was considered an important factor in New Jersey's 2003 Stanley Cup championship. Devils' general manager Lou Lamoriello praised his impact {{both on and off the}} ice: [...] "Certainly (the tangibles were) the quality player he was even at that time, how good he was defensively as well as always finding a way to get big goals. It was also about how good he was on faceoffs. And the intangibles, which are really more tangible than anything, are what he brought in the locker room from leadership and unselfishness. It was obvious that when he didn't play he was still so active in his support. He's genuine in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> He was a true team player." [...] Nieuwendyk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011, and his uniform number 25 was honoured by the Calgary Flames on March 7, 2014, as he was named to the organization's [...] "Forever a Flame" [...] program.|$|E
500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Alexandra Marshall of MTV called the song a [...] "lush little snippet which {{sounds like a}} basement tape from a Magnetic Fields EP." [...] A writer for the Birmingham Evening Mail wrote that its [...] "sweeping melody and atmospheric vocals" [...] create a [...] "distinctive soundscape". Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media remarked that the song [...] "tenderly glides down throats like lithium." [...] While commenting that Play [...] "need of a bit of pruning", David Browne of Entertainment Weekly cited [...] "Porcelain" [...] as an exception and praised it as [...] "gorgeous". In their [...] "Chartslot" [...] feature, the Daily Record described the song as [...] "ideal for chilling out to on a summer's evening." [...] Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times characterized the Play songs [...] "Honey" [...] and [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "emotional and gripping" [...] and wrote that if [...] " [...] didn't move you (in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word),</b> then you probably had no pulse." [...] Playlouder named [...] "Porcelain" [...] the twenty-sixth best single of 2000, calling it the album's [...] "most crushingly heavenly track" [...] and praising its combination of piano melodies with Moby's [...] "hauntingly haunted" [...] vocals. The song ranked at number fifty-six on The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Q placed [...] "Porcelain" [...] at number 253 on their list of the 1,001 Best Songs Ever.|$|E

500|$|No. 80 Wing {{had begun}} {{transferring}} to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944, {{and the main}} body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on Morotai, where it came {{under the control of}} the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), until 9March. Once there, he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to Manila. In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and fellow aces Wilf Arthur and John Waddy, who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions. The incident became known as the [...] "Morotai Mutiny". Gibbes later declared that [...] "...after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given, I could not see any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service." [...] As a former jackaroo, he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle: [...] "I felt horrible about it, being an ex bushy...at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> No—not the Japs. Cattle...If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives, starvation will be our main weapon...God, I hated doing it but could do nothing else. Felt as sick as hell." [...] No action was taken against the [...] "mutineers" [...] for their attempted resignations; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified. In the meantime, Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai. Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant; the Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, himself shortly to be dismissed over the [...] "mutiny", restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective [...] 23April.|$|E

2500|$|Aleksey {{remained}} {{the only child}} in the family, four infants dying before his birth and five after. Years later he described himself (to which other people attested) as a weak, capricious and whimsical boy who for some reason loved to mock clergymen and suffered from sleepwalking at one time. Pisemsky remembered his father as a military service man in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> strict and duty-bound, a man of honesty in terms of money, severe and strict. [...] "Some of our serfs were horrified by him, not all of them, though, only those who were foolish and lazy; those who were smart and industrious were favoured by him," [...] he remarked.|$|E

2500|$|Carpenter was the Deputy for the Governor William Penn who {{was known}} as [...] "The Proprietor." [...] Samuel served from 24 November 1694 to 3 September 1698. Governor Penn was often unable to govern his {{possessions}} acquired under Royal Charter directly. The day-to-day operations devolved to his deputy governors. [...] "It is generally conceded that, next to Penn himself, Samuel Carpenter was at this time the most wealthy and influential citizen in the colony. [...] He {{was a man of}} great force in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> and being a Quaker of the most pronounced views, he, of course, proved to be of the greatest value and assistance to Penn during the latter's enforced absence in England." ...|$|E
