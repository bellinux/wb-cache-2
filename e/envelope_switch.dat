The goal is to find instructive variants of the <b>envelope</b> <b>switching</b> problem that are capable of clear-cut resolution, while still retaining paradoxical features. By relocating the original problem into different contexts involving commutes and playing cards the reader is presented with a succession of resolved paradoxes that reduce the confusion arising from the parent paradox. The goal is to reduce confusion by understanding how we sometimes misread mathematical statements; or, to completely avoid confusion, either by reforming language, or adopting an unambiguous notation for switching problems. This article also suggests that an illusion close in character to the figure/ground illusion hampers our understanding of switching problems in general and helps account for the intense confusion that switching problems sometimes generate...|$|R

40|$|Polar {{modulated}} RF amplifiers {{have the}} potential to enhance efficiency while achieving sufficient linearity for a signal having non-constant <b>envelope.</b> However, <b>switching</b> modulators used in such architectures to generate the envelope signal are difficult to implement because of the high bandwidth and low switching ripple requirement, while achieving high efficiency even at large power back-off. This paper presents a wideband supply modulator for a 20 MHz RF bandwidth polar modulated PA. Realized in 65 nm CMOS, it consists of a cascoded nested Miller compensated linear amplifier and a class D switching amplifier. The class-AB linear amplifier with cascoded Miller compensation in the modulator reduces the output switching ripple to 4. 3 mVrms at a switching frequency of 118 MHz. With an optimized design the modulator achieves a maximum efficiency of 87. 5 % and a small signal $-$ 3 dB bandwidth of 285 MHz. At 10 dB back-off the efficiency is more than 40 %. The modulator can deliver 22. 7 dBm output power to a 5. 3 $Omega$ load. It satisfies the linearity requirement of IEEE 802. 11 g WLAN signal when tested in a real polar modulated amplifier...|$|R

5000|$|The two {{envelopes}} problem, {{also known}} as the exchange paradox, is a brain teaser, puzzle, or paradox in logic, probability, and recreational mathematics.

40|$|Input-Output {{buffered}} crossbars {{are popular}} {{building blocks for}} scalable high-speed switching because they require minimum speed-up of memory bandwidth. These crossbars typically schedule and transfer fixed size <b>envelopes</b> over the <b>switching</b> fabric. When incoming packets are variable sized, as in IP networks, the arriving packets are fragmented into envelopes for scheduling and transfer through the fabric. This fragmentation can lead to, possibly large [1], loss of switch bandwidth and instability unless the switch capacity is dimensioned for a worst-case packet size pattern. Alternately, the envelope size should be made very small to minimize bandwidth wastage. However, smaller envelope sizes result in smaller available time for scheduling and fabric reconfiguration.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} a major remodeling {{of the nuclear}} envelope and its underlying lamina during bovine preimplantation development. Up to the onset of major embryonic genome activation (MGA) at the 8 -cell stage nuclei showed a non-uniform distribution of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). NPCs were exclusively present at sites where DNA contacted the nuclear lamina. Extended regions of the lamina, which were not contacted by DNA, lacked NPCs. In post-MGA nuclei the whole lamina was contacted rather uniformly by DNA. Accordingly, NPCs became uniformly distributed throughout the entire nuclear envelope. These findings shed {{new light on the}} conditions which control the integration of NPCs into the nuclear <b>envelope.</b> The <b>switch</b> from maternal to embryonic production of mRNAs was accompanied by multiple invaginations covered with NPCs, which may serve the increased demands of mRNA export and protein import. Other invaginations, as well as interior nuclear segments and vesicles without contact to the nuclear envelope, were exclusively positive for lamin B. Since the abundance of these invaginations and vesicles increased in concert with a massive nuclear volume reduction, we suggest that they reflect a mechanism for fitting the nuclear envelope and its lamina to a shrinking nuclear size during bovine preimplantation development. In addition, a deposit of extranuclear clusters of NUP 153 (a marker for NPCs) without associated lamin B was frequently observed from the zygote stage up to MGA. Corresponding RNA-Seq data revealed deposits of spliced, maternally provided NUP 153 mRNA and little unspliced, newly synthesized RNA prior to MGA, which increased strongly at the initiation of embryonic expression of NUP 153 at MGA...|$|R

5000|$|The simple {{resolution}} above {{assumed that}} the person who invented the argument for switching was trying to calculate the expectation value of the amount in Envelope A, thinking of the two amounts in the envelopes as fixed (x and 2x). The only uncertainty is which envelope has the smaller amount x. However many mathematicians and statisticians interpret the argument as an attempt to calculate the expected amount in Envelope B, given a real or hypothetical amount [...] "A" [...] in Envelope A. (A mathematician would moreover prefer to use the symbol a to stand for a possible value, reserving the symbol A for a random variable). One does not need to look in the envelope to see how much is in there, in order to do the calculation.

The paper is aimed at presenting the results of the researches recently conducted by the authors on the conception, based on free-form generating algorithms, of building envelopes that can be considered optimal with respect to different functional and structural criteria. Since the optimality conditions may change with the variation of the external/internal environment, the generation of these forms is obtained considering kinetic structural systems, {{in such a way that}} the shape of the <b>envelopes</b> can be <b>switched</b> from one optimal configuration to any other, thus creating adaptive systems.

5000|$|Suppose for {{the sake}} of argument, we start by imagining an amount 32 in Envelope A. In order that the {{reasoning}} in steps 6 and 7 is correct whatever amount happened to be in Envelope A, we apparently believe in advance that all the following ten amounts are all equally likely to be the smaller of the two amounts in the two envelopes: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 (equally likely powers of 2: Falk and Konold, 1992). But going to even larger or even smaller amounts, the [...] "equally likely" [...] assumption starts to appear a bit unreasonable. Suppose we stop, just with these ten equally likely possibilities for the smaller amount in the two envelopes. In that case, the reasoning in steps 6 and 7 was entirely correct if envelope A happened to contain any of the amounts 2, 4, ... 512: <b>switching</b> <b>envelopes</b> would give an expected (average) gain of 25%. If envelope A happened to contain the amount 1, then the expected gain is actually 100%. But if it happened to contain the amount 1024, a massive loss of 50% (of a rather large amount) would have been incurred. That only happens once in twenty times, but it is exactly enough to balance the expected gains in the other 19 out of 20 times.|$|R
50|$|As {{pointed out}} by many authors, the {{mechanism}} by which the amounts of the two envelopes are determined is crucial for {{the decision of the}} player to switch or not his/her envelope. Suppose that the amounts in the two envelopes A and B were not determined by first fixing contents of two envelopes E1 and E2, and then naming them A and B at random (for instance, by the toss of a fair coin; Nickerson and Falk, 2006). Instead, we start right at the beginning by putting some amount in Envelope A, and then fill B in a way which depends both on chance (the toss of a coin) and on what we put in A. Suppose that first of all the amount a in Envelope A is fixed in some way or other, and then the amount in Envelope B is fixed, dependent on what is already in A, according to the outcome of a fair coin. Ιf the coin fell Heads then 2a is put in Envelope B, if the coin fell Tails then a/2 is put in Envelope B. If the player was aware of this mechanism, and knows that they hold Envelope A, but don't know the outcome of the coin toss, and doesn't know a, then the switching argument is correct and he/she is recommended to <b>switch</b> <b>envelopes.</b> This version of the problem was introduced by Nalebuff (1988) and is often called the Ali-Baba problem.

Using electroencephalography (EEG), we recorded brain activity to sounds {{in which the}} interaural phase difference (IPD) of the TFS (or the modulated temporal <b>envelope)</b> was repeatedly <b>switched</b> between leading in one ear or the other. When the amplitude of the tones is modulated equally in the two ears at 41 Hz, the interaural phase modulation (IPM) evokes an IPM following-response (IPM-FR) in the EEG signal. For low-frequency signals, IPM-FRs were reliably obtained, and largest for an IPM rate of 6. 8 Hz and when IPD switches (around 0 °) were in the range 45 – 90 °. IPDs conveyed in envelope of high-frequency tones also generated IPM-FRs; response maxima occurred for IPDs switched between 0 ° and 180 ° IPD. This {{is consistent with the}} interpretation that distinct binaural mechanisms generate the IPM-FR at low and high frequencies, and with the reported physiological responses of medial superior olive (MSO) and lateral superior olive (LSO) neurons in other mammals. Low-frequency binaural neurons in the MSO are considered maximally activated by IPDs in the range 45 – 90 °, consistent with their reception of excitatory inputs from both ears.

40|$|In October 2005, an {{intensive}} three-year Laser Triggered Gas Switch (LTGS) development program was initiated {{to investigate and}} solve observed performance and reliability issues with the LTGS for ZR. The approach taken {{has been one of}} mission-focused research: to revisit and reassess the design, to establish a fundamental understanding of LTGS operation and failure modes, and to test evolving operational hypotheses. This effort is aimed toward deploying an initial switch for ZR in 2007, on supporting rolling upgrades to ZR as the technology can be developed, and to prepare with scientific understanding for the even higher voltage switches anticipated needed for future high-yield accelerators. The ZR LTGS was identified as a potential area of concern quite early, but since initial assessments performed on a simplified Switch Test Bed (STB) at 5 MV showed 300 -shot lifetimes on multiple switch builds, this component was judged acceptable. When the Z{sub 20 } engineering module was brought online in October 2003 frequent flashovers of the plastic <b>switch</b> <b>envelope</b> were observed at the increased stresses required to compensate for the programmatically increased ZR load inductance. As of October 2006, there have been 1423 Z{sub 20 } shots assessing a variety of LTGS designs. Numerous incremental and fundamental switch design modifications have been investigated. As we continue to investigate the LTGS, the basic science of plastic surface tracking, laser triggering, cascade breakdown, and optics degradation remain high-priority mission-focused research topics. Significant progress has been made and, while the switch does not yet achieve design requirements, we are on the path to develop successively better switches for rolling upgrade improvements to ZR.

40|$|A 6. 1 -MV, 0. 79 -MA laser-triggered gas switch (LTGS) {{is used to}} {{synchronize}} the 36 modules of the Z {{machine at}} Sandia National Laboratories. Each module includes one switch, which serves as the last command-fired switch of the module, and hence is {{used to determine the}} time at which each module electrically closes relative to the other modules. The switch is ∼ 81 -cm in length, ∼ 45 -cm in diameter, and is immersed in mineral oil. The outer <b>switch</b> <b>envelope</b> consists of six corrugated monomer-cast acrylic insulators and five contoured stainless-steel rings. The trigger electrodes are fabricated from copper-infused tungsten. The switch is pressurized with several atmospheres of sulfur hexafluoride (SF_{ 6 }), which is turbulently purged within 2  seconds after every shot. Each switch is powered from a 6 -MV, 0. 78 -MJ Marx generator which pulse charges a 24 -nF intermediate-store water capacitor in 1. 4 -μs. Closure of the switch allows power to flow into pulse-forming transmission lines. The power pulse is subsequently compressed by water switches, which results in a total accelerator output power in excess of 70 -TW. A previous version of the LTGS performed exceptionally at a 5. 4 -MV, 0. 7 -MA level on an engineering test module used for switch development. It exhibited a 1 -σ jitter of ∼ 5 [*][*]ns, a prefire and flashover rate less than 0. 1 %, and a lifetime in excess of 150 shots. When installed on the Z accelerator, however, the switch exhibited a prefire probability of ∼ 3 %, a flashover probability of ∼ 7 %, and a 15 -ns jitter. The difference in performance is attributed to several factors such as higher total charge transfer, exposure to more debris, and more stressful dynamic mechanical loading upon machine discharge. Under these conditions, the replacement lifetime was less than ten shots. Since refurbishment of Z in October  2007, there have been three LTGS design iterations to improve the performance at 6. 1 -MV. The most recent design exhibits a prefire rate of less than 0. 1 %, a flashover rate of ∼ 0. 2 %, a single switch jitter of ∼ 6 -ns, and a lifetime of greater than 75 shots. Modifications to achieve the performance improvement are detailed in this article...|$|R
40|$|Retroviral Replicating Vectors (RRVs) {{carrying}} the human codon optimized yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD 2) suicide gene {{are currently in}} Phase I/II clinical trials for treatment of high-grade glioma. These vectors are highly tumor specific due to their intrinsic inability to infect non-dividing cells, and their restriction by the innate immune system, which is often suppressed in the tumor microenvironment. Currently, this system relies on delivery of a single transgene, yCD 2, to the tumor mass. However, the current ‘gold standard’ in medical care is to treat cancer with a multi-drug regimen to combat the heterogeneous nature of tumors. As RRV therapy progresses, it must also {{address the issue of}} heterogeneity and seek to deliver more therapeutics to the cancer. These studies explore the possibility of using RRVs armed with multiple transgenes to improve the therapeutic efficacy of RRV-mediated cancer gene therapy. We examined the use of independent intrinsic promoter to drive RRV transgene expression in multiple cell lines. As transgene space in limited in RRVs, a smaller promoter was studied. Super Core Promoter (SCP 1) was found to have varying degrees of protein expression across different cell lines. As certain immune factors are confined to a therapeutic window, low expression of transgene by SCP 1 was used in U 87 cells to express cytokine mGM-CSF along with yCD 2. Protein levels of yCD 2 dropped, but the transgene still remained functional, while levels of mGM-CSF remained within the therapeutic range. The MLV 4070 A envelope, suffers from “superinfection resistance”, a phenomenon in which a virus is unable to infect cells that have already been infected by a virus expressing the same <b>envelope</b> protein. By <b>switching</b> out the <b>envelope</b> of RRV for different viral envelopes, the efficiency of cotransduction was studied across multiple cell lines. Results showed that cotransduction efficiencies varied between cell lines, potentially as a function of receptor availability or intrinsic viral immunity. Based on results from these studies, prime candidates for cotransduction of U 87 cells were established. Simultaneous cotransduction using two RRVs, expressing the noninterfering 4070 A (AC 3) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelopes, resulted in increased transgene expression from AC 3 -RRV, whereas transgene expression from GALV-RRV decreased slightly when compared to transduction with a single RRV. In order to increase transgene expression of larger transgenes without compromising transgene stability, P 2 A was attached to the end of 4070 A and GALV envelope proteins. P 2 A proved to increase protein expression in most cell lines compared to SCP 1, however, the vector copy number per cell decreased. GALV pseudotyped RRV with P 2 A was then used to cotransduce cells in combination with AC 3 -yCD 2. Expression of the yCD 2 transgene increased, while expression of the GALV-RRV transgene decreased slightly. Functional assays revealed that cotransduction with two RRVs resulted in increased cell death, except at the highest concentrations of ganciclovir. Thus use of pseudotyped RRVs to deliver multiple transgenes has the potential to increase the therapeutic efficacy of RRV-mediated gene therapy...|$|R
