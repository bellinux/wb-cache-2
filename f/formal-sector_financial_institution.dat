40|$|From the 1950 s up to {{the early}} 1990 s the All-India data show an ever-declining share of {{informal}} credit in the total outstanding debt of rural households. Contemporaneous micro-level studies, using more qualitative research methodologies, provide evidence that questions {{the strength of this}} trend, and more recent All-India credit surveys show, first, a levelling, and then a rise, in the share of rural informal credit in 1990 / 91 and 2000 / 01, respectively. By reference to findings of a study of village moneylenders in Rajasthan, the paper notes lessons to be drawn. First, informal financial agents have not disappeared from the rural financial landscape in India. Second, <b>formal-sector</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> can learn much about rural financial service needs from the financial products and processes of their informal counterparts. Third, a national survey of informal agents, {{similar to that of the}} 1921 Census survey of indigenous bankers and moneylenders, would provide valuable pointers towards policy options for the sector. A recent Reserve Bank of India Report on Moneylender Legislation not only explores incentive mechanisms to better ensure fair practice, but also proposes provision for a new category of loan providers that would explicitly link the rural informal and formal financial sectors...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE AND MOTIVATION: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect {{functional}} diversification on the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> The focus is on whether <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> should be allowed to combine commercial banking and investment banking functions under one financial conglomerate. Under current regulators <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> are allowed to combine the functions, however regulators are considering driving regulation towards separating commercial and investment banking. This study sheds light on whether the contemplated separation of investment and commercial banking increases or decreases the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> DATA AND METHODS: The data sample of his study consists of 51 <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> from Europe and the US, with a time span ranging from 2007 to 2014. Functional diversification is measured using income and asset based measures, collected from the annual financial statements of the <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> Credit risk is measured with the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> level credit default swap (CDS) spreads and the CDS spread difference with banking sector CDS index spreads. The impact of functional diversification on credit risk is examined with multiple panel data regressions, where the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> is explained with the functional diversification measures and a set of control variables. Furthermore, multiple robustness checks are developed. FINDINGS: Based on the results, functional diversification decreases the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> at the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> credit risk level and compared with the average credit risk in the banking sector. The results are confirmed with multiple robustness checks. Based on the results the contemplated separation of commercial and investment banking with new regulation can have grave consequences. Separating the two functions would decrease functional diversification increasing the credit risk of <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> and the probability of <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> failures...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{different}} views {{on the effects of}} public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> on corporate debt restructuring : the soft budget view and the hard budget view. The former view, which is held by Kornai (1979, 1983), Dewatripont and Maskin (1995), and others insists that because centralized public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> have difficulty committing themselves to refrain from providing additional funds to distressed firms, corporate reorganizations often result in overinvestment. On the other hand, the latter view argues that public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> should prefer corporate liquidation rather than the continuation of business because public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> are secured by mortgages to a greater extent and are more reluctant to forgive the debts than private <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> In this paper, I have empirically examined the role and impact of public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> government-affiliated <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> in particular, from the viewpoints of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and bankruptcy procedures for distressed firms. The conclusions of this paper are as follows. In the DIP financing, the Development Bank of Japan always takes the lead, followed by private <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> Namely, so-called cowbell effect may exist, which is inconsistent with the hard budget view. Regarding the selection of bankruptcy procedures, firms that owed to government-affiliated <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> have a tendency to opt for private procedures which have the effect of delaying a drastic debt restructuring. This is consistent with the soft budget view. public <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> bankruptcy procedures, debtor-in-possession financing...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{international}} trade in goods and capital movement on the productivity distribution and industry-wide productivity when countries are heterogeneous {{in the quality of}} their <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> In autarky, firm heterogeneity in their productivities arises in countries with poor <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> while all firms adopt a high-productivity technology in countries with better <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> Trade in goods will not change the productivity distribution (nor the industry-wide productivity as a result) in any country, although it lowers equilibrium interest rates in countries with poor <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> while it raises them in countries with better <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> Allowing international capital movement in addition to the trade, however, makes a large impact on the industry. Capital flight from countries with poor <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> occurs, which may lead to global convergence in which all firms in the world adopt the high-productivity technology under a relatively high interest rate. But if the worldwide average of quality of <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> is low, international capital movement will reduce worldwide production efficiency such that low-productivity firms re-emerge even in northern countries as well as in southern countries...|$|R
