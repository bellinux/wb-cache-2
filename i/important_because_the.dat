This is <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet.

5|$|Raël founded Clonaid in March 1997, {{shortly after}} the Dolly the Sheep cloning, believing that the process was <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> human species had been created by an {{extraterrestrial}} cloning project. On a practical level, Raël promoted the practice {{as a way to}} develop more desirable genetics and eventually prolong memories in new bodies. Shortly after Clonaid's launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that she had set up cloning laboratories and had hired a team of six scientists. She said she had limited knowledge of cloning but was skilled in selecting experts.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Oberon orbits Uranus at a {{distance}} of about 584,000km, being the farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Oberon's orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 13.5days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Oberon is a synchronous satellite, tidally locked, with one face always pointing toward the planet. Oberon spends a significant part of its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere. As a result, its surface is directly struck by the solar wind. This is <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by the magnetospheric plasma, which co–rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|E
5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the third farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Umbriel's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 4.1Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Umbriel is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward its parent planet. Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> trailing hemispheres of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment {{may lead to the}} darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E

25|$|In {{the legal}} field, source {{classification}} is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, {{and other sources}} of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the headnotes of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias. Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and precedential, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.|$|E
25|$|A minor-planet moon is {{an astronomical}} object that orbits a minor planet as its natural satellite.

25|$|Control of or {{at least}} {{inclusion}} {{in the creation of}} a cultural epic is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> traditional epic poem like The Odyssey or Virgil’s Aeneid is, at its core, a written history.

For Friedman to deny epic associations to the long poem because they are sometimes written by women is to counter the efforts of many female long poets.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between priests and warriors was <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> concept of Ērānshahr had been revived by the priests. Without this relationship, the Sassanid Empire {{would not have}} survived in its beginning stages. Because of this {{relationship between}} the warriors and the priests, religion and state were considered inseparable in the Zoroastrian religion. However, it is this same relationship that caused the weakening of the Empire, when each group tried to impose their power onto the other. Disagreements between the priests and the warriors led to fragmentation within the empire, which led to its downfall.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies in}} 2003 {{discovered}} that the immune system supports bio-film development in the large intestine.
