5|$|Meanwhile, Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) {{suspects}} Mitchell's new assistant, Broderick (Jeremy Rowley), has a {{crush on}} Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), which he denies but secretly affirms. His suspicion is soon proven wrong when Broderick hugs Cameron in an elevator revealing {{that he is the}} real object of his desire. While eating dinner together, Cameron reveals this to Mitchell, who still believes Broderick has {{a crush on}} him. To see which one is right, the two go to Broderick's house, but after getting a text from Broderick which says he is quitting, the two decide it would be best if they never <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> one of them Broderick liked.|$|E
5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
5|$|Romania ordered 126 of {{the tanks}} on 14 August 1936 as the R-2 and {{received}} the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands didn't help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> one would be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests. After disassembly and checks of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and 6 almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.|$|E

25|$|This greatly {{damaged the}} labourer’s {{movement}} as soon nobody <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> organisation they belonged to.

25|$|There {{can also}} be {{regional}} differences in voter turnout. One issue that arises in continent-spanning nations, such as Australia, Canada, the United States and Russia, is that of time zones.

According to Cerf, the panel could often determine {{the identities of the}} mystery guests early, as they <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> celebrities were in town, or which major movies or plays were about to open. On those occasions, to provide the audience an opportunity to see the guest play the game, the cast would typically allow questioning to pass around at least once before coming up with the correct guess.|$|E

He was indicted on a perjury charge in 1996. His attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have the indictment dismissed {{on the grounds that}} his answers were literally truthful. The district court refused to do so since other witnesses had answered questions about the 1991 party with reference to the 1990 one, and that DeZarn's other answers had shown he <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> party was at issue.|$|E

25|$|Each episode {{should run}} for 27 minutes and 15 seconds, however, if any episode runs over or under {{then it is}} the job of {{post-production}} to cut or add scenes where appropriate. As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, EastEnders: The First 10 Years, after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made. The episode was then copied onto D3 video. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the BBC's technical standard for broadcasting.|$|E
25|$|There was {{advanced}} co-ordination between infantry, {{artillery and}} armour, and the latest, highly manoeuvrable Mark V tank was used {{after it had}} been demonstrated to Monash and Rawlinson. Five companies (60 combat and four supply tanks) of the British 5th Tank Brigade were provided for the assault. Although the Australians had worked with {{a small number of}} tanks successfully at Villers-Bretonneux, their opinion of the technology was clouded by the bad experience they had had of them in April and May 1917 around Bullecourt. As such, to ensure co-ordination and overcome the problems the Australians had experienced at Bullecourt, the Australian infantry and tanks trained and lived together prior to the battle. Coloured diagrams were painted {{on the sides of the}} tanks, corresponding to the battalions that they would support, so that the infantry <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> tank to follow.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Owen Field did {{not have}} {{permanent}} artificial lighting sufficient for television broadcasts at night. This meant that untelevised home games had to start {{in the morning or}} early afternoon so as to be completed by dark, because the cost of leasing a set of portable lights was too high for a game that would not earn enough revenue to pay for those lights. For all televised games, portable lights on trucks were rented – but the leasing costs cut into the university's revenue, and often the four or five portable light trucks stayed on campus for weeks in anticipation of the next televised game. True night games were difficult to play in Norman because of the amount of portable lighting needed to illuminate the field adequately for spectators to see the players, much less the light required for television. Prior to 1982, the university <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> games would be televised and could plan months ahead for leasing the necessary lighting.|$|E

25|$|He {{went into}} law {{after the war}} and in 1921 set up his own practice. During {{the early years of the}} Austrian First Republic, he was close to the Fatherland Front. A {{successful}} lawyer, he was invited to join the cabinet of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1933. Following Dollfuss' murder in 1934, he became a State Councillor from 1937 under Kurt Schuschnigg. A keen mountaineer, Seyss-Inquart became the head of the German-Austrian Alpine Club. He later became a devotee of Heinrich Himmler's concepts of racial purity and sponsored various expeditions to Tibet and other parts of Asia in hopes of proving Aryan racial concepts and theories. He was not initially a member of the Austrian National Socialist party, though he was sympathetic to many of their views and actions. By 1938, however, Seyss-Inquart <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> way the political wind was blowing and became a respectable frontman for the Austrian National Socialists.|$|E

500|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, a {{group of}} identically dressed masked men, each handcuffed to a briefcase, are {{attacked}} in a subway. They are all killed, with one also having his hand cut off, and his briefcase taken. The attacker opens the briefcase and removes the box of diamonds it contains. Investigating the attack, Agent Phil Coulson discovers that the briefcases were randomly assigned, so no one <b>knew</b> <b>which</b> contained the diamonds, and that the attacker carried it out with her eyes closed. Civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee Skye believes that extrasensory perception may be involved, but Coulson and Agent Melinda May doubt that such abilities exist. Using social media, the team discovers that the thief, who has been behind several other similar crimes, is former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Akela Amador. Coulson had trained Amador, and until now had believed her dead.|$|E
