Genetic data {{indicates that the}} golden jackals of the Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia may represent two ancient populations that have survived into modern times. Golden jackals in the Balkans originated from those expanding from southeast Europe and from the Caucasus. Golden jackals from both the Balkans and the Caucasus are expanding into the Baltic. In the Middle East, golden jackals from Israel have a higher <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> than European jackals.

5|$|Some breeders {{have shown}} concern {{regarding}} {{the lack of}} <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> in the breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool.

The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were receptive to the idea, preferring to use Singapuras from around the world that are not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen have to meet certain health and appearance requirements.|$|E

The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed.

One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> (see references e.g.).

5|$|In {{his book}} Genetics and the Origin of Species (1937), Theodosius Dobzhansky {{established}} {{the idea that}} mutation, once seen as a rival to selection, actually supplied the raw material for natural selection by creating <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity,</b> with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic and <b>genetic</b> <b>diversities</b> are not {{correlated}} in {{strains of}} the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa isolated in SW Spain. The cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (Kützing) Kützing is notorious for forming extensive and toxic blooms but the genetic structure of natural populations, and in particular during blooms, remains to be explored. In order to add more knowledge about the genetic structure of M. aeruginosa, we compared phenotypic and genetic variabilities in seventeen strains of M. aeruginosa isolated from three adjacent water bodies in SW Spain (the consecutive reservoirs La Minilla and El Gergal, and small pools in Doñana National Park). For this purpose, a phenetic tree, based on six phenotypic traits (including morphology of cells, photosynthetic and respiratory performance, and toxin production) was compared with a phylogenetic tree built by using the 16 S- 23 S rDNA Internal Transcribed Spacer sequence. Whereas the strains isolated from La Minilla showed a relatively homogeneous phenotype, the phenotypic traits of the remaining strains did not discriminate between the other two water bodies. On the other hand, only a strain isolated in Doñana National Park showed a slightly different ITS sequence, but the sequences from the remaining strains were similar.

The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not genetically pure, having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of <b>genetic</b> <b>diversity</b> a problem.|$|E

40|$|In {{specific}} and obligate interactions {{the nature and}} abundance of a given species can have important effects on the survival and population dynamics of associated organisms. In a phylogeographic framework, we therefore expect that the fates of organisms interacting specifically are also tightly interrelated. Here we investigate such a scenario by analyzing the genetic structures of species interacting in an obligate plant-insect pollination lure-and-trap antagonism, involving Arum maculatum (Araceae) and its specific psychodid (Diptera) visitors Psychoda phalaenoides and Psycha grisescens. Because the interaction is asymmetric (i. e., only the plant depends on the insect), we expect the genetic structure of the plant to be related with the historical pollinator availability, yielding incongruent phylogeographic patterns between the interacting organisms. Using insect mtDNA sequences and plant AFLP genome fingerprinting, we inferred the large-scale phylogeographies of each species {{and the distribution of}} <b>genetic</b> <b>diversities</b> throughout the sampled range, and evaluated the congruence in their respective genetic structures using hierarchical analyses of molecular variances (AMOVA). Because the composition of pollinator species varies in Europe, we also examined its association with the spatial genetic structure of the plant. Our findings indicate that while the plant presents a spatially well-defined genetic structure, {{this is not the case}} in the insects. Patterns of <b>genetic</b> <b>diversities</b> also show dissimilar distributions among the three interacting species.

For instance, varying levels of habitat disturbance across a region may locally reduce both diversities due to extinctions, and increased genetic drift during population bottlenecks and founder events. We investigated the regional distribution of <b>genetic</b> and species <b>diversities</b> of a coastal sand dune plant community along 240 kilometers of coastline with the aim to test for a correlation between the two diversity levels. We further quantify and tease apart the respective contributions of natural and anthropogenic disturbance factors to the observed patterns.

We further revealed a negative impact of urbanization: Sites with a high amount of recreational infrastructure within 10  km coastline had significantly lowered <b>genetic</b> and species <b>diversities.</b> On the other hand, a measure of natural habitat disturbance had no effect.
