5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was framed. By the early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition of armor plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent <b>hogging</b> and sagging, had shifted and the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately <b>hogging</b> the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit {{on the length of}} a wooden-hulled ship is about 300feet, after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to <b>hogging,</b> so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater. The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E

40|$|The lean <b>hog</b> futures {{contract}} is replacing the live <b>hog</b> {{futures contract}} at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange {{beginning with the}} February 1997 contract. The lean <b>hog</b> futures will be cash settled based on a broad-based lean <b>hog</b> price index, eliminating terminal markets from the price discovery process.

Frozen pork bellies futures are also examined for the cash meats. Both long- term and short-term hedges are simulated, using the minimum- variance approach, which utilizes only unconditional information, and the Myers-Thompson approach that incorporates conditional information. The results show that the lean <b>hog</b> futures should perform better than either the live <b>hog</b> or the frozen pork bellies futures as a hedging instrument for Omaha cash <b>hogs</b> and cash loins. The strongest evidence of this is for the short-term hedging of cash <b>hogs.</b> For the other three meats, no futures contract demonstrated a clear hedging advantage. ...|$|R

25|$|Following {{the loss}} of the turbine-powered {{destroyer}} HMS Cobra, which broke in two and sank while on its delivery voyage on 19 September 1901, the Admiralty set up a committee to investigate the strength and seaworthiness of its destroyers. As part of these investigations, a number of full-scale tests were carried out on Wolf to determine the stresses to which destroyers could be exposed to at sea. Wolf was fitted with strain gauges and subject to <b>hogging</b> and sagging tests in dry dock at Portsmouth. Following this, Wolf, still fitted with strain gauges, was sent to sea to look for bad weather. The investigation indicated that the destroyers built to Admiralty design requirements had adequate strength.|$|E
25|$|This swine {{production}} and pollution that accompanies factory <b>hogging</b> {{is concentrated in}} the parts of North Carolina that have the highest disease rates, the least access to medical care, and the greatest need for positive education and economic development. Since hog production has become consolidated in the coastal region of N.C., the high water tables and low-lying flood plains have increased the risk and impact of hog farm pollution. A swine CAFO {{is made up of}} three parts: the hog house, the “lagoon,” and the “spray field.” Waste disposal techniques used by small-scale traditional hog farms, like using waste as fertilizer for commercially viable crops, were adopted and expanded for use by CAFOs. Lagoons are supposed to be protected with an impermeable liner, but some do not work properly. This can cause environmental damage, as seen in 1995 when a lagoon burst in North Carolina. This lagoon released 25 million gallons of noxious sludge into North Carolina’s New River and killed approximately eight to ten million fish.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} {{to increases in}} extracellular osmolarity, Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates the <b>HOG</b> 1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is composed {{of a pair of}} redundant MAPK kinase kinases, namely, Ssk 2 p and Ssk 22 p, the MAPK kinase Pbs 2 p, and the MAPK <b>Hog</b> 1 p. <b>Hog</b> 1 p is activated by Pbs 2 p through phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues. Activated <b>Hog</b> 1 p is essential for survival of yeast cells at high osmolarity. However, expression of constitutively active mutant kinases, such as those encoded by SSK 2 deltaN and PBS 2 (DD), is toxic and results in a lethal level of <b>Hog</b> 1 p activation. Overexpression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptp 2 p suppresses the lethality of these mutations by dephosphorylating <b>Hog</b> 1 p. A catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser Ptp 2 p mutant (Ptp 2 (C/S) p) is tightly bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated <b>Hog</b> 1 p in vivo. Disruption of PTP 2 leads to elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated <b>Hog</b> 1 p following exposure of cells to high osmolarity. Disruption of both PTP 2 and another protein tyrosine phosphatase gene, PTP 3, results in constitutive <b>Hog</b> 1 p tyrosine phosphorylation {{even in the absence of}} increased osmolarity. Thus, Ptp 2 p and Ptp 3 p are the major phosphatases responsible for the tyrosine dephosphorylation of <b>Hog</b> 1 p. When catalytically inactive <b>Hog</b> 1 (K/N) p is expressed in <b>hog</b> 1 delta cells, it is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. In contrast, <b>Hog</b> 1 (K/N) p, expressed together with wild-type <b>Hog</b> 1 p, is tyrosine phosphorylated only when cells are exposed to high osmolarity. Thus, the kinase activity of <b>Hog</b> 1 p is required for its own tyrosine dephosphorylation. Northern blot analyses suggest that <b>Hog</b> 1 p regulates Ptp 2 p and/or Ptp 3 p activity at the posttranscriptional level...|$|R
25|$|The first {{dedicated}} war galleys {{fitted with}} rams were built with a {{mortise and tenon}} technique, a so-called shell-first method. In this, the planking of the hull {{was strong enough to}} hold the ship together structurally, and was also watertight without the need for caulking. Hulls had sharp bottoms without keelsons in order to support the structure and were reinforced by transverse framing secured with dowels with nails driven through them. To prevent the hull from <b>hogging</b> there was a hypozoma, a thick cable that connected bow with stern. It was kept taut to add strength to the construction along its length, but its exact design or the method of tightening is not known. The ram, the primary weapon of ancient galleys from around the 8th to the 4th century, was not attached directly on the hull but to a structure extending from it. This way the ram could twist off if got stuck after ramming rather than breaking the integrity of the hull. The ram fitting consisted of a massive, projecting timber and the ram itself was a thick bronze casting with horizontal blades that could weigh from 400kg up to 2 tonnes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impact of {{structural}} changes in <b>hog</b> production manure management practices.
