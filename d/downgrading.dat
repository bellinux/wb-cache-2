5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Oman, the cyclone briefly re-intensified slightly, possibly {{due to the}} warm waters. However, increasing wind shear and entrainment of dry air from the Arabian Peninsula continued to remove deep convection from its eastern semicircle. On June 6, the cyclone turned to the north-northwest, and later that day the JTWC downgraded Gonu to tropical storm status. The IMD followed suit by <b>downgrading</b> Gonu to severe cyclonic storm status and later to cyclonic storm status early on June 7. Gonu crossed the Makran coast in Iran six hours later and the IMD stopped issuing advisories on the cyclone. This made it the first tropical cyclone on record to hit the country since 1898. After landfall, Gonu persisted as a remnant low over Iran through June 8.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that the stock market reacts negatively to bond rating <b>downgrades</b> and that <b>downgrades</b> tend to follow periods of negative returns, indicating that at least some <b>downgrades</b> are partially predictable. Hypothesizing that the reaction to a <b>downgrade</b> depends on both the implications for cash flows and the degree of surprise, we explore how the reaction to <b>downgrade</b> announcements varies across bond issues. We find that the equity market reacts much more negatively to bond rating <b>downgrades</b> to and within the speculative bond category than to <b>downgrades</b> within the investment grade category. Within the speculative category, the reaction is stronger, the lower the old and new ratings are. The reaction to multiple-level <b>downgrades</b> is not very different from that to single-level <b>downgrades.</b> The market reaction is also stronger if the firm has experienced negative pre-downgrade abnormal returns. Our evidence indicates that <b>downgrades</b> are viewed by the market as providing information on likely future earnings before interest charges, not just likely future interest charges. It is also consistent with Billett 2 ̆ 7 s (1996) hypothesis that low rated debt makes a firm less attractive as a takeover target...|$|R

40|$|Since June 2007, the {{creditworthiness}} of {{structured finance}} products has deteriorated rapidly.

40|$|This paper studies short-selling {{prior to}} the release of analyst <b>downgrades</b> in a sample of 670 <b>downgrades</b> of NASDAQ stocks between 2000 and 2001. We {{document}} abnormal levels of short-selling in the three days before <b>downgrades</b> are publicly announced. Further, we show that this pre-announcement abnormal short-selling is significantly related to the subsequent share price reaction to the <b>downgrade,</b> and especially so for <b>downgrades</b> that prompt the most substantial price declines. Our findings are robust to various controls that might also affect shortselling such as pre-announcement momentum, three-day pre-announcement returns, and the announcement-day share price. In addition, the results are independent of scheduled earnings announcements, analyst herding, and non-routine events near <b>downgrades.</b> Further evidence suggests that tipping is more consistent with the data than the prediction explanation which posits that short sellers successfully predict <b>downgrades</b> on the basis of public information about firms’ financial health. Finally, we present evidence that <b>downgraded</b> stocks with high abnormal shortselling perform poorly over the subsequent six months by comparison with those with low abnormal short-selling. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that short sellers are informed traders and exploit profitable opportunities contained in <b>downgrade</b> announcements...|$|R
5|$|Upon {{attaining}} typhoon status, Meranti turned {{towards the}} northeast {{in response to}} a strengthening near-equatorial ridge south of the typhoon. Visible satellite images of the typhoon depicted a small, ragged eye within a well-developed cyclone. Gale-force winds extended 155km (100mi) at this time. Well-developed outflow allowed the storm to maintain its peak intensity for roughly 18hours before dry air became entrained in the circulation. The combined effects of decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused Meranti to quickly weaken. By 0600UTC on August6, the eye was no longer visible on satellite imagery and several hours later deep convection rapidly diminished, leading to both agencies <b>downgrading</b> the typhoon to a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Later on November30, the {{depression}} further intensified into a tropical cyclone {{and was given}} the name Trina by the FMS. At this time, gale-force winds were only present in one quadrant of the storm. In previous years, gale-force winds had to be present all around {{the center for the}} system to receive a name. Upon receiving its name, Trina attained its peak intensity with winds of 65km/h (40mph) along with a barometric pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.38inHg). Remaining nearly stationary, Trina succumbed to strong wind shear during the evening of November30. The JTWC only classified Trina as a tropical storm for 12hours before <b>downgrading</b> the system and issuing their final advisory early on December1. However, according to the FMS, the system retained gale-force winds through December2, by which time it was situated about 70km (45mi) northwest of Mangaia. Now significantly displaced from any convective activity, the remnants of Trina persisted in the same general area for several more days before completely dissipating.|$|E
5|$|The bank bailouts and the {{economic}} downturn increased the country's deficit and debt levels {{and led to a}} substantial <b>downgrading</b> of its credit rating. To build up trust in the financial markets, the government began to introduce austerity measures and in 2011 it passed a law in congress to approve an amendment to the Spanish Constitution to require a balanced budget at both the national and regional level by 2020. The amendment states that public debt can not exceed 60% of GDP, though exceptions would be made in case of a natural catastrophe, economic recession or other emergencies. As one of the largest eurozone economies (larger than Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined) the condition of Spain's economy is of particular concern to international observers. Under pressure from the United States, the IMF, other European countries and the European Commission the Spanish governments eventually succeeded in trimming the deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to an 7.1% in 2013.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding}} of stock market reactions to <b>downgrades</b> and of the type of strategic restructuring conducted by MNCs. Reactions of stock prices for the <b>downgraded</b> MNCs in our study were not significantly different from zero on average. Indeed, the announcement may have already been expected by stock analysts and/or the impact on their debt cost and cash flows may have been low if the initial rating was high. However, this average result revealed different situations because only half of the <b>downgrades</b> destroyed stockholder value. The stock price reaction was more than − 5 per cent over the period of (− 1, + 1) days around a <b>downgrade.</b> The reasons for the <b>downgrade</b> (acquisition or operating performance decline) seemed to have limited impact on stock market reactions. In addition, we noticed many operational and financial changes in the six months following a <b>downgrade.</b> Divestiture was the main reaction for enhancing financial flexibility. The measures were all the more significant when the initial rating was low, in particular for non-core asset sales. Their frequency was higher when the initial rating was BBB (corresponding to a <b>downgrade</b> to the BBB− lowest rating in the investment grade). Finally, the reasons for <b>downgrades</b> had an effect on the type of restructuring: a <b>downgrade</b> in a difficult context involved a larger number of financial measures than a <b>downgrade</b> after an acquisition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a <b>downgrade</b> of a company’s credit rating on its stock price in the days surrounding the <b>downgrade.</b> If we consider this <b>downgrade</b> new information, then a negative impact on the company’s stock price would be expected. However, if we assume that rating agencies use information that investors have already accounted for, then there would be no impact.

To perform this analysis I used an event study, a technique commonly used in finance to identify the impact of one event on a particular variable.

5|$|The largest {{change has}} been the <b>downgrading</b> of the former through route of New England Street in favour of a new north–south road, Fleet Street, which diverges to the west.

In contrast, Cheapside is expected to take a much higher volume of traffic, as it becomes the main east-west route in the New England Quarter, taking traffic between London Road and Fleet Street, the main north–south road.

These give access to the car park, Bellerbys College and a new pick-up and drop-off point immediately outside the side entrance to the station.

5|$|Beginning on August15, the NHC began {{forecasting}} {{that the}} hurricane would make landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina within two days. Early on August16, the eye became better defined, although the feature diminished {{within a few}} hours, and the NHC {{was on the verge}} of <b>downgrading</b> Felix to tropical storm status. A break in the ridge allowed Felix to turn to the north, bringing it about 150mi (250km) east of the Outer Banks. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to a northeast drift, and there was initial uncertainty whether Felix would loop back to the west or recurve to the northeast. During this time, the system remained a minimal hurricane, maintaining a large eye about 60 to 80miles (95 to 130km) in diameter, but with weak convection due to cooler air. After the trough that turned Felix to the east-northeast bypassed it to the north, the hurricane turned to the southeast, executing a small loop while northwest of Bermuda. On August20, Felix weakened below hurricane intensity for the first time in nine days, due to cooler waters and increased wind shear. By that time, the convection was removed from the center, and another trough brought the storm to the northeast. While passing east of Newfoundland on August22, Felix became extratropical. The remnants continued to the northeast, eventually passing north of the United Kingdom on August25.|$|E
