40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} udder and teat {{measurements}} on milk yield in Brown Swiss Cows were studied. The {{differences among the}} means for <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat length, <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat diameter, <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> udder height, distance between <b>front</b> teats <b>and</b> mammary type scores in different lactation numbers were statistically significant (P < 0. 001). <b>Front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat length, <b>and</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> udder height after milking were higher than before milking. <b>Front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat diameter, distance between front teats, distance between <b>rear</b> teats <b>and</b> distance between <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teats after milking were lower than before milking. Furthermore, 305 -day milk yield and milk yield per milking were significantly positively correlated with distance between <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teats <b>and</b> mammary type scores before milking (P < 0. 001). The mean values before milking for <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat length, <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat diameter, <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat udder height, distance between front teats, distance between rear teats, distance between <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teats <b>and</b> mammary type scores at general lactation were 59. 45 and 49. 72 mm, 22. 14 and 21. 53 mm, 47. 96 and 47. 59 cm, 12. 29 cm, 7. 76 cm, 9. 58 cm and 23. 65, respectively. In conclusion, teat and udder measurements and mammary type scores significantly affected milk yield.
