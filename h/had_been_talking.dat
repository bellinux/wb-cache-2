5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{psychological}} profile, the Garda broadcast an appeal for information on the RTÉ television programme Crimeline with a request for people whose houses had been broken into in the Grangegorman area to contact them. After interviewing a number of people involved in burglary, they discovered that Dean Lyons <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about the killings. Lyons matched the facial composite released by the gardaí and he was questioned on 26 July 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes, and had {{performed}} publicly {{for the first}} time. Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale {{was kicked out of}} the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties. According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones & His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, and he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling {{that he might be}} on the verge of transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E

25|$|The {{case had}} first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, {{a nurse in}} the {{obstetrics}} ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated {{by the city of}} Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In that conversation she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her interlocutor from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked about what she had said, she was fired.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{incident}} proved counter-productive to the Argentine sovereignty push, as Lord Chalfont <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to {{a public}} meeting {{at the time of}} the plane's arrival. The islanders made it plain to Lord Chalfont that they rejected a Memorandum of Agreement negotiated between Britain and Argentina that August which stated that Britain was prepared to discuss sovereignty provided the islanders' wishes were respected. This spurred the formation of the Falkland Islands Committee by London barrister Bill Hunter-Christie and others. The Emergency Committee, as it became known, proved to be an effective lobbying organisation, constantly undermining Foreign Office initiatives on sovereignty negotiations. In December 1968, the lobbying effort managed to force the British Government to state that the islanders' wishes would be paramount.|$|E

He did so after he logged his 97th career triple-double in a 115–99 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats. Kidd was voted by the fans to start in the 2008 All-Star game in New Orleans as a guard along with Dwyane Wade. During that season Kidd had been mentioned in trade rumors, notably to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the deal fell through when the Lakers {{refused to give up}} their young center Andrew Bynum. On January 28, 2008, Kidd revealed that his agent <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to the Nets' front office about a trade. On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the team that originally drafted him.|$|E
500|$|As a teacher, Rabi was underwhelming. Leon Lederman {{recalled}} {{that after a}} lecture, students would head to the library {{to try to work}} out what Rabi <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about. Irving Kaplan rated Rabi and Harold Urey as [...] "the worst teachers I ever had". Norman Ramsey considered Rabi's lectures [...] "pretty dreadful", while William Nierenberg felt that he was [...] "simply an awful lecturer". Despite his shortcomings as a lecturer, his influence was great. He inspired many of his students to pursue careers in physics, and some became famous.|$|E
500|$|Mersey Beat founder Bill Harry later repudiated {{the story}} about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were, as Harry <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Epstein about the band {{for a long time}} (being the group he {{promoted}} the most in Mersey Beat) and by McCartney saying, “Brian [...] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were, they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat.” Regardless, the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor, during lunch hour on 9 November 1961. He was initially repelled by the dark, damp club, but he congratulated them on their performance.|$|E

500|$|Murrell {{continued}} {{to remain the}} subject of local discussion after his death. Maple believed that the legacy created within these communities {{was a combination of}} both fact and myth, with [...] "Murrell the man" [...] being supplanted by [...] "Murrell the myth", around which a [...] "vast wealth of lore" [...] accrued. Maple noted that many of the attributes associated with witches in British folklore came {{to be associated with the}} cunning man. For instance, he highlighted the existence of local stories that credited Murrell with the ability to fly, and that he was once observed flying over the River Crouch on a broomstick. Another story held that Murrell <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to a group of old men in Canvey Island before suddenly vanishing and reappearing in his own village, which was several miles away.|$|E
500|$|In August 2011, Starkey {{appeared}} as a guest on the BBC's Newsnight programme together with Owen Jones and Dreda Say Mitchell, made during {{a discussion about the}} 2011 England riots. Starkey claimed that [...] "the whites have become black", and that [...] "a particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic, gangster culture has become the fashion". The leader of the Labour party, Ed Miliband, spoke about Starkey's remarks, saying [...] "they are racist comments, frankly". The author Toby Young, blogging in the Telegraph, defended Starkey by claiming that Starkey <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> not about black culture in general. Rod Liddle argued in support of the remarks. Fellow panellist Owen Jones described the comments as [...] "one of the ugliest episodes of the backlash", claiming that [...] "multiculturalism and ethnic groups {{have nothing to do with}} what happened".|$|E
500|$|Epstein saw {{numerous}} posters around Liverpool advertising concerts by the Beatles {{as well as}} in {{the second}} issue of Mersey Beat, which had [...] "Beatles sign Recording Contract!" [...] on the front cover, as the Beatles had recorded the [...] "My Bonnie" [...] single with Tony Sheridan in Germany. Some months after its release, Epstein supposedly (as stated in his biography), asked his assistant Alistair Taylor about the single, because a customer, one Raymond Jones, had asked Epstein for the single on 28 October 1961, which made Epstein curious about the group. Harry and McCartney repudiated this story, as Harry <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Epstein about the Beatles for a long time (being the group he promoted the most in Mersey Beat), and by McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were, they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat." ...|$|E

500|$|Epstein's {{version of}} the story was that {{customer}} Raymond Jones walked into the NEMS shop and asked him for the [...] "My Bonnie" [...] single, which made Epstein curious about the group. Taylor later claimed that he had used the name of Jones (a regular customer) to order the single and paid the deposit, knowing that Epstein would notice it and order further copies. Harry and McCartney later repudiated Epstein's story, as Harry <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Epstein for a long time about the Beatles—the group that he promoted the most in Mersey Beat—with McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were; they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat".

500|$|The {{ideas for}} [...] "One More Day" [...] {{began to develop}} almost two years before its release, at one of Marvel's {{creative}} summits for creators and editors. Quesada, Straczynski, Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, Jeph Loeb, Tom Brevoort and Axel Alonso developed the concept between them, and Ed Brubaker and Dan Slott added more at the next summit. [...] "One More Day" [...] was announced as the concluding storyline of Straczynski's run on Amazing Spider-Man in early 2007, and Quesada was named as the artist for the storyline. Although Quesada had become more selective in choosing projects to do as an artist since becoming editor-in-chief, he felt compelled to do the art for One More Day because he felt {{very close to the}} story, and because since he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about the project for so long, he felt he [...] "needed to put my money where my mouth is." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} radio {{broadcast}} upon seizing power, {{which did not}} occur until 16:00, Khánh assailed the former regime for its performance during its three months at the top. He said [...] "The political, economic, and social situation in the countryside still offers no promising prospect. There has not been one single compensation worthy of the sacrifices accepted daily by the soldiers." [...] He alluded to a neutralist plot, claiming that [...] "some persons" [...] had joined [...] "with the colonialists standing for neutralism in order {{to pave the way}} for the Communists to enslave us". Khánh's broadcast was signed by 17 generals and 32 other senior officers. Many observers were immediately sceptical of the claims of neutralism and regarded personal ambition as the motivating factor all along. An anonymous source close to the plotters told The New York Times that [...] "We were anxious about them indeed...and we had conclusive proof that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with the French in terms of a neutralized Vietnam and that North Vietnam had given support to the plan", explicitly naming Kim and Xuan.|$|E
