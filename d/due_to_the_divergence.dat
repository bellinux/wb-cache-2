40|$|We {{study the}} issue of {{defining}} the discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ) in perturbative string theory as a light-like limit. While this limit is unproblematic at the classical level, it is non-trivial at <b>the</b> quantum level <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>divergences</b> by <b>the</b> zero-mode loops. We reconsider this problem in bosonic string theory. We construct the multi-loop scattering amplitudes in both open and closed string theories by using the method of Kikkawa, Sakita and Virasoro (KSV), and then we show that these scattering amplitudes are perfectly well-defined in this limit. We also discuss the vacuum amplitudes of the string theory.

50|$|Berg {{winds are}} usually {{accompanied}} by coastal lows. These coastal lows owe their existence to {{the configuration of}} the plateau, escarpment and coastal plain (see diagram on the right, above), in that they are confined to the coastal areas, always below the escarpment. Though they can arise almost anywhere along the coast, they often first appear on the west coast, or even on the Namibian coast. They are then always propagated counter-clockwise along South Africa's coastline at between 30-60 km/h, from the west coast southwards to the Cape Peninsula and then eastward along the south coast, and finally north-eastward along the KwaZuluNatal coastline, to finally dissipate north of Durban, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>divergence</b> of the coastline from the plateau which disappears altogether {{in the vicinity of the}} Limpopo valley. There is always a hot off-shore berg wind ahead of a coastal low, which can blow for several days or for only for a few hours. This is then followed by cool onshore winds which bring low cloud, fog or drizzle to the region, but may, on occasions, produce substantial precipitation when coupled to an approaching cold front.|$|E
