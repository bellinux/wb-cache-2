Mach. Intell., 25 (9) : 1172 - 1177, 2003] relies upon adoption of a certain model for statistical data distribution.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) {{edible oil}} analysis package designed to simultaneously analyze for trans content, cis content, iodine value (IV), and saponification num-ber (SN) of neat {{fats and oils}} by using calibrations based on pure triglycerides and derived by application of partial-least-squares (PLS) regression was assessed and validated. More than 100 hy-drogenated rapeseed and soybean samples were analyzed by using the edible oil analysis package {{as well as the}} newly pro-posed modification of the AOCS IR trans method with trielaidin in a trans-free oil as a basis for calibration. In addition, ~ 1 / 3 of the samples were subsequently reanalyzed by gas chromatogra-phy (GC) for IV and trans content. The PLS approach predicted somewhat higher trans values than the modified AOCS IR method, which was traced to a combination of the inclusion of trilinolelaidin in the calibration set and the effects of baseline fluctuations. Eliminating trilinolelaidin from the triglyceride standards and the use of second-derivative spectra to remove baseline fluctuations produced excellent concurrence between the PLS and modified AOCS IR methods (mean difference of 0. 61 % trans). Excellent internal consistency was obtained be-tween the IV and cis and <b>trans</b> <b>data</b> provided by the edible oil analysis package, and the relationship was close to that theoret-ically expected [IV = 0. 86 (cis + trans) ]. The IV data calculated for the GC-analyzed samples matched the PLS IV predictions within 1 IV unit. The trans results obtained by both IR methods were linearly related to the GC data; however, as is commonly observed, the GC values were significantly lower than the IR values, the GC and IR data being related by a slope factor of ~ 0. 88, with an SD of ~ 0. 80. The concurrence between the <b>trans</b> <b>data</b> obtained by the two FTIR methods, and between the FTIR and GC–IV data, as well as {{the internal consistency of the}} IV, cis and trans FTIR predictions, provides strong experimental ev-idence that the edible oil analytical package measures all three variables accurately...|$|R

In this approach we adopt optimality criteria of minimal spatial-features combined uncertainty, as well as tightness of the frame tessellating this combined space. In this work, scalings in the x and y directions, allowing for independent dilations in these two directions, as well as rotations and translations are allowed. For each discrete set of scalings, rotations and translations the frame bounds are calculated. For frames where the frame operator is well approximated by a multiple of the identity, we use the same set of functions in the analysis and synthesis, as though the frame is equivalent to an orthogonal basis. Moreover, we show {{that in the case of}} independent scalings in the x and y directions, the number of dominant (characteristic) orientations of the filter bank may depend on scale.
