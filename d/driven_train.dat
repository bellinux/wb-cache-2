50|$|It {{is planned}} to use Intamin People Mover P30 {{monorail}} trains, an electric <b>driven</b> <b>train</b> especially designed and most suitable for commuter services in cities. It is the most recent model of its kind and characterized by modern design, spacious cabins, and wide doors for easy access for passengers with luggage. The train runs on rubber wheels which are connected to bogies, and is laterally guided by means of side guiding wheels. The rubber-steel interface between train and guideway will have a good friction coefficient, leading to decreased vibration transmission to the train from the track. These attributes leads to higher ride quality and passenger comfort.|$|E

The boulevard along the shore is not spoiled by large hotels or apartment blocks and has not given in to an excessive commercialisation. Although most buildings lining the boulevard are tourist apartments and pensions, most are just three floors high (and none more than 5) and offer a distinctive 'feel' of the 1950s. Besides the beach, {{there are a few}} museums in Katwijk, like the old fisherman's museum Katwijks Museum and the Spinoza-museum. A few kilometers inland is the Valkenburg Lake Steam Train, a narrow gauge railway museum where a scenic steam locomotive <b>driven</b> <b>train</b> ride can be taken around Lake Valkenburg. Katwijk has many hotels and three camping places, mostly situated in the dunes.|$|E

40|$|TutorialWherever a {{variable}} speed gas compression train {{is needed for}} Oil & Gas upstream applications {{as well as for}} gas storage applications the primary decision has to be made between a gas turbine driver and an electric motor controlled by {{a variable}} frequency drive (VFD). A second decision has to be made between a high speed direct <b>driven</b> <b>train</b> and a low speed driver (gas turbine or motor) driving the compressor via a speed increasing gear. Finally it has to be decided whether a classical, oil lubricated train arrangement shall be used or if a high speed, oil-free, magnetic bearing levitated train configuration shall be chosen. With these three major decisions a variety of different train configurations are possible. They differ from each other in many technical aspects and therefore have strengths and weaknesses which can be rated in order to facilitate the evaluation of the optimum equipment configuration for a certain application. This paper specifically concentrates on the comparison of rotordynamic key figures like the logarithmic decrement (damping) of the lowest bending mode, the presence of overhung coupling modes within the speed range or the presence of torsional critical speeds which can be excited within the speed range and which therefore might adversely affect the integrity of the train components. The evaluated configurations include modern hermetically sealed, oil-free, magnetic bearing levitated compressor designs. Based on these key figures this paper will benchmark the rotordynamic robustness as well as the operational safety of the investigated train configurations...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of quinidine and mexiletine on the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to a change in heart rate. The ventricular effective refractory period was measured at a basic drive cycle length of 500 msec with basic <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> durations of two beats, eight beats, 20 beats and 3 minutes. The ventricular refractory periods were measured in the baseline state and after oral treatment with quinidine or mexiletine in 20 subjects each. In the baseline state, there was progressive shortening of the ventricular refractory period as the <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> duration increased from two beats to 3 minutes. Quinidine prolonged refractoriness by 5 % (p < 0. 001) at each <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> duration.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the design and}} production of highly efficient and reliable wind turbine <b>drive</b> <b>trains,</b> the project deals with the mathematical modelling and experimental study of <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> system dynamics. A typical <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> is considered as the subsystem of a wind turbine that transfers mechanical power from the rotor hub to the generator, and thereby {{plays an important role}} in the system dynamics and efficiency of wind turbine operation. The dynamics of wind turbines is complex and a critical area of study for the wind industry. The multidisciplinary nature of wind turbine design adds to the complexity of this task, as the subsystems of a wind turbine need to be tuned with respect to a common objective to achieve a cost effective and optimum structural performance. The current work contributes to enhanced knowledge in this field with focus on interaction between functional components and system dynamic response, faults modelling and detectability of defects in bearings in wind turbine <b>drive</b> <b>trains.</b> The overall performance of a <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> can be evaluated from different perspectives. In this thesis, the dynamics behaviour of the high speed shaft <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> is evaluated by proposed objective functions referring to displacements, loads, and frequency responses. To have a better insight into wind turbine dynamics, the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of high speed shaft <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> dynamics with respect to input structural parameters is considered. The multiplicative dimension reduction method is employed to provide the mapping between the objective functions' sensitivity indices and design variables. The results of such analysis can narrow down the number of input variables for design problem and improve the computational efficiency. The proposed GSA methodology is applied for the system modelled analysis of high speed shaft subsystem of a <b>drive</b> <b>train.</b> Moreover, by introducing defects in functional components and investigating sensitivity indices, detectability of faults by GSA is proved. The results show that the proposed methodology is capable of detecting damage in the functional components such as bearings in early stage before a complete failure. The application of this methodology within the detection, prediction, and prevention framework has a potential to reduce the maintenance cost for critical components. The results can also provide a better understanding and useful hints in wind turbine <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> system dynamics with respect to different structural parameters, ultimately designing more efficient <b>drive</b> <b>trains...</b>|$|R

A typical wind turbine <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> consists of a rotor, gearbox and generator. The dynamic modelling of epicyclic gearbox that exists in wind turbine is challenging {{due to the fact}} that it has both rotating and orbiting gears. The dynamic equations of motion are obtained based on the rigid multibody modelling with discrete flexibility approach by Lagrange’s formulation. The dynamic model accounts for the time varying gear tooth mesh stiffness, linear stiffness of bearings and torsional shaft stiffness. The aerodynamic torque that a wind turbine <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> subjected to, is modelled based on the simplified method for load calculation in wind turbine, Danish Standard DS 472. The characteristic load value acting per unit length at the two-thirds length of the blade is used for calculating the total load of the torsional moment.
