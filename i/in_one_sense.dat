Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>sense,</b> the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E

50|$|Psychologist J. C. Flugel {{concluded}} that styles of dress affect one's appearance, yet triggering feelings that enable role performance.

30|$|In this paper, we set {{the length}} of the pilot as M and the total number of {{multipath}} as L. For the sake of convenience, the sampling size <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sensing</b> slot equals to {{the length of}} pilot and the sampling point is supposed to keep accordance with the change of pilot elements. Furthermore, the PU state is assumed unchanged in a sensing slot. The period of sensing slot is set to be Ts, the sampling period is illustrated by τ, and the channel coherent time is denoted by Tc. There are quantitative relationships among the aforementioned variables, i.e., Ts[*]=[*]M[*]×[*]τ, Tc[*]=[*]Ts/fd. Here, fd represents the Doppler frequency.|$|R

The simple condition, which is that the satellite can give a perfect decision on the channel states and the number of the idle channels is fixed, is first considered. Then, we discuss how the throughput changes under the imperfect detection and the fixed idle channel. Finally, a more universal condition where every channel becomes busy with a specific probability <b>in</b> <b>one</b> frame is considered. In addition, it is assumed that there will be always at least <b>one</b> packet <b>in</b> the buffer of satellite earth station for simplicity as Ref [9].|$|R

The duality of their legislative system and the far-reaching consequences of the conflict between Greece and Turkey which extend into virtually every facet of Cyprus society serve as further indication of the complexity in establishing a concrete and unified definition of nationality in Cyprus.|$|R

Specifically, we predicted that the regulation of food intake by women is embodied in their feelings of physical cleanliness. Study 1 found that failures of restrained eating (i. e., overeating) increased accessibility of physical cleanliness-related words for women, but not men. Study 2 found that increased negative moral emotions fully mediated the effect of overeating on a desire for physical cleanliness. Overall, the studies argue {{for the importance of}} morality in restrained eating and in the central role of emotions in the embodiment of cognitive metaphors. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

Further research employing technologically advanced high resolution imaging and larger samples is needed to clarify and enhance the current evidence.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) offer a unique solution that encompasses not only target species for harvesting, but also the interactions surrounding them and the local environment as a whole. Direct benefits of MPAs to fisheries (for example, spillover effects) have been well documented around the world. Indirect benefits have also been shown for several cases among species such as abalone and fishes in Central California. Most importantly, MPAs can be effective at protecting existing kelp forest ecosystems and may also allow for the regeneration of those that have been affected.|$|E

Note that Scriabin did not, for his theory, recognize a difference between a major and a minor tonality of the same name (for example: c-minor and C-Major). Indeed, influenced also by the doctrines of theosophy, he developed his system of synesthesia toward what would have been a pioneering multimedia performance: his unrealized magnum opus Mysterium was to have been a grand week-long performance including music, scent, dance, and light {{in the foothills of the}} Himalayas Mountains that was somehow to bring about the dissolution of the world in bliss.|$|E
