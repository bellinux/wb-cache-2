5|$|Although Congressional {{investigations}} {{focused on}} whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas. On July 31, 2008, a United States district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas.|$|E
5|$|Molecular studies {{based on}} DNA {{analysis}} have suggested new relationships among mammal families {{over the last}} few years. Most of these <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} age, {{conflicting}} <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reported. A study by Einarsen and Skogstad (1996) indicates older employees {{tend to be}} more likely to be bullied than younger ones.|$|E
25|$|<b>Findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{contradictory}} as {{to whether}} coffee has any specific health benefits, and results are similarly conflicting regarding the potentially harmful effects of coffee consumption. Furthermore, results and generalizations are complicated by differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, author Russell Edwards {{claimed to}} have proved Kosminski's guilt using {{mitochondrial}} DNA evidence from a shawl he {{believed to have been}} left at a murder scene. His claim has not been published or verified by the peer-review process, and his methods and <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> criticised.|$|E
50|$|Matsuzawa is {{well known}} for his {{research}} on chimpanzee memory, which suggests that chimpanzees outperform humans on some simple memory tasks. He has argued that this is evidence of a memorial capacity in young chimpanzees that is superior to that seen in adult humans. However, the accuracy of these <b>findings</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> disputed. Silberberg & Kearns (2008) have argued that the performance difference between human and chimpanzee trials can be explained by training effects on the tested chimpanzees. This <b>finding</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> replicated on a popular German science television show.|$|R
30|$|Lee (2013) {{classified}} {{the research}} findings in WCF: Research <b>findings</b> that <b>have</b> not <b>been</b> well applied such as amount of feedback, choice of WCF strategies, which errors should be corrected, and student uptake; research <b>findings</b> that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reasonably well applied including {{need to act}} upon WCF and timely WCF; and research <b>findings</b> that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> over-applied.|$|R
50|$|A first inquiry {{conducted}} by the Commissioner for Railway Safety attributed the cause of train accident to a tornado. This <b>finding</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widely disputed by the general public.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} archaeological <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{interpreted}} as {{documentation of the}} Cretan pederastic rites. At a rustic shrine dedicated to Hermes and Aphrodite, at Kato Syme, approximately sixty kilometers east of Hagia Triada, excavations led by Angeliki Lembessi have uncovered numerous bronze objects and remains of animal sacrifices.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} factor {{found to be}} associated with antibiotic resistance is the decrease in the virulence capabilities of the resistant strain. Such <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reported in the case of rifampicin-resistant and colistin-resistant strains, in which decrease in infective ability, quorum sensing and motility have been documented.|$|E
25|$|Compared to Israel, archaeological {{knowledge}} about Jordan (formerly Transjordan) is limited. Two universities, the University of Jordan and Yarmouk University, offer archeology studies. Apart {{from the work}} of the official antiquities department, there are many foreign-educated professional archaeologists in Jordan, working on dozens of field projects. <b>Findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> published in the four-volume Studies in the History and Archaeology of Jordan (1982–1992).|$|E

25|$|Another mysterious {{document}} that Rebbe Nachman dictated to Reb Noson is the Megillat Setarim ("Hidden Scroll"), {{which was written}} in a cryptic combination of Hebrew initials and brief phrases. Prof. Zvi Mark has researched and attempted to decipher this document, based on disclosures from prominent members of the Breslov community. His <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> published in Hebrew and in English translation, along with facsimiles of discrepant manuscript copies.|$|E
25|$|Besides prehistoric rock-carvings to {{be found}} {{especially}} along the Yenisei banks, the first internationally important archaeological <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> near Arzhan, in the north central Tuva. Here, Scythian kurgan burials are being researched, revealing the earliest (7th, 6th century BC) and easternmost remains {{of these people who}} spread all the way to Europe. Their story and fantastic gold treasures can be appreciated in the National Museum in Kyzyl.|$|E
25|$|Not all of Hofmann's <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deemed fraudulent. A {{document}} {{called the}} 'Anthon transcript' that allegedly contains reformed Egyptian characters from the Book of Mormon plates {{is still in}} dispute, although the characters have been highly circulated both by the Church and other individuals. Due to Hofmann's methods, the authenticity {{of many of the}} documents he sold to the Church and the Smithsonian will likely never be sorted out.|$|E
50|$|Gamma rays {{mostly with}} {{energies}} between 2 and 10 GeV <b>have</b> <b>been</b> detected by the Fermi satellite. The radiation from Reticulum II is more significant that other dwarf galaxy emissions. However this <b>finding</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> contested.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, doubt over the {{authenticity}} or reliability of transcripts {{of the trial}} has meant {{that much of the}} analysis of the trial's <b>findings</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> undertaken with a degree of scepticism.|$|R

Leadership for the program comes from the Menlo Park division of the Palo Alto VA system.|$|E
25|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} Islam {{on the status of}} women, many writers have discussed the status of women in pre-Islamic Arabia, and their <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mixed. Some writers have argued that women before Islam were more liberated drawing most often on the first marriage of Muhammad and that of Muhammad's parents, but also on other points such as worship of female idols at Mecca. Other writers, on the contrary, have argued that women's status in pre-Islamic Arabia was poor, citing practices of female infanticide, unlimited polygyny, patrilineal marriage and others.|$|E
25|$|The ACS {{has sought}} to compile details of all known {{historically}} significant matches and has widened its scope to include details of other competitions such as the Minor Counties Cricket Championship and the Second XI Championship in England. The bulk of its research concerns those matches that are officially or unofficially recognised as first-class or List A limited overs cricket. The <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> published in-house in various guides (see list below) and in the Association's quarterly journal The Cricket Statistician. The Who's Who of first-class Cricketers {{is one of the}} few commercially published works.|$|E

25|$|MHC may {{be related}} to mate choice in some human populations, a theory that found support by studies by Ober and colleagues in 1997, as well as by Chaix and colleagues in 2008. However, the latter <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> controversial. If it exists, the {{phenomenon}} might be mediated by olfaction, as MHC phenotype appears strongly involved in the strength and pleasantness of perceived odour of compounds from sweat. Fatty acid esters—such as methyl undecanoate, methyl decanoate, methyl nonanoate, methyl octanoate, and methyl hexanoate—show strong connection to MHC.|$|E
25|$|The eoxins (EXC4, EXD4, EXE5) are newly described. They stimulate {{vascular}} permeability in an ex vivo human vascular endothelial model system, {{and in a}} small {{study of}} 32 volunteers EXC4 production by eosinophils isolated from severe and aspirin-intolerant asthmatics was greater than that from healthy volunteers and mild asthmatic patients; these <b>findings</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> suggested {{to indicate that the}} eoxins have pro-inflammatory actions and therefore potentially involved in various allergic reactions. Production of eoxins by Reed-Sternburg cells has also led to suggestion that they are involve in Hodgkins disease. However, the clinical significance of eoxins has not yet been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of scientists who study climate change agree that human activity is responsible for changing the climate. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{is one of the}} largest bodies of international scientists ever assembled to study a scientific issue, involving more than 2,500 scientists from more than 130 countries. The IPCC has concluded that most of the warming observed during the past 50 years is attributable to human activities.
