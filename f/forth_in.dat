When the bell was struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together.

When {{the fruit of the}} two founders' renewed efforts was brought <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it.

5|$|In {{the course}} of Romanization, the Celtic polytheism of the local tribes was merged – syncretized – with the Roman religion. The Celtic deities came to be worshiped under {{the names of their}} Roman counterparts. Thus Lugus was {{replaced}} by Mercury, Belenus by Apollo, Taranis by Jupiter and so <b>forth,</b> <b>in</b> a practice called interpretatio romana by Caesar, who pioneered it. Roman gods also acquired the names of local gods as epithets; thus Mars was venerated as Mars Caturix, Mercury as Mercurius Cissonius and Jupiter as Jupiter Poeninus after the god of the Pennine Alps.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is practised by {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and the leaf scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. In the fish species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving back and <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> the surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E

5|$|While Galileo's {{application}} of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative, his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day, including dozens {{of examples of}} an inverse proportion square root method passed down from Fibonacci and Archimedes. The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the Eudoxian theory of proportion, as set <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> the fifth book of Euclid's Elements. This theory had become available only a century before, thanks to accurate translations by Tartaglia and others; {{but by the end}} of Galileo's life, it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of Descartes.|$|E

5|$|Although MalcolmX {{retained}} {{final approval}} of their hybrid text, {{he was not}} privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so <b>forth.</b> <b>In</b> late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past MalcolmX,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of MalcolmX had begun well prior to his assassination.|$|E
5|$|As Bagramyan pushed towards Vitebsk, {{his forces}} were {{aided by the}} same Belorussian guerrilla fighters who had escaped the German encirclement in April. They {{provided}} vital intelligence, including information on the location of bridges and troop movements, and launched attacks against German logistic lines. On 22 June 1944, Bagration began as Bagramyan proceeded in moving westwards as previously planned. However, a widening gap on the Front's northern flank grew as it advanced while the Second Baltic Front, tasked to help defend that area, took no action. Stalin agreed to send a tank corps to reinforce Bagramyan's forces but ordered him to capture Polotsk, which would sever Army Group North's communication lines and open up a route towards the central Baltic. By 3 July, his troops had accomplished the tasks set <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> the directive, destroyed the Third Panzer Army and captured Polotsk. For his achievements, on 7 July he was decorated with the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation Cockade, a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; Operation Rankin, a plan for measures {{to be taken in}} the case of a sudden German collapse; and Operation Overlord, a plan for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July. The plan set <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E
