40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to approach the problem of determining the transport conditions (and effects of residual acceleration) during the plane-front directional solidification of a tin-bismuth alloy under low gravity conditions. The work involves {{using a combination of}} 2 - and 3 -D numerical models, scaling analyses, ID models and the results of ground-based and low-gravity experiments. The latter are to be conducted during the MEPHISTO experiment scheduled for USMP- 3 in early 1996. The models will be used to predict the response of the transport conditions and consequent solute segregation in <b>directionally</b> <b>solidifying</b> tin-bismuth melt. Real-time Seebeck voltage variations across a Sn-Bi melt during directional solidification in MEPHISTO on USMP- 1 show a distinct variation which can be correlated with thruster firings. The Seebeck voltage measurement is related to the response of the instantaneous average melt composition at the melt-solid interface. This allows a direct comparison of numerical simulations with the Seebeck signals obtained on USMP- 1. The effects of such accelerations on composition for a <b>directionally</b> <b>solidifying</b> Sn-Bi alloy have been simulated numerically. USMP- 1 acceleration data was used to assist in our choice of acceleration magnitude and orientation. The results show good agreement with experimental observations. The USMP- 3 experiments took place earlier this year (February 22 through March 6). There were several differences between the USMP- 3 experiments as compared to USMP- 1. Firstly a more concentrated alloy was solidified and, secondly, Primary Reaction Control System thruster burns were requested at particular times during four separate growth runs. This allowed us to monitor the response Seebeck response under well-characterized growth conditions. In addition, we carried out simulations during the experiment in order to interpret the Seebeck signal. Preliminary results are described here...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research done}} {{to apply the}} Fractional Step Method to finite-element simulations of natural convective flows in pure liquids, permeable media, and in a <b>directionally</b> <b>solidified</b> metal alloy casting. The Fractional Step Method has been applied commonly to high Reynold's number flow simulations, but is less common for low Reynold's number flows, such as natural convection in liquids and in permeable media. The Fractional Step Method offers increased speed and reduced memory requirements by allowing non-coupled solution of the pressure and the velocity components. The Fractional Step Method has particular benefits for predicting flows in a <b>directionally</b> <b>solidified</b> alloy, since other methods presently employed are not very efficient. Previously, the most suitable method for predicting flows in a <b>directionally</b> <b>solidified</b> binary alloy was the penalty method. The penalty method requires direct matrix solvers, due to the penalty term. The Fractional Step Method allows iterative solution of the finite element stiffness matrices, thereby allowing more efficient solution of the matrices. The Fractional Step Method also lends itself to parallel processing, since the velocity component stiffness matrices can be built and solved independently of each other. The finite-element simulations of a <b>directionally</b> <b>solidified</b> casting are used to predict macrosegregation in <b>directionally</b> <b>solidified</b> castings. In particular, the finite-element simulations predict the existence of 'channels' within the processing mushy zone and subsequently 'freckles' within the fully processed solid, which are known to result from macrosegregation, or what {{is often referred to}} as thermo-solutal convection. These freckles cause material property non-uniformities in <b>directionally</b> <b>solidified</b> castings; therefore many of these castings are scrapped. The phenomenon of natural convection in an alloy under-going directional solidification, or thermo-solutal convection, will be explained. The development of the momentum and continuity equations for natural convection in a fluid, a permeable medium, and in a binary alloy undergoing directional solidification will be presented. Finally, results for natural convection in a pure liquid, natural convection in a medium with a constant permeability, and for directional solidification will be presented...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{vertical}} Bridgman-Stockbarger apparatus {{was used}} to <b>directionally</b> <b>solidify</b> water upward, {{in the hope that}} detached solidification would evolve from gas bubbles forming on the wall. A large contact angle of the water on the ampoule wall and a high solubility of the dissolved gas caused gas bubbles or tubes to form only at the ampoule wall, and not in the interior. Gas tubes were often nearly periodically spaced around the ampoule wall, with a spacing that increased with ampoule diameter and decreased with freezing rate. The width of the gas tubes was nearly independent of the ampoule diameter and freezing rate. A high degree of detachment was obtained with a rough, nonwetting coating on the ampoule wall, but full detachment was not achieved. This indicates that detachment does not occur by propagation of a single gas bubble around the periphery of the freezing interface. The convection near the freezing interface influenced gas bubble formation, and was outward for a concave freezing interface and inward for a convex interface...|$|R

This allows us to unify the (JH) calculation schemes for both in-variant as well as multi-variant eutectic reactions. The derived analytical expressions are then utilized to study the effect of dissimilar solute diffusivities and interfacial energies on the undercoolings and the solidified fractions.
