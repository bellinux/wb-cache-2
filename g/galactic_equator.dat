The galactic plane of the Milky Way intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the galactic anticenter is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga.

5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the <b>galactic</b> <b>equator.</b> In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an {{efficiency}} comparison {{was made for}} three different monitoring algorithms in order to simulate the response of rotating monitoring systems. Burst-events counting on a spherical surface were simulated as a system, with a one or more detectors located {{on the center of}} a sphere. The burst-events direction was randomly changed at steps analogous to the monitoring period and the monitoring was simulated in Monte Carlo calculations for three separate models: In the first model, the random direction, the detection vector was randomly changed after each step using two isotropic distributed random variables. In the second model, the sphere stripping the detection vector was pointed to the upper latitude. The whole sphere was scanned through a full monitoring period. In the second model, the quadrantic stripping, four quadrants were defined for each hemisphere, in the step-by-step completion of the whole segment angular detection vector ranges. This method was set to present an equivalent of a bundled detectors array and has an enhancing monitoring ability. It may be applied on galactic oriented objects, distributed along the <b>galactic</b> sphere <b>Equator.</b> The 10 6 steps scored events from each of the three algorithms in very similar probabilities. Only after increasing the number of events from 10 6 to 10 7, the random model showed an improved scoring algorithm compared to the other two patterned monitoring algorithms. The sphere-stripping algorithm was proven to be 25 % more efficient compared to the quadrantic algorithm, and is therefore the preferred patterned monitoring algorithm...|$|R

Secular evolution of orbital elements is presented. New terms generated by the Sun's oscillation about the galactic plane are considered. The inclusion of the new terms into the equation of motion of the comet leads to orbital evolution which may be significantly different from the conventional approach.

40|$|We {{test for}} {{foreground}} residuals {{in the foreground}} cleaned Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps outside and inside U 73 mask commonly used for cosmological analysis. The aim {{of this paper is}} to introduce a new method to validate masks by looking at the differences in cleaned maps obtained by different component separation methods. By analyzing the power spectrum as well as the mean, variance and skewness of needlet coefficients on bands outside and inside the U 73 mask we first confirm that the pixels already masked by U 73 are highly contaminated and cannot be used for cosmological analysis. We further find that the U 73 mask needs extension in order to reduce large scale foreground residuals to a level of less than 20 % of the standard deviation of CMB fluctuations within the bands closest to the <b>galactic</b> <b>equator.</b> We also find 276 point sources in the cleaned foreground maps which are currently not masked by the U 73 mask.
