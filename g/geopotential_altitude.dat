40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} in many {{aerospace}} applications for a meaningful reference atmosphere characteristic of {{the whole of the}} tropics in both the northern and southern hemispheres of the globe, a proposal was made earlier by the authors for altitudes up to 80 km. This proposal is here based on balloonsonde, rocketsonde, grenade, falling sphere and satellite data in the range 0 to 100 km, and on the MSIS- 83 model from 100 to 1000 km. The proposal consists of linear segments in the temperature distribution with values in degrees Celsius of 27, − 9, − 74, − 5,− 5, − 74 and − 80. 4 at <b>geopotential</b> <b>altitudes</b> of 0, 6, 16, 46, 51, 74 and 84. 69 km (= 86 km geometric altitude) respectively, beyond which the description is in terms of geometric altitude. A linear segment between 86 and 97 km with a lapse rate of $ 0. 6 ^ 0 C/km$ is followed by an elliptic variation commencing with atemperature gradient of zero at 97 km to reach at 110 km a temperature of $− 45 ^ 0 C$ with a gradient of $ 15 ^ 0 C/km$. This gradient remains constant up to 120 km where the temperature is $ 105 ^ 0 C$. Beyond 120 km the temperature distribution follows a Bates type of profile up to 1000 km to reach a value there of $ 760 ^ 0 C$. A sea level pressure of 1010 mb and an acceleration due to gravity of $ 9. 78852 ms^{- 2 }$ corresponding to the Tropic of Cancer are used in the preparation of the atmospheric tables...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{looking at}} the various colossal interferometers, etc., {{discussed}} at this conference to test gravitational theory, one cannot avoid feeling that easier approaches exist. The use of low velocity, neutral atom matter waves in place of electromagnetic waves in sensitive inertial interferometer configurations is proposed. For applications, spacecraft experiments to sense a drag-free condition, to measure the Lense-Thirring precession, to measure the gravitomagnetic effect and/or the earth's <b>geopotential</b> (depending on <b>altitude),</b> and to detect long period gravitational waves are considered. Also, a terrestrial precision test of the equivalence principle on spin polarized atoms, capable of detecting effects of the 5 th force is considered. While the ideas described herein are preliminary, the orders of magnitude are sufficiently tantalizing to warrant further study. Although existing proposed designs may be adequate {{for some of these}} experiments, the use of matter-wave interferometry offers reduced complexity and cost, and an absence of cryogenics...|$|R

[...] This <b>geopotential</b> <b>altitude</b> h is then used instead of geometric altitude z in the hydrostatic equations.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} balloon-borne radiosonde {{employed for}} synoptic meteorology provides vertical profiles of temperature, pressure, and humidity {{as a function}} of elapsed time. These parameters are used in the hypsometric equation to calculate the <b>geopotential</b> <b>altitude</b> at each sampling point during the balloon's flight. It is important that the vertical location information be accurate. The present investigation was conducted with the objective to evaluate the altitude determination accuracy of the standard radiosonde throughout the entire balloon profile. The tests included two other commercially available pressure sensors {{to see if they could}} provide improved accuracy in the stratosphere. The pressure-measuring performance of standard baroswitches, premium baroswitches, and hypsometers in balloon-borne sondes was correlated with tracking radars. It was found that the standard and premium baroswitches perform well up to about 25 km altitude, while hypsometers provide more reliable data above 25 km...|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{thoroughly}} examines influences, which {{directly affect}} mercury barometer readings. In {{order to obtain}} true values of the air pressure, the following influences {{must be taken into}} consideration: mercury temperature, Earth's gravity, correction of the instrumental error, which includes the influence of inaccurate instrument setting and the influence of scale error, capillarity and defective vacuum space. With regard to the indicated influences the value of air pressure is obtained at standard temperature and gravity. For the purpose of individual barometer readings comparison, the readings must be reduced to the mean sea level or reference level, where the <b>geopotential</b> <b>altitude</b> of a barometer is needed. So as to establish individual corrections, the value of the acceleration of gravity on barometer level and the altitude of the barometer had to be determined. Due to above mentioned influences this thesis discusses the Earth's gravity field and vertical systems that were used. Finally, readings on »Princo 469 NOVATM Economy model« mercury barometer have been made providing that all the required reductions have been carried out...|$|E
40|$|Because {{inception}} {{of a national}} program to implement the International System of Units (SI) appears to be inevitable and imminent, the tables of airspeed, altitude, and Mach number prepared by Livingston and Gracey to serve for airspeed meter and altimeter calibrations and for the conversion of flight measurements of these quantities to related parameters - Mach number, true airspeed, equivalent airspeed, etc. - have been revised to the SI. Tables of airspeed in knots are also included because {{of the significance of}} this quantity in navigation. In addition, the data in the altitude tables have been revised to the U. S. Standard Atmosphere of 1962. The latter data reflect increased knowledge of the higher atmosphere and more precise determination of basic quantities, including the redefinition of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale by the Tenth General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1954. The U. S. Standard Atmosphere, 1962, corresponds to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standard Atmosphere up to 20 kilometers (<b>geopotential</b> <b>altitude).</b> A table of conversion factors for various pressure units is presented in SI Units...|$|E
