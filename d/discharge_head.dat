An EPS production system may use multiple EPS slurry blasting cells arranged in tandem, so the steel strip passes from one cell into the next, then into the next, and so on. Multiple cells increase the exposure of the steel strip to the slurry blast streams, thereby allowing the strip to move faster, yet still achieve the necessary level of scale removal.

Design and implementation details of two different structures of ferrofluid pump are discussed, namely single phase pump and two phase pump.

For a long run, the piping pressure losses increases and the pump efficiency decreases which effect the system requirements of either discharge pressure of flow rate. A hybrid centrifugal-jet pump system is proposed {{in order to enhance}} the centrifugal pump performance to achieve the system requirements. The performance of the centrifugal and the proposed hybrid pumps are performed at a speed 2900 rpm for different ratios of centrifugal and jet pumps flow rates. The effect of the throat ratio (D/L) variation of the jet pump is also investigated at different ratios of D/L= 0. 33, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 66.

The discharge heads of 1 and 2 Â m were tested. The pump could operate at the collector temperature of about 70 - 90 Â Â°C and vapor gage pressure of 10 - 18 Â kPa.

This is observed as a reduction in the discharge current at the time when the <b>discharge</b> <b>head</b> is in the proximity of the probes. The effect is observed for all impulse voltages investigated and for both polarity combinations of initiating impulse voltage and surface charge.

40|$|Summary: This study {{examined}} the association between head size at birth, discharge, and 1 year and developmental outcome at 1 year in preterm infants, with and without intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) or associated periventricular echodensities (PVE). The data indicated that most sick preterm infants with small heads at discharge achieved appropriate head sizes at 1 year. Analyses of the 1 -year mental and motor performances of 125 subjects revealed that for subjects who did not develop ICH, appropriate head sizes at birth and discharge were associated with good developmental outcome, whereas infants with small heads (< two standard deviations below the mean for age) before hospital discharge {{were more likely to}} show poorer developmental outcome at 1 year. For subjects with ICH, birth and <b>discharge</b> <b>head</b> circumference were not predictive of 1 -year developmental status; how-ever, normal head size at 1 year was associated with better outcome. This was true for children with transient PVE as well. However, persistent periventricular echodensities were associated with both mental and motor deficits at 1 year, regardless of head growth.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of scour downstream of a ski-jump bucket has remained inconclusive, despite analysis of numerous prototypes {{as well as}} hydraulic model studies in the past. It {{is partly due to}} the complexity of the phenomenon involved and partly because of limitations of the traditional analytical tool of statistical regression. This paper addresses the latter part and presents an alternative to the regression in the form of neural networks. The depth of the scour hole developed along with its width and length is predicted using neural network models. A network architecture complete with trained values of connection weight and bias and requiring input of grouped parameters pertaining to <b>discharge</b> <b>head,</b> tail water channel depth, bucket radius, lip angle, and median sediment size is recommended in order to predict the depth, the location of maximum scour, as well as the width of scour hole. The neural network predictions have been compared with traditional statistical schemes. Although the common and simple feed forward back propagation network took a very long time to train as compared to some advanced schemes, it was found to impart equally reliable training as the latter. Use of causative variables in grouped forms was found to be more rewarding than that of their raw forms probably due to lesser scaling effect...|$|E

Mathematical models based on the physical principles, associated to the development of volumetric and rotordynamic machines, are developed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the generalized design rules for a new stilling basin for use with the straight drop spillway. This generalized stilling basin design was developed because experience in the field had shown that there was no satisfactory stilling basin for the straight drop spillway. However, limited field experience indicates that this new design will adequately protect the downstream channel from scour. Water falling over the spillway crest falls onto a flat apron. The nappe is broken up by floor blocks, which also prevent damaging scour of the downstream channel banks. Scour of the downstream channel bed is prevented by an end still. Flaring wingwalls, triangular in elevation, prevent erosion of the dam fill. For proper operation of the stilling basin, the contraction of the flow at the ends of the spillway opening must be partially suppressed. The stilling basin can be used {{for a wide range of}} <b>discharge,</b> <b>head</b> on the crest, crest length, height of drop, and downstream tailwater level. An important finding is that the stilling basin length computed for the minimum tailwater levels. Dangerous scour of the downstream channel may occur if the nappe is supported sufficiently by high tailwater so that it lands beyond the end of the stilling basin. A method of computing the stilling basin length for all tailwater levels is presented. The design rules developed as a result of the laboratory tests were carefully checked an verified. An example shows how these rules are applied to the design of field structure.

Deep-seated orifice spillways are subjected to cavitation damage as the cavitation index drops below the critical cavitation index of 0. 2 because of negative pressures on the profile and high flow velocities. Aerators are provided for mitigating cavitation damage. Design guidelines for aerator of orifice spillways are scanty and not reported much in the literature so far; thus, there still remains gray area {{in the field of}} spillway aerator design. The present study investigates the performance of an offset aerator with and without a ramp for deep-seated orifice spillway on a physical and numerical model. Performance of the aerator for varying <b>discharges,</b> <b>heads,</b> and gate openings is studied for varying cavity subpressures. Results with respect to jet length, cavity subpressure and air entrainment coefficients are presented in the form of nondimensional plots. From this study, the nondimensional jet length is in the range of 2 to 35 and increases as the cavity subpressure, approaches atmospheric pressure. It is also found that the air entrainment increases with increase in Froude number, ramp height and cavity pressure. From the present study results, equations for jet length and air entrainment coefficient are developed and are presented for the orifice spillway aerator.
