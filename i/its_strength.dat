5|$|Overall {{the attackers}} lost six bombers and 12 Bf 109s, some 12.5% of <b>its</b> <b>strength.</b> However, the British claimed 81 aircraft, 26 by the Duxford Wing. Zehbe's Dornier alone was claimed nine times. Among the German {{casualties}} {{that day was}} Rolf Heitsch and his flame throwing Dornier; the device had not been tested at high altitude and when used, squirted black oil over Holmes' windshield and {{attracted the attention of}} British fighters. Park would not have been pleased that despite being stripped of protection the small force of bombers lost only a quarter of <b>its</b> <b>strength</b> while surrounded by 100 fighters. Still, the operation had been a victory. Fighter Command lost 13 fighters, eight were claimed by JG 52.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} at the River Auja, the brigade camped to the {{south-east}} of Sarona, {{out of range}} of the Turkish artillery.

In the last month the regiment had lost twenty-seven dead and eighty-eight wounded, sixty-one had to be evacuated to the rear as they were ill and two men were missing.|$|E
5|$|As the Afrika Korps {{retreated into}} Libya and Tunisia, the 2nd Division, {{as part of}} X Corps, was in pursuit.

5|$|Detachment Lika was {{an ad hoc}} {{formation}} {{consisting of}} the 44th Infantry Regiment and one battery of the 17th Artillery Regiment.

5|$|On 10March 1953, No.30 Transport Unit re-formed as No.36 (Transport) Squadron, {{which had}} disbanded the {{previous}} day at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales.

Elements of No.36 Squadron began returning to Australia in January 1955, {{and by the end of}} the month <b>its</b> <b>strength</b> was four Dakotas and one Wirraway, and fifty-eight personnel including five officers. Nominal operational control of the squadron was transferred to Fifth Air Force on 1February 1955, though its purpose continued to be the support of Commonwealth forces. No.36 Squadron ceased flying on 13March, after which its remaining elements departed Iwakuni for Australia, leaving three Dakotas and a Wirraway that formed RAAF Transport Flight (Japan); the flight operated until July 1956 and was disbanded two months later.|$|E

5|$|After Charles Parham began {{promoting}} {{the idea that}} speaking in tongues was the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit around 1901, he began to attract a considerable following which he organized loosely as the Apostolic Faith Movement (AFM) in 1906.

After renouncing Parham, the severely weakened AFM regrouped around Howard A. Goss, L. C. Hall, D. C. O. Opperman, and A. G. Canada. They were later joined by Eudorus N. Bell, previously a Southern Baptist minister. The AFM had <b>its</b> <b>strength</b> in the rural areas of Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Since the {{introduction}} of competition {{and the application of}} the principle of financial sufficiency, Spanish Port Authorities have developed their business in a highly competitive environment.
