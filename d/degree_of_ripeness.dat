40|$|The alien invader weed, Opuntia stricta Haw (family Cactaceae), {{is seriously}} {{threatening}} biodiversity in veld habitats of the Kruger National Park. Basic biological and ecological {{information on the}} establishment, growth and reproduction of the species {{is necessary for the}} development of effective strategies for its control. The rapid spread of the plant is apparently mainly due to seed dispersal by baboon (Papio ursinus). Sixty percent of seed taken from baboon faeces resulted in seedlings that established. Although palatability criteria for ripe fruit were more favourable than for unripe or medium-ripe fruit, seed from fruit at all three <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripeness</b> germinated equally well, and seedling establishment was similar. Despite their lower acidity, as well as higher total soluble sugar content and pH, cladodes are not subject to herbivory to near the extent that ripe fruit are. Freshly collected seed kept in Sabie River water showed significantly better germination/emergence after seven days submersion (83) than at 14 or 28 days (52 and 66, respectively). Results suggest that seed dispersal of the species by animals, principally baboon, is an important cause of rapidly expanding infestations, and that dissipation in water will intensify the problem. Current findings should contribute toward the development of long-term weed management strategies aimed at con- tainment/eradication of the weed...|$|R
30|$|Natural {{grape must}} {{is a very}} complex and {{variable}} medium that has a great impact on the efficiency of yeast fermentation. The concentrations of sugar, nitrogen, and micronutrients change from season to season, and the composition of NGM depends on the grape variety, geographic and climate factors, viticulture practices, and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripeness</b> at harvest. The diversity of winemaking practices also contributes to the variability of grape must composition and fermentation conditions. Taken together, these factors make it difficult to compare fermentation performance between strains and studies. To achieve better experimental reproducibility, researchers frequently use SGMs with defined compositions when studying fermentation performance.|$|R

Two lots of trapist cheese were {{produced}} with different heating temperatures of the curd (38 and 43 °C), {{and the data}} concerning and manufacture {{as well as the}} ripening of these cheeses are presented in this paper. Higher heating temperature caused a higher titratable acidity (20 °T) of the curd. At the age of 15 days the acidity was 24 °T higher and after this period the differences diminished {{as the result of the}} influence of other factors. It can be concluded that lower heating temperature contributed to a more moderate rise of acidity in the course of ripening. Higher heating temperature yielded cheeses with coarser body and with lower water content. The differences in water content at ages of 15, 30, and 45 days were 2. 27 %, 2. 52 % and 1. 97 % respectively. This means that lower heating temperature resulted in a more appropriate water content of the cheeses. The extent of protein break down was more pronounced in cheeses with higher heating temperature which is evident in higher <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripeness</b> as well.

2500|$|The first {{successful}} commercial production of California Chardonnay was from plantings in the Livermore Valley AVA. Wente Vineyards developed a Chardonnay clone {{that was used}} to introduce the grape variety in several Californian vineyards throughout the 1940s. In the 1950s, James David Zellerbach, one-time US Ambassador to Rome, started Hanzell Vineyards winery and dedicated it to making Burgundian-style Chardonnay. His success encouraged other Californian winemakers to follow suit and culminated in Chateau Montelena's victory over Burgundy Chardonnay in the 1976 blind tasting event conducted by French judges known as the Judgment of Paris. In response, the demand for Californian Chardonnay increased and Californian winemakers rushed to increase plantings. In the 1980s, the popularity of Californian Chardonnay increased so much, the number of vines planted in the state eclipsed that of France by 1988. By 2005, nearly [...] accounted for almost 25% of the world's total Chardonnay plantings. The early trend was to imitate the great Burgundy wines, but this soon gave way to more rich buttery and oaked styles. Starting with the 1970s, the focus was on harvesting the grapes at more advanced <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripeness</b> and higher Brix levels. New oak barrels were used to produce wines that were big in body and mouthfeel. Frank J. Prial of The New York Times was an early critic of this style, particularly {{because of the lack of}} [...] "food friendliness" [...] that was common with these massive wines. Another criticism of California Chardonnays, and one that has been levied against other Californian wines, is the very high alcohol levels which can make a wine seem out of balance. In recent years, California winemakers have been using process such as reverse osmosis and spinning cones to bring the alcohol levels down to 12 to 14%.|$|R
50|$|Harvesting {{is carried}} out when the grapes are fully ripe.

40|$|Ziel der Arbeit war es herauszufinden, durch welche Parameter die Konglomeratbildung in naturtrübem Apfelsaft beeinflusst wird und wie diese verhindert werden kann. Zu diesem Zweck wurden 77 Saftvarianten aus Äpfeln der Sorten Elstar und Braeburn hergestellt. Die Äpfel wurden in die Reifegrade Unreif, Reif und Überreif eingeteilt und die Säfte mit verschiedenen Schönungsmethoden behandelt (Bentonit, zwei Amylasen, drei Pektinasen, eine Protease und Zentrifugation). In Abständen von 4 Wochen wurden die Saftflaschen durch Schütteln auf Konglomeratbildung kontrolliert und die Trübung gemessen. Ebenso wurden die Gehalte an Pektin, Stärke, Protein und Polyphenolen bestimmt. Es konnte festgestellt werden, dass die Behandlung mit Bentonit oder einer Protease keinen Schutz gegen Konglomeratbildung bieten konnte. Bei unreifen Äpfeln brachten auch die Amylasen keinen effektiven Schutz gegen Konglomerate und sorgten für niedrige Trübungsstabilität. Waren die Äpfel reif oder überreif, konnte mit Amylasen relativ trubstabiler, konglomeratfreier Saft erzeugt werden. Pektinasen schützten zwar vor Konglomeratbildung, allerdings kam es auch zu geringer Trübungsstabilität. Das Zentrifugieren von Apfelsaft nach der HTST-Behandlung ergab zwar ein minimiertes Risiko für Konglomerate, allerdings brachte es keinen effektiven Schutz vor Konglomeratbildung. Auch die Trübungsstabilität war nicht optimal. Weiters konnte festgestellt werden, dass es im Reifeverlauf eines Apfels einen Zeitpunkt geben muss, an dem Saft mit sehr wenig Trübung erzeugt werden kann. The aim of {{this work}} was to find out, which {{parameters}} influence the building of conglomerates in cloudy apple juice {{and how it can}} be avoided. For this purpose 77 variants of juice out of apples from cultivars Elstar and Braeburn were produced. The apples were divided into three <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripeness</b> (unripe, ripe and overripe). The juices were treated with different methods of fining (bentonit, two amylases, three pectinases, one protease and centrifugation). In intervals of 4 weeks the juice in the bottles were checked for conglomerate building by shaking them. The turbidity in the bottles and the amount of pectin, starch, proteins and polyphenols were measured as well. It was established, that the treatment with bentonit or protease could not protect the juice against conglomerate building. In juices from unripe apples amylase could not effectively protect them from conglomerates and could not ensure cloud stability. In juices from ripe or overripe apples the treatments with amylases lead to cloud stability and absence from conglomerates. The treatment with pectinases protected against building of conglomerates, but it could not guarantee high cloud stability. The centrifugation of cloudy apple juice after HTST-treatment resulted in less risk for the building of conglomerates, but a complete protection was not achieved. Also the cloud stability was not in an optimal range. Additionally it was established that there is a point in the progress of ripening, in which it is possible to produce juice with really low turbidity...|$|R

A principal-components analysis and investigatory techniques were used to define seven distinct regions in multisensor space according to the state <b>of</b> <b>ripeness</b> <b>of</b> the bananas, predicted from a classification of banana-skin colours. Then three supervised classifiers. namely Fuzzy ARTMAP, LVQ and MLP, were used to classify the samples into the observed seven states <b>of</b> <b>ripeness.</b> It was found that the Fuzzy ARTIMAP and LVQ classifiers outperformed the MLP classifier, with accuracies of 90. 3 % and 92 %, respectively, compared with 83. 4 %.

In {{the first part of}} the experiment, the time of dipping in hot water is fixed to 5 min and temperature of the hot water varied for 35, 70 and 93 °C. For the next set of the experiment the dipping time varied for 1, 3, 5, or 7 min while the temperature for the dip in hot water retained constant at 70 °C, besides carrying out a simple water wash treatment to conceive absolute advantage of the hot water dip treatment. The treated samples are then allowed to ripen/cure for 72 h under air circulated cabinet dehydrator adjusted at 38 - 40 °C. The effectiveness of the treatments is evaluated by assessing texture, taste and overall acceptability of the products, determining also the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripeness.</b> The treatment with 70 °C performed better than 35 and 93 °C furnishing with 55 % product yield of acceptable quality. The yield of improved quality product is further increased to 70 % on the optimization of treatment time to 3 min. The ripening of Dhakki dates does not require the fruits to stay on tree beyond fully mature doka stage for want of dong formation and hence saves at least 2 weeks hang-on period.
