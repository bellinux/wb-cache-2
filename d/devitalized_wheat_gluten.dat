40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the nutritional value of processed <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> for early-weaned pigs. The first experiment involved 72 weanling pigs with an avg age of 20 d and avg wt of 9. 2 lb. Six diets were fed to the pigs in individual metabolism cages. Protein sources were casein, flash-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> spray-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> two solubilized <b>wheat</b> <b>glutens,</b> and soybean meal. Response criteria were N digestibility, biological value, and N retention. Casein had greater N digestibility, biological value, and N retention than the other protein sources. The <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> products had greater N digestibility than soybean meal. Modification of the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> to increase its solubility, resulted in marked decreases in biological value and N retention. Experiment 2 was a nursery growth assay. A total of 180 pigs were used, with an avg age of 25 d and avg wt of 12. 3 lb. The five pelleted diets fed from d 0 to 14 were: 1) a high nutrient density diet (HNDD) with 20 % dried whey and 20 % dried skim milk (DSM); 2) HNDD with the DSM replaced by flash-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and lactose; 3) HNDD with the DSM replaced by spray-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and lactose; 4) HNDD with the DSM replaced by solubilized-modified <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and lactose; 5) HNDD with DSM replaced by soy protein isolate and lactose. All pigs were fed a common diet from wk 3 to 5 of the experiment. No differences in ADG or ADFI were noted for d 0 to 14. Feed to gain was best for pigs fed diets with spray-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and worst for those fed diets with soy-isolate. For d 0 to 35, pigs fed diets with flash-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> had lower ADG and ADFI than pigs fed diets with spray-dried and solubilized-modified <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> Furthermore, pigs fed spray-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> during Phase I had the greatest overall growth performance, with a 19 % improvement in ADG compared to pigs fed DSM...|$|R
40|$|Biocomposites {{developed}} from <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> using water without any chemicals as plasticizer and jute fibers as reinforcement have much better flexural and tensile properties than similar polypropylene composites reinforced with jute fibers. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is an inexpensive and abundant co-product derived from renewable resources and is biodegradable but non-thermoplastic. Previous attempts at developing biocomposites from <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> have used plasticizers such as glycerol or chemical modifications to make gluten thermoplastic. However, plasticizers have a considerably {{negative effect on}} the mechanical properties of the composites and chemical modifications make <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> less biodegradable, expensive and/or environmentally unfriendly. In the research reported, we developed composites from <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> using water as a plasticizer without any chemicals. Water plasticizes <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> but evaporates during compression molding and therefore does not affect the mechanical properties of the composites. The effect of composite fabrication conditions on the flexural, tensile and acoustic properties was studied in comparison to polypropylene composites reinforced with jute fibers. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> composites had flexural strength (20 MPa), tensile strength (69 MPa) and tensile modulus (7. 7 GPa) values approximately twice those of polypropylene composites.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{environmental concern}} has reawakened {{an interest in}} materials based on renewable resources as replacement for petroleum-based materials. The main objective of this thesis was to explore plant proteins, more specifically <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> as a binder in wood adhesives intended for typical solid wood applications such as furniture and flooring. Alkaline and acidic dispersions of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> were used as wood adhesives to bond together beech wood substrates. Soy protein isolate {{was used as a}} reference. The tensile shear strengths of the substrates were measured for comparison of bond strength and resistance to cold water. AFM in colloidal probe mode was used to investigate nanoscale adhesion between cellulose and protein films. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was divided into the two protein classes; glutenins and gliadins, and their adhesive performance was compared with that of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> Heat treatment and mild hydrolysis were investigated as means for improving bonding performance of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> The treated <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples were analysed by SE-HPLC and 13 C-NMR to correlate molecular size distribution and structural changes with bonding performance. Soy protein isolate is superior to <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> especially in regards to water resistance. However, the bond strength of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is improved when starved bond lines are avoided. The AFM analysis reveals higher interfacial adhesion between soy protein isolate and cellulose than between <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and cellulose. These results partly explain some of the differences in bonding performance between the plant proteins. Soy protein isolate contains more polar amino acid residues than <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and possibly interacts more strongly with cellulose. Furthermore, the bond performances of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and glutenin are similar, while that of gliadin is inferior to the others, especially regarding water resistance. The extent of penetration of the dispersions into the wood material has a large impact on the results. The bonding performance of gliadin is similar to the others when over-penetration of the dispersion into the wood material is avoided. Moreover, the bond strength of the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples heated at 90 °C was in general improved compared to that of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> A small improvement was also obtained for some of the hydrolyzed <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples (degree of hydrolysis: 0 - 0. 6 %). The improvements in bonding performance for the heat treated samples are due to polymerization, while the improvements for the hydrolyzed samples are due to denaturation. The 13 C-NMR analysis of the treated samples confirms some degree of denaturation. QC 2012051...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{different}} protein feeds on honey bees (Apis mellifera L), experiments were conducted in a completely randomized block design with 15 treatments and 4 replicates. The nutritional effects of different treatments on caged bees were studied through recording half-life time (50 % mortality). Pollen substitutes were soybean flour, soybean meal, bread yeast, <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> soybean flour + soybean meal, soybean flour + bread yeast, soybean flour + <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> soybean meal + <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> and <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> + bread yeast. Pollen supplements were <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> + pollen, soybean flour + pollen, soybean meal + pollen, bread yeast + pollen and two controls as pollen and honey. The nutritional effects of different protein sources provided by pollen substitutes and supplements were recorded on the amount of carcass protein and fatbody of honey bee workers in experimental colonies. The <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> supplement and the soybean substitute showed the longest (60. 58 days) and the shortest (10. 53 days) half-life time of worker bees, respectively. The amount of food consumption in different treatments was not significantly different (P&gt; 0. 05). The greatest DM of worker bees (dry matter of carcass) was related to soybean (34 %) and the least related to yeast supplement (31. 54 %), which were significantly different (P&lt; 0. 05).

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the nutritional value of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and spray-dried porcine plasma in diets for weanling pigs. For the experiment, 120 pigs (14 lb avg initial body wt) were used in a 35 -d growth assay. Treatments fed from d 0 to 14 postweaning were: 1) a dried skim milk-dried whey-soybean mealbased control; and 2, 3, and 4) spray-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> spray-dried porcine plasma, and a blend of the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and porcine plasma used to replace dried skim milk on a protein basis. All pigs were fed the same corn-soybean meal-dried whey-based diet from d 14 to 35. For d 0 to 14, pigs fed porcine plasma protein had greater average daily gain and average daily feed intake than pigs fed <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> However, for d 14 to 21 (i. e., during the transition period to the phase II diet), pigs fed diets with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> had the greatest feed intake and rate of gain compared with pigs fed other protein sources during phase I.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) on <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> materials. Two objectives form the motivation for this paper. First, the study provides {{an assessment of the}} environmental impact of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> powder production. The aim of this contribution is to provide a base assessment which can feed into the evaluation of any future wheat-gluten-based product. Second, the study evaluates wheat-gluten-based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polylactide (PLA) packaging film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production, incineration with energy recovery, and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. Such comparison offers insight in environmental benefits of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> over conventional plastic film as well as its bio-based alternative and identifies its optimal production and disposal methods. For <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> production, the LCA results show that the impacts of the <b>wheat</b> cultivation and <b>gluten</b> drying phase are dominant in the majority of the 18 impact categories in the ReCiPe midpoint assessment method. The LCA results also exhibit that the scenario with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> film produced by extrusion and incinerated to recover embodied energy is favorable from environmental perspective. It offers great benefits in climate change and fossil depletion over LDPE film and in 14 impact categories over PLA film. Although <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> film suffers from common problems for bio-based materials (e. g. land occupation), the overall environmental performance indicates that <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> provides a promising source for bio-based polymer production.

40|$|<b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring protein polymer. It {{is produced in}} abundance by the agricultural industry, is biodegradable and very inexpensive (less than $ 0. 50 /lb). It has unique viscoelastic properties, {{which makes it a}} promising alternative to synthetic plastics. The unplasticized <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is, however, brittle. Plasticizers such as glycerol are commonly used to give flexibility to the articles made of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> but with the penalty of greatly reduced stiffness. Former work showed that the brittleness of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> can also be improved by modifying it with a tri-thiol additive with no penalty of reduced stiffness. However, the cost of the customer designed tri-thiol additive was very high and it was unlikely to make a cost effective material from such an expensive additive. ^ Here we designed a new, inexpensive thiol additive called SHPVA. It was synthesized from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) through a simple esterification reaction. The mechanical data of the molded wheat gluten/SHPVA material indicated that <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was toughened by SHPVA. As a control, the wheat gluten/PVA material showed no improvement compared with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> itself. Several techniques have been used to characterize this novel protein/polymer blend. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) study showed two phases in both wheat gluten/PVA and wheat gluten/SHPVA material. However, scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures indicated that PVA was macroscopically separated from <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> while <b>wheat</b> gluten/SHPVA had a homogeneous look. The phase image from the atomic force microscope (AFM) gave interesting contrast based on the difference in the mechanical properties of these two phases. ^ The biodegradation behavior of these protein/polymer blends was examined in soil. SHPVA was not degraded in the time period of the experiment. Wheat gluten/SHPVA degraded slower than <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> We also developed some other interesting material systems based on <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> including the <b>wheat</b> gluten/basalt composite and wheat gluten/clay composite materials.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJ. S. DrouillardA {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted in which <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> film forming solutions were modified by various means to produce films that would improve resistance to ruminal degradation. There was an interaction between pH and temperature, whereby low pH (pH 3) and high temperature (75 °C) of film forming solution resulted in films that had highest resistance to microbial degradation. Strategies that proved unsuccessful in improving resistance to ruminal degradation included use of the cross-linking enzyme, transglutaminase; induction of a Maillard reaction; and increasing the time of heating film forming solutions. Utilizing HCl versus acetic acid as the means to lower the pH of the film forming solution resulted in poor film formation, which {{can be attributed to}} glutenin‟s solubility in acetic acid. When acetic acid was replaced with 25 % HCl, however, no compromise in film formation was observed and ruminal degradability was not affected. In order to develop an economical and effective means of encapsulating lysine for rumen bypass, <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and corn zein were evaluated as encapsulation materials. Coating soybean meal with either <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> or zein resulted in superior protection against ruminal degradation when compared to unprotected soybean meal.

This difference increased to up to 4. 5 % in 6 h and diminished again for longer reaction times. Possible differences in the gluten composition and the presence of albumins and globulins in wheat flour could not explain the difference in DH% because the addition of starch to VWG increased the rate of hydrolysis similarly. Instead, it was concluded that starch granules impede gluten aggregation, which facilitates the hydrolysis.
