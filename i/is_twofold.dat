25|$|In September 2006, SENER {{launched}} the Energy Plus (Energía Plus) {{program with the}} objective of increasing generation capacity and meeting the rising demand for electricity. The program applies for consumption levels above those for 2005. CAMMESA requires all large users (above 300kW) to contract the difference between their current demand and their demand in the year 2005 in the Energy Plus market. In this new de-regulated market, only energy produced from new generation plants will be traded. The aim of the program <b>is</b> <b>twofold.</b> In one hand, it seeks to guarantee supply to residential consumers, public entities, and small and medium enterprises. On the other hand, it aims at encouraging self-generation by the industrial sector and electricity cogeneration.|$|E

He outlines nine passions that organize and are organized by our dealings with others: lust, despair, hatred, vanity, jealousy, envy, faith, hope, and love. While these emotional states may be seen as raw emotion, their expression is always conditioned by the context within which the individual mobilizes or learns to mobilize them.|$|E

For this purpose, the Bar Council of India has an internal Committee whose function is to supervise and examine the various institutions conferring law degrees and to grant recognition to these institutions once they meet the required standards. In this manner the Bar Council of India also ensures the standard of education required for practising in India are met with. As regards the qualification for enrollment with the State Bar Council, while the actual formalities may vary from one State to another, yet predominately they ensure that the application has not been a bankrupt /criminal and is generally fit to practise before courts of India.|$|E

500|$|A {{consequence}} of the image method of filter design is {{that the effect of}} the end terminations has to be calculated separately if its effects on response are to be taken into account. [...] The most severe deviation of the response from that predicted occurs in the passband close to cut-off. [...] The reason for this <b>is</b> <b>twofold.</b> [...] Further into the passband the impedance match progressively improves, thus limiting the error. [...] On the other hand, waves in the stopband are reflected from the end termination due to mismatch but are attenuated twice by the filter stopband rejection as they pass through it. [...] So while stopband impedance mismatch may be severe, it has only limited effect on the filter response.|$|E

2500|$|After Maitland Volcano became extinct, {{prolonged}} erosion {{destroyed the}} volcanic edifice. The reason why Maitland eroded away while its neighbour, Edziza, did not <b>is</b> <b>twofold.</b> With {{the cessation of}} volcanic activity, Maitland Volcano was unable to protect itself from erosion by providing a cover of younger lavas {{on top of the}} older shield. Another factor is that Maitland's basement was built entirely of soft, friable sedimentary rocks of the Bowser Lake Group. Such rocks are more vulnerable to erosion than igneous rocks. The Bowser Lake Group sedimentary rocks are shale, sandstone, conglomerate and siltstone, which were deposited in marine and non-marine environments during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Intervening valleys, deeply incised into the Jurassic shale and sandstone, are as much as [...] below the base of the now deeply eroded Maitland shield volcano.

2500|$|The {{preamble}} to the Constitution {{serves as}} an introductory statement of the document's fundamental purposes and guiding principles. It neither assigns powers to the federal government, nor does it place specific limitations on government action. Rather, it sets out the origin, scope and purpose of the Constitution.

2500|$|A mechitza most {{commonly}} means the physical divider placed between the men's and women's sections in Orthodox synagogues and at religious celebrations.

Secondly, even if the sexes are separated, {{they should not be}} able to interact to a high degree during a religious service, lest this lead to gazing and impure thoughts. [...] Due to these restrictions, mechitzot are usually opaque (at least looking from the men's side to the women's side). Some mechitzot divide the front and back of the synagogue, but others have mechitzot dividing the left and right sides of the synagogue; for example, the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale does this. This is often seen as more equal since the women are not farther away from the service than the men.|$|E
2500|$|Glycosylation is {{the process}} by which a {{carbohydrate}} is covalently attached to a target macromolecule, typically proteins and lipids. [...] This modification serves various functions. [...] For instance, some proteins do not fold correctly unless they are glycosylated. [...] In other cases, proteins are not stable unless they contain oligosaccharides linked at the amide nitrogen of certain asparagine. The influence of glycosylation on the folding and stability of glycoprotein <b>is</b> <b>twofold.</b> Firstly, the highly soluble glycans may have a direct physicochemical stabilisation effect. Secondly, N-linked glycan mediate a critical quality control check point in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Glycosylation also plays a role in cell-cell adhesion (a mechanism employed by cells of the immune system) via sugar-binding proteins called lectins, which recognize specific carbohydrate moieties. Glycosylation is an important parameter in the optimization of many glycoprotein-based drugs such as monoclonal antibodies. Glycosylation also underpins the ABO blood group system. It is {{the presence or absence of}} glycosyltransferases which dictates which blood group antigens are presented and hence what antibody specificities are exhibited. This immunological role may well have driven the diversification of glycan heterogeneity and creates a barrier to zoonotic transmission of viruses. [...] In addition, glycosylation is often used by viruses to shield the underlying viral protein from immune recognition. A significant example is the dense glycan shield of the envelope spike of the human immunodeficiency virus.|$|E
