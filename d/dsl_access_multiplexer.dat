50|$|The Broadband Forum is {{investigating}} architectural aspects of G.fast and has, as of May 2014, identified 23 use cases. Deployment scenarios involving G.fast bring fiber {{closer to the}} customer than traditional VDSL2 FTTN (fiber to the node), but not quite to the customer premises as in FTTH (fiber to the home). The term FTTdp (fiber to the distribution point) is commonly associated with G.fast, similar to how FTTN is associated with VDSL2. In FTTdp deployments, {{a limited number of}} subscribers at a distance of up to 200-300 m are attached to one fiber node, which acts as <b>DSL</b> <b>access</b> <b>multiplexer</b> (DSLAM). As a comparison, in ADSL2 deployments the DSLAM may be located in a central office (CO) at a distance of up to 5 km from the subscriber, while in some VDSL2 deployments the DSLAM is located in a street cabinet and serves hundreds of subscribers at distances up to 1 km. VDSL2 is also widely used in fiber to the basement.|$|E

40|$|Access {{networks}} include modems, home gateways, and <b>DSL</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Multiplexers</b> (DSLAMs), and {{are responsible}} for 70 - 80 % of total network-based energy consumption. In this paper, we take an in-depth look at the problem of greening access networks, identify root problems, and propose practical solutions for their user- and ISP-parts. On the user side, the combination of continuous light traffic and lack of alternative paths condemns gateways to being powered {{most of the time}} despite having Sleep-on-Idle (SoI) capabilities. To address this, we introduce Broadband Hitch-Hiking (BH 2), that takes advantage of the overlap of wireless networks to aggregate user traffic in as few gateways as possible. In current urban settings BH 2 can power off 65 - 90 % of gateways. Powering off gateways permits the remaining ones to synchronize at higher speeds due to reduced crosstalk from having fewer active lines. Our tests reveal speedup up to 25 %. On the ISP side, we propose introducing simple inexpensive switches at the distribution frame for batching active lines to a subset of cards letting the remaining ones sleep. Overall, our results show an 80 % energy savings margin in access networks. The combination of BH 2 and switching gets close to this margin, saving 66 % on average. QC 20140704 </p...|$|R
30|$|The IPTV {{head end}} (1) or a {{video-on-demand}} (VoD) server is responsible of delivering video and content, i.e. the original TV channels, {{to the core}} network which represents a high-speed communication infrastructure. The core network (2) distributes the video streams from the head end to the metro backbone. The metro backbone (3) interconnects the core network with the different access networks. Its main function is to multiplex the different service providers and to adapt the transport system to the specific characteristics of the subscriber loop. Therefore, the metro backbone must perform data transmission and switching tasks efficiently. The elements that transport the multimedia content to the end users (subscribers) form the access network (4) which may be DSL-based containing BRASes (broadband remote <b>access</b> servers) and <b>DSL</b> <b>access</b> <b>multiplexers</b> (DSLAMs). Alternatives for the access network could be WiMAX with components such as ASN-GW (access service network - gateway) connecting the edge router to a base station (BS) which may transmit the TV channels to the mobile users either using unicast (cf. CID for connection identifier) or multicast (cf. MCID for multicast CID). In case of a VANET-based IPTV system, the mobile stations MS in Figure 2, would represent the devices in the cars which there will present the TV programs to the users. If WLANs or LTE {{would be used to}} deliver IPTV services in a VANET, the situation would be very similar to what is illustrated for WiMAX in Figure 2 and, therefore, it is not explicitly depicted in this figure to reduce complexity. The access network manages the user demands by using the return channel. The main requirement of an access network is to have enough bandwidth to support multiple IPTV channels as demanded by the currently active set of subscribers. Finally, the subscribers (5), e.g., sitting in the cars if we assume access via a V 2 I communication system, may be connected to the access network either directly or have their own local network which enables indirect communication and information exchange between the user’s device (e.g. TV set) and the access network. This direct or indirect communication allows accessing the available resources in the IPTV network.|$|R
50|$|Reverse {{power feeding}} (RPF) {{is a new}} {{technology}} being standardized by ETSI and the Broadband Forum TR-301. It allows sending power from the customer premises to a distribution point (DP), in order to power the distribution point unit (DPU). The DPU includes typically a <b>DSL</b> <b>access</b> <b>multiplexer</b> (DSLAM) that can support up to 24 users and an optical network terminator (ONT), which connects the DPU to a central office (CO) where the optical line terminator (OLT) is located. This topology as also known as fiber to the distribution point (FTTdp). RPF is a critical technology for the upgrade of VDSL2 subscribers to the new G.fast standard, which has a maximum range (at high speeds) of 250m. Given {{that only a small}} number of subscribers is located at a radius of 250m from a DPU, the number of DPUs required to deploy G.fast infrastructure greatly increases, compared to VDSL2 and older xDSL technologies. RPF reduces installation cost by removing the need to connect the DPU locally to the power grid, as well as the need to monitor its power consumption with a smart meter.|$|E
50|$|U-verse {{uses the}} Alcatel-Lucent 7330 or 7340 Intelligent Services Access Manager (ISAM) shelf, also called a video-ready access device (VRAD), {{deployed}} {{either in a}} central office (CO) or to a neighborhood serving area interface (SAI). These models are both composed of circuit boards providing service, which are fed by fiber. FTTN (fiber to the node) systems use model 7330, which uses existing copper wiring to customers' homes, leading to distance limitations from the VRAD cabinet to the customer's home. The 7330 ISAM is an internet protocol <b>DSL</b> <b>access</b> <b>multiplexer</b> that supports VDSL and ADSL protocols. FTTP (fiber to the premises) systems use model 7340, mostly {{in areas such as}} new neighborhoods or large housing developments, where AT&T chooses to run fiber to the household, removing the distance limitations of copper. The 7340 then connects to a serving area interface, which distributes service to homes in the neighborhood, via a dual strand fiber, which then splits into 32 customer fiber pairs. The fiber pairs typically lead to a customer's residence at the network interface device.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} an application-driven methodology for implementing parallel and heterogeneous programmable platforms. We deploy our flow for network access platforms {{where we have to}} trade off flexibility against costs and performance. Our methodology therefore focuses on characterizing the application domain as early as possible.

Our flow includes an efficient path to implementation in hardware and software. The software implementation framework takes a modular application description and generates code for embedded processors that can easily be ported to different platforms and used for profiling. Different communication architectures, co-processors, and specializations of programmable processing elements can be derived from profiling results to affect the platform hardware.

40|$|We model an ATM network {{comprising}} {{an input}} quelling cell switching hub. Customer access lines are multiplexed into the relatively faster input links of this hub. Each <b>access</b> <b>multiplexer</b> is fed by on/off sources. Motivated {{by the fact}} that an ATM network should support both bursty as well as smooth traffic, we consider the scenario in which some multiplexers are fed by sources with long bursts of cells, and others by sources with short bursts. Here we report the results of a detailed simulation of this hub-based ATM network. Our objective is to compare the performance of various strategies for scheduling cell service in the <b>access</b> <b>multiplexers,</b> and in the ATM switch. The simulation results confirm what might be expected from the results of our earlier analytical modelling of the multiplexer and the switch in isolation (this analysis assumed a particular Markovian model for the aggregate cell arrival processes into the ATM switch). In particular, we find that, if mean burst delay is the performance criterion then, for a small ratio of ATM-Link to customer-access-line speed (less than or equal to 3 for the models and parameters we use), the more bursty traffic should undergo burst level multiplexing at the <b>access</b> <b>multiplexer,</b> and should be given lower priority during output contention resolution in the input queueing hub. If worst case delay performance (e. g., the 99. 9 percentile of the end-to-end delay of a burst) is a consideration, however, we find that, even for small ATM-link to access-line speed ratio, the best combination of strategies is that the <b>access</b> <b>multiplexers</b> should multiplex the packets from the access lines in a round-robin fashion, and the switch should still give lower priority to the burstier traffi...|$|R

40|$|Persistent TCP flows, <b>DSL</b> <b>access</b> networks, buffer dimensioning. The {{capacity}} of the (<b>DSL)</b> <b>access</b> network keeps increasing, {{while at the same}} time there is a trend to support, on top of web browsing applications that spurred the initial popularity of the Internet, more and more applications (e. g. peer-to-peer, time-shifted TV) that require the transport of long-lived flows over such an access network. During the transport of these long-lived flows associated with these (non-timecritical) applications it is important that the last mile link is efficiently used and that each flow gets its fair share of the available capacity and this is what TCP, ideally suited for these non-time-critical applications, aims to do. We work under the assumption that the rest of the network and the upstream, which needs to transport the ACKs, are appropriately dimensioned and thus we concentrate on the downlink and its associated link buffer (in a <b>DSL</b> <b>access</b> network it is in the DSLAM) which has a crucial impact on the efficiency and the fairness of the transport in “last mile”. Studies show that persistent TCP flows have the greatest impact on buffer requirement (and not short-lived (web) flows). We show that both requirements can be fulfilled by choosing the buffer large enough (so that there is no packet loss). We develop a heuristic formula to calculate the required buffer size.
