For every five-cun layer of earth, two men, {{standing}} <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face,</b> should tamp six times with pestles, each man pounding three times on a dent; then tamp four times on each dent, two men again standing <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face,</b> each pounding twice on the same dent; then tamp two more times, each man pounding once. Following this, tamp the surface with pestles or stamp with feet randomly to even out the surface.

Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.|$|E
