5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out was that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>former,</b> <b>the</b> premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a}} way to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E

Originally planned for 22 June, Epsom was postponed until 26 June, to make up deficiencies in manpower and materiel. The initial opposition was expected to come from the depleted 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend ("Hitler Youth"), elements of the 21st Panzer Division, and the Panzer Lehr.|$|E
5|$|Despite never making landfall, the {{tropical}} cyclone disrupted numerous shipping lanes and inflicted damage on Bermuda and Newfoundland. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>former,</b> <b>the</b> hurricane brought winds {{in excess of}} , downing power lines and felled trees. Property damage also resulted from the strong winds. Overall damage on the island totaled $400,000. After passing west of Bermuda, {{the tropical}} cyclone tracked across numerous shipping lanes. Two ships, the Leicester and Gaspar, encountered the hurricane and became stricken in open waters. Though most people were rescued from both ships, six people perished on the former while one died on the latter. Beginning on September15, the hurricane tracked east of Newfoundland, producing heavy rainfall on land. The precipitation flooded roads and caused streams to overflow, inundating additional areas. On the island, two people were killed. Overall, the hurricane caused eight fatalities.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>former,</b> <b>the</b> subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a long}} history of {{interaction}} with humanity; depictions of the species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a largely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>former,</b> <b>the</b> species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, and foolish, yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in relatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the Physiologus, where the animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave robber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies the spotted hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued survival, both in captivity and the wild.|$|E

5|$|Despite passing {{closest to}} the Florida Keys, impact was minimal, limited to {{tropical}} storm-force winds and light rainfall. The outerbands of Isaac produced heavy precipitation further north, especially in Palm Beach, St. Lucie and Indian River counties. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>former,</b> <b>the</b> resultant flooding left numerous residents in Royal Palm Beach and Loxahatchee isolated. There was extensive street flooding, and water entered a few houses. Damage in Palm Beach County alone was nearly $71.6million (2012USD). Inland flooding was also reported in several other counties, though losses were generally minor. A tornado in Indian River County damaged 118mobile homes and 15single family homes. Further north in Central Florida and the Panhandle, the storm spawned four other tornadoes. Tides along the Gulf Coast of Florida caused erosion and coastal flooding in Bay, Collier, Franklin, Gulf, and Wakulla counties. Though winds caused little damage, around 113,000customers were left without electricity in South Florida. The storm resulted in two indirect fatalities, both caused by vehicles driving on slick roads in Palm Beach and Okeechobee counties. Throughout the state, damage reached approximately $91.45million.|$|E
5|$|The M2 {{is similar}} to that of eosimiids and almost {{identical}} to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows well-developed small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally well-developed crests. The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar shelf, the outer area of the tooth, is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an invagination in the outer wall of the tooth) more symmetrical <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>former.</b> <b>The</b> parastyle, a small cusp in the outer front corner of the tooth, is located more buccally (towards the outer side of the tooth) than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth, is more expansive. The lingual cingulum is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus.|$|E
