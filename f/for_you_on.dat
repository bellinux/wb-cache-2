500|$|The 1926 World Series {{produced}} one of {{the most}} famous anecdotes in baseball history, involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. Sylvester was an 11-year-old boy from Essex Fells, New Jersey who was supposedly hospitalized after falling off a horse. Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy's parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. Soon, the family received an airmail package with two balls, one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, [...] "I'll knock a homer <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> Wednesday". After Ruth hit three home runs in Game4 on October 6, newspapers reported that Sylvester's condition had miraculously improved. After the World Series had ended, Ruth made a highly publicized visit to Sylvester's home, in which the boy said to Ruth, [...] "I'm sorry the Yanks lost the series". In the spring of 1927, Sylvester's uncle visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy's life. Ruth asked how the boy was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards. After the man left, Ruth, who was seated next to a group of baseball writers, said, [...] "Now who the hell is Johnny Sylvester?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Rachael Blampied had auditioned 5 {{times for}} Shortland Street, with her last being {{for the role}} of Zlata Waldheim. However Blampied was turned down every time as she looked too similar to one of the core actresses, Beth Allen (who portrayed Brooke Freeman). After she auditioned {{for the role of}} Zlata, {{producers}} decided to utilise their similarities and create the role of Bree – a sister for Brooke, specifically for her. Blampied received a call in mid-2011 asking if she was eager to accept the role. She was extremely pleased with the call, saying; [...] "It's the best phone call an actor can wish for – that they're writing a part <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> a show {{you really want to be}} on. It was a complete surprise and totally out of the blue." [...] The character was originally planned to appear nicer but end up being [...] "badder" [...] than Brooke. Blampied started filming her scenes in October 2011. Blampied found her first day of work similar to walking [...] "into a beast" [...] and although she was nervous, she found it was like [...] "a family". In November TVNZ announced that a new addition would be arriving to Brooke's dysfunctional family, with Bree arriving on 9 December. Blampied enjoyed working alongside her screen sister, Allen and Pua Magasiva (who portrayed Brooke's boyfriend Vinnie), saying; [...] "I've had some great scenes with Beth and Pua, which have been enormous fun as they're such generous actors and are heaps of fun to hang out with!" [...] The character was originally envisioned to be killed off at the end of her stint, but producers were so impressed with Blampied that they rewrote the characters ending by sending her to a psychiatric hospital. Blampied was not aware as to what Bree was to endure throughout her stint but was informed that she was always going to leave after her initial storyline came to an end. She was sad to leave the soap but pleased with her exit, [...] "I was sad to have to leave the show, but it's not a closed exit. One of the writers said to me on my last day, 'Well it's always good to have a crazy in the cupboard.'" [...] Bree made her last appearance on 25 September 2012.|$|E
