40|$|We {{investigate}} the uncertainty {{associated with a}} joint quantum measurement of two components of spin of a spin- 1 / 2 particle and quantify {{this in terms of}} entropy. We consider two entropic quantities: the joint entropy and the sum of the marginal entropies, and obtain lower bounds for each of these quantities. For the case of joint measurements where we measure each spin observable equally well, these lower bounds are tight.

40|$|We {{show that}} loop quantum gravity {{suffers from a}} {{potential}} problem with non-locality, coming from a mismatch between micro-locality, {{as defined by the}} combinatorial structures of their microscopic states, and macro-locality, defined by the metric which emerges from the low energy limit. As a result, the low energy limit may suffer from a disordered locality characterized by identifications of far away points. We argue that if such defects in locality are rare enough they will be difficult to detect. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, revision with extended <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>result...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{expectation}} {{value of a}} Polyakov-Maldacena loop that wraps the thermal circle k times in strongly coupled N= 4 super Yang-Mills theory. This is achieved by considering probe D 3 and D 5 brane embeddings in the dual black hole geometry. In contrast to multiply wound spatial Wilson loops, nontrivial dependence on k is captured through D 5 branes. We find N^{- 2 / 3 } corrections, reminiscent of the scaling behaviour near a Gross-Witten transition.

40|$|In this paper, {{we use the}} {{non-linear}} dynamics of the individual quantum trajectories of an optical cavity inside an instantaneous quantum feedback loop to measure the phase shift between two pathways of light with an accuracy above the standard quantum limit. The feedback laser provides a reference frame and constantly increases the dependence {{of the state of}} the resonator on the unknown phase. Since our quantum metrology scheme can be implemented with current technology and does not require highly-efficient single photon detectors, it should be of practical interest until highly-entangled many-photon states become more readily available.

40|$|We report {{measurements}} and calculations of the spin-subband depopulation, induced by a parallel magnetic field, of dilute GaAs two-dimensional (2 D) hole systems. The results reveal that {{the shape of the}} confining potential dramatically affects the values of in-plane magnetic field at which the upper spin subband is depopulated. Most surprisingly, unlike 2 D electron systems, the carrier-carrier interaction in 2 D hole systems does not significantly enhance the spin susceptibility. We interpret our findings using a multipole expansion of the spin density matrix, and suggest that the suppression of the enhancement is related to the holes' band structure and effective spin j= 3 / 2.

40|$|In {{the context}} of inflationary models with a pre-inflationary stage, in which the Einstein {{equations}} are obeyed, the weak energy condition is satisfied, and spacetime topology is trivial, we argue that homogeneity on super-Hubble scales must be assumed as an initial condition. Models in which inflation arises from field dynamics in a Friedman-Robertson-Walker background fall into this class but models in which inflation originates at the Planck epoch, eg. chaotic inflation, may evade this conclusion. Our arguments rest on causality and general relativistic constraints {{on the structure of}} spacetime. We discuss modifications to existing scenarios that may avoid the need for initial large-scale homogeneity.

40|$|We {{show that}} the Polyakov loop {{approaches}} its asymptotic value at high temperatures from below in any strongly-coupled gauge theory at large N_c with a dual supergravity description. In these theories the Polyakov loop {{can be used to}} define a quantity that behaves as a free energy of a heavy quark in the medium. This should be compared to the recent lattice results in pure glue SU(3) theory at high temperatures where the Polyakov loop approaches its non-interacting limit from above. We {{show that the}} "heavy quark free energy" obtained from the renormalized loop computed on the lattice does not behave as a true thermodynamic free energy. We conjecture that this should always be the case in asymptotically free gauge theories.

40|$|The {{question}} {{of determining the}} underlying Fermi surface (FS) that is gapped by superconductivity (SC) is of central importance in strongly correlated systems, particularly in view of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Here we explore various definitions of the FS in the superconducting state using the zero-energy Green's function, the excitation spectrum and the momentum distribution. We examine (a) d-wave SC in high Tc cuprates, and (b) the s-wave superfluid in the BCS-BEC crossover. In each case we show that the various definitions agree, to a large extent, {{but all of them}} violate the Luttinger count and do not enclose the total electron density. We discuss the important role of chemical potential renormalization and incoherent spectral weight in this violation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the recently proposed label-propagation algorithm (LPA) for identifying network communities. We reformulate the LPA as an equivalent optimization problem, giving an objective function whose maxima correspond to community solutions. By considering {{properties of the}} objective function, we identify conceptual and practical drawbacks of the label propagation approach, most importantly the disparity between increasing {{the value of the}} objective function and improving the quality of communities found. To address the drawbacks, we modify the objective function in the optimization problem, producing a variety of algorithms that propagate labels subject to constraints; of particular interest is a variant that maximizes the modularity measure of community quality. Performance properties and implementation details of the proposed algorithms are discussed. Bipartite as well as unipartite networks are considered.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the formulation of}} entropic gravity in two spacetime dimensions. The usual gravitational force law is derived {{even in the absence}} of area, as normally required by the holographic principle. A special feature of this perspective concerns the nature of temperature and entropy defined at a point. We argue that the constancy of the gravitational force in one spatial dimension implies the information contained at each point in space is an internal degree of freedom on the manifold, and furthermore is a universal constant, contrary to previous assertions that entropic gravity in one spatial dimension is ill-defined. We give some heuristic arguments for gravitation and information transfer constraints within this framework, thus adding weight to the contention that spacetime and gravitation might be emergent phenomena.

40|$|We {{examine the}} spin current {{generated}} by quantum dots embedded in an optical microcavity. The dots {{are connected to}} leads, which allow electrons to tunnel {{into and out of}} the dot. The spin current is generated by spin flip transitions induced by a quantized electromagnetic field inside the cavity with one of the Zeeman states lying below the Fermi level of the leads and the other above. In the limit of strong Coulomb blockade, this model is analogous to the Jaynes-Cummings model in quantum optics. We find that the cavity field amplitude and the spin current exhibit bistability as a function of the laser amplitude, which is driving the cavity mode. Even in the limit of a single dot, the spin current and the Q distribution of the cavity field have a bimodal structure.

40|$|Magmatism in {{subduction}} zones builds continental {{crust and}} causes most of Earth's subaerial volcanism. The production rate {{and composition of}} magmas are controlled by the thermal structure of subduction zones. A range of geochemical and heat flow evidence has recently converged to indicate that subduction zones are hotter at lithospheric depths beneath the arc than predicted by canonical thermomechanical models, which neglect magmatism. We show that this discrepancy can be resolved by consideration of the heat transported by magma. In our one- and two-dimensional numerical models and scaling analysis, magmatic transport of sensible and latent heat locally alters the thermal structure of canonical models by ∼ 300 K, increasing predicted surface heat flow and mid-lithospheric temperatures to observed values. We find the advection of sensible heat to be larger than the deposition of latent heat. Based on these results we conclude that thermal transport by magma migration affects the chemistry {{and the location of}} arc volcanoes.

40|$|We examine various {{possibilities}} for realistic 5 D higgsless models and construct a full quark sector featuring next-to-minimal flavor violation (with an exact bulk SU(2) protecting {{the first two}} generations) satisfying electroweak and flavor constraints. The "new custodially protected representation" {{is used for the}} third generation to protect the light quarks from flavor violations induced due to the heavy top. A combination of flavor symmetries, and RS-GIM for the right-handed quarks suppresses flavor-changing neutral currents below experimental bounds, assuming CKM-type mixing on the UV brane. In addition to the usual higgsless RS signals, this model predicts an exotic charge- 5 / 3 quark with mass of about 0. 5 TeV which should show up at the LHC very quickly, as well as nonzero flavor-changing neutral currents which could be detected in the next generation of flavor experiments. In the course of our analysis, we also find quantitative estimates for the errors of the fermion zero mode approximation, which are significant for higgsless-type models.

40|$|We study generalizations of the singlet-sector amplitude-product (AP) {{states in}} the valence-bond basis of S= 1 / 2 quantum spin systems. In the {{standard}} AP states, {{the weight of a}} tiling of the system into valence bonds (singlets of two spins) is a product of amplitudes depending on the length of the bonds. We here introduce correlated AP (CAP) states, in which the amplitude product is further multiplied by factors depending on two bonds connected to a pair of sites (here nearest neighbors). While the standard AP states can describe a phase transition between an antiferromagnetic (Neel) state and a valence-bond solid (VBS) in one dimension (which we also study here), in two dimensions it cannot describe VBS order. With the CAP states, Neel-VBS transitions are realized as a function of some parameter describing the bond correlations. We here study such phase transitions of CAP wave-functions on the square lattice. We find examples of direct first-order Neel-VBS transitions, as well as cases where there is an extended U(1) spin liquid phase intervening between the Neel and VBS states. In the latter case the transitions are continuous and we extract critical exponents and address the issue of a possible emergent U(1) symmetry in the near-critical VBS. We also consider variationally optimized CAP states for the standard Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions and the J-Q model in two dimensions, with the latter including four-spin interactions (Q) in addition to the Heisenberg exchange (J) and harboring VBS order for large Q/J. The optimized CAP states lead to significantly lower variational energies than the simple AP states for these models.
