50|$|After the war, Krisson resumed as a {{printing}} business, but Comino left day-to-day {{management in the}} hands of senior staff so that he could devote himself to the Dexion slotted angle concept (though he did write a history of the printing business, published as The Krisson Story in 1953). Several prototypes were made, and in 1946, with £7000 savings and £7000 borrowed from Krisson's bankers, he invested in a second-hand Henry & Wright standard <b>die</b> <b>press,</b> and began manufacture, adapting the press so that the steel strip could be continuously fed into it and painted. In May 1947, he established a factory in Chingford in north-east London, staffed by nine factory workers and one sales person, but sales were initially disappointing, partly due to post-war cash payment requirements. However, sales and production increased to 50,000 feet per week in 1949, generating a business turnover of £500,000 that year. During 1950, the Dexion strips began to be used for exhibitions, and production reached 125,000 feet per week, and a new Dexion factory was opened in Enfield.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} direct lipid {{analysis}} by MALDI mass spectrometry in intact membranes, without prior extraction/separation steps, is described. The purple membrane {{isolated from the}} extremely halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum was selected as model membrane. Lyophilized purple membrane were grinded with 9 -aminoacridine (9 -AA) as dry matrix, and the powder mixture was crushed in a mechanical <b>die</b> <b>press</b> to form a thin pellet. Small pieces of the pellet were then attached to the MALDI target and directly analyzed. In parallel, individual archaebacterial phospholipids and glycolipids, together with the total lipid extract of the purple membrane, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS using 9 -AA as the matrix in solution. Results show that 9 -AA represents a suitable matrix for the conventional MALDI-TOF/MS analysis of lipid extracts from archaeal microorganisms, {{as well as for}} fast and reliable direct dry lipid analysis of lyophilized archaebacterial membranes. This method might be of general application, offering the advantage of quickly gaining information about lipid components without disrupting or altering the membrane matrix...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Since {{magnetism}} {{is strongly}} stress dependent, Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) inspection tools {{have the potential}} to locate and characterize mechanical damage in pipelines. However, MFL application to mechanical damage detection faces hurdles which make signal interpretation problematic: 1) the MFL signal is a superposition of geometrical and stress effects, 2) the stress distribution around a mechanically damaged region is very complex, consisting of plastic deformation and residual (elastic) stresses, 3) the effect of stress on magnetic behaviour is not well understood. This paper summarizes recent results of experimental and modeling studies of MFL signals resulting from mechanical damage. In experimental studies, mechanical damage was simulated using a tool and <b>die</b> <b>press</b> to produce dents of varying depths in plate samples. MFL measurements were made before and after selective stressrelieving heat treatments. These annealing treatments enabled the stress and geometry components of the MFL signal to be separated. In general, geometry effects scale with dent depth and tend to dominate in deep dents, while stress contribution to the MFL signals is relatively constant and is more significant for shallow dents. The influence of other parameters such as flux density and topside/bottomside inspection was also quantified. In the finite element analysis work, stress was incorporated by modifying the magnetic permeability in th...|$|E
40|$|Optimizing complex {{engineering}} {{problems may}} demand large computational efforts {{because of the}} use of numerical models. Global optimization can be established through the use of evolutionary algorithms, but may demand a prohibitive amount of computational time. In order to reduce the computational time, we incorporate in the global optimization procedures a physics-based fast coarse model. This paper presents a two-level genetic algorithm (2 LGA) for electromagnetic optimization. This algorithm employs the global convergence properties of the genetic algorithm, where acceleration of the optimization results from the fast computations of the coarse model (low level) and where accuracy is guaranteed by using a limited number of fine model (high level) evaluations. Using the coarse model, we iteratively build surrogate models (intermediate levels) where metamodels produce surrogate models which approximate the fine model. The proposed algorithm comprises internal parameters which are self-tunable. We applied the 2 LGA to the optimization of an algebraic test function, to the optimization of a <b>die</b> <b>press</b> model (TEAM Workshop Problem 25) and to the optimization of an octangular double-layered electromagnetic shield. The results show that the 2 LGA is converging to the optimal solutions as the traditional genetic algorithm and that the acceleration is dependent on the accuracy of the low level. An acceleration factor of more than two can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDensification {{process of}} {{granules}} from roll-compacted binary mixtures of microcrystalline cellulose, known as ductile powder, and lactose, considered a brittle material, was investigated using a full-instrumented <b>die</b> <b>press.</b> The role of each component {{and the effect}} of the granule size on tablet properties were analysed. Based on the stress transmission measurements in axial and radial directions, the densification behaviour of granules and original mixtures was studied and correlated to the deformation mechanisms of the granules. Results showed that tablets produced with granules presented lower tensile strength than the tablets produced with the original binary mixtures. Attending the granule size, an increase in the size was translated into a reduction of tensile strength of tablet. The analysis of the axial stress transmission ratio, which measures the loss of stress from the top {{to the bottom of the}} powder bed, showed a lower value for granules than for the original mixtures. This difference was attributed to the work consumed in the fragmentation of granules during the densification process. However, the granules fragmentation limits the development of large contact surface between particles and results in lower tablet's strength. Moreover, the reduction of tensile strength was more significant for a high percentage of the ductile material in the mixture. In order to reduce the effect of loss of reworkability, quality by design should be applied from the process development and formulation perspectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractCurrently {{technologies}} {{which are}} applied for leather cutting include slitting knifes, <b>die</b> <b>press</b> techniques and manual cutting. Use of laser technology has grown significantly during recent years due to number of advantages over conventional cutting methods; flexibility, high production speed, possibility to cut complex geometries, easier cutting of customized parts, and less leftovers of leather makes laser cutting {{more and more}} economically attractive to apply for leather cutting. Laser technology provides advantages in cutting complex geometries, stable cutting quality and possibility to utilize leather material in economically best way. Constant quality is important in industrial processes and laser technology fulfills this requirement: properly chosen laser cutting parameters provides identical cuts. Additionally, laser technology is very flexible in terms of geometries: complex geometries, individual designs, prototypes and small scale products can be manufactured by laser cutting. Variety of products, which needed to be cut in small volumes, is also the application where laser cutting can be more beneficial due to possibility to change production from one product to another only by changing geometry without a need to change cutting tool. Disadvantages of laser processing include high initial investment costs and some running costs due to maintenance and required gas supply for the laser. Higher level of operator's expertise is required due to more complicated machinery in case of laser cutting. This study investigates {{advantages and disadvantages of}} laser cutting in different areas of application and provides comparison between laser cutting and mechanical cutting of leather...|$|E
