5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{meeting the needs}} of the British forces, Project E affected the design and development of British nuclear weapons. Interim designs like Violet Club were no longer required, as Project E weapons could <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> pending the development of a British weapon. The British designers were particularly impressed by the Mark 28, which was not only lighter than the British Green Grass warhead used in Yellow Sun, but remarkably more economical in its use of expensive fissile material. An Anglicised version of the Mark 28 was developed, known as Red Snow, and a Yellow Sun Mark 2 using Red Snow cost £500,000 compared with £1,200,000 for the Mark 1 with Green Grass.|$|E

5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he could do things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting with}} Fleming led to Hawks's first {{job in the}} film industry, as a prop boy on the Douglas Fairbanks film In Again, Out Again (on which Fleming was {{employed}} as the cinematographer) for Famous Players-Lasky. According to Hawks, a new set needed to be built quickly when the studio's set designer was unavailable, so Hawks volunteered to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> himself, much to Fairbanks's satisfaction. He was next employed as a prop boy and general assistant on an unspecified film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. (Hawks never named the film in later interviews and DeMille made five films roughly in that time period).|$|E

5|$|Culann {{the smith}} invites Conchobar to a feast at his house. Before going, Conchobar {{goes to the}} playing field to watch the boys play hurling. He is so {{impressed}} by Sétanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. Sétanta has a game to finish, but promises to follow the king later. But Conchobar forgets, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to protect his house. When Sétanta arrives, the enormous hound attacks him, but he kills it in self-defence, in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, and in another by driving a sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley. Culann is devastated {{by the loss of}} his hound, so Sétanta promises he will rear him a replacement, and until it is old enough to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> he himself will guard Culann's house. The druid Cathbad announces that his name henceforth will be Cú Chulainn—"Culann's Hound".|$|E
5|$|Joining Mikulski as an {{advocate}} for servicing Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who {{was present at the}} meeting when O'Keefe announced the cancellation of the mission. A veteran astronaut of four shuttle missions, including two Hubble servicing missions, Grunsfeld had devoted years to Hubble, and was very disappointed when O'Keefe canceled the mission. He briefly considered retiring from NASA, but realized if he stayed, he could continue to advance physics in other ways. Instead, Grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service the telescope, possibly by sending a robot into orbit to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> When O'Keefe announced his resignation as Administrator in December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences committee opposed O'Keefe's position regarding servicing Hubble, the media and science community saw hope for the telescope's servicing mission to be reinstated.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 1861, Frémont ordered Grant {{to embark}} south with his troops from Cairo to attack Confederate {{soldiers}} encamped in Belmont, Missouri. Grant, along with Brigadier General John A. McClernand, landed 2,500 men at Hunter's Point, two {{miles north of}} the Confederate base outside Belmont. They took the camp, but the reinforced Confederates under Brigadier Generals Frank Cheatham and Gideon J. Pillow forced a chaotic Union retreat. At first, Grant had wanted to destroy Confederate strongholds at both Belmont, Missouri and Columbus, Kentucky, but Frémont had not given Grant enough troops to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> All Grant's men could do was disrupt the Confederates and fight their way back to their Union boats. They escaped back to Cairo under fire from the heavily fortified stronghold at Columbus. A tactical defeat, the battle gave Grant's volunteers confidence and experience.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaurs {{had large}} {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These suggest a highly developed {{sense of smell}} which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs. Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way, arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds, which use their keen senses and energy-efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically. Researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might {{have had to be}} cold-blooded in order to get more calories from carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> as {{he said at the}} start of the episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
