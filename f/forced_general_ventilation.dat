40|$|Abstract: According to the Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 /EC, {{one of the}} {{essential}} requirements relating to {{occupational safety and health}} hazards is to prevent dust pollution emitted by machinery during the implementation processes. Research on evaluation of emissions from machinery, according to the method of test bench using tracer gases, are currently being conducted in CIOP-PIB. This article presents some aspects of dust emission and efficiency of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) during metal grinding. Studies were performed with 10 sources of dust emissions during grinding. To evaluate the pollutants emission in the process of grinding metal products sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) was selected as a tracer gas. The results show that wherever dust is emitted, the LEV should be supported by the <b>general</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Ensure good interaction between all elements of modifying the air flow and the spread of pollutants in the surroundings of the LEV is essential to effective protection of human working zone against pollutants. We used five variants of ventilation: ventilation turned off, the LEV, one-way <b>general</b> <b>ventilation,</b> mixed <b>general</b> <b>ventilation</b> and displacement <b>general</b> <b>ventilation.</b> An increase in the efficiency of dust capture depending on the source of emission by 2. 5 – 14 % was observed. This confirms that characteristics of flow resulting from the operation of ventilation is important in the spread of pollutants in the room...|$|R

40|$|Abstraet [...] A {{survey of}} the carboxyhaemoglobin levels of welders using the bare-wire dip-transfer carbon dioxide {{shielded}} welding process was performed to see whether excessive amounts of carbon monoxide were being absorbed by the operators. It was {{found that there was}} a possible hazard from carbon monoxide unless great attention was paid to the standard of <b>ventilation.</b> If the <b>general</b> <b>ventilation</b> was defective then local exhaust ventilation was shown to be necessary. In one area surveyed a dramatic fall in carboxyhaemoglobin levels was noticed after improvements were made in the <b>general</b> <b>ventilation</b> and local exhaust ventilation installed.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{short-term}} exposures to ethylene oxide, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde in a sterilization process, the authors conducted continuous environmental monitoring of these chemicals in the breathing zone of workers in 2 hospitals. The arithmetic mean of ethylene oxide was 1. 2 ppm near unventilated cabinets housing sterilizing materials, and environmental concentrations of ethylene oxide could not be reduced under threshold limit values time weighted average by only managing <b>general</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Environmental concentration of formaldehyde was lower in a properly ventilated pathology division in which no large specimens were stored (0. 3 ppm) than in the pathology division where large specimens were stored (2. 3 ppm). Although environmental concentrations of glutaraldehyde in an endoscopy unit with proper <b>general</b> <b>ventilation</b> were not detectable, environmental concentration levels in an endoscopy unit without <b>general</b> <b>ventilation</b> system were 0. 2 and 0. 5 ppm. According {{to the results of}} environmental monitoring in the breathing zone of workers, extremely high concentrations were observed in some work practices (ethylene oxide, 300 ppm; formaldehyde, 8. 6 ppm; glutaraldehyde, 2. 6 ppm). In order to avoid occupational exposures to these chemicals and prevent potential chronic and acute health hazards, good communications with these chemicals, good work practices, appropriate personal protective equipment, and engineering controls should be required. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Commonly, screens {{were placed}} over {{openings}} reducing airflow by approximately 50% so the opening area was increased appropriately. The requirement for <b>general</b> <b>ventilation</b> and {{the requirement for}} sufficient combustion air are quite different. A typical arrangement might be to make the opening large enough to provide intake air plus [...] per Minute (CFM) for additional ventilation. Engines pull sufficient air into the fire room for their own operation. However, additional airflow for ventilation usually requires intake and exhaust blowers.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{part of the}} {{refining}} of {{gold and}} silver molten metal, silver dust and fumes are released into the atmosphere. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) enforces an 8 -hour, equivalent Time Weighted Average concentration limit for silver dust and fumes of 10 µg/m 3. MSHA initiated a program to assess the controls that were being used to control silver dust and fume exposure. Refineries were visited at six mines. The layout of each refinery and the controls used varied at each refinery. At each operation, personal and area silver fume and dust samples were collected to assess worker exposures and to determine sources of fume. Primary source of silver dust and fume exposure was the pouring of molten metal from the furnace. Secondary sources of exposure included: precipitate mixing, bar cooling, and housekeeping. Guidelines were developed addressing housekeeping, exhaust <b>ventilation,</b> <b>general</b> <b>ventilation,</b> administrative controls, and system monitoring. In most cases, housekeeping and <b>general</b> <b>ventilation</b> were adequate; however, the exhaust ventilation systems needed to be improved. 1 INRODUCTION Silver dust and fumes become airborne during the refining step of producing gold and silver.
