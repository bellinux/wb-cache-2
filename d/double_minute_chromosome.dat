40|$|AbstractA {{reduction}} in the DNA modification of cytosine methylation has been linked directly to chromosome rearrangements concomitant with retroelement amplification in several marsupial hybrid genomes. While phenotypes observed for interspecific eutherian hybrids are suggestive of methylation perturbations and retroelement instability, no link between retroelements, DNA methylation, and chromosome instability has yet been identified. Previous studies in eutherian hybrids, however, have been limited to a gross examination of methylation using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme analysis or focused on single-copy genes and/or have avoided examination of repetitive DNA. Methylation changes and retroelements are proposed as mechanisms for <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosome</b> formation and oncogene amplification, both present in the genome of a Mus hybrid model, thus making it an ideal system to evaluate methylation status more closely. We have used the PCR-based methodologies methylation-sensitive amplicon subtraction (MS-AS) and methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) to detect differentially methylated sequences between three complex genomes and to isolate methylation perturbations in a Mus musculus×Mus caroli hybrid. This novel application of MS-AS and MS-RDA resulted in the isolation of differentially methylated retroelements surrounding the locus on Chromosome 10 responsible for <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosome</b> formation within this interspecific eutherian hybrid...|$|E

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are {{cytogenetic}} {{manifestations of}} gene amplification frequently seen in cancer cells. Genes amplified on <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> include oncogenes and multi-drug resistant genes. These genes encode proteins which contribute to cancer formation, cancer progression, {{and development of}} resistance to drugs used in cancer treatment. Elimination of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and therefore genes amplified on them, is {{an effective way to}} decrease the malignancy of cancer cells. We investigated the effectiveness of a cancer drug, gemcitabine, on the loss of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from the ovarian cancer cell line UACC- 1598. Gemcitabine is able to decrease the number of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in cells at a 7500 X lower concentration than the commonly used cancer drug hydroxyurea. Amplified genes present on the <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are decreased at the DNA level upon gemcitabine treatment.

The selective incorporation of <b>double</b> <b>minutes</b> chromatin and c-H 2 AX signals into micronuclei provides a strong link between DNA damage and the loss of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from gemcitabine treated cells.

These cells contained multiple {{copies of the}} dihydrofolate reductase gene which were associated with <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> The growth rate of these cells {{in the absence of}} methotrexate was inversely related to the degree of gene amplification (number of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes).</b> Cells could both gain and lose genes {{as a result of an}} unequal distribution of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> into daughter cells at mitosis. The loss of amplified dihydrofolate reductase genes during growth in the absence of methotrexate resulted from the continual generation of cells containing lower numbers of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Because of the growth advantage of these cells, they became dominant in the population. We also studied an unstably resistant S- 180 cell line (clone) that, after 3 years of continuous growth in methotrexate, generated cells containing stably amplified dihydrofolate reductase genes.

40|$|A genetic system {{comprised}} of mammalian cell mutants which demonstrate concomitant resistance {{to a number}} of unrelated drugs has been described previously. The resistance is due to reduced cell membrane permeability and is correlated with the presence of large amounts of a plasma membrane glycoprotein termed P-glycoprotein. This system could represent a model for multiple drug resistance which develops in cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic drugs. We demonstrate here that the multiple drug resistance phenotype can be transferred to mouse cells with DNA from a drug-resistant mutant and then amplified quantitatively by culture in media containing increasing concentrations of drug. The amount of P-glycoprotein was correlated directly with the degree of drug resistance in the transformants and amplified transformants. In addition, the drug resistance and expression of P-glycoprotein of the transformants were unstable and associated quantitatively with the number of double minute chromosomes. We suggest that the gene for multiple drug resistance and P-glycoprotein is contained in these extrachromosomal particles and is amplified by increases in <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosome</b> number.

Pharmacological inhibition of CK 1 increases p 53 protein level and induces cell death, whilst small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of CK 1 a stabilizes p 53 and induces growth arrest. We mapped the dominant protein-protein interface that stabilizes the MDM 2 and CK 1 a complex in order to determine whether a peptide derived from the core CK 1 a-MDM 2 interface form novel Biologics {{that can be used to}} probe the contribution of the CK 1 -MDM 2 protein-protein interaction to p 53 activation and cell viability. Overlapping peptides derived from CK 1 a were screened for dominant MDM 2 binding sites using (i) ELISA with recombinant MDM 2; (ii) cell lysate pull-down towards endogenous MDM 2; (iii) MDM 2 -CK 1 a complex-based competition ELISA; and (iv) MDM 2 -mediated ubiquitination. One dominant peptide, peptide 35 was bioactive in all four assays and its transfection induced cell death/growth arrest in a p 53 -independent manner.

From previous and present karyotypes, it appears that the homogeneously staining regions reside on a distorted X chromosome. Therefore, amplification of c-myc has been accompanied by translocation of the gene from its normal position on chromosome 8 (8 q 24).

40|$|Background: Epidemiological studies {{indicate}} {{increased risk of}} leukemia, lymphoma, and brain tumor among electrical workers exposed to electromagnetic field (EMF). Other investigator reported that continuous exposure of four successive generations of mice to EMF in doses of 1 kV to 5 kV caused tumor formation in offspring. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of continuous exposure of three successive generations of mice (Mus musculus L) to EMF of 3 kV, 4 kV, and  5 kV and its implication of chromosomal breakage, as detected by double minute formation. Methods: Four couples of mice of Swiss Webster strain, 3 - 4 months of age, and 7 - 40 gram of body weight were exposed to EMF at the doses of 3 kV, 4 kV, and 5 kV, and one couple served as control. Double minute formation was examined in all offspring, except one couple of each group to be exposed with the same doses of EMF to get the F 2 generation, and so forth until F 3 generation. Twenty metaphases of chromosomes were examined and frequencies of double minute were calculated in the three generations of all group. Results: Frequencies of double minute in F 1, F 2, and F 3 of mice exposed to EMF of 3 kV were respectively 0. 78  ±  0. 08;  0. 83  ±  0. 09; and 0. 80  ±  0. 05. In the 4 kV group were 0. 083  ±  0. 11; 0. 73  ±  0. 03; and 0. 96  ±  0. 15, and in the 5 kV group were  0. 96  ±  0. 25; 0. 75  ±  0. 05; and 0. 99  ±  0. 33, whereas no double minute chromosomes were noted in control group. Frequencies of the double minute in mice exposed to EMF were significantly higher than control group. Conclusions: Continuous exposure of mice during three successive generations to EMF at doses of 3 kV, 4 kV, and 5 kV causes increased chromosomal breakage as detected as <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosome</b> formation.

They can well represent the advanced stage of malignancy. However, the mechanisms of DM generation are still not fully understood. Here, the {{sister chromatid}} exchange (SCE) {{was used to determine}} whether the occurrence of DMs was related to the high genomic instability in human carcinoma cells. We analyzed SCE frequencies in two groups of cell lines: the first group contained DM-positive cell lines such as UACC- 1598, SK-PN-DW, and NCI-N 87 carcinomas, while the second group comprised DM-negative cell lines including HO- 8910, U 251, and MGC- 803. Results: The data showed that SCE was significantly increased in the DM-positive cells as compared to the DM-negative cells. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the incidence of DMs and the SCE frequency in the UACC- 1598, SK-PN-DW, and NCI-N 87 carcinoma cells. Conclusions: Because SCE can reflect general genome instability, it is suggested that the DMs are likely to be closely associated with genomic instability in carcinoma cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Neuroblastoma (NB) is {{the most}} common extracranial solid tumour of childhood. Several genomic {{imbalances}} correlate to prognosis in NB, with structural rearrangements, including gene amplification, in a near-diploid setting typically signifying high-risk tumours and numerical changes in a near-triploid setting signifying low-risk tumours. Little is known about the temporal sequence in which these imbalances occur during the carcinogenic process. Methods We have reconstructed the appearance of cytogenetic imbalances in 270 NBs by first grouping tumours and imbalances through principal component analysis and then using the number of imbalances in each tumour as an indicator of evolutionary progression. Results Tumours clustered in four sub-groups, dominated respectively by (1) gene amplification in <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and few other aberrations, (2) gene amplification and loss of 1 p sequences, (3) loss of 1 p and other structural aberrations including gain of 17 q, and (4) whole-chromosome gains and losses. Temporal analysis showed that the structural changes in groups 1 – 3 were acquired in a step-wise fashion, with loss of 1 p sequences and the emergence of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> as the earliest cytogenetic events. In contrast, the gains and losses of whole chromosomes in group 4 occurred through multiple simultaneous events leading to a near-triploid chromosome number. Conclusion The finding of different temporal patterns for the acquisition of genomic imbalances in high-risk and low-risk NBs lends strong support to the hypothesis that these tumours are biologically diverse entities, evolving through distinct genetic mechanisms. </p...|$|R

A striking variability of phenotype and chromosome constitution was observed among the different variants. All resistant cell lines exhibited a greatly increased dihydrofolic acid reductase (DHFR) activity and DHFR content; however, the DHFR activity levels varied considerably among the variants, ranging between about 35 and 275 times the parental level. In the absence of selective pressure, the increased DHFR activity was unstable, and in all cell lines but one was completely lost over a period ranging in different variants between 25 and 200 days. The MTX-resistant cells lines showed anomalies in their chromosome constitution, which involved the occurrence of a duplicated set of chromosomes in most cells {{of some of the}} variants and the presence of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in all cell lines. An analysis of the correlation of loss of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and loss of DHFR activity in the absence of MTX has given results consistent with the idea that the double-minute chromosomes contain amplified DHFR genes. However, the most significant finding is that, in contrast to what has been reported in the mouse system, the recognizable double-minute chromosomes varied greatly in number in different variants without any relationship to either the level of DHFR activity or the degree of instability of MTX resistance in the absence of selective pressure. These and other observations point to the occurrence in the human MTX-resistant variants of another set of DHFR genes, representing a varied proportion of the total, which is associated with the regular chromosomes, and which may be unstable in the absence of selective pressure...|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} number of copies of specific genes may offer an advantage to cells when they grow in restrictive conditions {{such as in the}} presence of toxic drugs, or in a tumor. Three mathematical models of gene amplification and deamplification are proposed to describe the kinetics of unstable phenotypes of cells with amplified genes. The models differ in details but all assume probabilistic mechanisms of increase and decrease in gene copy number per cell (gene amplification/deamplification). Analysis of the models indicates that a stable distribution of numbers of copies of genes per cell, observed experimentally, exists only if the probability of deamplification exceeds the probability of amplification. The models are fitted to published data on the loss of methotrexate resistance in cultured cell lines, due to the loss of amplified dihydrofolate reductase gene. For two mouse cell lines unstably resistant to methotrexate the probabilities of amplification and deamplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene on <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are estimated to be approximately 2 % and 10 %, respectively. These probabilities are much higher than widely presumed. The models explain the gradual disappearance of the resistant phenotype when selective pressure is withdrawn, by postulating that the rate of deamplification exceeds the rate of amplification. Thus {{it is not necessary to}} invoke a growth advantage of nonresistant cells which has been the standard explanation. For another analogous process, the loss of <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> containing the myc oncogene from SEWA tumor cells, the growth advantage model does seem to be superior to the amplification and deamplification model. In a more theoretical section of the paper, it is demonstrated that gene amplification/deamplification can result in reduction to homozygosity, such as is observed in some tumors. Other applications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Interspecific {{hybridization}} of marsupial species {{leads to}} genomic instability {{as a result}} of methylation aberrations and retroelement activation. Eutherian mammals last shared a common ancestor with marsupial mammals approximately 147 mya. However, no study has successfully addressed whether retroelement demethylation contributes to eutherian hybrid genomic instability, yet phenotypes and preliminary evidence suggest eutherian interspecific hybrids may be subject to the same patterns of genomic instability as that observed in marsupials. This thesis examines the hypothesis that interspecific hybridization of eutherian species results in genomic instability {{as a result of}} aberrant methylation and retroelement activation. Genomic instability manifesting as <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in cell lines from a 16 d Mus musculus X Mus caroli hybrid was characterized and determined to be amplification of an oncogene, mdm 2. Hybrid-specific methylation abnormalities were isolated using a novel application of a methylation-sensitive substractive hybridization technique. These data showed that the <b>double</b> <b>minutes</b> were a result of demethylation targeted to retroelements surrounding the mdm 2 locus that was amplified on the <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> This is the first demonstration of retroelement demethylation in a eutherian hybrid. Additional M. musculus X M. caroli hybrids were produced using artificial insemination to allow for an examination of developmental timing of genetic instability as well as to further quantify the underlying cause of these destabilizing events. These hybrids were growth retarded and morphologically abnormal, with hypoplastic placentas. Isolation of hybrid-specific methylation changes produced a library of sequences enriched in retroelements. A functional genomics approach revealed the pathology observed in two 13 d M. musculus X M. caroli hybrids was the result of overexpression of the retroelement mvL 30 - 1. The activation of mvL 30 - 1 was a direct result of undermethylation in the hybrid genomes and was most pronounced in the placenta. The results presented herein provide evidence that the placenta is a specific site of genomic instability via demethylation and retroelement activation in interspecitic hybridization. This research will lead to a further understanding of hybrid dysgenesis and genomic instability and contributes {{to our understanding of the}} mechanisms and genes that, in concert, play a role in abnormal placental growth. ...|$|R

The results indicate that although Zn, Cu, Hg, Ag, Co, Ni, and Bi induce metallothionein-I mRNA accumulation in both Cdr 80 and Cds cells, the Cdr 80 cells show increased resistance to only a subset of these metals (Zn, Cu, Hg, and Bi). This suggests that not all metals which induce metallothionein mRNA are detoxified by metallothionein and argues against autoregulation of metallothionein genes. Metallothionein-I mRNA is also induced by iodoacetate, suggesting that the regulatory molecule has sensitive sulfhydryl groups...|$|R
40|$|Neuroblastoma (NB) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} childhood solid tumor. The {{aim of this study}} was to report on the prognostic significance of clinical parameters (age and stage), genetic (Ip deletion and N-myc amplification - NMA) and cytogenetic results in 47 NB patients diagnosed at the Mother and Child Health Institute of Serbia "Dr Vukan Čupić". Clinical factors evaluated in this study were age and clinical stage. The 5 -year overall survival (OS) was best (73 %) in the age group children less than 1 year, compared with the older children (15 %). Stage IV patients had worst outcome (13 %) than 'non-stage IV patients (47 %). Genetic factors analyzed in this series of NB patients were: Ip deletion and NMA. 5 -year OS was: 65 % in the Ip deletion negative group and 13 % in the Ip 36 deletion positive group; 58 % in the NMA negative and 19 % in NMA positive group. Cytogenetic results showed that normal karyotype, near-diploidy, near-tetraploidy and homogeneously staining regions (hsr) and <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (dms), together with age over 1 year and stage IV were a very poor prognostic factors...|$|R
40|$|Radiations and {{chemical}} carcinogens induce the amplification of viral DNA inserts {{and of their}} cellular flanking sequences in SV 40 -transformed Chinese hamster embyro cells. In the cell line CO 60, the phenomenon is easily measured by in situ hybridization using SV 40 -DNA as a probe. We found that the appearance of microchromosomes (MC) in CO 60 metaphases correlated well with the induction of SV 40 -DNA amplification (SDA) mediated in the same cells by chemical carcinogens. SDA and MC formation had the same inducers and were essentially transient phenomena whose occurrence and disappearance were simultaneous. The banding properties of MC and the respective time courses of induction of chromosome aberrations and MC formation/disappearance indicated that MC were not chromosome or chromatid breaks but rather acentric <b>double</b> minute-like <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>Double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (DM) {{have been shown to}} contain amplified genes. They specifically occur in established cell lines and in vivo tumor cells. Therefore, the reported correlations between SDA and MC formation and the homologies between MC and DM in CO 60 cells further support the existence of specific relationships between mutagenesis, gene amplification, in vivo selective pressures and tumor cytogenetics. © 1986 IRL Press Ltd.

40|$|Cancer {{research}} {{is a study}} of tragic complexity. The more we discover about this disease, the more we realize how much we have to learn. It relentlessly unravels new complications, justifying the difficulty we have had in ridding cancer from the human experience. Nevertheless, we strive to conquer it. To accomplish this noble goal, we require tools to understand a patient's specific tumor in as comprehensive a manner as possible. The methods presented here aim to provide a complete assessment of a tumor's genome, discovering the alterations made to the patient's germline genome that may {{have given rise to}} cancer. Mutations both large and small are identified and integrated using various techniques to discover the events and elements specific to the tumor genome. The methods will be used on whole genome sequencing data of several tumors, revealing the structural events that occurred in multiple tumors. <b>Double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in GBM tumors will be discovered computationally and confirmed experimentally. Finally, techniques that expose tumor clonality will be described and used to infer whole genome, allele-specific copy number profiles of all major clones comprising a tumor population from a single tumor biopsy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Autonomous replicons, such as viral episomes and {{oncogene}} containing <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (DMs), lack centromeres {{and consequently}} should be lost rapidly when the nuclear membrane breaks down at mitosis. Surprisingly, they are not. This raises {{the important question}} of the mechanisms that enable their efficient transmission to daughter cells. We review recent developments in GFP-based chromosome labeling strategies that enable real time analyses using high resolution light microscopy to provide insights into this issue. The results reveal that episomes and DMs both adhere to host chromosomes, a process referred to as ‘‘chromosome tethering’’. Such association enables acentric molecules to use the chromosomal centromere in trans, thereby achieving efficient transmission to daughter cells. This unique mechanism of mitotic segregation also raises the possibility of developing {{a new class of}} anti-cancer drugs that work by selectively eliminating growth enhancing genes from cancer cells.

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (DMs) have {{important}} implications for cancer progression because oncogenes frequently amplified on them. We previously detected a functionally undefined gene amplified on DMs, Ribosomal L 22 -like 1 (RPL 22 L 1). The relationship between RPL 22 L 1 and cancer progression is unknown. Here, RPL 22 L 1 was characterized for its role in ovarian cancer (OC) metastasis and its underlying mechanism was examined. DNA copy number and mRNA expression of RPL 22 L 1 in OC cells was analyzed using data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Omnibus database. An immunohistochemical analysis of clinical OC specimens was performed and the relation-ships between expression level and clinicopathological factors were evaluated. Addition-ally, in vivo and in vitro assays were performed to understand the role of RPL 22 L 1 in OC. RPL 22 L 1 expression was higher in OC specimens than in normal tissues, and its expres-sion level was highly positively correlated with invasion and lymph node metastasis (P < 0. 05). RPL 22 L 1 over-expression significantly enhanced intraperitoneal xenograft tumor development in nude mice and promoted invasion and migration in vitro. Additionally...|$|R
40|$|Cytogenetic {{analysis}} of short‐term cultures from 25 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH) revealed clonal chromosome abnormalities in 17 tumors: ten storiform‐pleomorphic and seven myxoid MFH. Telomeric associations, rings, and dicentric chromosomes {{were present in}} 11 tumors and cytogenetic signs of gene amplification (homogeneously staining regions and <b>double</b> <b>minute</b> <b>chromosomes)</b> in four. The breakpoint distribution of the numerous structural rearrangements was nonrandom. The chromosome bands most frequently affected were 19 p 13 (in eight tumors; eight rearrangements gave rise to 19 p+ markers, some of which looked similar, and an r(19) was found in one case), 11 p 11 (in seven tumors; three translocations and four deletions), 1 q 11 (in seven tumors; one translocation and six deletions), and 3 p 12 (in six tumors; all deletions). Other bands involved {{at least four times}} were 1 p 36, 5 p 15, and 20 q 13. Of particular clinical interest was the observation that tumors with 19 p+ seemed to have a pronounced tendency to recur locally (local recurrence in five of eight tumors with 19 p+ compared to one of nine in tumors without this aberration; observation period 4 – 16 months) ...|$|R
