5|$|Acid2 was {{designed}} with Microsoft <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> particularly in mind. The creators of Acid2 were dismayed that <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> {{did not follow}} web standards. It was prone to display web pages differently from other browsers, causing web developers to spend time tweaking their web pages. Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> comply with web standards.|$|E
5|$|Alpha {{transparency}} in PNG-format images: The {{eyes of the}} smiley face use alpha transparency, {{which is part of}} the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification. Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face smoothly and elegantly. This was a significant issue because <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> 6, the most widely used web browser at the time Acid2 was released, did not support alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> 7, bringing <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> in line with other web browsers in this regard.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer.</b> The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E

50|$|More radical is the {{addition}} of a native bookmark system in place of sharing <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> Favorites. These bookmarks may be stored online - as can feeds, autofills, and browser settings. This allows the user to synchronize any number of Avant installations on different computers. Avant can still share <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> Favorites. This option was reintroduced by the developer after some users lamented its loss.|$|R
50|$|Open source {{tools were}} {{typically}} developed to the standards, and made fewer exceptions for the then-dominant <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> {{deviations from the}} standards.|$|R
5|$|Other features/built-in {{applications}} {{included the}} following: enhanced Pocket Outlook with vCard and vCal support, improved Pocket <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> and SMS reply options for Phone Edition.|$|E
5|$|Phishing {{protection}} blocked 90 {{percent of}} verified phishing websites in PC Magazine testing. <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> 7 caught 75 percent, and Firefox caught 60 percent.|$|E
5|$|Windows 95 was {{released}} without {{a web browser}} as Microsoft had not yet developed one. The success of the web caught them by surprise and they subsequently approached Spyglass to license their browser as <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer.</b> Spyglass went on to later dispute {{the terms of the}} agreement, as Microsoft was to pay a royalty for every copy sold. However, Microsoft sold no copies of <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer,</b> choosing instead to bundle it for free with the operating system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{toolbars}} can {{be locked}} {{to prevent them}} from being accidentally moved. This same capability was also added to <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer’s</b> toolbars.|$|R

5|$|Arena, which predated Netscape Navigator and Microsoft's <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer,</b> {{featured}} {{a number of}} innovations used later in commercial products. It was the first browser to support background images, tables, text flow around images, and inline mathematical expressions.|$|E
5|$|Parental {{controls}} {{no longer}} support browsers other than <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> and Edge, {{and the ability}} to control browsing by a whitelist was removed. Also removed were the ability to control local accounts, {{and the ability to}} scan a machine for applications to allow and block.|$|E
5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> with Windows.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Netscape 8, {{the browser}} {{did not use}} <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> Trident layout engine as an {{alternative}} engine option, alongside various other additional features.|$|R

5|$|Windows 10 {{introduces}} a new default web browser, Microsoft Edge. It features a new standards-compliant rendering engine forked from Trident, annotation tools, and offers integration with other Microsoft platforms present within Windows 10. <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> 11 is maintained on Windows 10 for compatibility purposes, but is deprecated {{in favor of}} Edge and {{will no longer be}} actively developed.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 was {{released}} on 13 April 2005. On 31 October 2005, Safari 2.0.2 became the first browser to pass Acid2. Opera, Konqueror, Firefox, and others followed. With the release of <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> 8 on 19 March 2009, the latest versions of all major desktop web browsers now pass the test until IE10 {{was released}}, which fails the test. Its successor, Microsoft Edge, is able to render correctly it as of Windows 10 version 1607. Acid2 was followed by Acid3.|$|E
5|$|Anti-phishing {{integrates}} with <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer.</b> It analyzes sites, {{examining the}} website's URL, title, form, page layout, visible text and links, {{and uses a}} blacklist to detect phishing sites. Users are blocked access from suspected phishing sites, however are presented an option to continue. In PC Magazine testing, the feature blocked 22 of 24 phishing sites, while <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> 7 recognized 17 of the 24 sites. In PC Pro testing, the feature successfully blocked access to every phishing site it was tested against. Spam filtering no longer includes a language feature, Symantec claims it is less useful with current spam and created false positives. Tested against 1,500 messages by PC Magazine, Norton let {{over half of the}} spam to the inbox. Five percent of valid mail were marked as spam. This version utilizes Symantec's Veritas VxMS technology to better identify rootkits. VxMS allows Norton to find inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login. This release drops support for Windows 2000 and was compatible with Windows Vista upon its release with an update.|$|E

5|$|<b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> {{was first}} {{included}} in the Windows 95 Plus! Pack that was released in August 1995. In September, the Chinese government chose Windows to be the operating system of choice in that country, and entered into {{an agreement with the}} company to standardize a Chinese version of the operating system. Microsoft also released the Microsoft Sidewinder 3D Pro joystick in an attempt to further expand its profile in the computer hardware market.|$|E
5|$|Almost a {{year after}} the initial release, Microsoft quietly {{released}} the second version. It entered the technical preview stage on 19 July 2010, and the final build was released on 16 December 2010. It includes Network Inspection System (NIS), a network intrusion detection system that works on Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as a new anti-malware engine that employs heuristics in malware detection. Version 2.0 integrates with <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> to protect users against web-based threats. NIS requires a separate set of definition updates.|$|E
5|$|Most {{versions}} of Windows Mobile have a standard set of features, such as multitasking {{and the ability}} to navigate a file system similar to that of Windows 9x and Windows NT, including support for many of the same file types. Similarly to its desktop counterpart, it comes bundled with a set of applications that perform basic tasks. <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> Mobile is the default web browser, and Windows Media Player is the default media player used for playing digital media. The mobile version of Microsoft Office, is the default office suite.|$|E
25|$|All {{standard}} {{text editing}} controls and all {{versions of the}} 'RichEdit' control now support the Text Services Framework. Also, all Tablet/Ink API applications and all HTML applications which use <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> Trident layout engine support the Text Services Framework.|$|R
50|$|While all {{of these}} {{programs}} can customize <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> user interface and extend the feature set, they cannot modify the rendering engine, and are therefore subject {{to many of the}} same benefits and vulnerabilities of IE, including security holes and issues with rendering.|$|R
5000|$|Expression Web {{can design}} and develop web pages using HTML5, CSS 3, ASP.NET, PHP, JavaScript, XML+XSLT and XHTML. Expression Web 4 {{requires}} [...]NET Framework 4.0 and Silverlight 4.0 {{to install and}} run. Expression Web uses its own standards-based rendering engine which is different from <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> Trident engine.|$|R
5|$|This {{initial release}} had {{multiple}} built-in applications, {{many of them}} similarly branded to match their desktop counterparts; such as Microsoft Reader, Microsoft Money, Pocket <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> and Windows Media Player. A version of Microsoft Office called Pocket Office was also bundled and included Pocket Word, Pocket Excel and Pocket Outlook. Notes, a note-taking app saw its first release and would be supported by most later versions of Windows Mobile. Intelligent character recognition support allowed Notes to distinguish styles of handwriting to be learned by the OS during processing to improve accuracy and recognition levels.|$|E
5|$|Netscape's browser was dominant, {{in terms}} of market share, but it had lost most of its share to <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer</b> during the first browser war. By the end of 2007, the usage share of Netscape's browsers had fallen from over 90% in the 1990s, to less than 1%. Its second-largest {{acquisition}} is the purchase of MapQuest, a web mapping company. From 19992009, MapQuest had the greatest market share among mapping websites; it has since dropped to second place, behind Google Maps. The majority of the companies acquired by AOL are based in the United States. As of April 2008, AOL has acquired 41companies. Most of the acquired companies {{are related to the}} internet, including several internet service providers and web browsers.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2010, Valve {{announced}} that Steam was developing a client for OS X. The announcement {{was preceded by}} {{a change in the}} Steam beta client to support the cross-platform WebKit web browser rendering engine instead of the Trident engine of <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer.</b> Before this announcement, Valve teased the release by e-mailing several images to Mac community and gaming websites; the images featured characters from Valve games with Apple logos and parodies of vintage Macintosh advertisements. Valve developed a full video homage to Apple's 1984 Macintosh commercial to announce the availability of Half-Life 2 and its episodes on the service; some concept images for the video had previously been used to tease the Mac Steam client.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{users have}} criticised the {{phishing}} filter {{for being too}} easy to circumvent. One successful method of bypassing <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> Phishing Filter has been reported by redirecting a blacklisted web page to another, non-blacklisted page, using a server-side redirect. [...] Until the new page is blocked as well, the attack can remain active.|$|R
50|$|Mixi.DJ {{offers a}} media player, {{but also a}} free toolbar and Conduit-based search engine, the toolbar being the add-on {{prompted}} to add during installation. The toolbar is a new hijacker that alters a browser's homepage. It also adds itself to the computer's registry, creates strings in the memory, and changes <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> icon to a magnifying glass.|$|R
5000|$|The W3C {{suggests}} that user agents should allow users to disable it, otherwise META refresh {{should not be}} used by web pages.For <b>Internet</b> <b>Explorer's</b> security settings, under the miscellaneous category, meta refresh can be turned off by the user, thereby disabling its redirect ability.In Mozilla Firefox it can be disabled in the configuration file under the key name [...] "accessibility.blockautorefresh".|$|R
