The principle of the axioms of intuition states that appearances {{in space and time}} are thought of as quantitative, having extensive magnitude. The principle of the anticipations of perception states that an appearance's sensed reality has degree, or <b>intensive</b> <b>magnitude.</b> The principles of the analogies of experience state that perceptual appearances, not things in themselves, are thought of as experienced objects, in accordance with a priori rules of the understanding.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{tracks the}} {{systematic}} dialectical determination of mathematical concepts in Hegel’s Encyclopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften (1830, 1817) and investigates the insights {{that can be}} gained from such a perspective on the mathematical. To begin with, the determination of Numbers and arithmetical operations from Being shows that the One and the successor function have a qualitative base and need not be presupposed. It is also shown that even for infinite <b>Intensive</b> <b>Magnitudes</b> (cardinals) there exists an Extensive Magnitude through which they gain meaning. This makes the ‘bad’ in Hegel’s ‘bad infinity’ a trifle problematic. Finally, if ‘Dasein’ is interpreted as the whole of perception in the present, Place {{can be viewed as}} the spatial Now, Motion as the passage from Place to Now and Matter as the actual (as opposed to observed) Presence of the natural realm...|$|R
40|$|In a comment, {{hitherto}} unremarked upon, Alfred Binet, {{well known}} for constructing the first intelligence scale, claimed that his scale did not measure intelligence, but only enabled classification {{with respect to a}} hierarchy of intellectual qualities. Attempting to understand the reasoning behind this comment leads to an historical excursion, beginning with the ancient mathematician, Euclid and ending with the modern French philosopher, Henri Bergson. As Euclid explained (Heath, 1908), magnitudes constituting a given quantitative attribute are all of the same kind (i. e., homogeneous), but his criterion covered only extensive magnitudes. Duns Scotus (Cross, 1998) included <b>intensive</b> <b>magnitudes</b> by considering differences, which raised the possibility (later considered by Kant (Sutherland, 2004)) of ordered attributes with heterogeneous differences between degrees (heterogeneous orders). Of necessity, such attributes are non-measurable. Subsequently, this became a basis for the quantity objection to psychological measurement, as developed first by Tannery (1875) and then by Bergson (1889). It follows that for attributes investigated in science, there are three structural possibilities: (1) classificatory attributes (with heterogeneous differences between categories); (2) heterogeneous orders (with heterogeneous differences between degrees); and (3) quantitative attributes (with thoroughly homogeneous differences between magnitudes). Measurement is possible only with attributes of kind (3) and, as far as we know, psychological attributes are exclusively of kinds (1) or (2). However, contrary to the known facts, psychometricians, for their own special reasons insist that test scores provide measurements...|$|R
40|$|Application of the Visual Simulation {{technique}} (VS) {{to assist}} in the planning and analysis of construction operations has become increasingly important in the research community in recent years. Benefits of applying VS have been reported in several publications. Nevertheless, the effort required to design and construct an "appropriate " representative display for the system to be analyzed in a VS experiment is frequently time consuming and data <b>intensive.</b> The <b>magnitude</b> of this activity is often increased due to certain characteristics of construction operations, such as their complexity and the distribution of work over large areas. An alternative approach, DISCO, which employs a schematic modeling format reflecting the system dynamics on the computer screen during simulation run is presented in this paper. 1...|$|R

50|$|Taken in its immediacy, a Number is an Extensive Magnitude, that is, a {{collection}} of a certain Amount of self-same Units. These Units, say ten or twenty of them, are the sublated moments of the Extensive Magnitudes ten or twenty. However, the Number ten or twenty, though made up of Many, is also a self-determining One, independent of other Numbers for its determination. Taken in this way, ten or twenty (a) differentiates itself from Extensive Magnitude and becomes an <b>Intensive</b> <b>Magnitude,</b> which is expressed as the tenth or twentieth Degree. Just as the One was completely indifferent to the other Ones of the Many yet depended on them for its existence, each Degree is indifferent to every other Degree, yet they are externally related {{to one another in}} ascending or descending flow through a scale of Degrees.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{blocks of}} quantum spins {{in a chain}} at thermal equilibrium, focusing on their properties from a thermodynamical perspective. Whereas in classical systems the temperature behaves as an <b>intensive</b> <b>magnitude,</b> a deviation from this behavior is expected in quantum systems. In particular, we see that under some conditions {{the description of the}} blocks as thermal states with the same global temperature as the whole chain fails. We analyze this issue by employing the quantum fidelity as a figure of merit, singling out in detail the departure from the classical behavior. The influence in this sense of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions can be clearly observed within this approach. Then we show that the blocks can be considered indeed as thermal states with a high fidelity, provided an effective local temperature is properly identified. Such a result originates from typical properties of reduced sub-systems of energy-constrained Hilbert spaces. Finally, the relation between local and global temperature is analyzed {{as a function of the}} size of the blocks and the system parameters. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I propose to {{consider}} a certain set of notions in Kant as subsumable under a single notion – that of the soul’s intensity – {{as well as the}} possibility of a transcendental grounding of this notion within Kant ’s critical framework. First, I discuss what it means for Kant to attribute <b>intensive</b> <b>magnitude</b> to the soul, starting with his response to Mendelssohn where Kant introduces the soul’s intensity as a metaphysical notion immanent to the principles of rational psychology. I show, however, that in Kant ’s counter-argument there occurs a subtle though crucial shift in perspective – from the soul’s substance to its powers. Then I move on to consider three fundamental variants upon the soul’s intensity – intensities of representation, of life, and of cognition – each governed, I argue, by the implied notions of measure of intensity and its balance. Also, I examine Kant ’s accounts of the life of a species and the necessity of sickness; of intensity of “enlightenment” in a society and the benefit of ignorance; and of sermon as a practical exertion of cognition’s intensity. Next, the aforementioned shift of emphasis allows me to demonstrate that the notion of the soul’s intensity can indeed be transcendentally justified by appealing to Kant ’s principle of the Anticipations of Perception. Finally, I conclude with an appendix on the possible connection of the soul’s intensity to Kant ’s aesthetic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article {{represents}} the seismic slope stability analysis of earth core rock-fill Tipaimukh Dam under static and dynamic loading conditions. The Tipaimukh area {{is located at}} the triple junction of the three continental plates- Indian, Eurasian and Burmese tectonic plate. The area is frequently interrupted by unanticipated geological discontinuities, such as regional and local-scale faults and fractures that behave as a strike-slip and extensional movements. Two kinds of numerical models (A and B) are presented here. Both models consist of five zones and each zone has individual rock mechanical characteristics. Model A assumes safety factor of dam slope associated with impervious core including clay material. Model B assumes also safety factor associated with masonry wall as an impervious core. The present numerical modeling results reveal that under static condition of the dam the safety factor ranges from 2. 56 to 2. 69. On the contrary, under seismic/dynamic loading conditions associated with earthquake M 6. 0 to M 8. 5, the safety factor ranges from 1. 60 to 0. 98 for model A, and from 1. 66 to 0. 98 for model B. The past records of the historical earthquakes in north-eastern India reveal that the recurrence period of <b>intensive</b> <b>magnitude</b> earthquakes, as experienced in Assam, Shillong plateau and Manipur area, is 38 to 53 years. The calculated safety factor of the Tipaimukh Dam implies that the dam would be destroyed if it would be affected by earthquakes magnitude over 7. 0 throughout its operational life, which is usually extent from 50 to 100 years...|$|E
40|$|This is a pre-publication, {{electronic}} {{version of}} {{an article published in}} Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities. This article is from a special issue, 'Creative philosophy theory and praxis', edited by Felicity Colman and Charles J. Stivale. As I faintly smell the sulphur in the air, hear the crunch of my boots upon the salt crystals that have grown upon this art form, and taste the saltiest water ever, actualities are overtaken by the ‘limitless scale of one’s mind’, just as Robert Smithson described. As I traverse the territory of the infamous Spiral Jetty, the gyrations of this Utah time machine shift gear and offer a smorgasbord of sensations. <b>Intensive</b> <b>magnitude.</b> Morpho-sorcery. Alchemical differentiation. This affective place of my choosing turns me into a larval subject of Smithson’s system. This world sings its salt hymn in my ears: a slight wind off the snow covered mountain ranges that encircle the spiral coming across the solid lake, rustling the parched low level scrub, invisibly moving over the basalt rocks that cluster at Rozel Point. Today, the end of winter, it is a deathly silent space, haunted by the incessant affect of the multiple temporal positions that cohabit within this world’s stark geological formations. To arrive at the end point of the jetty, finally, is to realise that one has to indeed, begin at the ‘indeterminate’ yet singular middle to access the complex place of the reality one is immersed in, where the spinning categories of map and material – all possible configurations of east, south, west, north, mud, salt, crystals, rocks, water, as the infamous chant goes – admit uncertainty, ambiguity, chaos - just as the crystal lattice of the steady growth of the salt maintains a coherent site. One enters Smithson’s virtual underground movie house, generative of an endless thought of ‘jeopardy’ – ‘a spiral lightening bolt’. Does the experience of this walk reveal the aesthetic art form to be a chiasmatic synthesis of the fourth dimension – ‘laughter’ as Smithson once described it (after Buckminster Fuller) another name for – ‘entropic verbalization’? Or is this empirically formed cogito of mine merely another empty reminiscence? Here I will argue that Smithson’s spiral is indeed an affective prompt for a moving image of the thought of demented time (Deleuze); a deranged time (Smithson), a Peircean graph of duration that in charting aesthetic movement, becomes a study in the texture of forces.
